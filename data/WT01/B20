<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 25, 1996, Waterville, ME:</b>&nbsp; A
high-ranking federal judge criticized America's current anti-drug
efforts while speaking before students at Colby College, reported <i>The
Associated Press</i>.&nbsp; Calling our drug war strategies a &quot;losing
battle,&quot; Chief Judge Juan Torruella of the First Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals proposed that America seriously rethink its
methods and goals, and suggested that the establishment of a
national pilot program to alleviate marijuana-related
prosecutions might be a first step in the right direction. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At minimum, &quot;a shift has to be made in the funding for drug
enforcement toward an intense educational campaign,&quot; he
said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Torruella, who went on the federal bench in 1975 and joined the
appeals court in 1984, called for a national debate on the drug
issue.&nbsp; In addition, he said that an independent national commission
should be empaneled to analyze alternative approaches to curbing
drug use.&nbsp; Currently, any legitimate debate on the issue is
clouded by political &quot;rhetoric&quot; and anti-drug &quot;hysteria,&quot;
he claimed.&nbsp; Torruella likened this attitude to the zealotry
exhibited by anti-communists during the McCarthy era. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Torruella was also critical of the ways in which he felt drug
prosecutors and law enforcement officials have run rampant over
the bill of rights.&nbsp; &quot;You can't have one Constitution
for the good guys and another Constitution for the bad
guys,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Torruella has served as chief judge of the First Circuit U.S.

<p align="center"><b>Federal Medical Marijuana Bill Attracts
Additional Sponsors</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; Three more
members of Congress, including one Republican and the House's
only Independent, have recently signed on to a federal bill (H.R.
2618) that would permit physicians to prescribe marijuana as a
therapeutic agent for seriously ill patients.&nbsp; With the addition
of the recent signees, U.S. Reps. Bernard Sanders (I-VT), George
Brown (D-Calif.), and Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.), the total number
of co-sponsors now stands at sixteen. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Slowly but surely, more and more members of Congress are
coming forward to show their support for medical marijuana
legislation,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;This is a bill that deserves full bi-partisan
support and prompt federal action.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The inclusion of Bilbray brings the total number of Republican
co-sponsors to three.&nbsp; Republican support of this
legislation is critical if the bill is to move forward in a
Republican controlled Congress. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Currently, H.R. 2618 is simultaneously pending before two
subcommittees: the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on
Crime and the House Commerce Committee, Subcommittee on Health
and Environment.&nbsp; This past March, <b>NORML</b> Executive
Director Keith Stroup, Esq. testified before the Subcommittee on
Crime and encouraged Chairman Bill McCullom (R-Fla.) -- a former
two-time co-sponsor of federal medical marijuana legislation
himself -- to hold additional hearings regarding medical
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">H.R. 2618 was introduced in Congress last fall by Rep. Barney
Frank (D-Mass.) to amend federal law to allow seriously ill
patients to have legal access to marijuana for medicinal
purposes.&nbsp; If passed, the bill would allow doctors to
prescribe marijuana to individuals suffering from &quot;glaucoma,
AIDS wasting syndrome, muscle spasms from certain spastic
disorders including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and
quadriplegia, or the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy
or radiology.&quot;&nbsp; Presently, only eight patients are
allowed to receive marijuana legally from the federal government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The effectiveness of medicinal marijuana has been endorsed by a
number of scientific and medical associations including the <a
href="../../MEDICAL/apha.html">American Public Health Association</a>,
the Australian Commonwealth Department of Human Services and
Health, the National Academy of Sciences, and the <a

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1, 1996, Navajo Nation, AZ:</b>&nbsp;
Plans for a widescale planting of industrial hemp on American
Indian soil have met opposition from federal officials who argue
that any planting or harvesting of hemp would violate federal
law.&nbsp; Presently, Navajo Nation President Albert Hale is awaiting
a legal opinion from the tribe's Justice Department before going
forward with the project.&nbsp; This past March, a ceremonial
planting of industrial hemp seeds by the Coalition for Hemp Awareness
(CHA) took place on Native American soil following the unanimous
passage of a resolution by the Nation to allow for hemp
cultivation to occur on sovereign soil. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Often described as &quot;marijuana's misunderstood cousin,&quot;
industrial hemp is from the same plant species (<i>Cannabis
sativa</i>) that produces marijuana.&nbsp; Unlike marijuana,
however, industrial hemp contains only minute traces of THC, the
psychoactive ingredient that gives marijuana its medicinal and
euphoric properties.&nbsp; Regardless, DEA spokeswoman Dana
Seeley still maintains that federal laws forbidding the
cultivation of marijuana also apply to hemp.&nbsp; &quot;We are
hopeful that they will not [go forward with their plans],&quot;
she said.&nbsp; Seeley noted that the DEA will continue to
monitor the situation closely and may take action if any
large-scale test plots of hemp are planted. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">After decades of unemployment, leaders of the Navajo Nation feel
that hemp cultivation will invigorate the local economy.&nbsp;
The Navajo Nation Hemp Project &quot;is formulated to provide [a] bio-regional
local industry that will create jobs and enhance the agricultural
base,&quot; stated CHA spokeswoman Christie Bohling.&nbsp;
&quot;With the many attributes and by-products of this natural renewable
resource, the Navajo Nation will become self-sufficient in [its]
ability to provide many of its own necessities.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Currently, industrial hemp is grown legally throughout much of
Europe and Asia and can be used to produce a variety of products
such as cosmetics, textiles, paper, paints, plastics, and animal
feed. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
During a recent speech at the National Press Club, new Drug Czar
Barry McCaffrey made several remarks that cast doubt on the
validity of the &quot;gateway theory.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCaffrey stated that out of the 90 million Americans who have
experimented with illegal drugs, only 3 million are current
addicts.&nbsp; In addition, he stated that the &quot;overwhelming

&quot;walk away and sa[y] it's not for me.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;In my mind, the Drug Czar is simply acknowledging what we
at <b>NORML</b> have already known,&quot; said Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Federal statistics tell us time and time
again that the bulk the Americans who experiment with illicit
drugs experiment solely with marijuana and do not progress to
harder drugs or run into drug-related problems later in
life.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>White House Unveils New Drug Strategy</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 29, 1996, Cora Gables, FL:</b>&nbsp;
Amidst a wave of media fanfare, President Clinton and Drug Czar
Barry McCaffrey unveiled a new 10-year anti-drug strategy this
past Monday in Miami.&nbsp; The program asks for a record high
$15.1 billion budget to initiate a &quot;decade-long commitment&quot;
to reduce drug use in America. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although both the President and the Drug Czar emphasized that the
new strategy is chiefly focused on &quot;motivat[ing] America's
youth to reject illegal drugs and substance abuse,&quot; a comprehensive
breakdown of the 1997 budget request illustrates that the plan's
largest component remains domestic law enforcement.&nbsp;
According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP),
the President is requesting $8.3 billion in fiscal year 1997 for
domestic enforcement. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, McCaffrey admitted that the new 1996 Clinton
anti-drug strategy is essentially the same as those of previous
administrations.&nbsp; &quot;Everything in this strategy is
already being done,&quot; he told reporters in Miami.&nbsp;
&quot;I don't think the drug strategy has new tricks in it.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a follow-up conference this past Wednesday in Washington,
D.C., McCaffrey reiterated this point.&nbsp; This strategy
contains &quot;no sudden surprise attacks,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
&quot;[We] recognize that there is no silver bullet.&quot;&nbsp;
McCaffrey added that he sees the new approach as a
&quot;permanent commitment to young people&quot; and was
optimistic that &quot;there is no reason why we can't return
America to a ... pre-Vietnam era level of drug use.&quot;&nbsp;
When asked by the moderator what he felt about the idea of legalization,
McCaffrey called the notion &quot;nonsense.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The federal government's war on drugs has risen from a $1.5
billion yearly battle in 1981 to $15.1 billion battle
today.&nbsp; During that time, America has experienced millions
of casualties and very few gains,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;The Clinton
administration's latest proposals are simply an escalation of the
same policies that resulted in the arrest of nearly one-half
million marijuana smokers in 1994 alone.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on the 1996 National Drug Control
Strategy or the just-released Gallup Poll: A Look at How

Who Used Marijuana As Medicine</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 18, 1996, Toledo, OH:</b>&nbsp; Daniel
Asbury, a quadriplegic who grew marijuana to alleviate reoccurring
pain and muscle spasms, has been given a two-year suspended
sentence by Lucas County Court Judge Ruth Ann Franks.&nbsp;
Asbury, who was found guilty of trafficking in marijuana despite
expert testimony by <b>NORML</b> Board member Dr. John Morgan on
the use of marijuana and pain management, must now refrain from
using cannabis if he wants to stay out of jail. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This court does not condone the use of marijuana,&quot;
Franks said.&nbsp; &quot;This court has sent people to the
penitentiary for using marijuana.&nbsp; ... But I believe this is
a unique case. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The evidence is clear that you were using this drug for
medicinal purposes.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, any further use may land Asbury in jail.&nbsp;
&quot;Essentially, David Asbury's future -- like the futures of
the tens of thousands of patients who use marijuana as a medicine
-- is limited to two options: suffer in pain or risk arrest and
jail,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Asbury suffered a broken neck 15 years ago and began to use
marijuana as a therapeutic agent after prescription drugs proved
ineffective at controlling his pain.&nbsp; &quot;I need it,&quot;
Asbury told the court.&nbsp; &quot;It's the only thing that makes
me feel better.&quot; <br>

Traverse City punishable by a maximum penalty of $100 and up to

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The road to the ballot has been a rocky one for marijuana

rejected by the city commission despite having well over the

December unanimously passed a resolution asking residents not to
sign the petition. <br>

California Ballot</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 23, 1996, Santa Monica, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Proponents of a state-wide initiative to legalize marijuana for
medical use report that they have collected over 750,000
signatures, well over the number necessary to place it on the
November 1996 California ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Supporters were elated by the success of the signature-gathering
drive and noted that a last week blitz of over 140,000 signatures
virtually guaranteed that Californians will have an opportunity
to vote on the issue this year.&nbsp; A final validation of the
estimated 750,000 signatures is expected in five to eight
weeks.&nbsp; The number of signatures required to qualify the
initiative for the 1996 ballot is 433,269. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">California's medical marijuana initiative came about in response
to Governor Pete Wilson's decision to veto legislation passed by
the California Legislature in 1995 that would have allowed for
the controlled compassionate use of marijuana for those diagnosed
by a physician to be suffering from the diseases of AIDS, cancer,
glaucoma, and multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; The 1996 initiative maintains
that any patient who possesses a valid doctor's recommendation
should be allowed to use marijuana as a therapeutic agent without
fear or risk of prosecution.&nbsp; If the initiative is passed by
California voters this fall, the measure will become law
immediately and cannot be vetoed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The issue here is simple; sick people should not be

<p align="center"><b>Vermont Senate Approves Hemp Legislation: <br>
However, State Still A Long Ways Away From Cultivation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 18, 1996, Montpelier, VT:</b>&nbsp; An
amended version of legislation that had been previously approved
by the House to permit the development of a domestic hemp
industry in Vermont was passed by the Senate by a 15-10
vote.&nbsp; The amended measure reportedly &quot;narrows the
focus&quot; of the bill (H.783) and now must be re-approved by
the Rouse before being sent to the governor.&nbsp; Because the
measure failed to receive two-thirds majority support in the
Senate, it is expected be vetoed by Gov. Howard Dean who remains
opposed to any efforts to legalize industrial hemp.&nbsp;
&quot;It is a terrible message to send to children,&quot; wrote
Dean in an April 8 letter to hemp-activist, Colorado Sen. Lloyd
Casey (D- Northglenn). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rep. Fred Maslack (R-Poultney), a chief proponent of the
legislation, told <b>NORML</b> that the House is going to take
its time and &quot;let things develop&quot; before rushing to
approve the amended legislation.&nbsp; Maslack stated that House
backers are considering several options at this time, including
trying to override Dean's expected veto of the bill and/or
tacking the controversial legislation onto an economic
development bill considered sacred to the governor.&nbsp;
&quot;It's not over 'til it's over,&quot; Maslack told the <i>Associated
Press</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kathleen Keenan, chairwoman of the House Commerce Committee, told
the AP that she sees hemp as an &quot;economic development
issue,&quot; but noted that &quot;it has enough merit to stand
alone.&quot;&nbsp; Keenan further added that she was uncertain
how committed Dean was to the economic development bill and
cautioned that he may, in fact, veto it with the hemp provision
included. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Keenan's warning has little affect on the bill's proponents,
however, who consider the latest round of political one-upmanship
a &quot;positive&quot; note.&nbsp; The approval from the Senate
was &quot;one more step in the process,&quot; said Maslack.&nbsp;
&quot;[It's] not the first step [and it's certainly] not the last
step,&quot; but it's definitely a step in the right direction. <br>

Industrial Hemp Prohibition</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 17, 1996, Denver, CO:</b>&nbsp; Appalled
at the recent defeat of a bill that would have allowed Colorado
to become the first state to legally grow industrial hemp since
World War II, Hollywood actor and hemp activist Woody Harrelson
has withheld $10,000 of his taxes to protest the government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I know I'm only a pampered actor with no room to complain,
... but the fact is I care,&quot; Harrelson wrote in a two page
proclamation.&nbsp; Previously Harrelson, who has commercial
interests in a hemp clothing company, had pledged his support for
the Colorado hemp bill by affirming that he &quot;will personally
guarantee that all hemp produced in Colorado will be purchased at
fair market prices.&quot;&nbsp; The legislation was recently
killed by the House Agriculture Committee by a 8-5 vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to a story that ran in <em>USA Today</em>, Harrelson
said that he's been quietly fighting on behalf of industrial hemp
and other environmental causes for years.&nbsp; He even slipped
president Clinton a letter regarding hemp cultivation while they
both attended actor Ted Danson's wedding, the feature noted. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to Harrelson's action and to commemorate his efforts

has shown great courage and integrity in speaking out in the name

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>DEAth In Colorado</b></font><b> <br>
Hemp Cultivation Killed By House Agriculture Committee</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 11,1996, Denver CO:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation (SB 67) that would have allowed Colorado to become
the first state to legally grow industrial hemp since World War
II was killed by the House Agriculture Committee by a stunning
8-5 vote.&nbsp; The vote came as a surprise to many who had watched
support for domestic hemp legislation grow in recent weeks,
including gaining approval from the full Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Many witnesses attribute the outcome to a collective show of
force from law and drug enforcement officials.&nbsp; During the
four hour hearing, twelve law enforcement officials testified against
the bill, including regional DEA representative Greg Williams and
Colorado Bureau of Investigation Director Carl Whiteside.&nbsp;
Among their arguments, law enforcement testified that there is no
difference between industrial hemp and marijuana and that passing
the Hemp Industrial Production Act would send the wrong message
to young people.&nbsp; &quot;In the minds of many, ... [support
for] this will be perceived as a weakening of our anti-marijuana
message in our society,&quot; stated Special Agent Williams. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Fear and intimidation&quot; scared off support for this
bill in the Committee, said the bill's sponsor, Senator Lloyd
Casey (D-Northglenn).&nbsp; Hemp activist Laura Kriho of the
Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP) agrees.&nbsp; The
emotional pressure and scare tactics used by these law enforcement
agencies effectively strong-armed the state legislature, forcing
them to vote for the police and against the farmers of
Colorado.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">One legislator who voted against the measure, Rep. Russell George
(R-Rifle), explained in an interview immediately after the
hearing how the testimony of law enforcement influenced his decision.&nbsp;
&quot;The key factor in making up my vote was when the ... DEA
... testified and said that under no circumstances would [they]
issue any kind of registration or permit,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
&quot;That meant anything else we did with this bill was a waste
of time and was moot because the bill itself said that ...
farmer[s] couldn't go forward without a DEA registration.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The presence of the DEA at the hearing was especially troubling
to both Casey and hemp proponents who noted that, prior to the
April 11 hearing, representatives from the agency had been
cooperative with the bill's backers.&nbsp; In the past, the DEA
in Colorado had &quot;appeared helpful,&quot; noted Kriho.&nbsp;
&quot;We had even been told that ... the DEA in Washington, D.C.
[was] in the process of reviewing policies related to industrial
hemp production.&nbsp; ... [However,] after the DEA testimony at
the hearing, I believe it is safe to say that the DEA is not
working with hemp proponents.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite this setback, activists remain positive that domestic
hemp cultivation in Colorado remains a tangible goal.&nbsp;
&quot;We [still] have a lot of momentum and a lot of
support,&quot; Kriho stated.&nbsp; &quot;We are now in the
process of evaluating our strategies and determining our courses
of action.&nbsp; We have several interesting options and are
excited to be able to pursue them.&quot;&nbsp; Unfortunately,
though, any future efforts to legalize industrial hemp in
Colorado will be without the efforts of either Lloyd Casey or
Reps. Steve Acquafresca (R-Cedaredge) and Bill Jerke (R-
Lasalle), all of whom are stepping down after this year's
session.&nbsp; When asked by <b>NORML</b> if Casey foresees any legislators
in Colorado willing to carry the torch after he leaves, the
Senator's only response was: &quot;I hope so.&quot; <br>

Week <br>
Activists Expect To Have Necessary Number Of Signatures</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 18, 1996, Santa Monica, CA:</b>&nbsp; An
initiative to legalize the medical use of marijuana appears to
have the necessary number of signatures to place it on the
November 1996 California ballot, reports Californians for
Compassionate Use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;When organizers across the state turned in their respective
estimates ... of signatures gathered for the Compassionate Use
Initiative of 1996, the [total] came to over 500,000,&quot;
reported the CCU on April 12, one week before the deadline.&nbsp;
The number needed to qualify the initiative for the 1996 ballot
is 433,269. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Activists note that an additional 120,000 to 140,000 signatures
were anticipated to have been gathered during the drive's final
week.&nbsp; Such a figure would be well over the amount needed to compensate
for any errors or invalid signatures. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">California's medical marijuana initiative came about in response
to Governor Pete Wilson's decision to veto legislation passed by
the California Legislature in 1995 that would have allowed for
the medical use of marijuana.&nbsp; If the initiative is passed
by California voters this fall, the bill will become law
immediately and cannot be vetoed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The 1996 initiative has been endorsed by the cities of San
Francisco, Oakland, and West Hollywood; the Santa Cruz and Marin
Boards of Supervisors; the California Nurses Association; the Los
Angeles AIDS Commission; the California Multiple Sclerosis
Society; the Orange County Register, and many other health and

Oral arguments were heard before the Supreme Court in a case that
may determine whether seizing property from criminally prosecuted
drug dealers constitutes double jeopardy under the United States
Constitution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Civil forfeiture has never been deemed so punitive ... as
to constitute a prosecution or punishment under the
[Constitution's] double jeopardy clause,&quot; contended Justice
Department lawyer Michael Dreeben on behalf of the Clinton
administration.&nbsp; The attorney urged the Court to overturn
two double-jeopardy decisions in which federal appeals courts in
Michigan and California found civil forfeiture following a
criminal prosecution to be unconstitutional. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[This] is, in my mind, the single most important case
involving the government's forfeiture authority in the area of
narcotics, and possibly other areas,&quot; said Attorney Lawrence
Robbins of Washington, D.C., one of two attorneys arguing against
the government's controversial, double-barreled anti-drug
strategy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If this looks like a punishment ... what then is the reason
for not treating it like punishment,&quot; asked Justice William
H. Rehnquist during the procedures. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, no
one may be &quot;subject for the same offense to be twice put in
jeopardy of life or limb.&quot;&nbsp; The Supreme Court has

the same crime. <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Assembly Committee Votes For
Tougher Pot Penalties</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 16, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; The
California Assembly Public Safety Committee slammed the door on
drug reformers by soundly defeating a bill to lessen penalties
for medical marijuana and approving another measure to increase
marijuana prison sentences. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The committee, whose complexion has shifted sharply to the right
with the Republican takeover of the Assembly this year, turned a
deaf ear to the pleas of medical marijuana patients, physicians and
AIDS support groups by rejecting a medical marijuana bill
sponsored by Rep. John Burton (D-San Francisco).&nbsp; The Burton
bill (AB 2120) was a heavily watered-down version of legislation introduced
last year by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos to allow for the
prescribed use of marijuana for the sick and terminally ill. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the bill's concessions, Burton's proposed legislation was
defeated handily by a vote of 7-1, signifying a major reversal in
the committee's attitude regarding medical marijuana.&nbsp; In
the past, the committee had been receptive toward the medical
marijuana issue and had approved legislation allowing for it's
use three years in a row.&nbsp; This year, Burton's measure was
actively opposed by the California Narcotics Officers
Association, the Governor's Department of Health, and Attorney
General Lungren, who argued that the legislation undercut the
established system of drug regulation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Meanwhile, the committee eagerly approved a measure introduced by
Assemblyman Charles Poochigan (R-Fresno) to enhance prison
sentences by three years and up for marijuana convictions
involving a kilogram or more. Two Democrats joined Republicans in
approving the bill, which was strongly backed by the Narcotics
Officers and District Attorney's associations.&nbsp; &quot;The committee
appeared indifferent to the costs of imprisoning more offenders
for non-violent crime,&quot; stated California NORML State
Coordinator Dale Gieringer, who had opposed the measure.&nbsp; &quot;Throughout
the day, it routinely approved all other penalty enhancement
bills with no regard as to whether the offenses were violent,
serious, or victimless. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Drug-law reformers hope to derail AB 2764 in the
Democratic-controlled State Senate, Gieringer noted. <br>

a medical marijuana bill that made it all the way to the

of the bill and no witnesses opposed it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Because the legislation was introduced late in this year's
legislative session, there is little hope of it being approved in
1996.&nbsp; Nevertheless, hemp proponents are encouraged that
this hearing will provide a &quot;running start&quot; for the
introduction of a similar bill in 1997. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">We are &quot;laying the groundwork for next year,&quot; said
Missouri NORML President Dan Viets, Esq., whose office provided
Sen. Howard with background materials regarding the uses of industrial
hemp.&nbsp; Viets added that Howard has been
&quot;encouraged&quot; by the favorable response his bill has
received. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP), one
Missouri farmer has already applied for a DEA permit to grow hemp
and is hopeful that the legislature will at least pass a
resolution supporting industrial hemp research before the
completion of this year's session. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 10, 1996, Montpelier, VT:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation that had been previously approved overwhelmingly by
the House to permit development of a domestic hemp industry in
Vermont has been temporarily derailed by the Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following hearings in the Senate Agriculture Committee, the bill
(H.783) was passed by a 4-2 vote.&nbsp; However, the bill was
passed with an &quot;adverse report&quot; and is now
&quot;ordered to lie&quot; in Senate.&nbsp; According to a
spokesman for the Vermont Legislative Council, bills
&quot;ordered to lie&quot; are in limbo, but may be called back
to the floor for further debate at any time if the bill receives
a majority vote from the full Senate to do so. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Approving legislation with an adverse report is &quot;hardly ever
done,&quot; said Rep. Fred Maslack (R-Poultney), one of the
initial proponents of the hemp cultivation bill.&nbsp; Maslack

opponents, recently testified at informal hearings before the Senate

<p align="center"><b>Tax Stamp Legislation Under Fire In Arizona</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April, 1996, Phoenix, AZ:</b>&nbsp; A 1983 law
allowing individuals to attain licenses from the state to deal in
and pay taxes on cannabis is under fire from state officials who
argue that the legislation is tantamount to legalizing
marijuana.&nbsp; Recently, a bill introduced by Rep. Scott
Bungaard (R-Glendale) calling for the repeal of Arizona's tax
stamp legislation was approved in the Senate Government Reform
Committee by a 6-1 vote.&nbsp; The bill (H2367) now moves to the
full Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Committee Chairman Stan Barnes, 55 people signed up
to testify in opposition to Bungaard's amendment, including
Arizona NORML President Peter Wilson.&nbsp; Wilson ignited the stamp
tax controversy this past November when Northwest Phoenix Justice
Court Judge John Barclay dismissed marijuana possession charges
against him because of evidence that he is licensed by the state
to sell cannabis.&nbsp; Basing his decision on constitutional
prohibitions against double jeopardy, Judge Barclay concluded
that Wilson could not be prosecuted because of (punitive) taxes
he had previously paid to the Arizona department of revenue to
sell and possess cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I think by possessing a license and paying the tax, you
show an attitude that is different than a criminal
attitude,&quot; said Wilson's attorney and <b>NORML</b> Legal
Committee member, Michael Walz, speaking in favor of maintaining
the current legislation.&nbsp; &quot;What you have is a county
attorney saying on the record he is 100 percent confident [Mr.
Wilson's case] will be reversed on appeal.&nbsp; If that is really
true, then there is no reason for this legislation.&nbsp; And in
fact, what it does is deprive the state of Arizona of
potentially, millions of dollars in revenue.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The license and tax requirements were never intended to
decriminalize the sale of marijuana,&quot; countered Rep.
Bungaard.&nbsp; &quot;I want to send a clear message that drug
use of any kind in this state is illegal and unacceptable.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the recent momentum to repeal the tax stamp legislation,
AZ4NORML member Bill Green doubts Bungaard's measure will pass
this year.&nbsp; &quot;If by some chance it gets passed without
us noticing, we plan to file a referendum with the Secretary of
State.&nbsp; We will bill it as a protest vote for legal
marijuana. <br>

to an <em>Associated Press</em> report. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">High school substitute Michael Maynard, 42, argues that the

drug misdemeanors -- but not murder -- is arbitrary and does not
give teachers a chance to defend themselves.&nbsp; Maynard
pleaded no contest in 1974 when a traffic stop revealed a small

Controversial proposals made by a state health-planning group to
decriminalize small amounts of marijuana and create

<p align="center"><b>Colorado Senate Gives Green Light To
Domestic Hemp Cultivation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 30, 1996, Denver CO:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation (SB 67) that would allow Colorado to become the first
state to legalize the growing of industrial hemp was approved by
the full Senate by a 18-15 vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The move surprised many who felt that the controversial
legislation would likely fall three or five votes shy of a
majority.&nbsp; &quot;I feel like I've been through a wringer,
but I'm very happy,&quot; said the bill's sponsor, Sen. Lloyd
Casey (D-Northglenn), in an interview with the <i>Rocky Mountain
News</i>.&nbsp; A similar bill was introduced by Casey in 1995,
but only received one vote of support in its first committee. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Colorado Industrial Hemp Production Act permits the planting
of no more than 40 acres of industrial hemp (defined by the bill
as marijuana containing no more than 0.5% THC) in Colorado in
1996 for agricultural, commercial, and scientific research.&nbsp;
The legislation allows for full scale hemp production to begin in
1998 and has been endorsed by the Colorado Farm Bureau, the Colorado
State Grange, and the National Federation of Farm Bureaus.&nbsp;
The bill has also received support from Hollywood actor and hemp
businessman Woody Harrelson. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill now moves to the more conservative House where Reps.
Steve Acquafresca (R-Cedaredge) and Bill Jerke (R-Lasalle) have
agreed to help carry the legislation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Often described as &quot;marijuana's misunderstood cousin,&quot;
industrial hemp is from the same species that produces
marijuana.&nbsp; Unlike marijuana, however, industrial hemp has
only minute amounts of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the
psychoactive ingredient that gives marijuana its medical and
euphoric properties.&nbsp; Industrial hemp is currently grown
legally through much of Europe, Asia, and parts of Canada to
produce a variety of products such as textiles, paper, composites,
paints, cosmetics, and animal feed. <br>

<p align="center"><b>District Attorney To Take No Further Action
In Medical Marijuana Distribution Case</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 3, 1996, New York, NY:</b>&nbsp; The
Manhattan District Attorney has agreed to take no further action
in its prosecution of Johann Moore for distributing marijuana for
medical purposes and to dismiss all charges against him in six
months. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Judge William Mogulescu explained in open court that this
decision by the District Attorney's office constituted an extreme
deviation from their internal policies which require that all
defendants must plead to the indictment in all cases of marijuana
sales.&nbsp; Judge Mogulescu further added that he believed the
District Attorney's action to be tantamount to an acknowledgment
by that office of the legitimacy of medicinal marijuana and of
the validity of Moore's claim that his distribution of marijuana
as medicine constituted a justification for his actions. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Immediately after the court proceeding where Moore consented to
the six month deferred prosecution, he informed reporters that he
intends to continue to provide marijuana to those with a legitimate
medical need. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moore's attorney and President of the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), Robert Fogelnest said, &quot;I
applaud the District Attorney's office for their ultimately making
an intelligent and humane judgment in the disposition of this
case.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I hope that this will pave the way for a more enlightened
policy regarding the distribution of marijuana for medical
use,&quot; added Moore's other attorney, Ruth Liebesman.&nbsp;
Both Liebesman and Fogelnest are members of the <b>NORML</b>
Legal Committee. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moore is a longtime New York City drug reform activist and is the
founder of the city's underground cannabis buyer's club -- one of
an estimated 30 clubs that currently operate and distribute
medical marijuana to seriously ill patients who possess a
doctor's recommendation.&nbsp; He was arrested last August for
distributing marijuana and was charged with criminal sales in the
fourth degree. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The statement made by the District Attorney in this case is
a strong one,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;It appears that they -- like the D.A.'s
offices in San Francisco, Oakland, and Santa Cruz have done
previously -- wish to make the prosecution of buyer's clubs and
those involved in the distribution of marijuana for medicinal use
the state's lowest priority.&quot; <br>

The number of marijuana offenders in California state prisons has
increased to its highest level in history, according to the
latest statistics from the Department of Corrections.&nbsp; As of
December 31, 1995, 1,572 prisoners were serving time for marijuana
felonies, up 18 percent from one year previously. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The new figures appear to belie recent claims that the war on
marijuana in California has let up.&nbsp; California now has two
and a half times more marijuana prisoners than in the early
l970s, before possession was decriminalized from a felony to a
misdemeanor, and 15 times as many marijuana prisoners as at the
record low in 1980.&nbsp; An unknown number of additional
prisoners are serving time in county jails.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
recent surveys indicate that marijuana usage is rising --
especially among adolescents -- suggesting strongly that harsh
penalties are not an effective deterrent in marijuana
consumption. <br>

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I think it's ingenious,&quot; said U.S. Attorney Lynne A.

converted into plain tickets and given to law enforcement
agencies. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A federal judge will decide whether the miles should be
considered as assets and confiscated under forfeiture laws.&nbsp;
Recently, the Supreme Court upheld a Michigan ruling that allows prosecutors
to seize property used in a crime even when the owner was not a

<CENTER><B>Federal Medical Marijuana Attracts Bi-Partisan Support First Two

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March 29, 1996, Washington, DC:</B>&nbsp;  Four additional members of Congress, including one member of the House Judiciary Committee, 
Subcommittee on Crime, and two Republicans, have recently signed on to a federal bill (H.R. 2618) that would permit physicians to prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic agent for seriously ill patients.&nbsp;  The recent signees, U.S Reps. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.), Steven Gunderson (R-Wis.), Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), and Tom Campbell (R-Calif.) bring the total number of co-sponsors to thirteen.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The support of the recent co-sponsors is critical for a variety of reasons.&nbsp;  The addition of Reps. Gunderson and Campbell gives the bill its first taste of bi-partisan support and could potentially persuade several other Republicans -- including House Speaker and former co-sponsor of medical marijuana legislation Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) -- to sign on to H.R. 2618.&nbsp;  In addition, the support of Republicans is necessary if the bill is to move forward in a Republican controlled Congress.  
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rep. Lofgren's support is also crucial.&nbsp;  Currently, H.R. 2618 is pending before the Subcommittee on Crime.&nbsp;  As a member of this committee, Lofgren can encourage Chairman and former two-time co-sponsor of medical marijuana legislation, Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), to hold additional hearings on medical marijuana and possibly bring the bill to a vote.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">H.R. 2618 was introduced in Congress last fall by Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) to amend federal law to allow seriously ill patients to have legal access to marijuana for medicinal purposes.&nbsp;  If passed, the bill would allow doctors to prescribe marijuana to individuals suffering from "glaucoma, AIDS wasting syndrome, muscle spasms from certain spastic disorders, including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia, or the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy or radiology."&nbsp;  Currently, only eight patients are allowed to receive medical marijuana 
legally from the federal government.

State Budget</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March, 1996, Olympia, WA:</B>&nbsp;  Washington State University and the state Department of Health will start looking for ways to make medicinal marijuana available to the seriously ill, under strict controls, though two appropriations provided in this year's operating budget.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The funding for the study came through the efforts of state Senators Jeanne Kohl (D-Seattle) and Bob McCaslin (R-Spokane).&nbsp;  The two senators co-sponsored a bill (SB-6744) that was used as a model for the appropriations provided in this year's budget.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The funds will be used by Washington State University, in conjunction with the state Board of Pharmacy, and the state Department of Health to conduct research on cultivating marijuana in a tamper-free environment.&nbsp;  The study will also determine the appropriate organization to manufacture and distribute the drug for medical use. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The second appropriation will be used to fund a clinical study administered by the state Department of Health under the controlled substance abuse therapeutic program, in statute since 1979.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The study will be limited to patients under a physician's care.&nbsp;  Only patients receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation treatments, or suffering from glaucoma, AIDS or HIV related illnesses, multiple sclerosis, or other life threatening illnesses would qualify for the study.  
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Results of a statewide public-opinion poll directed by local political consultant Sharon Gilpin the weekend of March 2nd-3rd indicated that the public supports the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.&nbsp;  The statewide survey of 400 voters found that 75 percent favored making marijuana available for patients if prescribed by a doctor.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gilpin said the results were a complete surprise.&nbsp;  "I know the people in the Northwest tend to be compassionate, but the high number was totally unexpected," she said.&nbsp;  Gilpin said people who are concerned about the rising cost of health care are willing to look at alternatives to the high cost of fighting diseases such as AIDS and cancer.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"This is a great start that will lead to what we hope is a promising finish," said Dr. David Edwards, an Olympia physician and medical coordinator for the Washington Hemp Education Network (WHEN), an agency working on informing the public of the potential benefits of medicinal marijuana.&nbsp;  "I expect the results to have a positive effect in our effort to provide organic marijuana to patients under strict medical guidelines."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Medical marijuana activist and founder of the Green Cross Cannabis Buyers Club, Joanna McKee, said she is confident the study will confirm what other tests have shown: the positive effects of medicinal marijuana.&nbsp;  "The medical community is so focused on using chemicals to combat illness, they ignore a simple, organic solution that's readily available," she said.&nbsp;  "This test will provide the answer to those who still question 
the effectiveness of THC."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Sen. McCaslin said if the results of the state study on THC is similar to others conducted, organic marijuana could be a boon for the seriously ill.&nbsp;  "It will not only aid them in their physical recovery, it could prove to be a psychological boost as well," he said.  
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kohl said the study is the first step towards getting needed medicine to those who desperately need it.&nbsp;  "If the synthetic drug is not working for a patient, it only makes sense they should be able to have access to organic marijuana."  
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Activists should be advised that the medicinal marijuana appropriations could potentially fall victim to a section-item veto by the governor.   However, Sen. Kohl's office tells <B>NORML</B> that she has been assured by the governor's staff that he will not take such action.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information or for the latest status on the Washington state medical marijuana appropriations, please contact Sen. Jeanne Kohl's office @ (206) 285-1869 or the office of Sen. Bob McCaslin @ (360) 786-7606.</I>

<CENTER><B>Domestic Hemp Cultivation Bill Heads To Colorado Senate</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March 22, 1996, Denver, CO:</B>&nbsp;  Legislation (SB 67) introduced by Sen. Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn) to allow Colorado to become 
the first state to grow industrial hemp in almost 40 years is heading for the Senate floor.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a move that stunned both proponents and opponents alike, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted 5-4 to send the bill to the full Senate for debate.&nbsp;  A similar bill was introduced by Casey in 1995, but only received one vote of support in its first committee.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"We're talking about not just growing, but about the textile mills, the paper mills, [and] the food-processing products.&nbsp;  We're talking about all the value-added things that can result from this," explained Casey.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Colorado Industrial Hemp Production Act permits the planting of no more than 40 acres of industrial hemp (defined by the bill as marijuana containing no more than 0.5% THC) in Colorado in 1996 for agricultural, commercial, and scientific research.&nbsp;  The legislation allows for full scale hemp production to begin in 1998 and has been endorsed by the Colorado Farm Bureau, the Colorado State Grange, and the National Federation of 
Farm Bureaus.&nbsp;  The bill has also received support from Hollywood 
actor and hemp businessman Woody Harrelson.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Working diligently over the past year to gather support for this bill is the Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP), a grassroots organization of activists who have donated their time to volunteer on this campaign.&nbsp;  CO-HIP notes that the bill currently has support in the Senate, but is probably three to five votes shy of a majority.&nbsp;  Nevertheless, the group remains confident that the bill will pass the Senate and is actively 
pursuing the help of farm organizations and professional lobbyists to drum up support among legislators.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Colorado's legislative session ends on May 8, 1996.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information on this bill, please contact the office 
of Senator Lloyd Casey @ (303) 866-4865 or CO-HIP @ (303) 784-5632.&nbsp;  For more information on the value of industrial hemp, please contact either Allen St. Pierre or Paul Armentano of <B>NORML</B> @ (202) 483-5500.</I>

<CENTER><B>Washington State Medical Marijuana User Found Guilty Of Drug 
Possession And Manufacture Charges</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March, 1996, Tacoma, WA:</B>&nbsp;  A Pierce County resident who used marijuana to alleviate pain and seizures stemming from head injuries he suffered in a 1988 motorcycle accident was found guilty of charges that he possessed and manufactured marijuana.&nbsp;  His sentencing is set for April 10.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Jess Williams, aka Fat Freddy, claims that he grew marijuana to combat the symptoms of his injury after discovering that cannabis worked more effectively than any conventional prescription drugs.&nbsp;  Law enforcement agents who raided Williams home maintained that Williams possessed more plants than necessary for personal use.&nbsp;  Williams attorney, <B>NORML</B> Legal Committee member Jeffrey Steinborn, asserts that he will appeal the decision.&nbsp;  "This case is a long way from over," he says.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">William's case had risen to the forefront of the battle for medical access to marijuana in Washington State.&nbsp;  While Steinborn admits that an acquittal would not have invalidated the law, he maintains that a "not guilty" verdict might have made prosecutors wary of bringing similar cases to trial.&nbsp;  Previously, medical marijuana user Ralph Seeley won a declaratory judgment from Pierce County Superior Court Judge Rosanne Buckner affirming that a cancer patient's need to use marijuana as a medicine overrides the state's interest in outlawing its prescription.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Some activists who attended William's trial noted that they felt the jury might have ruled differently had the defendant suffered from cancer or glaucoma.&nbsp;  Williams was the "Freedom Fighter" of the month for the May issue of High Times magazine.

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March 17, 1996, Navajo Nation, Arizona:</B>&nbsp;  A scheduled 
planting of industrial hemp seeds by the Coalition for Hemp Awareness (CHA) took place on test plots of American Indian soil.&nbsp;  The initial planting came about following a resolution passed unanimously by the Navajo Nation to allow for hemp cultivation to occur on sovereign soil.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following meetings with both the Vice President and the Director of Agriculture of the Navajo Nation, CHA spokesman Christie Bohling told <B>NORML</B> that support for the hemp cultivation project is "overwhelming beyond our wildest dreams."&nbsp;  Bohling notes that adverse weather and a lack of seeds limited CHA's spring planting to a small "ceremonial celebration," but adds that a widescale planting is scheduled for the end of April.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Navajo Hemp Project began in 1992 when activists Jim Robinson and Tom and Carolyn McCormick moved to the reservation for the purpose of introducing hemp cultivation on sovereign soil.&nbsp;  Currently, well over 30,000 acres of Navajo nation land has been allocated for hemp cultivation.&nbsp;  In addition, CHA states that the organization is close to securing approval for similar cultivation projects from ten other tribes located across the United States.&nbsp;  This will enable CHA the opportunity to grow hemp in a variety of "different [climates and] environments," Bohling explains.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Coalition for Hemp Awareness was founded in 1991 to incite the rapid return of cannabis hemp as an agricultural crop.&nbsp;  CHA is a political advocacy network group that assimilates and disseminates hemp information to both politicians and the public.

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March 19, 1996, Crewe, VA:</B>&nbsp;  A dazzling array of tough new anti-drug proposals failed to pass the Virginia General Assembly 
this week.&nbsp;  The measures were opposed by a drug-law reform coalition that included members of DC NORML, Virginians Against Drug Violence, and Virginia's Cannabis Action Network.&nbsp;  The measures would have increased marijuana penalties, permitted drug testing of high-school students, and given courts the broad authority to continue cases despite improper procedures or incomplete lab results.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"This year we had a real show of force," said activist Lennice Werth of Virginians Against Drug Violence.&nbsp;  "[We had] lots of anti-prohibitionists showing up at the state house to voice their dissatisfaction with this kind of legislation."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Among bills defeated outright were measures to include marijuana seeds and stems as evidence to increase marijuana penalties (SB34, SB58, HB96, HB169); allow courts to continue cases that have been dismissed due to improper procedures (HB646, SB53); add a $1,000 additional fine for possession or distribution charges to go to local authorities (HB1002), and 
permit the drug testing of high school students (HB949, HB950, HB579).
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A measure that was not killed, but amended, was legislation that would have greatly expanded the use of military for drug law enforcement, particularly for searching private property.&nbsp;  Werth notes that the amended bill limits use of the military to aerial surveillance only and called the revision "a substantial victory" for the drug reform movement.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Some measures that passed the General Assembly despite the efforts of drug-law reformers include legislation to legalize double jeopardy (SB435, SJR73) and deny bail to drug offenders (HB504).&nbsp;  Altogether, reformers monitored a total of 48 bills.

muscle spasms, was found guilty of trafficking in marijuana over three times the bulk amount and could face a sentence of up to five years in prison.&nbsp;  Asbury's sentencing will occur on April 18.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The guilty verdict was a setback for marijuana reform advocates who had hoped to set a legal precedent in Ohio for the medical use of marijuana.&nbsp;  John Hartman, President of Northcoast NORML, notes that the organization flew in <B>NORML</B> Board member and CUNY Medical School Professor Dr. John Morgan to testify as an expert witness on the use of marijuana and pain management.&nbsp;  "For whatever reason, the jury [who found Asbury innocent on charges of cultivation] didn't find Daniel's medical necessity case strong enough to nullify [the trafficking charge,]" Hartman notes.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hartman adds that Asbury's defense was made more difficult because Ohio currently provides no medical marijuana defense in its body of established state law.&nbsp;  Therefore, Asbury's defense was basically asking the jury to "find the compassion to rule over the law," Hartman said.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Asbury suffered a broken neck 15 years ago and began to use marijuana as a therapeutic after prescription drugs proved ineffective at controlling his pain.&nbsp;  Marijuana made me "fe[el] like a human being again," he said.

Marijuana</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March 12, Oakland, CA:</B>&nbsp;  The Oakland City Council has 
unanimously passed a resolution (#72516) endorsing Rep. Barney Frank's (D-Mass.) federal medical marijuana legislation, supporting the activities of the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Club, and declaring the arrest of individuals involved with the medical use of marijuana to be a low priority for the city of Oakland.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The main points of the resolution are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Marijuana has been shown to help pain and discomfort in people suffering from a variety of illnesses including AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and chronic pain when no other medications have been effective.
<LI>The illegal purchase of marijuana by people already suffering with chronic illnesses subjects them to further suffering in the form of potential arrest and prosecution.
<LI>The Oakland Cannabis Buyer's Club provides a way for patients needing to purchase marijuana for medical use to do so with greater ease and less risk of arrest and prosecution.
<LI>The City of Oakland wishes to declare its desire not to expend City resources in any investigation, detention, arrest, or prosecution arising out of alleged violations of state and federal law regarding the possession, cultivation, and/or distribution of marijuana for medical use.
<LI>The Oakland City Council authorizes the City Manager to instruct the City's federal lobbyist to work in support of H.R. 2618 -- a bill in Congress that would amend the federal law to allow a physician to legally prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic agent to seriously ill patients.

<CENTER><B>Twice As Many Defendants Imprisoned For Marijuana Possession 
Under Tough "Three Strikes" Law Than For Violent Crimes, Study Indicates</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March 6, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</B>&nbsp;  More than twice as many defendants have been sentenced to stiff prison sentences under 
California's "three strikes and you're out" law than have murderers, rapists, and kidnappers combined, according to a recent study by the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Overall, the report concluded that 85 percent of those sentenced under the law had been convicted most recently of a non-violent offense.&nbsp;  Of those 85 percent, 192 individuals were sentenced under the law after being convicted of marijuana possession while in custody (a felony offense in California) as compared to only 40 who were convicted of murder, 25 of rape, and 24 of kidnapping.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">To be prosecuted under the stringent California law, a defendant must have been convicted of at least one or more serious violent crimes in the past.&nbsp;  However, the most recent offense need not be a violent crime -- only a felony.&nbsp;  The law mandates double the normal sentence for anyone convicted of a second felony and life sentence for any individual convicted of a third felony.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"People are going to jail in America for possessing marijuana," stated <B>NORML</B>'s Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;  "As this report clearly illustrates, the sentences can potentially be for life.&nbsp;  This sort of illogical and fiscally irresponsible mandatory sentencing must end."

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March, 1996, Sunny View, NC:</B>&nbsp;  A medical marijuana activist who had received extensive media coverage for her vocal support 
of the medicinal use of marijuana was recently arrested by law enforcement officials and charged with various drug charges including possession with intent to manufacture a controlled substance.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Jean Marlowe, president of the Marijuana Relegalization Movement, told local newscasters in a television interview that she smoked marijuana at least three times a day to obtain therapeutic relief from three orthopedic conditions she suffers from: degenerative disc disease, reflect sympathetic dystrophy, and osteoarthritis.&nbsp;  Days later, local law enforcement officials raided the Marlowe residence and found approximately 50 marijuana 
seedlings.&nbsp;  Marlowe maintains that the seized seedlings were being grown for her own medical use and intends to sue both the state and federal government for legal medical access to marijuana.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"No one sick or suffering should have to endure the added stress of living in fear of being searched, jailed, or prosecuted," Marlowe said.&nbsp;  "I want this medicine available for every American citizen that needs it!&nbsp;  Nobody should have to perform a criminal act to obtain a safe, natural medicine."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">To support her argument, Marlowe notes that she has letters from two separate physicians confirming her use of medical marijuana.&nbsp;  In addition, Marlowe has an official notice from the Social Security Administration stating that "she ... relies on marijuana to relieve her symptoms and smokes three grams per day."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"I will get medical access or an exemption to grow my own [cannabis] before I'm though," Marlowe affirmed.&nbsp;  "How dare our legislators sit up there in Washington and bicker among themselves and treat the very citizens who put them [there] so very heartlessly.

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March 1996, Olympia, WA:</B>&nbsp;  A final version of the 1996 
Washington Hemp Initiative has been approved by the Washington state Attorney General.&nbsp;  If successful, the initiative, now known officially as Initiative 663, would require the state to replace existing policies prohibiting cannabis with a system of regulation and taxation similar to that of alcohol.&nbsp;  The initiative has until July 8th to gather the 189,000 signatures from registered Washington voters necessary to place the bill on the upcoming ballot.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The 1996 Hemp Initiative is a comprehensive initiative dealing with industrial, medicinal, and recreational hemp.&nbsp;  Industrial hemp is defined by the initiative as having less than .5 percent THC and is to be regulated as a non-intoxicating agricultural commodity.&nbsp;  Medicinal cannabis is allowed to be distributed by prescription from drug stores and pharmacies.&nbsp;  Regulations regarding the use of recreational and/or intoxicating hemp (read: marijuana) are modeled after the laws regulating 
alcohol and permits adults over 21 to consume cannabis as long as they do so responsibly.&nbsp;  In addition, minors will not be allowed where marijuana is grown, sold, or consumed.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Tom Rohan, state coordinator for the initiative drive, notes that petition organizers have over 3,000 volunteers to help gather signatures.

<CENTER><B>Bill To Eliminate Arizona Tax Stamp Legislation Pulled For Time 
Being</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March 12, 1996, Phoenix, AZ:</B>&nbsp;  An amendment that would delete Arizona's cannabis tax and licensing program was pulled by the 
bill's sponsor, Rep. Scott Bungaard (R-Glendale).&nbsp;  Bungaard plans 
to reintroduce the amendment next week.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bungaard's move to repeal Arizona's tax stamp legislation stems from a November 1995 ruling by Northwest Phoenix Court Justice Judge John Barclay that dismissed charges against Arizona NORML Chairman Peter Wilson because of evidence that he was licensed by the state to sell marijuana.&nbsp;  Basing his decision on constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy, Judge Barclay concluded that Wilson could not be prosecuted for possession of marijuana because of taxes he had already paid the Arizona Department of Revenue to sell cannabis.&nbsp;  The state is currently appealing the decision.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"Having this law gives the appearance that we have decriminalized [marijuana] use in this state," Rep. Bungaard said.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"If the legislature allows Rep. Bungaard to submit a new bill, it will open this issue up to public debate within both the House and Senate," said Bill Green of Arizona <B>NORML</B>.&nbsp;  "Our goal is to be well organized so that we [can] actively [lobby the legislature] at that time."

<CENTER><B>NORML Testifies Before Congress</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>Executive Director Keith Stroup Tells Subcommittee That "Far More 
Harm Is Caused By Marijuana Prohibition Than By Marijuana Itself"</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March 6,1996, Washington, DC:</B>&nbsp;  In a step forward for the 
marijuana reform movement, Congress invited <B>NORML</B> Executive Director Keith Stroup and two other reform advocates to testify on the subject of marijuana policy.&nbsp;  Wednesday's congressional hearing marked the first time that Congress has made such overtures in more than six years.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Testifying before the House Judiciary Committee: Congressional Subcommittee on Crime, Stroup urged the committee to put an end to federal policies that continue to arrest hundreds of thousands of adult marijuana users every year while, at the same time, maintaining <B>NORML</B>'s opposition to adolescent drug use.&nbsp;  "Marijuana smokers in this country are no different from their non-smoking peers, except for their marijuana use.&nbsp;  Like most Americans, they are responsible citizens who work hard, raise families, contribute to their communities, and want a safe, 
crime-free neighborhood in which to live," he stated.&nbsp;  "It's time 
we ended marijuana prohibition and stopped arresting and jailing hundreds of thousands of average Americans whose only 'crime' is that they smoke marijuana.&nbsp;  This is a tragic and senseless war against our own citizens; it must be ended.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Stroup also spoke in favor of amending federal law to allow patients access to medical marijuana with a doctor's prescription and urged the members of the crime subcommittee to promptly approve HR 2618 -- a federal bill currently before the subcommittee that would permit the medical use of cannabis.&nbsp;  "Whatever you may feel about the war on drugs," Stroup 
summarized, "denying medical marijuana to seriously ill people should not be a part of it."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Also appearing before the subcommittee to attest to marijuana's medical utility was Richard Brookhiser, Senior Editor for the National Review.&nbsp;  In impassioned testimony, Brookhiser told of his own use of marijuana, with the full knowledge of his physicians, as a way to alleviate the violent nausea he suffered as the result of cancer chemotherapy treatments.&nbsp;  "Because of ... marijuana, my last two courses of chemotherapy were almost 
nausea-free," Brookhiser recounted.&nbsp;  "There was only one problem -- I had to become a criminal to do this."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Representing the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) was Attorney Jeralyn E. Merritt of Denver, Colorado.&nbsp;  Merritt testified in favor of changes recently enacted by the U.S. Sentencing Commission and approved by Congress adopting a universal plant/weight ratio of 100 grams be used in marijuana sentencing.&nbsp;  Merritt argued that efforts by some members of Congress to re-enact a 1000 gram per plant ratio for marijuana plants were not justified.&nbsp;  "For Congress to step in 
now," she testified, "in the absence of new and compelling evidence that the [current law] is scientifically unsound or otherwise irrational, flies in the face of the authority granted to the [U.S.] Sentencing Commission."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Appearing before the committee on an opposing panel were Stephanie Haynes, President of Drug Watch International, Dr. Eric A. Voth of the International Drug Strategy Institute, D.A.R.E. officer Donald Hayes of the Alexandria Virginia Police Department, and Tom Hedrick, Vice Chairman of the Partnership for a Drug Free America.&nbsp;  All four speakers testified in favor of continuing to maintain strict penalties for the use of marijuana 
and encouraged Congress to strengthen their anti-drug efforts.&nbsp;  In addition, both Ms. Haynes and Dr. Voth voiced their disapproval over the efficacy of medical marijuana and the introduction of HR 2618.&nbsp;  Ignoring the fact that thousands of seriously ill patients risk arrest daily to acquire marijuana as a therapeutic agent for a variety of serious illnesses including glaucoma, cancer, and the wasting syndrome associated with AIDS, Voth testified that only "the pro-marijuana forces [continue to] 
drive the medical marijuana issue."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although <B>NORML</B> was encouraged by the opportunity to testify 
before the congressional subcommittee, the organization expressed concern that Subcommittee Chairman, Bill McCollum -- a former two-time co-sponsor of medical marijuana legislation himself -- refused to hear testimony from Harvard Medical School Professor and international authority on medical marijuana, Dr. Lester Grinspoon, M.D.&nbsp;  "Because of the importance [<B>NORML</B>] place[s] on the need for medical marijuana, we had asked if we might have ... [Dr.] Lester Grinspoon ... present our testimony here today, but [we] were told by the committee that would not be possible," 
Stroup explained.&nbsp;  "[However,] Dr. Grinspoon remains available should this committee elect to hear from him at some point."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"The fact that the subcommittee allowed a medical doctor testify to the purported dangers of marijuana, but denied <B>NORML</B> the opportunity to present expert medical testimony on the therapeutic effectiveness of cannabis is truly unfortunate, said <B>NORML</B>'s Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;  "Since the Subcommittee on Crime may be voting on proposed medical marijuana legislation in the near future, one can only hope that they will hold additional hearings at which time expert medical testimony 
on both sides of the issue will be accepted."

<CENTER><B>New Drug Czar Sworn In; Clinton Proposes Massive Expansion Of 
White House Anti-Drug Efforts</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March 6, 1996, Washington, DC:</B>&nbsp;  In a move that signifies a 180 degree departure from the President's previous decisions to downsize the Office of National Drug Control Policy, President Clinton recently asked Congress for $3.4 million in supplemental spending to expand the staff of the ONDCP from 25 to 150 individuals.&nbsp;  This money would be in addition to the extra $250 million dollars already appropriated by the White House to beef up anti-drug efforts.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"The general wants some troops to command," explained one White House official to the Washington Post on Clinton's sudden move to increase the ONDCP staff, "and Clinton wanted the general."&nbsp;  Newly appointed drug czar, retired General Barry R. McCaffrey was sworn in to office yesterday.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition to his title as drug czar, McCaffrey was granted a slot on the National Security Council.&nbsp;  The former general was also given approval from the White House to carry over 30 former Pentagon staffers to his new operation.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"According to the most recent FBI statistics, the federal government's war on drugs is primarily a war against marijuana users," explained <B>NORML</B>'s Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;  "Clinton's latest effort to drastically increase the 'war' effort is yet another step in the wrong direction and a wasteful expenditure of valuable taxpayers dollars."

<CENTER><B>NORML Issues Principles Of Responsible Cannabis Use</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 29, 1995, Washington D.C.:</B>&nbsp;  The National 
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, the nation's oldest and largest interest group dedicated solely to marijuana law reform, has adopted a set of Principles of Responsible Cannabis Use.&nbsp;  <B>NORML</B> maintains that when marijuana is enjoyed responsibly, subjecting users to harsh criminal and civil penalties provides no public health benefit and causes terrible injustices.&nbsp;  For reasons of public safety, public health, economics, and justice, the prohibition laws should be repealed to the extent that they criminalize responsible marijuana use.&nbsp;  The key points to the Principles of Responsible Use are as 
follows:
<UL>
<LI><B>Cannabis consumption is for adults only.</B>&nbsp;  Many things and 
activities are suitable for young people, but others absolutely are not.&nbsp;  Children do not drive cars, enter into contracts or marry, and they must not use drugs.
<LI><B>The responsible cannabis user does not operate a motor vehicle or other dangerous machinery impaired by cannabis.</B>&nbsp;  Although cannabis is said by most experts to be safer than alcohol and many prescription drugs with motorists, public safety demands that impaired drivers be taken off the road and that objective measures of impairment be developed and used, rather than chemical testing.
<LI><B>The responsible cannabis user will carefully consider his/her setting and regulate use accordingly.</B>&nbsp;  The responsible cannabis consumer will be vigilant as to conditions -- time, place, mood, etc. -- and does not hesitate to say "no" when those conditions are not conducive to a safe, pleasant and/or productive experience.
<LI><B>Use of cannabis, to the extent that it impairs health, personal development or achievement, is abuse and should be resisted by responsible cannabis users.</B>&nbsp;  Abuse means harm.&nbsp;  Some cannabis use is harmful; most is not.&nbsp;  That which is harmful should be discouraged; that which is not need not be.
<LI><B>The responsible cannabis user does not violate the rights of others, observes accepted standards of courtesy and public propriety, and respects the preferences of those who wish to avoid cannabis entirely.</B>&nbsp;  Regardless of the legal status of cannabis, responsible users will adhere to emerging tobacco smoking protocols in public and private places.
</UL>

<CENTER><B>Vermont House Of Representatives Approves Hemp Cultivation 
Legislation</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 29, 1996, Montpelier, Vermont:</B>&nbsp;  Legislation that proposes to permit development of a domestic hemp industry in Vermont (H.783) was approved by the House of Representatives by a voice vote today.&nbsp;  The bill had received wide-scale bi-partisan support one day earlier when the second reading was approved by a 108-33 vote.&nbsp;  The overwhelming number of votes in favor of the legislation would override the Governor's veto if he chooses to oppose it.&nbsp;  In the past, Gov. Howard B. Dean has spoken out against hemp cultivation claiming that it would be tantamount to legalizing marijuana.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Vermont legislation is similar to a pending Colorado hemp bill introduced by Senator Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn) and would authorize the University of Vermont to undertake research of industrial hemp production in the state.&nbsp;  A key aspect of this research would include growing test plots of industrial hemp.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill is expected to go to the Senate after session tomorrow barring any last minute calls for reconsideration.&nbsp;  Legislators note that there appears to be little opposition for the proposal in the Senate.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Sen. Thomas Bahre (R-Addison), chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee told the Vermont Times that he hopes to begin taking testimony on the bill as soon as March 18.&nbsp;  "We want to seriously look at whether there is anybody out there to buy this fiber, and what its potential is to create manufacturing jobs," he said.&nbsp;  "If it doesn't then I don't see a need to go any further.&nbsp;  But, I do think this fiber has the potential to have land produce something that isn't producing milk."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Often described as "marijuana's misunderstood cousin," industrial hemp is from the same plant species that produces marijuana.&nbsp;  Unlike marijuana, however, industrial hemp has only minute amounts of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient that gives marijuana its euphoric properties.&nbsp;  Industrial hemp is currently grown legally throughout much of Europe and Asia and can be used to produce a variety of products such as cosmetics, textiles, paper, paints, 
plastics, and animal feed.

<CENTER><B>Hemp To Be Planted On American Indian Soil</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 17, 1996, Chandler Heights, AZ:</B>&nbsp;  The Coalition for Hemp Awareness (CHA) announced that the Navajo Nation has issued a resolution allowing for hemp cultivation to take place on American Indian soil.&nbsp;  CHA has scheduled a spring planting to take place on March 17, 1996.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Navaho Hemp Project began in 1992 when activists Jim Robinson and Tom and Carolyn McCormick moved to the reservation for the purpose of introducing hemp cultivation on sovereign soil.&nbsp;  The trio were so successful in their education campaign that the resolution was passed by the Navajo Nation with a unanimous vote of 30-0.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although over 30,000 acres of the Navajo Nation have been allocated for hemp cultivation, CHA's initial planting will be limited to a small seed bank crop.&nbsp;  In addition, CHA states that the organization is close to securing approval for similar cultivation projects from ten other tribes located across the United States.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Coalition for Hemp Awareness was founded in 1991 to incite the rapid return of cannabis hemp as an agricultural base crop.&nbsp;  CHA is a political advocacy network group that assimilates and disseminates hemp information to both politicians and the public.

<CENTER><B>Illinois Supreme Court Finds Cannabis Tax Stamps Unconstitutional</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 15, 1996, Illinois:</B>&nbsp;  The Illinois Supreme Court has declared that the application of the state's Cannabis and 
Controlled Substances Tax Act in the case a defendant who had previously plead guilty to drug possession charges constitutes double jeopardy under the United States Constitution.&nbsp;  This decision follows closely on the heels of similar rulings reached by both an Arizona trial court and the Indiana Supreme Court.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing the opinion of the court, Justice Harrison rejected the state's argument that the application of the Illinois act is not contingent upon commission of a crime.&nbsp;  "Under the Act, the only persons liable for the tax are 'dealers,'" the justice writes.&nbsp;  "[T]o be a 'dealer' within the meaning of the statute, one must have carried out certain enumerated acts 'in violation of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act or the Cannabis Control Act,' both of which are criminal statutes.&nbsp;  [Hence,] by the terms of the Act, criminal conduct is a prerequisite to tax liability. ..."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">... [Consequently,] because the Department of Revenue cannot determine whether a person is a 'dealer' subject to the tax unless and until that person had been found guilty of the underlying criminal offense, the Cannabis and Controlled Substances Tax Act not only assumes that a crime has been committed, it also presupposes that the offending party has been 
arrested, charged and convicted.&nbsp;  In this regard, the act ... [is] a form of punishment for double jeopardy."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information on this case, please refer to Docket No. 77708 (Keith Robert Wilson v. The Department Of Revenue), filed February 15, 1996.&nbsp;  For more information on cannabis tax stamps, please contact Allen St. Pierre of <B>NORML</B> @ (202) 483-5500.</I>

<CENTER><B>California Medical Marijuana Initiative Heads Toward November 
State Ballot</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 26, 1996, Santa Monica, CA:</B>  An initiative to 
legalize the medical use of marijuana appears headed for the November 1996 California ballot thanks to crucial last-minute financial support from a group of major donors.&nbsp;  The new donations make it likely that supporters will garner the necessary number of signatures by the April 20 deadline to place the initiative on the ballot.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Initiative organizers were elated by the gift and expressed confidence that voters would approve the measure.&nbsp;  Polls indicate that a solid majority of Californians support the medicinal legalization of marijuana.&nbsp;  The current medical marijuana initiative would guarantee the right of patients to use marijuana for medicinal purposes if they possess a physician's recommendation.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Medical marijuana has remained illegal despite growing acceptance in the health care community of its efficacy in the treatment of cancer, glaucoma, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain and muscle spasticity.&nbsp;  Under current state law, Californians who cultivate marijuana for medicinal use may be subject to up to three years in state prison.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The 1996 medical marijuana initiative has been endorsed by the cities of San Francisco, Oakland, and West Hollywood; the Santa Cruz and Marin Boards of Supervisors; the California Nurses Association; the Los Angeles AIDS Commission, the California Multiple Sclerosis Society, the California Seniors' Legislature, and many other organizations and public leaders.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to statements made to The New York Times by Dennis Peron, Director of the California Medical Marijuana Initiative, the all-volunteer signature drive has gathered approximately 200,000 signatures to date.&nbsp;  The coalition must collect 600,000 signatures by April 20 to place the initiative on the November ballot.

estimated 30 underground clubs located across the country that supplies marijuana as a therapeutic to seriously ill patients who possess a physician's recommendation -- has taken the offensive since his home was raided by police on February 16.&nbsp;  Evans' home served as the headquarters for the club which distributed marijuana to approximately 30 patients.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Evans and his attorney, marijuana activist Gatewood Galbraith, held a press conference on the Covington courthouse steps at the Kenton County Municipal Building to protest the police action.&nbsp;  "If they want to make this the battle [for medical marijuana clubs,] then we're ready to do battle," Galbraith told the press.&nbsp;  "Only a fascist nation would keep this premiere medicine from the hands of seriously ill patients ... for whom it is the best therapy."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Even though Evans' house was raided over one week ago and marijuana was confiscated, law enforcement officials have yet to produce a warrant for Evans' arrest.&nbsp;  Even so, Evans' case and subsequent press conference have drawn an exceptional amount of favorable press coverage including features in the Kentucky Post, Cincinnati Post, Cincinnati Enquirer, and at least two television news stations.&nbsp;  Covington police have refused to comment on the situation.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"I am sick of living in a country where I can't be free," summarized Evans.&nbsp;  "Give me liberty or give me death.&nbsp;  We are going to have a cannabis buyers club."

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 16, 1996, Covington, KY:</B>&nbsp;  The home of activist and medical marijuana user Richard Evans has been raided by law enforcement officials.&nbsp;  Evans' house served as the home base for the 9-year-old Cincinnati Cannabis Buyers Club.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Evans, who was not home at the time of the raid, subsequently checked himself into a local hospital to combat onsetting symptoms of manic depression -- a medical condition which he is treated for.&nbsp;  Evans stayed at the hospital throughout the weekend and intends to turn himself over to local authorities.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Evans informed <B>NORML</B> that he still has "no idea" what charges may be pending against him, but speculated that he may be facing felony offenses for two marijuana seedlings that were present in his home.&nbsp;  Ironically, witnesses report that law enforcement officers failed to seize the seedlings.

<CENTER><B>Missouri Medical Marijuana Bill Unanimously Passes Senate Public

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 15, 1996, Jefferson City, MO:</B>&nbsp;  A medical marijuana bill (Senate Bill 573) introduced by State Senator Joe Mosley has 
unanimously passed the Senate Public Health Committee.&nbsp;  The bill 
states that "no criminal or civil penalty shall apply to any person for the act of possessing marijuana provided that ... a [physician] certifies in writing that the person is under professional care [and] ... needs marijuana as part of a therapeutic regimen.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Missouri NORML Coordinator Dan Viets says that he is pleased with the committee's recommendation to the Senate to pass the bill.&nbsp;  However, he added a note of skepticism regarding a last minute amendment to the bill that instructs the University of Missouri to conduct research on the efficacy and safety of whole-smoked cannabis to that of the synthetic-THC drug Marinol.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"I hope this doesn't bog the bill down and undermine the overall purpose of the legislation: to stop seriously ill individuals from going to prison for their medical use of cannabis," Viets said.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill will now go to the Senate floor for a vote.

<CENTER><B>Hemp Businessman Sentenced To More Than 8 Years In Prison</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 15, 1996, Minneapolis, MN:</B>&nbsp;  Hemp activist and 
founder of the U.S. Hemp Company, Arlin Trout, was sentenced to more than eight years in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to possess more than 100 kilograms of marijuana.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Trout accused the prosecution of utilizing paid informers and snitches to frame him and labeled himself a political prisoner who is being targeted for his beliefs.&nbsp;  Arlin's wife, Cathy, will now be left to run the successful clothing business and raise the Trout's six children on her own.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Prior to his sentencing, Trout gave an impassioned speech to U.S. District Judge James Rosenbaum.&nbsp;  "I was charged and convicted of conspiring to sell a plant that grows wild in this region and [that] once provided legal jobs for Minnesota.&nbsp;  This plant is the oldest, safest source of food, fuel, fiber and medicine on Earth and has infinite industrial and medicinal value to society.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"... Fear and ignorance guided by greed and blind ambition created the prohibition of hemp.&nbsp;  I am morally and intellectually compelled to resist these forces.&nbsp;  When the American people find out what hemp is and why it's really illegal, may they deal with this government as harshly as it has dealt with me.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although Trout's supporters applauded Arlin's bold speech, Judge Rosenbaum was unmoved and sentenced Trout to the maximum sentence recommended under the U.S. sentencing guidelines.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When asked if she felt that her husband's speech may have increased the length of his sentence, Cathy Trout responded, "Why not stand up for your rights?&nbsp;  One day in jail is too long.&nbsp;  You can't be expected to admit you're wrong when you don't believe you are.&nbsp;  You've got to live with yourself.&nbsp;  Besides, the extra time isn't going to destroy the fact that I love him and his children love him, and no matter how long he's in [prison], that won't change."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite Trout's incarceration, he is reportedly planning to run as the United States vice presidential candidate for the 10-year-old Grassroots Party.

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 21, 1996, Norman, OK:</B>&nbsp;  A month long hemp display arranged by the University of Oklahoma NORML chapter is under 
fire from parents and local officials.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The three case exhibit, currently on display at The Norman Public Library, advocates the legalization of the hemp plant for industrial and agricultural purposes.&nbsp;  On display are various products made from hemp such as hats, shoes, and backpacks as well as a caption next to a picture of former President George Washington encouraging farmers to: "Grow hemp."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">School patron Robert Coffman, who said he was representing other parents, recently criticized the display at a City Council meeting and argued that such an exhibit was inappropriate for children.&nbsp;  In addition, Mayor Bill Nations reports that he has had at least a dozen calls from people opposed to the exhibit.&nbsp;  Nations admits that both city and library officials had tried to prevent UO NORML from running the exhibit.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Tony Smith, a member of UO NORML, states that the library has received an equal number of compliments as well as complaints from patrons regarding the controversial exhibit.&nbsp;  He further argues that children should be allowed to view the exhibit so they can learn about the historical and industrial uses of the hemp plant.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"We teach our children that we have a free country where dissenting opinions can be expressed," Smith says.&nbsp;  "Our children are well-informed about the government's position on marijuana.&nbsp;  Our exhibit in a public forum demonstrates that we ... live in a country where freedom of expression exists."

enforcement officials to speak out in favor of California's current medical marijuana initiative.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"I believe there is adequate unbiased and scientific evidence that marijuana does have medicinal benefit.&nbsp;  When we consider the associated consequences of other prescription drugs it seems illogical to exclude marijuana as another alternative available to physicians for prescription. ..."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"... Even if there are no other benefits than relief of pain or stimulation of appetite, there appears to be a legitimate place for marijuana in the wide array of legally prescribed drugs.&nbsp;  The legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes seems to strike a reasonable balance between the abuse and illegal use of the drug and its legitimate medicinal value that could be available through prescriptive use.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"With the increased public attention on my own support of the medicinal use of marijuana, I find that many other conservative persons share this belief.&nbsp;  ...Marijuana is not the street degenerate that ravages society."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Anderson has been employed in law enforcement and public safety since 1964 and has been a police chief for 14 years.&nbsp;  He is also a member of the U.S. Army Reserve with rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Californians for Compassionate Use coalition is attempting to place an initiative on the 1996 general election ballot that would allow doctors to prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic agent.&nbsp;  The coalition needs to collect 600,000 signatures by April 20 to place the initiative on the November ballot.

<CENTER><B>Update: Judge Drops Charges Against Medical Marijuana User Todd 
McCormick</B></CENTER> 

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 13, 1996, Bryan, OH:</B>&nbsp;  Judge Anthony Gretick has dismissed drug charges against medical marijuana user and activist Todd McCormick.&nbsp;  McCormick, who has a prescription from a physician in Holland to use cannabis as a medicine, was arrested this past summer when Ohio State Patrolmen discovered in excess of thirty pounds of marijuana in his van. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Judge Gretick ruled that state troopers had illegally searched McCormick's vehicle and ordered that the evidence be suppressed.&nbsp;  It is expected that the state will appeal Gretick's verdict. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since the beginning of this case, McCormick has maintained that the search had been illegal and that the marijuana seized was intended solely for medical use and not for sale.&nbsp;  McCormick, 25, is the founder of the San Diego Compassionate Use Club in California and was driving to his home state of Rhode Island to establish a similar club when he was arrested. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick's case garnered national headlines this past fall when it was revealed that Judge Gretick was considering allowing McCormick to have legal access to cannabis while in jail.&nbsp;  For much of his life, McCormick has used marijuana as a therapeutic to alleviate pain associated with a rare strain of cancer he suffers from known as histiocytosis X.&nbsp;  While in Holland, McCormick received a prescription for the use of 1 to 10 grams of marijuana daily from Dr. R. T. Trossel of the Preventive Medicine Center in Rotterdam. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"I'm sure he can't live without it," Trossel notes, "because he becomes completely paralyzed.&nbsp;  ...I am convinced [that] there are no other drugs that would give him the same relief.&nbsp;  He's tried them all ... [and] ... this seems to have the best effect on him." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick, who had recently been residing in the Netherlands, states that he is pleased with Gretick's ruling and plans on returning to Rhode Island shortly.&nbsp;  He notes that he is considering filing charges against the state of Ohio.

<CENTER><B>Medical Marijuana Sentence Reduction Bill Introduced in

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 5, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</B>&nbsp;  State Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco) has introduced legislation (AB 2120) that would provide some relief for patients who choose to cultivate marijuana for medicinal purposes.&nbsp;  The bill (AB 2120) would reclassify such personal cultivation and use of medical marijuana as a misdemeanor, thereby allowing judges to grant a wide variety of sentencing alternatives.&nbsp;  Currently, marijuana cultivation in California is categorized as a felony offense and those found guilty may be subject to up to three years in state 
prison. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The medical sentence reduction bill is scheduled to be heard before the Public Safety Committee of the State Assembly in March.&nbsp;  Burton's bill represents the fourth year in a row that the state legislature has attempted to reconcile the continuing demand from the medical community for access to medical marijuana. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"This bill is a real ... effort to relieve the suffering of thousands of seriously ill people," says Dennis Peron, Director of Californians for Compassionate Use.&nbsp;  "This is surely the least we can do." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Californians for Compassionate Use coalition is currently attempting to place a medical marijuana initiative on the 1996 general election ballot by collecting 600,000 signatures by April 20, 1996.

<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Modeled closely after a Colorado hemp bill, Vermont's legislation (H.783) would allow limited test cultivation of industrial hemp to take place at the University of Vermont for the next two years.&nbsp;  The bill will go before the house floor for a second reading on February 20. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"There is nothing on the radar screen that has nearly the magnitude of economic benefit that hemp has for our farmers," states Rep. Fred Maslack (R-Poultney), one of The bill's primary supporters.&nbsp;  "The federal government has no business interfering with state legislation." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Maslack notes that the hemp issue is a bi-partisan issue with "momentum in the house."

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 12, 1996, Honolulu, Hawaii:</B>&nbsp;  The House Agriculture Committee has voted to postpone deciding on a bill that would 
allow Hawaii to cultivate industrial hemp until "more scientific information" can be gathered. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Legislation introduced by state Rep. David Tarnas would amend the state law to authorize the production, possession, and commerce of non-psychoactive industrial hemp in Hawaii.&nbsp;  Tarnas maintains that the cultivation of industrial hemp in Hawaii could provide local farmers with a prosperous economic and environmental future.&nbsp;  "Hawaii has the opportunity to capture a significant market share as the first hemp production in the U.S.A.," he wrote this past November. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Less enthusiastic were the members of the House Agriculture Committee who decided to hold off acting on Tarnas' bill until the 1997 legislative session.&nbsp;  The committee's main concern appeared to be over the question of cross-pollination, stated an aid of Rep. Tarnas who attended the hearings.&nbsp;  Law enforcement officials testified that marijuana growers would be able to grow psychoactive strains of cannabis alongside of non-psychoactive hemp.&nbsp;  Hemp proponents denied this claim and argued that the growth of high grade marijuana was not possible in such close 
proximity to industrial hemp. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An aid of Rep. Tarnas maintains that he will "absolutely" reintroduce hemp cultivation legislation next year.&nbsp;  In the meantime, the House of Representatives has released a concurrent resolution (H.C.R. 28) requesting the establishment of a "state licensing program for the agricultural production of industrial cannabis hemp for food, fuel, and fiber, and the establishment of a pilot project to conduct agronomic research on industrial cannabis hemp."

<CENTER><B>Actor Woody Harrelson Endorses Industrial Hemp; Hearings For Colorado Cultivation Bill Begin Today</B></CENTER> 

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 8, 1996, Denver, CO:</B>&nbsp;  Hearings begin today before the Colorado State Senate Agriculture Committee to determine the 
fate of a bill that would allow Colorado to become the first state to grow industrial hemp in almost 40 years. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill, sponsored by Senator Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn), permits the planting of no more than 40 acres of industrial hemp in Colorado in 1996 for agricultural, commercial, and scientific research.&nbsp;  The legislation allows for full scale commercial production of hemp to begin in 1998. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Appearing before the Committee today are a wide assortment of hemp activists, businessmen, farmers, and lobbyists.&nbsp;  However, Casey speculates that the bill's most influential endorsement may come from Hollywood actor and businessman, Woody Harrelson.&nbsp;  In a fax to the Agriculture Committee, Harrelson stated that he "will personally guarantee that all hemp produced in Colorado will be purchased at fair market prices."&nbsp;  Harrelson is a hemp proponent who has commercial interests in both the clothing and paper industry. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"That [endorsement] might do the best for us," notes Casey.&nbsp;  In the past, a major concern for the committee was whether there is a legitimate market for industrial hemp.&nbsp;  Harrelson's announcement demonstrates that there are buyers willing and waiting, the senator states. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If Casey's legislation is approved by the 7-member Senate Agriculture Committee, the bill will then move on to the Senate floor for a vote. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information on this bill, please contact either Colorado State Senator Lloyd Casey @ (303) 866-4865 or the Colorado Hemp Initiative Project at (303) 784-5632.&nbsp;  For more information on industrial hemp, please contact Allen St. Pierre @ <B>NORML</B>.</I>

<CENTER><B>Circuit Court Ruling Allows For Religious Defense In Marijuana Cases</B></CENTER> 

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 2, 1995, San Francisco, CA:</B>&nbsp;  Rastafarians can 
defend themselves against charges of marijuana possession on religious grounds, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Citing the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the three judge appeals panel overturned the lower court convictions of three individuals charged with possessing marijuana.&nbsp;  The Circuit Court ruled that a Montana District Court Judge had violated the act by failing to allow the Rastafarian defendants to present evidence demonstrating marijuana's sacred role in their religion.&nbsp;  However, the Court upheld additional drug 
convictions against the defendants. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"The court's decision to negate the marijuana possession charges against these defendants is a significant ruling," stated <B>NORML</B> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;  "To the best of <B>NORML</B>'s 
knowledge, this decision is the first time that a marijuana conviction has been overturned on the basis of freedom of religion." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 strengthened protections for religious groups and was intended to curb criminal prosecutions that interfere with religious beliefs.&nbsp;  The act requires the government to show a compelling interest for any prosecution that significantly hinders the exercise of religious freedom. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"Under RFRA, ... the government had the obligation, first, to show that the application of the marijuana laws to the defendants was in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and, second, to show that the application of these laws to these defendants was the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest," Judge John Noonan wrote for the court. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, the court maintained that the government could challenge the defendant's claims that they were, in fact, Rastafarians. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The government should be free to cross-examine [the defendants] on whether they ... are Rastafarians and to introduce evidence negating their assented claims," added Judge Noonan.&nbsp;  "It is not enough in order to enjoy the protections of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to claim the name of religion as a protective cloak." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information, please contact Allen St. Pierre of <B>NORML</B> @ (202) 483-5500.&nbsp;  A copy of the decision is currently
available on the Internet at the following address: <A HREF="http://www.law.vill.edu/Fed-Ct/Circuit/9th/opinions/9430073.htm"><SMALL>http://www.law.vill.edu/Fed-Ct/Circuit/9th/opinions/9430073.htm</SMALL></A></I>

<CENTER><B>Iowa Supreme Court "Just Says No" To Controversial License Suspension Law</B></CENTER> 
 
<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 1996, Des Moines, IA:</B>&nbsp;  Iowa's federally mandated "smoke a joint, lose your license law" has been ruled 
unconstitutional by the State Supreme Court.&nbsp;  As a result, 
hundreds of convicted drug offenders, many found guilty of simple 
marijuana possession, will have their driving privileges restored.&nbsp;  In addition, the state stands to lose more than $16 million annually in federal highway aid. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">With its recent <A HREF="../LAWS/dressler.html"> decision</A>, the court nullified a 1993 state law that imposes an automatic six-month driver's license suspension upon conviction of any drug offense, regardless of whether the offense is driving related.&nbsp;  According to the court, the license suspension constituted "double jeopardy" because it was a second punishment for a single criminal action.&nbsp;  "There [is] no direct connection between possession of controlled substances, driving, and public safety," wrote the court.&nbsp;  "The amended statute authorizing this license revocation was aimed essentially at enhancing punishment for controlled substance possession." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Iowa Department of Transportation estimates that nearly 8,500 people had been subject to license suspension since the law took effect two years ago. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"It's the first step in the right direction of common sense," said Attorney Jeff Crispin of Des Moines.&nbsp;  "There's no logical connection between these drug offenses and driving privileges.&nbsp;  It doesn't make sense to have these penalties." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the recent decision, transportation officials have decided against expunging drug-related suspensions from the driving records of those who have already completed them.

<CENTER><B>Medical Marijuana Patients To Rally On State Capitol Steps</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 7, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</B>&nbsp;  Persons who are living with AIDS and cancer from the Sacramento County area and beyond 
will be rallying on the West Steps of the California State Capitol Building Saturday, February 17 at 2:00 to show their support for medical marijuana.&nbsp;  Sacramento County Director of Californians for Compassionate Use, Ryan Landers, will present state lawmakers with signatures gathered in Sacramento during the first half of the statewide effort to qualify the "Compassionate Use Act of 1996" for inclusion in the 1996 election ballot and demonstrators will be conducting an all day sign-up drive. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Medical marijuana proponents need to gather 600,000 signatures from registered voters by April 20 in order to put the Initiative on the ballot for the 1996 election.&nbsp;  To date, the all volunteer drive has amassed approximately 125,000 signatures. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">California's Medical Marijuana Initiative came about in response to Governor Pete Wilson's decision to veto legislation that would allow for the medical use of marijuana.&nbsp;  If the initiative is passed by California voters this fall, the bill will become law immediately and cannot be vetoed. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"The [Medical Marijuana] Initiative will simply set the record and allow patients and their doctors to use marijuana medicinally in California free of the stigmas and terror they have come to accept," explained Dennis Peron, statewide Director of the Compassionate Use Campaign.

<CENTER><B>NORML Targets Republican Task Force: Urges Panel To Lift Ban On 
Medical Cannabis, Reconsider Decriminalization Of Marijuana</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 1, 1996, Washington, DC:</B>&nbsp;  <B>NORML</B> has sent a formal letter and 50-page informative booklet to each member of the new Republican task force on drugs.&nbsp;  The letter urges the committee 
to lift the federal government's ban on medical cannabis and re-examine the decriminalization of marijuana as a public policy.&nbsp;  <B>NORML</B> also asks the task force to include testimony from medical experts on these subjects when the committee holds public hearings on drug use later this year. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Enclosures to the letter include endorsements of the potential of medical marijuana from such well respected organizations as the National Academy of Sciences, American Public Health Association and others.&nbsp;  Also included in the booklet is a summary of the 1981 Monitoring the Future briefing paper that stated, "decriminalization [of marijuana] has had 
virtually no effect either on the marijuana use or related attitudes and belief about marijuana use among American young people." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"This compendium makes a strong argument for a federal re-evaluation of our current marijuana policies," says <B>NORML</B> Deputy National Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;  "It is intended to persuade as well as inform the newly established Republican drug task force." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The letter and booklet are two of <B>NORML</B>'s latest efforts to 
garner political attention and support for U.S. Representative Barney Frank's federal medical marijuana bill (H.R. 2618).&nbsp;  Frank's legislation would amend the federal law to permit doctor's to prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic agent to seriously ill patients.&nbsp;  The bill has been referred to the Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment and the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime where it is presently awaiting a vote.

Bob McCaslin, R-4th District; Darlene Fairley, D-32nd District; and Pat Thibaudeau, D-43rd District, has introduced a bill (S.B. 6744) that would allow further research to be conducted regarding the medical uses of marijuana. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The legislation, known as the Controlled Substances Therapeutic Research Act, finds that there is a need for research regarding the cultivation, processing, and distribution of medicinal marijuana under strictly controlled circumstances.&nbsp;  Therefore, S.B. 6744 amends current state statutes, creates new sections, and allows for appropriations to achieve those ends. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill has been referred to the 25-member Committee on Ways and Means and must be brought to an initial vote by February 6. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information, please contact Joanna McKee of Green Cross @ (206) 780-0630.&nbsp;  For more information on the medical uses of marijuana, please contact Allen St. Pierre of <B>NORML</B> @ (202) 483-5500.&nbsp;  Senator Jeanne Kohl may he contacted @ (360) 786-7670.</I>

<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Musikka was arrested by Gainesville police on December 9, 1995 while performing on stage at the sixth annual Florida Hempfest.&nbsp;  Despite having a prescription for marijuana issued to her by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Mussika was arrested after she took out one of her marijuana cigarettes and began smoking.&nbsp;  She was dragged off the stage arm-and-arm by two police officers and was later charged with possession of marijuana and disorderly conduct.&nbsp;  "The police just attacked the stage, reached up and grabbed me, and knocked me down," Musikka said.&nbsp;  "I was in total shock." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"The State Attorney honorably entered a nolle prosequi [decision not to prosecute] all charges after we presented them with the medical and legal documentation that supported our position," stated Fort Lauderdale attorney Norm Kent.

<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At a preliminary hearing, Judge Stolz of Manhattan's Criminal Court chose not to dismiss felony sales charges against Moore.&nbsp;  Stolz refused the defense's motion to dismiss on the grounds that the sale took place in a public space and because Moore has no formal training in medicine.

President Clinton's nomination of Army General Barry R. McCaffrey as the nation's new "Drug Czar." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"General McCaffrey has an impressive record of service to this country," says George R. Vickers, Executive Director of WOLA.&nbsp;  "But what is needed is a fundamental shift in U.S. anti-narcotic policies, away from failed military strategies that have had little impact on the supply of illicit drugs coming to the United States. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"Regardless of his personal qualities, McCaffrey's nomination symbolizes the misguided militarization of U.S. drug policy," adds WOLA Senior Associate Colleta Younger, "and suggests a continued erosion of civilian control over law enforcement efforts in this field." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">As Commander in Chief of the United States Southern Command, General McCaffrey has overseen the U.S. military's anti-narcotics operations in Latin America.&nbsp;  The WOLA has monitored human rights and United States policy in Latin America since 1974 and has produced numerous reports on U.S. anti-narcotics policy in the Andes.

<CENTER><B>Circuit Judge's Dissent In Urinalysis Case Could Spur Supreme Court Review</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 24, 1996, Atlanta, GA:</B>&nbsp;  The 11th Circuit Court has ruled that a Georgia law requiring all political candidates running for state office to undergo drug screening urinalysis is constitutional, but it is the dissent that has attorney Walker Chandler talking. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"It's a great decision," Walker said.&nbsp;  "Have you read the 
dissent.&nbsp;  It hits the nail right on the head." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a scathing 11 page dissent, Circuit Judge Rosemary Barkett writes, "I do not believe that the suspicionless search in these circumstances serves any special governmental need beyond the normal need for law enforcement, and, if it did, I believe that the candidates' privacy interests outweigh the governmental interests. ..." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">...We are not merely dealing with the denial of a job opportunity, but with the denial of opportunity to participate in our democratic form of government." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Barkett's dissent also calls into question apparent First Amendment violations posed by the controversial Georgia law.&nbsp;  "The majority maintains that the government's purpose [in passing this legislation] is not suppression of free expression.&nbsp;  Yet, it supports its holding by citing the importance of ensuring that elected officials are 'persons appreciative of the perils of drug use' and 'sympathetic to drug interdiction efforts.' 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Establishing a certain ideology as a 'qualification' for holding public office appears to be a content-based restriction on free expression." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Chandler, who filed the action against the Georgia statute and served as his own legal counsel maintains that he will forgo an "en banc" review of his case and will attempt to take his appeal directly to the Supreme Court.&nbsp;  He intends to argue that the law  violates the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.&nbsp;  Referring to the Court's decision last year to uphold the constitutionality of a Washington state law mandating random and warrantless searches of high school athletes partly on the notion that school children live under fewer constitutional 
protections than adults, Chandler fires, "The only way the Supreme Court could [then] approve of Georgia's law is by affirming that all Georgians are [children.]" 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>NORML</B>'s recently reformed Amicus Curiae Committee is currently reviewing the 11th Circuit Court decision and will consider filing an amicus brief if the Supreme Court decides to hear the case.

<CENTER><B>Activists Intending To Sell Marijuana At The Super Bowl Gain National Exposure</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 14, 1995, Tempe, AZ:</B>&nbsp;  The rumor that marijuana will be sold openly during this year's Super Bowl has garnered the attention of the national media in recent weeks and has even made it to the pages of Time Magazine. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Representatives from the Richard M. Davis Cannabis Hemp Co. plan to be on hand selling marijuana, states the magazine.&nbsp;  "I plan to have a press conference in the parking lot," says longtime marijuana activist and R.M. Davis spokesman Ron Kiczenski, "[I will] tell people where they can buy [marijuana] in the vicinity of the Super Bowl.&nbsp;  Not within the secured zone you have to get a special venue license for, but outside of that zone.&nbsp;  They'll be able to buy legal marijuana." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both Kiczenski and Davis have openly sold marijuana in Arizona before.&nbsp;  Ironically, on one occasion, the activists boldly set up shop in front of the Arizona State Capitol. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The activists latest plan stems from a ruling by Northwest Phoenix Justice Court Judge John Barclay that dismissed charges against Arizona NORML Chairman Peter Wilson because of evidence that he is licensed by the state to sell marijuana.&nbsp;  Basing his decision on constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy, Judge Barclay concluded that Wilson could not be prosecuted for possession of marijuana because of taxes he has paid to the Arizona Department of Revenue to sell cannabis.&nbsp;  Under Title 42 of a 1983 law, Arizona residents can purchase both a license and 
tax stamps to possess and sell marijuana.

<CENTER><B>Defense Fund Established To Aid Man Charged With Marijuana Trafficking</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 24, 1996, Oregon, OH:</B>&nbsp;  <B>NORML</B> chapters in Cleveland and Fremont Ohio have united to establish a defense fund for 
medical marijuana user Daniel Asbury.&nbsp;  Asbury is a quadriplegic who has been charged with trafficking in marijuana for growing his own medical cannabis. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Asbury suffered a broken neck 15 years ago and began to use marijuana as a therapeutic after prescription drugs proved to be ineffective at controlling his pain and muscle spasms.&nbsp;  Marijuana made me "fe[el] like a human being again," he said. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Asbury was arrested in September of 1995 for growing his own marijuana to treat his medical condition.&nbsp;  Asbury's lawyer, Terry Lodge of Toledo, Ohio, will invoke "medical necessity" as the basis for his defense.&nbsp;  The trial is scheduled to begin February 26 at the Lucas County Court House. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The medical necessity defense is expensive and requires expert testimony to establish the foundation for the defense.&nbsp;  Asbury's legal fees, including the cost of flying in expert witnesses such as <B>NORML</B> board member Dr. John Morgan, will total in the thousands of dollars. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>NORML</B> will forward all moneys received for the Daniel Asbury 
Defense Fund to Mid-American Bank in Toledo, Ohio where an account has been set up to assist Asbury. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>Concerned parties can mail checks or money orders made payable to Daniel Asbury to: NORML Defense Fund, PO Box 771154, Cleveland, Ohio, 44107 or call (216) 521-9333 for more information.</I>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 21, 1996:</B>&nbsp;  The latest issue of National Review, a weekly conservative journal headed by syndicated columnist William F. Buckley, asserts that the "war on drugs is lost" and recommends that the time has come to make narcotics legal. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a 15 page section of the political weekly, Buckley and a half-dozen other legalization proponents including Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore argue that America's "present prohibitive policy has failed, flatly and without serious question." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a telephone interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Buckley said that he hopes that the attention garnered from National Review will encourage the thinking community to begin seriously facing the issue of legalization. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Buckley, who just recently debated DEA head Thomas Constantine on the January 23 edition of "The Today Show," intends to follow up on the subject with three televised debates on his PBS program, "Firing Line."

<CENTER><B>U.S. Supreme Court To Review Double Jeopardy Case</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 12, 1996, Washington, DC:</B>&nbsp;  The United States Supreme Court has agreed to review the case that has virtually halted 
civil forfeitures across the country and resulted in thousands of convicted individuals asking courts to vacate their convictions. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In <a href="http://www.fear.org/405kpg.html">United States v. $405,089.23 in U.S. Currency</a>, the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that civil forfeitures constitute punishment for the purpose of double jeopardy.&nbsp;  Soon thereafter, courts across the country were flooded with petitions 
from inmates claiming that they had been punished by civil forfeiture and demanding that their convictions must be vacated.&nbsp;  Consequently, prosecutors throughout the nation have been besieged with litigation which requires that they defend cases they thought they had already won. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Criminal forfeiture statutes allow the government to simply combine the forfeiture and the criminal prosecution in the same case.&nbsp;  However, civil forfeitures are preferred by the government because the property owner is presumed guilty and because prosecutors have the added benefit of impoverishing the property owner as he or she faces a criminal prosecution.&nbsp;  Should the Supreme Court affirm the 9th Circuit's decision, even in part, many convictions and civil forfeitures will have to be undone. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both the government and the property owners urged the Supreme Court to take this case to resolve a host of issues which have arisen in the 6 years since the Court ruled in 1989 that civil forfeiture could be considered punishment for double jeopardy purposes. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information on civil forfeiture, please contact counsel for the property owners: Jeffrey Steinborn (206) 622-5117, or Jeffrey Finer (509)455-3700.</I>

<CENTER><B>Exiting Drug Czar Takes "Pot" Shot At New Hemp Shoe</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 13, 1996, Washington, DC:</B>&nbsp;  The name of Adidas' new hemp-based sneaker has fallen under staunch criticism from exiting drug czar, Lee Brown.&nbsp;  In a January 5 letter addressed to Adidas America President Steven Wynne, Brown asserts that the product's brand name -- "The Hemp" -- was specifically chosen to glorify and capitalize on the drug culture.&nbsp;  "On behalf of the children of America...," Brown writes, "I call upon you not to market [this] shoe." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to the drug czar's sharp reproach, Wynne answers that the shoe's brand name was chosen simply as a way to call attention to the industrial material used to construct the shoe.&nbsp;  "Adidas ... is working to produce products that are environmentally responsible," responds Wynne.&nbsp;  "One such material is hemp.&nbsp;  ...Consistent with this direction, we have produced a shoe using hemp.&nbsp;  ..." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">... [Furthermore,] products made from fiber hemp, including our shoes have no drug qualities.&nbsp;  I don't believe you will encounter anyone smoking our shoes anytime soon." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This past Friday, Brown shot off a second letter to Wynne, chastising the "sarcastic" tone of his previous response and again repeating his demand that Adidas find another name for its shoe.&nbsp;  "What the shoe is made of is not the problem," Brown counters.&nbsp;  "The problem is what you call it.&nbsp;  ...I do not think it is in the goal of curbing drug abuse to imply that drugs are cool." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Adidas spokesman John Fread says the company has not yet decided whether it will respond to Brown's latest letter.&nbsp;  The controversial Adidas shoe hit stores in December, but has not yet been publicly advertised.

<CENTER><B>Florida Schools To Consider Drug Testing Students</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 12, 1996, Fort Myers, FL:</B>&nbsp;  The Lee County school 
board is considering whether to impose random drug tests on its entire upper level student body as a way to deter teen drug use.&nbsp;  The proposed tests would be given regardless of reasonable suspicion and would extend to all students in middle and high school.&nbsp;  School board members intend to decide on the issue before the next school year. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"I think there is a [drug] problem," board member Pat Riley told the Fort Myers News Press.&nbsp;  "When I mention it to students, they jokingly say: 'There goes the whole basketball team, or the whole football team.'&nbsp;  I don't think that's funny. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Lee County school officials note that the schools already undergo random searches by drug dogs of students' lockers, although few drugs have been found.&nbsp;  Nevertheless, Superintendent Bobbie D'Alessandro states that results of a survey of 5,000 Lee County high school students demonstrate that there is a drug problem.

<CENTER><B>Clinton Administration Close To Naming New Drug Czar</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 17, 1996, Washington, DC:</B>&nbsp;  Army Lt. Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey is a leading contender to be the nation's next drug czar, reports a recent story in The Washington Post. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Post article quotes an unnamed senior administration official who said McCaffrey is "looking good" for the position.&nbsp;  McCaffrey is one of the country's most decorated generals and in the past has taken a hard-line stance against drugs.&nbsp;  He recently criticized the United States' current drug interdiction efforts during a public forum at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington DC Republican think-tank. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Many political analysts speculate that appointing a tough, no-nonsense military figure to head the federal "war on drugs" would be a wise strategic move for the Clinton administration, which has often been criticized for appearing "soft" on the illegal drug issue. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If McCaffrey is selected for the position, he would be the nation's fourth drug czar, after William Bennett, former Florida governor Bob Martinez, and Lee Brown.

<CENTER><B>Canadian Hemp Activist, Businessman Busted By Vancouver Police</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 4, Vancouver, Canada:</B>&nbsp;  Police have raided the <a href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp BC</a> store in Vancouver, British Columbia, and are charging the store's owner, vocal hemp activist Marc Emery, and three employees with selling marijuana seeds.&nbsp;  Emery had been selling marijuana seeds, along with hemp products and literature, from his retail store for the last 19 months in open defiance of the law.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Emery was recently featured in a front page article of the Wall Street Journal where he boasted to have sold "130,000 seeds" this year alone.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The raid took place at approximately 1 p.m. and law enforcement officials seized seeds and drug paraphernalia such as pipes, bongs, and mushroom grow kits.&nbsp;  A large Budget Rent-a-truck was parked outside to help the police move Hemp BC's wide assortment of products.&nbsp;  Emery and three employees were taken away in handcuffs and all four activists are being charged with trafficking marijuana seeds and selling instruments and 
paraphernalia for illicit drug use.&nbsp;  If found guilty of both charges, all four could face each life imprisonment and fines of $100,000.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Police Constable Anne Drennan states that the <a href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp BC</a> bust is the first time in Vancouver history that trafficking charges have been filed against individuals for selling marijuana seeds.&nbsp;  Drennan further added that she expects Emery -- a self-proclaimed libertarian who has previously served time in jail for opening his bookstore on Sunday in disobedience of Ontario's blue laws -- to conduct a very public court challenge.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both Emery and the three <a href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp BC</a> employees were released Friday on their own recognizance.&nbsp;  A preliminary hearing has been set for February 8, 1996.

that the <a href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp BC</a> retail storefront continues to remain open for business in spite of last Thursday's raid.&nbsp;  "We will be selling pipes, bongs, and seeds as per usual, although we might be understocked for a day or two," he says.

<CENTER><B>American Farm Bureau Supports Industrial Hemp Research</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 11, 1995, Reno, Nevada:</B>&nbsp;  The American Farm Bureau Federation, the largest farming organization in the United States, passed a resolution at its annual convention calling for research that could lead to the re-introduction of hemp into the American farm economy.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The resolution, adopted by a unanimous vote of the 51 state presidents and all 300 voting delegates, reads: "We recommend that [the] American Farm Bureau Federation encourage research into the viability and economic potential of industrial hemp production in the United States.&nbsp;  We further recommend that such research includes planting test plots in the United States using modern agricultural techniques."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Often described as "marijuana's misunderstood cousin," industrial hemp is from the same plant species that produces marijuana.&nbsp;  Unlike marijuana, however, industrial hemp has only minute amounts of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient that gives marijuana its euphoric properties.&nbsp;  Industrial hemp is currently grown legally 
throughout much of Europe and Asia and is being cultivated in test plots in Australia and Canada.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Andrew Graves, incoming president of the Fayette County chapter of the Kentucky Farm Bureau and vice-president of the Kentucky Hemp Growers Cooperative Association, introduced the resolution at the convention.&nbsp;  "What we are asking for is research to determine whether industrial hemp can once again become a profitable agricultural commodity for American farmers 
just as it is for farmers around the world," Graves said in his presentation.&nbsp;  "Where would agriculture be without research?"
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a separate resolution, the AFB also voted to affirm its policy in support of government efforts to eradicate illegal drugs, including marijuana.

<CENTER><B>U.S. Representative Criticizes <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">Hempilation</a> Protest Rally</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 3, 1996, Washington, DC:</B>&nbsp;  In response to a December 1 rally held outside the offices of Boston radio station WBCN to 
the protest the airplay of the NORML benefit CD <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">Hempilation</a>, U.S. 
Representative Barney Frank (D-Mass.) has issued a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno both condemning the actions of rally organizers, the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and requesting an inquiry into whether federal law enforcement officials were involved.  
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Like many others who have voiced their disapproval over the actions of the G.A.A.D. (i.e., National Writers Union, Boston Coalition for Freedom of Expression, Mass/Cann, etc.), Frank is highly critical of the actions of a Drug Enforcement Administration official who allegedly took an active role in the protest.&nbsp;  "It does not seem to me at all appropriate for a 
federal law enforcement agent to accompany an individual [G.A.A.D. Executive Director Georgette Watson] who is making a demand that a media outlet cease broadcasting a particular album, no matter how ... ill-advised you, I and the DEA might find it to be," Frank writes.&nbsp;  "This [sort of conduct] puts the federal government in the position of lending official support to an interference with freedom of expression. ..."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">... [Therefore,] if in fact a DEA agent accompanied Ms. Watson and lent support by his ... presence to her demand that the radio station stop playing [the <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">Hempilation</a>] CD, [then] that is a wholly inappropriate action for a federal law enforcement official ... and I ask that you look into it and make clear that this is not the sort of thing that should happen."

<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Future reports and conferences will be aimed at addressing potential solutions to America's violent crime problem, the bipartisan task force announced.&nbsp;  One of the problems that the bipartisan commission intends to address is the notion that America's current criminal justice system is simply a "revolving door" for career offenders.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"We are hear to underscore the American people's perception on violent crime," Bennett concluded.

<CENTER><B>Marijuana Activists Sue Prosecutors:&nbsp;  Hemp Proponents Claim 
Unlawful, Selective Prosecution In Hemp Seed Case</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>December 28, Hilo, Hawaii:</B>&nbsp;  Longtime hemp activists Roger Christie and Aaron Anderson have filed a civil lawsuit against 
Hawaii County prosecutor Jay Kimura and Deputy Prosecutor Kay Iopa alleging that they were unlawfully and selectively prosecuted for expressing their opinions regarding marijuana.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Christie and Anderson's suit maintains that the two were selectively prosecuted by Iopa in 1992 for possessing apparently sterile hemp seeds.&nbsp;  The seeds had been imported from China as birdseed in compliance with both state and federal laws.&nbsp;  Charges of "commercial promotion of marijuana" against Christie were dismissed earlier this year, but the case against Anderson is still pending.  
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The duo's lawsuit asserts that they were singled out primarily for their outspoken beliefs regarding the positive uses for hemp.&nbsp;  Christie and Anderson note that while similar hemp seeds are available and commonly sold in stores in Hawaii, they were the only individuals targeted by prosecutors.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Specifically, the suit alleges that prosecutors violated Christie's and Anderson's constitutional rights to "freely speak, petition their government, and be free from unjust government oppression."  
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The suit also alleges that Iopa misrepresented the facts against Christie and Anderson.&nbsp;  In 1992, police sent 800 seeds to the state Department of Agriculture for germination tests.&nbsp;  According to Christie and Anderson, the report said that there was zero germination.&nbsp;  However, the activists maintain that Iopa told the county grand jury, the Circuit Court, and the Hawaii Supreme Court that 6 to 9 percent of the seeds germinated.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"Our lawsuit underscores the new energy in the hemp movement," states Christie.&nbsp;  "We seek to make this the last marijuana trial in Hawaii."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Christie and Anderson are seeking $3 million in damages.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information on Christie and Anderson's lawsuit, please contact Roger Christie @ (808) 961-0488 or Attorney Steven Straus, Esq. @ (808) 969-6684.</I>

<CENTER><B>Canada Set To Lessen Pot Penalties</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 1, Toronto, Canada:</B>&nbsp;  A bill that will revamp the way Canada deals with marijuana has passed Parliament and is now in its final stages of becoming law.&nbsp;  Among the reforms included in the bill are a relaxing of the penalties associated with the possession of small amounts of marijuana.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"People charged with possession of less than 30 grams of marijuana or one gram of hash or hash oil will no longer be fingerprinted and they will have no criminal record," says Steve Jeffrey, a spokesman for Canada's Health Ministry.&nbsp;  "[However,] possession of the drug [will still] remain a crime," he warns.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">That aspect of bill C-7 troubles NORML Canada President Umberto Iorfida.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"[The law] almost doesn't mean anything to me if you still have to appear in court," he says.&nbsp;  Other less critical proponents of the bill view C-7 as striking a necessary balance between a liberalizing public attitude toward the drug and the fears of anti-drug groups and law enforcement.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Among the new marijuana sanctions proposed by the pending legislation are community service or payment of a fine.&nbsp;  Revenue raised through marijuana possession fines will be used to support marijuana related medical treatment programs and/or rehabilitation programs, notes Iorfida.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The new law is expected to take effect this spring.

<CENTER><B>NORML Establishes Amicus Curiae Committee</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In an effort to establish <B>NORML</B> as a more serious 
participant in the national debate over drug policy, <B>NORML</B> has re-established an amicus curiae ("friend of the court") committee to offer legal assistance in important marijuana related legal issues.&nbsp;  The committee will be co-chaired by <B>NORML</B> Legal Committee members Michael D. Cutler, Esq. of Boston, Massachusetts and C. Rabon Martin, Esq. of Tulsa, Oklahoma.  
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"An active <B>NORML</B> Amicus Committee will provide an avenue for 
<B>NORML</B> to once again add its organizational voice to some of the 
important legal issues of the day," says <B>NORML</B> Executive Director 
Keith Stroup, Esq.&nbsp;  "The committee will review requests that come into the national office for amicus assistance and will file an amicus brief with the court in the appropriate cases."&nbsp;  Many policy groups file amicus briefs in important and controversial legal cases as way to assist the court.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The first case before the new committee is a marijuana cultivation case involving the question of whether dead marijuana plants count as plants (with an assigned weight) or as actual marijuana (measured by actual weight).&nbsp;  The case (U.S. v Shields) is currently on appeal before the 11th Circuit.&nbsp;  The committee further intends on filing a second brief in the case of Seeley v Washington.&nbsp;  Defendant Ralph Seeley earlier won a declaratory judgment ruling that the state's ban on medical marijuana was unconstitutional.&nbsp;  The case is now going before the Washington 
State Supreme Court.

<CENTER><B>Indiana Supreme Court Rules On Constitutionality Of Illegal Drug 
Excise Tax</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>December 27, Indianapolis, Indiana:</B>&nbsp;  The Indiana Supreme 
Court has ruled that the state cannot tax illegal drugs and prosecute their owners too.&nbsp;  In the written opinion of the court, Chief Justice Randall T. Shepard maintained that to apply both civil and criminal penalties to drug cases would be a violation of the constitutional protections against double jeopardy.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, the high court also added that the assessment of the tax is a valid punishment when it is the "first jeopardy" -- that is, if it precedes criminal proceedings.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Responses to the ruling are widespread and some legal scholars are critical that the ruling will allow certain defendants to "buy" their way out of criminal sanctions.&nbsp;  Citing the court's suggestion that Revenue Department officials could consult with prosecutors to determine which action to take, Attorney Andrew Maternowski of Indianapolis worries that the 
state's particular punishment could depend on the defendant's financial standing.&nbsp;  "If you don't have money, you go to prison," he said.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Others feel that the ruling will encourage the state legislature to abolish the excise tax.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A similar "double jeopardy" ruling was recently issued in an Arizona trial court.&nbsp;  In that decision, a Northwest Phoenix Justice Court Judge dismissed marijuana charges against Arizona NORML Chairman Peter Wilson because he had previously paid the state tax on cannabis.

<CENTER><B>Despite "Colorful" Side Effects, FDA Panel Gives Thumbs Up To 
New Anti-Glaucoma Drug</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A Food and Drug Administration panel has approved a new type 
of anti-glaucoma drug even though it has the startling side effect of turning blue eyes brown.&nbsp;  "This could turn out to be a major public health hazard for glaucoma patients," noted Dr. Alexander Buckner of the University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;  The panel voted 4-2 to approve the new drug.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">National statistics indicate that glaucoma effects some 980,000 Americans a year.&nbsp;  Standard therapy in the treatment of glaucoma is the drug Timolol; however, physicians state that the drug has numerous side effects ranging from breathing problems to irregular heartbeats.  
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Medical marijuana proponents argue that the use of cannabis is an effective treatment in lowering inter-ocular pressure in individuals who suffer from open-angle glaucoma.&nbsp;  Advocates state that cannabis is both more effective and safer than other conventional treatments.

<p align="center">December 28, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b>USDA Issues &quot;White&quot; Paper On
Industrial Hemp: Report Concedes That American Hemp Cultivation
Isn't Likely Any Time Soon</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A recently released USDA &quot;white&quot; paper
indicates that the federal agency is currently exploring the
possibility of domestic hemp cultivation.&nbsp; The report notes
that a number of U.S. states reliant on the revenue raised
through tobacco farming have shown an interest in the possibility
of cultivating hemp as a way to compensate for slumping tobacco
sales.&nbsp; However, the report's conclusions demonstrate that
in spite of worldwide trends and renewed domestic interest in
hemp production, large-scale hemp cultivation will not begin in
the United States any time soon. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the report, the USDA insists that, &quot;Production
and processing trials [are] needed to establish the economic
viability of industrial hemp production [within the United
States.]&quot;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the report further notes that
neither can be permitted because &quot;legal issues currently preclude
[this] research&quot; from taking place.&nbsp; In sum the USDA
maintains that they cannot endorse the domestic production of
industrial hemp until field tests are conducted while
simultaneously noting that the DEA refuses to allow any actual
tests to take place. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moreover, the report states that the DEA remains &quot;opposed to
any consideration of hemp as a legitimate fiber or pulp
product.&quot;&nbsp; The DEA justifies this position, not on the
basis of any agricultural or economic evidence, but on &quot;the
perception that industrial hemp advocates have a hidden agenda of
favoring the legalization of marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; The report
further notes that current policy dictates &quot;that the White
House Drug Enforcement Office should be contact[ed] before USDA
staff attend meetings on industrial hemp or get involved with
research programs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;In essence, the federal government is allowing our nation's
policy toward an agricultural endeavor be determined -- not by an
agricultural agency -- but rather, by an anti-narcotics agency that
bases its reasoning upon the preconceived notion that any
advocacy of industrial hemp is also an endorsement of the
legalization of marijuana,&quot; states <b>NORML</b> Deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;For the American farmers
and businessmen who could potentially benefit from this growing
worldwide industry, the U.S. government's bias is unsupported and
truly shameful.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>An in depth look at the USDA report will be featured in the
forthcoming issue of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>'s Ongoing
Briefing.&nbsp; Copies of the 7 page report entitled
&quot;Industrial Hemp and other Alternative Crops for small-scale
Tobacco Producers,&quot; are presently available from </i><a
href="mailto:natlnorml@aol.com"><b><i>NORML</i></b></a>.</p>

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Colorado Senator Set To
Introduce Legislation Allowing For Hemp Cultivation In Colorado</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A Colorado bill that would allow for the
regulated cultivation of industrial hemp by Colorado farmers is
expected to be submitted to the state legislature in 1996.&nbsp;
The bill, sponsored by Senator Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn),
permits the planting of no more than forty acres of industrial
hemp in Colorado for agricultural, commercial, and scientific
research. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A similar bill was introduced by Sen. Casey in 1995 but was
defeated.&nbsp; (A complete story of the hearings surrounding
Casey's previous hemp bill appeared in the Spring 1995 issue of <b>NORML</b>'s
Active Resistance.) <br>

The sixth annual Florida Hempfest was marred by a greater police
presence than ever before and a record number of arrests --
including that of marijuana activist and legal medical marijuana
user, Elvy Musikka.&nbsp; Musikka, who is supplied by the federal
government with a monthly prescription of marijuana cigarettes to
treat her glaucoma, was dragged off the stage arm-and-arm by two
police officers after lighting one of her prescription &quot;joints&quot;
on stage. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Musikka was initially charged with possession of cannabis and

announced that the rally's organizers would take legal action

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 13, 1995, Boston, MA:</b>&nbsp; In
response to a December 1 rally held outside the offices of Boston
radio station WBCN to protest the airplay of the NORML benefit CD <a
href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">Hempilation</a>, the
National Writers Union and the Boston Coalition for Freedom of
Expression have issued statements condemning the actions of rally
organizers, the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both groups are highly critical of the overall nature of the
protest and specifically of the alleged use of state power and
finances to help institute the rally.&nbsp; Reports from the
December 1 gathering note that protesters arrived in state
vehicles, attendees were encouraged to &quot;bring their squad cars,&quot;
and an individual identified as a Boston liaison to the DEA
accompanied Georgette Wilson, Executive Director of the G.A.A.D.,
as she entered the station.&nbsp; &quot;These sort of actions,
when performed [and sponsored] by government agents, are
specifically [prohibited] by law,&quot; charges <a
href="mailto:billdown@usa1.com">Bill Downing</a>, president of <b>NORML</b>'s
Massachusetts chapter. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a letter to Governor William Weld from the National Writers
Union, Political Issues Chairman Robert B. Chatelle urges the
governor to demand Ms. Watson issue a formal apology for her
actions.&nbsp; The letter further urges Watson to &quot;pledge in
the future to abide by the laws [and] the U.S.
Constitution.&quot; If the executive director is unwilling to do
this, the National Writers Union suggests that Gov. Weld request
her resignation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We are concerned ... that you have not yet spoken out
against this abuse of power committed in your name,&quot;
Chatelle writes.&nbsp; &quot;The voters of the Commonwealth have
the right to hear from you about this disturbing event.&nbsp; I'm
sure you have no wish to advance your political career by trampling
on the inalienable rights of the people.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A press release issued by the Boston Coalition for Freedom of
Expression also casts stern consternation on the event and calls
the protest an &quot;astonishing example of the power of the
state riding roughshod over the Bill of Rights.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The news blackout on this matter, which should at the very
least result in the resignation of Ms. Watson and the
disciplining of the DEA agent who accompanied her into WBCN, is
almost as scandalous as the incident itself,&quot; concludes

Shirts That Parodied DARE Logo</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 8, 1995, Pomona, California:</b>&nbsp;
The Los Angeles County District Attorneys office dropped
charges against store-owner Mark Hornaday for selling T-shirts
parodying the DARE logo.&nbsp; Hornaday had been cited on a
complaint by DARE America for selling shirts bearing the DARE
logo with the statement: &quot;I turned in my parents and all I
got was this lousy T-shirt.&quot;&nbsp; He was charged under a
rarely used criminal law forbidding the counterfeiting of
copyrighted logos.&nbsp; Hornaday's T-shirts were also
confiscated. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hornaday was defended by <b>NORML</b> Legal Committee member
William Panzer, who argued that the law was unconstitutionally
broad in failing to distinguish between legitimate free speech
and intentionally deceptive marketing practices intending to
mislead customers.&nbsp; &quot;No one was going to think those
were really DARE T-shirts,&quot; argued Panzer. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Pomona assistant district attorney Richard Jenkins said that he
chose to dismiss the case because &quot;the people from DARE
would prefer that the [trade]mark be protected by a civil
action.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Since when does DARE call the shots at the DA's
office?&quot; Panzer replied sarcastically. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hornaday faced a maximum sentence of a year in jail and a $5,000
fine on four separate counts if convicted.&nbsp; It is unclear
whether DARE America intends to press further, civil litigation
against Hornaday. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 13, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Pronouncing the current administration's anti-drug policy to be
&quot;in utter disarray&quot; and citing recent findings that
indicate 48 percent of the high school class of 1995 has tried an
illegal drug, House and Senate Republicans have organized an
eighteen man task force to examine the drug issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's time to get tough with this stuff,&quot; said task
force co-chair, Orrin Hatch (R-UT).&nbsp; Hatch criticized the
nation's current anti-drug strategies as not focusing enough on
interdiction and law enforcement.&nbsp; The task force announced
that it will issue a report in March. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Recent studies demonstrate that drug use among high school
seniors is steadily climbing upward.&nbsp; The annual University
of Michigan study discovered that teen drug use rose for the
third year in a row, but cautioned that America's current
adolescent use rates still remain far below the peak period of
the late 1970s and early 1980s. <br>

State Senator John Moseley has pre-filed a bill (Senate Bill 573)
for the 1996 session of the Missouri General Assembly that would
provide certain marijuana users with a medical necessity
defense.&nbsp; Sen. Moseley is the former President of the

href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html"><b>Hempilation</b></a><b>,
WBCN, Draws Fire From National Writers Union, Boston Coalition
For Freedom Of Expression</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 13, 1995, Boston, MA:</b>&nbsp; In
response to a December 1 rally held outside the offices of Boston
radio station WBCN to protest the airplay of the <b>NORML</b>
benefit CD <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">Hempilation</a>,
the National Writers Union and the Boston Coalition for Freedom
of Expression have issued statements condemning the actions of
rally organizers, the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both groups are highly critical of the overall nature of the
protest and specifically of the alleged use of state power and
finances to help institute the rally.&nbsp; Reports from the
December 1 gathering note that protesters arrived in state
vehicles, attendees were encouraged to &quot;bring their squad cars,&quot;
and an individual identified as a Boston liaison to the DEA
accompanied Georgette Wilson, Executive Director of the G.A.A.D.,
as she entered the station.&nbsp; &quot;These sort of actions,
when performed [and sponsored] by government agents, are
specifically [prohibited] by law,&quot; charges Bill Downing,
president of <b>NORML</b>'s Massachusetts chapter. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a letter to Governor William Weld from the National Writers
Union, Political Issues Chairman Robert B. Chatelle urges the
governor to demand Ms. Watson issue a formal apology for her
actions.&nbsp; The letter further urges Watson to &quot;pledge in
the future to abide by the laws [and] the U.S.
Constitution.&quot;&nbsp; If the executive director is unwilling
to do this, the National Writers Union suggests that Gov. Weld
request her resignation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We are concerned ... that you have not yet spoken out
against this abuse of power committed in your name,&quot;
Chatelle writes.&nbsp; &quot;The voters of the Commonwealth have
the right to hear from you about this disturbing event.&nbsp; I'm
sure you have no wish to advance your political career by trampling
on the inalienable rights of the people.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A press release issued by the Boston Coalition for Freedom of
Expression also criticizes the event and calls the protest an
&quot;astonishing example of the power of the state riding
roughshod over the Bill of Rights.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The news blackout on this matter, which should at the very
least result in the resignation of Ms. Watson and the
disciplining of the DEA agent who accompanied her into WBCN, is
almost as scandalous as the incident itself,&quot; concludes
James D'Entremont, Director of the Boston coalition. <br>

Searches Of Bus Passengers To Be Illegal</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 7, 1995, Chicago, IL:</b>&nbsp; Civil
liberties proponents are claiming victory following an Illinois
Supreme Court decision to uphold a Champaign County Judge's
ruling that the police acted illegally by searching the bag of a
Greyhound Bus passenger. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Judge Harold Jensen granted a motion to suppress in the case of
Greyhound passenger Tim Besser.&nbsp; Besser was faced with drug
charges after a police search of bus passengers and their luggage
revealed Besser's suitcase to contain marijuana.&nbsp; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At the hearing, officers testified that they boarded the bus as
it pulled into the Urbana Station at 2:50 a.m.&nbsp; One officer
and his dog searched the luggage compartment and two other
officers questioned the bus passengers, ordering each to identify
their luggage.&nbsp; During the course of the trial, police
conceded that there was nothing suspicious about the bus or any
of its passengers.&nbsp; One officer further testified that he
knew the bus schedule by heart and added that such suspicionless
searches of busses were routine police procedure. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Consequently, by boarding the bus and detaining the passengers
without probable cause, the court ruled that Besser had been
unlawfully seized and searched.&nbsp; &quot;That kind of random
police work is a little offensive to me,&quot; Judge Jensen
remarked. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Besser was represented by <b>NORML</b> Legal Committee member,

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 1995, Traverse City, MI:</b>&nbsp; A <b>NORML</b>
chapter hoping to reduce marijuana penalties in Traverse City was
recently met with heavy opposition by local officials.&nbsp;
Following the announcement that the group plans to collect the
330 signatures necessary to put a new pot ordinance on the
ballot, city commission officials unanimously passed a resolution
asking residents not to sign the petition.&nbsp; The Traverse
City NORML petition sends the wrong message to teenagers,
Commissioner Shelly Kester said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Regardless of the resolution, area NORML President Bill Bustance
says he will have no problem gathering the necessary number of
signatures to bring the new marijuana ordinance to a public
vote.&nbsp; Last year, Bustance reportedly amassed more than
twice the needed amount of signatures on a similar
petition.&nbsp; However, the prior petition was rejected by the
commission because it allegedly conflicted with state law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bustance says that his current petition avoids last years legal
problems.&nbsp; His revised ordinance would make marijuana

Involving Firearms: Justices Rule Possessing A Weapon Not Enough
To Warrant Longer Sentences</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 7, 1995, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
In a unanimous decision that may open the door for the appeals of
hundreds of firearm convictions, the Supreme Court unanimously
ruled that a federal law mandating drug traffickers to receive an
additional five years in prison for using a firearm can only be
invoked when the defendant actively employs the weapon. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The decision struck down the convictions in two District cases in
which firearms were present but locked away during drug
dealing.&nbsp; In one incident, police discovered a pistol inside
a bag in a car trunk following a traffic stop that revealed 27
bags of cocaine.&nbsp; In the second case, an unloaded derringer
was discovered locked in a trunk of the defendant's bedroom
closet.&nbsp; The defendant had earlier sold crack cocaine to an
undercover officer in her apartment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Prior to the Court's ruling, many circuits courts had been
divided on how much &quot;use&quot; of a firearm is necessary to
invoke the additional mandatory minimum.&nbsp; A prior D.C.
Circuit of Appeals ruling stated that as long as the weapon is in
close proximity to the drugs or drug proceeds and is accessible,
the stiffer punishment could apply. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, after reviewing the law's language, the Supreme court
concluded that prosecutors must show active employment of the
firearm.&nbsp; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The definition of &quot;use&quot; said Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor &quot;is of such breadth that no role remains
for 'carry,&quot; which is also included in the statute.&nbsp;
&quot;Use&quot; does not include the mere placement of a gun
nearby for protection, she concluded.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Czar Leaves Post</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 12, 1995, Washington D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
President Clinton accepted &quot;with regret&quot; the resignation
of Dr. Lee Brown as head of the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy.&nbsp; A spokesman for the administration
says that a search for a successor is underway and maintained that
the President is as committed as ever to the battle against drug
abuse.&nbsp; &quot;[The war on drugs] will never be over until
every child in America knows that drug use is dangerous, illegal
and wrong,&quot; the President said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown is leaving his post as Drug Czar to take a teaching job at
Rice University in Houston.</p>

Americans Are Very Concerned About Illegal Drug Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 12, 1995, Miami, FL:</b>&nbsp;
Americans rate the use of illegal drugs as one of the nation's
greatest crises, second only to violent crime, indicates a Gallup
poll released this past Tuesday. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to results from the 1995 poll, 88 percent of the
nation's adults view illegal drugs as a serious problem --
ranking it ahead of such issues as the federal budget deficit and
health care costs.&nbsp; The survey also indicated that 93
percent of respondents favored more anti-drug education in public
schools and 85 percent opposed the idea of legalizing drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">White House Drug Czar Lee Brown, speaking at a conference in
Miami, commented that the results of the poll further
re-emphasize the need for a high-profile, well-funded national

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Arrests For 1994 Near Half Million
Mark: FBI Data Confirms Clinton's Marijuana War To Be Tougher
Than Bush's</b> </p>

<p align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">An estimated 481,098 total marijuana arrests were
made by state and local law enforcement during the year 1994,
according to the latest edition of the FBI's Uniform Crime
Report.&nbsp; This figure is a 26 percent increase over last
year's total and pushes the total number of marijuana arrests
under the Clinton administration to a staggering 861,788. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Of the 481,098 arrests made for marijuana in 1994, approximately
83.7 percent (402,717) were for simple
&quot;possession.&quot;&nbsp; The remaining 16.3 percent (78,381
arrests) were for &quot;sale/manufacture,&quot; a category that
includes all cultivation offenses -- even those where the marijuana
was being grown for personal use. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">&quot;This data confirms that the federal government's war on
marijuana consumers has gotten significantly tougher under
Clinton's regime,&quot; states <b>NORML</b>'s Deputy National
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;These new FBI statistics
indicate that one marijuana user is arrested eveiy 65 seconds in America.&nbsp;
Not surprisingly, those individuals who possess marijuana are
being hardest hit.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">According to annual data collected by the FBI, Clinton's two year
average of total marijuana arrests (430,894 arrests per year) is
27 percent higher than the average number of yearly arrests under
the Bush administration (338,998).&nbsp; &quot;The fact that
studies indicate adolescent use rates for marijuana are rising at
the same time that law enforcement is arresting record numbers of
users affirms <b>NORML</b>'s long-held belief that marijuana
prohibition is not an effective deterrent to marijuana
consumption,&quot; remarks St. Pierre. <br>

<p align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50"><b>December 4, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
The nation's prison population experienced its largest 1 year
increase ever bringing America's inmate population to a record

<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Since 1980, America's prison population has risen by over 300

To Purchase Legal Tax Stamps</b> </p>

<p align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50"><b>December 5, 1995, Phoenix, AZ:</b>&nbsp;
Following a recent Arizona court decision that rules a citizen
may legally possess and sell cannabis in Arizona if they possess
the proper state license and tax stamps to do so, marijuana
activists have been swarming to the state. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">According to reports from representatives of <a
href="http://www.amug.org/~az4norml/">AZ4NORML</a>, some
activists have even taken to openly selling marijuana in front of
the Arizona State Capital.&nbsp; Rich Davis, longtime hemp
activist and curator of the mobile USA Hemp Museum, recently sold
one gram bags of marijuana out in front of the Department of
Revenue in plain view of both capital and state police
officers.&nbsp; No arrests were made. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">A second well known activist, Ron Kiczenski, reports that he
intends to open America's first ever marijuana store.&nbsp;
&quot;This will be the first legal marijuana cigarette
company,&quot; he told <i>The Associated Press</i>.&nbsp;
&quot;It's legal to buy marijuana from anyone in the state.&nbsp;
You just have to pay the state tax within 24 hours of the
sale.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">The recent goings-on in Arizona stem from a ruling by Northwest
Phoenix Justice Court Judge John Barclay that dismissed charges
against Arizona NORML Chairman Peter Wilson because of evidence
that he is licensed by the state to sell marijuana.&nbsp; Basing
his decision on constitutional prohibitions against double
jeopardy, Judge Barclay concluded that Wilson could not be prosecuted
for possession of marijuana because of taxes he has paid to the
Arizona Depantnient of Revenue to sell cannabis.&nbsp; Under
Title 42 of a 1983 law, Arizona residents can purchase both a license
and tax stamps to possess and sell marijuana. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">State lawmakers contend that the legislation was intended solely
as a way to punish drug traffickers, not to legalize cannabis in
the state of Arizona.&nbsp; &quot;We're confident that [Judge
Barclay's] decision will be overturned,&quot; states Barnett
Lotstein, a special assistant with the Maricopa County Attorney's
Office.&nbsp; &quot;In the event it isn't, I'm sure the
Legislature would remedy that post haste.&quot; <br>

<p align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50"><b>Boston, Massachusetts, December 1, 1995:</b>&nbsp;
The Massachusetts based anti-drug group, Governor's Alliance
Against Drugs, in cooperation with representatives from the DEA

offices of WBCN Boston to voice their disapproval of the station
&quot;giving airtime&quot; to the <b>NORML</b> benefit CD, <a
href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">HEMPILATION</a>. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Alleging that <b>NORML</b> is poised to make &quot;millions&quot;
from the sale of the CD and further stating that &quot;WBCN is an
active participant of the pro-marijuana legalization effort in
Massachusetts,&quot; the G.A.A.D. issued a fax release
encouraging local law enforcement to attend the rally and
&quot;bring [their] squad car[s.]&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">According to representatives from Mass/Cann NORML, about 15
protesters showed up at the gathering and a report of the event
was broadcast on WCVB-TV Channel 3 News.&nbsp; Attendees were
shown carrying signs with slogans such as &quot;WBCN is bringing
the country to its knees&quot; and &quot;WBCN: Broadcasting
Capitalists for NORML.&quot;&nbsp; G.A.A.D. Executive Director
Georgette Wilson and Boston liaison for the Drug Enforcemant
Administration, Steve Morreale, were filmed entering WBCN's
offices as &quot;they went in to make their case to station

<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">WBCN reported to WCVB-TV that the station will continue to play
music off the <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">HEMPILATION</a>
CD.&nbsp; Later, in an MTV NEWS interview which aired December 6
and 7, WBCN's program director commented that: &quot;Music
shouldn't be blamed for social phenomena.&nbsp; Musicians have
the same right to free expression as other Americans.&quot;&nbsp;
The radio station offered Wilson an opportunity to air her
concerns over <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">HEMPILATION</a>
on WBCN's public forum show, but Wilson refused their invitation. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">In response to the action taken by the Governor's Alliance
Against Drugs against WBCN, Mass/Cann NORML is considering taking
legal action against the federal prohibitionist groups involved

<p align="center">November 13, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b>Congressman Barney Frank Introduces Federal
Legislation To Make Marijuana Available By Prescription</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; U.S. Representative
Barney Frank (D-MA) introduced a federal medical marijuana bill
in Congress on November 10 that would permit physicians to
prescribe marijuana to patients for a number of serious
illnesses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Frank medical use bill is modeled closely after a 1981
federal medical marijuana proposal co-sponsored at that time by
Rep. Newt Gingrich, now Speaker of the House, and three other Republicans.&nbsp;
The bill would reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule
II and would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services
to provide for controlled domestic cultivation to provide a legal
supply of medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although much more research is needed, it is clear from both
limited scientific data and rapidly accumulating anecdotal
evidence that marijuana is a valuable aid in reducing pain and
suffering for patients with a number of serious ailments, and
that it is less toxic and costly than the conventional medicines
for which it may be substituted. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marijuana is an effective means of overcoming the nausea and
vomiting induced by cancer chemotherapy as well as the nausea and
loss of appetite associated with the wasting syndrome of AIDS.&nbsp;
It is useful for various spastic conditions including multiple
sclerosis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia.&nbsp; It lowers
interocular pressure in people who suffer from open-angle
glaucoma.&nbsp; For some people with epilepsy, it is the only
anticonvulsant that works.&nbsp; It has been used for centuries as
an analgesic and its medical potential has been endorsed by both
the National Academy of Sciences and the Australian Commonwealth
Department of Human Services and Health.&nbsp; In 1988, DEA Chief
Administrative Law Judge Francis J. Young declared that marijuana
fulfilled the legal requirements for currently accepted medical
use in the United States, finding marijuana to be &quot;one of
the safest therapeutically active substances known to
man.&quot;&nbsp; His order was overruled, not by any medical
authority, but by the DEA itself. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Results from a recent poll conducted by the American Civil
Liberties Union demonstrate that 85 percent of the voting public
favor the medical use of marijuana.&nbsp; Thirty-six states have
adopted legislation facilitating the medical use of marijuana,
but none of these state measures can be implemented until
Congress amends the law.&nbsp; The introduction of Rep. Frank's
legislation provides Congress with that opportunity. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Many seriously ill patients in this country are already using
marijuana to reduce their pain and suffering, even though they
must risk arrest to obtain and use it.&nbsp; As a result,
informal &quot;buyer's clubs&quot; have formed in many cities to
supply marijuana to the seriously ill.&nbsp; Some of these clubs
are small and almost clandestine; a few, such as the one in San
Francisco, operate openly and serve several thousand clients on a
regular basis.&nbsp; The fact that thousands of seriously ill
Americans would risk arrest to obtain marijuana as a medicine
attests to the need for medical marijuana legislation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Harvard Professor Lester Grinspoon M.D., co-author of Marihuana,
the Forbidden Medicine (Yale University Press, 1993) says the
Frank medical marijuana bill &quot;is a compassionate and humane
proposal which would provide relief from pain and suffering to
thousands of seriously ill Americans.&nbsp; These are people with
life-threatening illnesses who cannot obtain relief with
available medication.&nbsp; It is both unscientific and
unconscionable for the federal government to continue to deny an
effective medication to these patients.&nbsp; Rep. Frank's
proposal would allow this decision to be made by the patient and
the treating physician.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>U.S. Sentencing Commission's Recommendations
Regarding Marijuana Weight Disparity Enacted Into Law: New
Legislation Could Affect Approximately 950 Imprisoned Marijuana
Growers</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 1, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Recommendations made by the U.S. Sentencing Commission this past
spring mandating a universal plant-weight ratio for marijuana was
enacted into law on November 1.&nbsp; The recommendation will be
retroactive and will affect an estimated 950 cases across the
nation dating back to 1989.&nbsp; Many of these prisoners will be
eligible for early release due to the amended guidelines;
however, Families Against Mandatory Minimum's (FAMM) spokesman
Jeff Stewart cautions that the decision to release an inmate
early still remains up to the discretion of each individual
judge.&nbsp; While it's true that nearly 1000 inmates will be affected
by the change, it does not necessarily follow that all of those
inmates will be immediately released, FAMM warns. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under the newly amended guidelines, each marijuana plant
cultivated will now be given a weight equivalent to 100 grams
regardless of the number of plants involved.&nbsp; In the past,
the 100 grams per plant measure was only mandated when a
defendant was convicted of possessing 49 plants or fewer. For
those convicted of harboring 50 plants or more, the weight
equivalent for each plant jumped to 1000 grams.&nbsp;
Consequently, defendants convicted for possessing 50 plants or
more faced sentences almost 3 times as long as those convicted
for 49 plants. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;To enhance fairness and consistency, this amendment adopts
the equivalency of 100 grams per marijuana plant for all
guidelines determinations,&quot; the commission stated.&nbsp; The
commission voted 7-0 in favor of the change. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A bill blocking the commission's recommendations was introduced
by U.S. Representative Jim Bunn (R-OR) in October, but Congress
failed to act on it. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Buchanan Flip-Flop-Flips On Medical
Marijuana Issue</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 4, 1995, Storm Lake, IA:</b>&nbsp;
When it comes to the issue of medical marijuana, presidential
hopeful Pat Buchanan just can't seem to make up his mind. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While fund-raising in Charlotte, NC this past summer, Buchanan
responded to a question posed by MAPS (Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic Studies) President Rick Doblin about
whether he would &quot;support the use of medical
marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; At that time, Buchanan stated that:
&quot;If a doctor indicated to his patient that this was the only
way to alleviate certain painful symptoms ... I would defer to
the doctor's judgment.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, when confronted with a similar question at a recent
gathering in Storm Lake, Iowa, Buchanan began singing a different
tune.&nbsp; When approached by a citizen and publicly asked about his
views on the medicinal use of marijuana, Buchanan said that he
felt that doctors should not be permitted to prescribe smoking
marijuana because of its destructive effect.&nbsp; Buchanan then
asked the man if he was with NORML.&nbsp; When the citizen
responded that he wasn't, but rather that he was &quot;terminally
ill patient ... [with] no hope and no treatment,&quot;&nbsp;
Buchanan suddenly flipped yet again on the issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If everything you say is true, and I choose to believe
you,&quot; Buchanan said, &quot;[then] I would support [your
decision to use marijuana as a medicine] in a second.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Idaho Supreme Court Rules That Employee Let
Go For Failing Drug Test<br>
Should Be Awarded Unemployment Benefits</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 27, 1995, Idaho:</b>&nbsp; In a
surprising 3-2 decision, the Idaho Supreme Court has ruled that
an employee who was fired after having tested positive for THC
should be eligible for unemployment benefits.&nbsp; In it's
written opinion, the Court concluded that: &quot;The record
presents substantial and competent evidence to support the
Commission's conclusion that Shearer [Lumber Products] failed to
communicate its expectations to [its employee, Steven]
Merriott.&nbsp; Shearer therefore could not require Merriott to
comply with uncommunicated expectations.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The &quot;uncommunicated expectations&quot; in this case had to
do with whether or not it was clear that Merriott's conduct while
off-duty could be construed as appropriate grounds for
dismissal.&nbsp; After testing positive for THC on a February 9,
1993, drug test, Merriott admitted that he had smoked marijuana
during his day off two days earlier.&nbsp; Merriott maintained
that he had not been intoxicated while on the job.&nbsp; He was
later fired on February 16, 1993, for violating Shearer Lumber
Products' substance abuse policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Upon analysis, the Court decided that although the company's
substance abuse policy prohibited employees &quot;from being
under the influence of any chemical substance or alcohol during working
hours,&quot; it did not make reference to what employees may or
may not do during non-working hours.&nbsp; &quot;The Commission
noted that Shearer presented no evidence that Merriott was impaired
while at work, nor was Merriott informed that use of controlled
substances during non-working hours would violate Shearer's
policy.&nbsp; Because there was no evidence that Merriott did not
comply with Shearer's communicated substance abuse policy, the
Commission concluded that Merriott was not discharged for
employment-related misconduct.&nbsp; ... [Therefore,] the Commission's
conclusion that Merriott is eligible for unemployment benefits is
affirmed.&quot; <br>

To Kill Proposed Ohio Bill That Allows Police To Sell Drugs</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 30, 1995, Cleveland, OH:</b>&nbsp;
Northcoast NORML has launched an educational campaign to inform
citizens about a proposed House Bill that would change Ohio's
long standing policy prohibiting law enforcement personnel from
selling less than the bulk amount of an illegal drug in reverse
sting operations.&nbsp; The bill (H.B. 125) is titled
&quot;Violations of the Drug Laws&quot; and is being sponsored by
State representative Jeff Jacobson (R-Dayton) by the request of
Montgomery County law enforcement officials. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Northcoast NORML is concerned about this proposed legislation for
various reasons.&nbsp; Most of all, NORML is worried that this
bill, if enacted into law, would shift the focus of Ohio's drug
war away from traffickers and onto small time users.&nbsp;
&quot;If the Senate passes House Bill 125, it will be open season
in Ohio for drug users,&quot; stated Northcoast NORML President
John Hartman.&nbsp; &quot;With the State prison system [already
operating] at over 170 percent capacity and many county jails bursting
at the seams, ... [it's clear that] we just don't need more drug
users in prison.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Northcoast NORML also notes that a change in the law could cause
law enforcement personnel to unintentionally add to the drug
problem in Ohio. Hartman notes that an October 25, 1994, Orange
County Register article (Defense Wants Crack Cases Killed, Peter
M. Gollner) reported that 42 percent of the people who bought
drugs from undercover officers got away with the police
manufactured drugs. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Smoke Study Demonstrates
Waterpipes To Be Ineffective</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 24, 1995, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Preliminary findings from a recent study on marijuana smoke
indicate that waterpipes offer smokers little protection against
the harmful tars found in cannabis. The study was sponsored by
California NORML and MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for
Psychedelic Studies) and its findings were released in a
California NORML press release. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the release, &quot;The reason [for this startling
result] appears to be that waterpipes filter out more of
marijuana's main psychoactive ingredient,
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), than they do other,
non-psychoactive, harmful tars.&nbsp; [Hence] users [of
waterpipes are required] to consume more noxious smoke in order
to reach their desired high.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The study, which was supported by the Drug Policy Foundation and
private donors, carefully analyzed the solid tar and THC content
of marijuana smoke from six separate devices.&nbsp; These devices
included a regular joint, a cigarette filter, three different
waterpipes, and two vaporizers (devices designed to evaporate the
THC from the marijuana with minimal smoke.)&nbsp; The performance
of each device was rated according to how effectively it reduced
the concentration of tar relative to THC.&nbsp; (THC, unlike the
tars in marijuana, is not carcinogenic.) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Surprisingly, the unfiltered joint yielded less tar per THC than
did either the cigarette filter or any of the waterpipes that
were tested.&nbsp; Results regarding the performance of the
vaporizers were mixed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;While the study results suggest waterpipes may be
counterproductive, sponsors caution that it is still premature to
conclude that they are actually harmful to health,&quot;
California NORML summarizes.&nbsp; &quot;This is because the
study did not analyze the non-solid vapor phase of marijuana smoke,
which contains a number of gasses known to be harmful to
health.&nbsp; If waterpipes help screen out these gasses, they
might be beneficial to health.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Czar Urges High School Coaches To Drug
Test Student Athletes</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 20, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Speaking before both national and DC area middle and high school
coaches, Drug Czar Lee Brown once again called for the drug
testing of high school athletes.&nbsp; Proclaiming that school
athletes are both &quot;role models&quot; and &quot;trend
setters&quot; for the student body, Brown encouraged schools and
coaches across the country to institute programs that would
subject athletes to random drug testing.&nbsp; &quot;If we can
make real headway in turning student athletes away from drugs, I
believe we can succeed with the entire population of young people,&quot;
Brown explained. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Ironically, Brown admitted during Friday's speech that,
&quot;There is no reason to think that drug use is any more
prevalent among student athletes than among young people
generally.&quot;&nbsp; Nevertheless, Brown wholeheartedly spoke
out in favor of policies that encourage student athletes to be
tested.&nbsp; &quot;My message for coaches and all school
administrators and teachers is this,&quot; Brown concluded,
&quot;You have important tools available to you, but first you've
got to get off the sidelines and into the game.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a decision advocated and publicly embraced by the Clinton
Administration, the Supreme Court this past June upheld a
Washington state middle school policy that authorized the random testing
of student athletes, without cause or suspicion of drug
use.&nbsp; At that time, Brown called the Court's ruling a
&quot;victory for kids.&quot; <br>

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The press release, featured in the October edition of TeleCard

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 1995:</b>&nbsp; <em>Great Events
Monthly</em>, a bi-monthly newspaper edited by Jack Anderson, has
devoted its September/October edition to analyzing the pros and
cons of the &quot;War On Drugs.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Posing the question of whether to &quot;legalize&quot; drugs or
&quot;escalate&quot; enforcement, the special issue explores both
sides of the drug issue and features articles by a variety of
authors including syndicated columnist Doug Bandow and DEA
Administrator Thomas Constantine.&nbsp; The issue also includes
two feature articles on the subject of medical marijuana.&nbsp;
The first, written by the Oklahoma City chapter of NORML
describes the plight of Jimmy Montgomery, the paraplegic medical
marijuana user who was sentenced to serve 10 years in prison for
less than two ounces of cannabis.&nbsp; (Thanks in large part to
hundreds of phone calls and letters from the media and <b>NORML</b>
activists, Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating signed for
Montgomery's medical release in late July.)&nbsp; The second
article focuses on both medical marijuana user Todd McCormick and
the ongoing legal battle for federal rescheduling reforms. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML</b>'s contribution to the publication includes a full
page chart outlining the responses of two widely respected
doctors when asked to rank drugs on the basis of five problem
areas.&nbsp; (These areas are withdrawal, reinforcement,
tolerance, dependence, and intoxication.)&nbsp; Both Dr. Jack E.
Henningfield of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and Dr. Neal
L. Benowitz of The University of California at San Francisco
ranked marijuana as the least serious drug.&nbsp; Both doctors determined
marijuana to be less serious than caffeine. <br>

That Cancer Patient Should Be Allowed To Use Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 13, 1995, Tacoma, WA:</b>&nbsp; In a
decision that may be a first for the nation, Superior Court Judge
Rosanne Buckner has ruled that a cancer patient's need to use
marijuana as medicine overrides the state's interest in outlawing
its prescription. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Defendant Ralph Seeley--a former journalist, lawyer, and cancer
patient--accomplished what no one else has done in a quarter
century of attempts.&nbsp; Seeley filed a declaratory judgment
action in Pierce County Superior Court, asking for a ruling that
the State's Constitution's reliance on &quot;fundamental
principles&quot; requires that marijuana be available as a
prescription substance.&nbsp; This past Friday, the Honorable
Judge Buckner agreed.&nbsp; A final order is being prepared. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I think, practically speaking, the effect [of this ruling]
is to put prosecutions for medical marijuana use on hold,&quot;
Seeley said.&nbsp; During the court proceedings, Seeley's moving
argument contained numerous references to his own experiences as
a cancer patient, forced to choose between breaking the law or
enduring unbearable suffering.&nbsp; Seeley has undergone eight
surgeries on his spine, two lung surgeries--including the removal
of one lung--radiation, and several bouts of chemotherapy.&nbsp;
He faces another surgery next month. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Jeffrey Steinborn, a Seattle lawyer who has represented a number
of clients in medical marijuana cases, called the ruling
significant.&nbsp; &quot;I think it's going to open the door to a
new wave of attempts to make this a legitimate medicine,&quot;
commented Steinborn, who is a friend of Seeley's.&nbsp; &quot;There's
a crack in the door now, a crack in the shell and I think it's
going to spread.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is monstrous to say [that] this substance cannot be used
as a medicine by people who are dying,&quot; Steinborn
concluded.&nbsp; &quot;I challenge any federal official to come
and debate the wisdom of this.&quot; <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 16, 1995, Sacramento CA:</b>&nbsp;
California Governor Pete Wilson vetoed a bill (A.B. 1529) by
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos to allow for the prescribed medical
use of marijuana by the sick and terminally ill.&nbsp; The
legislation would have provided for the controlled compassionate use
of marijuana for those individuals diagnosed by a physician to be

Wilson has vetoed a medical marijuana proposal. <br>

General's Office.&nbsp; Marijuana activist and head of
Californians for Compassionate Use, Dennis Peron, will be directing
the initiative drive. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The initiative maintains that any patients who possess a valid
doctor's recommendation should be allowed to use marijuana as a
therapeutic agent without fear or risk of prosecution.&nbsp; The initiative
also allows citizens to cultivate their own marijuana for
personal use and encourages state and federal governments to
establish a program that will provide for a safe and affordable
method of distribution.&nbsp; This coalition has 150 days to
collect 600,000 signatures. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Using patients as pawns is not right,&quot; declared Anna
Boyce, RN, in response to the governor's action.&nbsp; Boyce is
president of the petition drive as well as an elected member of
the California Senior Legislature.&nbsp; &quot;Marijuana helps
people who are suffering; it is being denied to them for purely political
reasons and that must change.&quot; <br>

Showbiz Today, a regular half hour program on CNN, featured a
segment on the growing controversy surrounding the release of HEMPILATION:
Freedom Is NORML.&nbsp; HEMPILATION is the first ever major
release devoted solely to the &quot;wonders of weed.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The approximately two minute news segment featured positive

Both Moore and Cypress Hill are featured on the CD. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The CNN piece also featured criticism from David Chamberlain of
the Washington DC-based Family Research Council.&nbsp; Stating
that be hoped that Capricorn Records would abandon the project,
Chamberlain commented that he felt the CD would encourage
teenagers to try marijuana. <br>

In a ruling that could cast doubt upon the legality of many

dismissed charges against a man who was arrested after a state
trooper reportedly smelled marijuana and then demanded that the
defendant &quot;hand it over.&quot;&nbsp; In the court's view,
the officer's phrase: &quot;hand it over&quot; was not a choice,

A coalition of AIDS activists, cancer survivors, seniors, nurses,

with the California Attorney General's Office.&nbsp; The
initiative was filed in response to Governor Pete Wilson's
expected veto of bill AB 1529.&nbsp; (This legislation would
provide for the controlled compassionate use of marijuana for
those individuals diagnosed by a physician to be suffering from
the diseases of AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and multiple
sclerosis.)&nbsp; Wilson previously vetoed similar bills in both
1993 and 1994. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The initiative maintains that those patients who possess a valid

Use Of Heat Sensing Equipment<br>
To Be Unconstitutional</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 4, 1995, Denver, CO:</b> The following
is an excerpt from a Reuters news brief: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    It is unconstitutional for police and drug enforcement agents
    to scan homes with heat-sensing equipment to detect criminal
    activity without a warrant, the federal appeals court in
    Denver ruled Wednesday. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    The decision came in a case which law enforcement officers in
    Wyoming obtained a search warrant, and later a conviction,
    after using a thermal imager to gather evidence that
    marijuana was being grown in a home. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears cases from a
    six state region [Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico,
    Kansas, and Oklahoma], ruled 3-0 that police must obtain a
    search warrant before using such equipment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    &quot;We reject the government's contention that its
    technical wizardry should free it from the restraints
    mandated by the Fourth Amendment,&quot; the court said.&nbsp;
    It noted that the government denies thermal imagers intrude
    upon privacy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    The court said four federal appeals courts in other circuits
    have ruled the opposite way, that warrants are not needed
    before police use thermal imagers.

York Times Editorial Lashes Out At The Drug War</b> 

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 7, 1995, New York, NY:</b> Citing
statistics from a recently released Sentencing Project report,
The New York Times denounced the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; in a
Saturday editorial. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Noting that current data indicates that one in three black men
between the ages of 20 and 29 are involved somewhere in the
criminal justice system (either prison, pre-trial detention, on probation
or on parole), the Op-ed argues that the &quot;War on Drugs&quot;
is rounding up a &quot;disproportionate&quot; number of black
Americans.&nbsp; In support of this notion, the editorial noted
that &quot;during the early 1990's, at a time when
African-Americans accounted for only 13 percent of monthly drug
users, African-Americans were involved in 35 percent of the
arrests for drug possession, 55 percent of the convictions and 74
percent of the prison sentences. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although the editorial never spoke out in favor of legalization,
it did assert that America &quot;need[s] to rethink both drug and
punishment policies.&quot;&nbsp; These latest figures, the Times
concluded, &quot;should set off alarm bells from the White House
to city halls--and help reverse the notion that we can
incarcerate our way out of fundamental social problems. <br>

Sandusky County NORML<br>
With Indictments</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 30, 1995, Fremont, OH:</b> A
September 22 weekend rally put on by the Sandusky County Chapter
of NORML has stirred up more than just controversy following an
announcement by Sheriff David Gangwer that he had undercover
agents infiltrate the event. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am disappointed with the actions of this sheriff,&quot;
said Sandusky County NORML Chapter President, Tomas
Salazar.&nbsp; &quot;This is a direct attack on NORML and we are
being targeted for our beliefs.&nbsp; This is a violation of our
Constitutional right to assemble.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gangwer claims that the information and evidence gathered by his
agents will eventually be turned over to the Sandusky County
Prosecutor and state officials.&nbsp; The evidence could warrant the
need for a special grand jury to seek criminal indictments
against NORML, he added.&nbsp; Gangwer would not discuss what
charges were being considered. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;At the very least we hope the information we gathered will
prevent this from ever happening in this county or in this state
again,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Don't bet on it, claims Salazar, who is already preparing to
organize another Harvest Festival next year.&nbsp; &quot;I can't
see anything that they can charge NORML with,&quot; he
contends.&nbsp; &quot;NORML has always acted responsibly in all
of their events ... and I expect there will be no
indictments.&nbsp; This is harassment.&quot;&nbsp; Salazar added
that organizers required all attendees to sign a release
affirming that they would not engage in any illegal activities
during the course of the festival.&nbsp; The release also required
attendees to indicate that they were not an undercover law
enforcement official. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We have a right to socialize and that's what we did,&quot;
Salazar concluded. &quot;We never expected the big brouhaha that
was made out of it.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Prohibition Establishment Attacks NORML
&amp; Capricorn Records<br>
For The Debut Of The Long-Awaited HEMPILATION Release</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 26, Nashville, TN &amp; Washington,
D.C.:</b>&nbsp; Last week marked the first time ever that a major
recording label has released a benefit compilation of popular
musicians that will benefit the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML).&nbsp; Available in music stores around
the nation, Capricorn Records' HEMPILATION contains major music
recording stars: Blues Traveler, The Black Crowes, Cypress Hill,
Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers, Gov.'t Mule and twelve other
musical acts. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We want people to think about freedom,&quot; explains Allen
St. Pierre of NORML.&nbsp; &quot;This is why the CD's subtitle is
'Freedom is NORML'.&nbsp; Participating artists view HEMPILATION
as a permanent, musical means of expressing their joint concerns
about the unfair restriction on Americans' civil liberties posed
by long standing government anti-marijuana efforts and a public statement
of their support for NORML. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On September 29, the Associated Press (AP) reported that
extremist anti-marijuana groups have already vowed to protest
HEMPILATION'S release.&nbsp; Devout prohibitionist Joseph
Califano, head of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse
(CASA) at Columbia University, told AP, &quot;Why anyone would
want to take something that's dangerous and damaging and
encourage children to use it is beyond me.&quot;&nbsp; NORML's
Allen St. Pierre responds: &quot;I wish that Mr. Califano would
stop misrepresenting NORML's mission statement.&nbsp; For 25
years NORML has never advocated that anyone, especially children,
should use marijuana.&nbsp; NORML advocates that adults should
not face criminal or civil penalties for the use and possession
of marijuana in their homes.&nbsp; If Mr. Califano is truly
concerned about the welfare of today's children and 'pro-drug'
messages in our society, I strongly suggest that Mr. Califano
should begin by loudly advocating the prohibition of the
semi-pornographic beer commercials that litter professional and
collegiate sporting events aired on television.&nbsp; It's clear
that alcohol and tobacco are, by any measure, the two drugs that
Mr. Califano and his group should be focusing on.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Other prohibition groups such as the Atlanta-based Parents
Resources and Information on Drug Education (PRIDE) and the
Washington, D.C.-based Family Research Council have indicated
that they would like to force this music off the market in a way
similar to their attempts to ban explicit rap music. <br>

three-year legal struggle to allow citizens of Canada to have the
freedom to purchase and read literature that describes or depicts
&quot;illicit drug use&quot; has been won by Umberto Iorfida of
Canada NORML.&nbsp; In a letter to Iorfida's attorney, The
Attorney General (Ministry of Justice) indicates that the
Canadian government has decided not to appeal the decision handed
down on October 4, 1994 by the then Ontario Supreme Court [now
called the Ontario Court of Justice, General Division].&nbsp;
That decision removed from the Criminal Code offensive language
that made &quot;literature&quot; such as: NORML publications,
High Times magazine, HEMP BC catalogs, Jack Herer's &quot;The
Emperor Wears No Clothes&quot; and a myriad of other popular
published works illegal in Canada. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Madame Justice Ellen McDonald determined the inclusion of
&quot;literature&quot; in the Criminal Code to be inconsistent
with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms [The equivalent to the

and democratic society. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">With this case finally put to rest, Iorfida and NORML Canada are

800 Pounds Of Marijuana</b> 

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 20, Columbia, MO:</b>&nbsp; The
State of Missouri recently purchased 800 pounds of hemp,
otherwise known as marijuana through the Missouri affiliate of
NORML.&nbsp; The hemp is in the form of four 200 pound bales
which are being used as part of an exhibit at the Visitors'
Center of the Battle of Lexington State Historic Site.&nbsp; The
bales were made to the specifications of the Historic Site. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Battle of Lexington (also known as the Battle of the Hemp
Bales) took place in September of 1861.&nbsp; Approximately 3000
federal soldiers from Chicago looted the bank and created a makeshift
earthwork fort.&nbsp; Twenty thousand Missouri volunteers engaged
the federal troops.&nbsp; A three day siege of the fort led to a
stand-off until the Missourians had the idea of using the
recently harvested hemp bales as a moving defense. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">With water soaked hemp bales (to prevent the fire red hot
grapeshot from burning the hemp bales), the Missourians, firing
over the hemp bales, rolled them forward toward the fort and
carried the day, defeating the federal troops. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Missouri NORML Coordinator Dan Viets, said, &quot;NORML is proud
to be of service to The State of Missouri in this regard and

Include &quot;Publications&quot; As Drug Paraphernalia</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 19, Octorara, PA:</b>&nbsp; By a 6-2
vote, the Octorara Area School Board adopted a policy that
enables school officials to suspend students for 10 days and
notify local police if student is caught on school grounds with &quot;publications
about drugs&quot; wrote a report in The Intelligencer Journal
(IJ). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to school administrators, the policy is needed because
&quot;publications ... brought to school have dealt with how to
grow marijuana and manufacture hallucinogenic drugs,&quot;
reported The New Era newspaper. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While the vote to adopt the policy prevailed, strong opposition
was voiced by School Board Member John Addyman who was quoted in
the IJ as saying, &quot;I have a real problem saying a publication
should be banned.&quot;&nbsp; Addyman said when he took a seat on
the school board he swore to uphold the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp;
&quot;That Constitution guarantees the right of free
speech,&quot; Addyman said.&nbsp; William Iacone, director of
special services, said administrators hope to target publications which
promote drugs by telling how to cultivate, buy, sell, use or
manufacture illegal drugs --and in some case, where to get
them.&nbsp; &quot;This is not freedom of speech,&quot; Iacone
said to the IJ. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Also opposing the new policy was school board attorney, Alan
Jarvis.&nbsp; He told the IJ that publications are &quot;a tender
area&quot; of the law and cautioned the board on calling publications
drug paraphernalia.&nbsp; He said the policy might be
challenged.&nbsp; Despite Mr. Jarvis' reservations of the legality
of the board's actions, other board members chimed in: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    - &quot;Leave it in [the policy change] and be
    challenged,&quot; said board member Sam Gasnow.&nbsp;
    &quot;That's what's right.&quot;&nbsp; Gasnow also asserted
    that students &quot;have no First Amendment rights in the
    classroom.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    - Board member Lawrence Gibbs [who supports the change in

<p align="center"><b>The Dutch Government Modifies Its Drug
Policy<br>
Pressure Felt From Neighboring Countries</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 25, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; The
Dutch government announced some revisions of their progressive
drug policy at a news conference held at the National Press
Club.&nbsp; State-Secretary for the Interior, Jacob Kohnstamm, presented
to the U.S. press (what little there was assembled! -ed.] a list
of changes that the Dutch government are seeking to implement in
the coming years.&nbsp; While some of these changes may be viewed
by some as an abdication by the Dutch of the progressive drug
policies established in the 1970's, Secretary Kohnstamm was quick to
point out that The Netherlands is not abandoning its defacto
legalization of small amounts of cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Due to strong pressure from its neighboring countries (especially
France), The Netherlands seek to compromise with its neighbors
while still championing the social, public health, and criminal justice
benefits that it believes its drug policy presents. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Secretary Kohnstamm indicated that policy changes concerning
cannabis are: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The sale of cannabis products in &quot;coffee shops&quot;
    will be reduced from 30 grams per purchase to 5 grams, <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -There will be a 50% reduction of the number of &quot;coffee
    shops&quot;, <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The state will begin to combat the large-scale production of
    cannabis in the Netherlands, <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The Netherlands will also seek to establish a more active
    policy on the deportation of &quot;drug tourists&quot; and
    addicts residing illegally in the Netherlands. 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mr. Kohnstamm reiterated that the citizens and the government of
the Netherlands strongly support their drug policy.&nbsp; When
asked by an American reporter, &quot;Why don't the Dutch adopt a drug
policy similar to America's war on drugs approach?&quot; Mr.
Kohnstamm said that such a policy is considered a complete
failure in the minds of the Dutch.&nbsp; He cited the latest
statistics from both the U.S. and the Netherlands concerning the
prevalence of cannabis use amongst teens to make his case. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the Netherlands (where cannabis sales are tolerated) the rate
of teens admitting to using cannabis is: 

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    Ever using cannabis = 13% <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    Last 30 days = 6% <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    As compared to the United States (where there is a total
    prohibition on cannabis): <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Legislature &quot;Just Says
No&quot; To Unpopular Marijuana Law</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 15, 1995, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
California Governor and possible Presidential nominee Pete Wilson
suffered a major defeat when the Republican controlled California
Assembly rejected his last ditch effort to renew the state's
&quot;Smoke a Joint, Lose Your License&quot; law.&nbsp; The controversial
legislation requires that the state impose a six-month drivers
license suspension upon conviction of any drug offense,
regardless of whether the offense is driving related.&nbsp; The
law will expire on the 2nd of December. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Looming heavy over the head of the California Assembly's decision
to dissolve the &quot;Smoke a Joint&quot; legislation is the
issue of federal mandates.&nbsp; Because Wilson initially pushed
for the license suspension law by co-sponsoring a 1990 federal
mandate requiring the state to either enact the legislation or
pass an &quot;opt-out&quot; resolution explicitly rejecting the
policy, California now stands at risk of losing nearly $100
million in federal highway aid.&nbsp; Ironically, in recent
years, Wilson has been an outspoken proponent against the
legitimacy of federal mandates. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile, Governor Pete Wilson Expects To
Veto Medical Marijuana Bill<br>
For Third Consecutive Year</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 12, 1995, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
For the third time in as many years, the California State
Assembly has voted in favor of a bill that would allow for the
medical use of marijuana by the sick and terminally ill.&nbsp;
However, sources close to the governor claim that Wilson will
once again veto the proposed legislation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill, AB 1529, would provide for the controlled compassionate
use of marijuana for those individuals diagnosed by a physician
to be suffering from the diseases of AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and
multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; In addition, this revised version of
the bill is worded in such a way so that it expressly avoids
conflicting with current federal policies prohibiting use of the
drug.&nbsp; (Wilson cited these policies as the basis for last
year's veto.)&nbsp; Despite the revision, however, a spokesman
for Wilson told the <em>San Diego Union Tribune</em> that the
governor &quot;hates&quot; the bill.&nbsp; AB 1529 is supported by
both the California Nurses Association and the California Senior
Legislature. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to claims that Wilson will veto the measure, the
bill's author, Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose), has
blasted the governor as being more concerned with politics than with
human suffering.&nbsp; &quot;In a free society, people who are
ill shouldn't be made criminals to alleviate their pain,&quot;
said Vasconcellos.&nbsp; &quot;Wilson is engaging in politics of
pain.&nbsp; That's pathetic.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on bill AB 1529, please contact Dale
Gieringer of California NORML @ (415) 563-5858 or contact Dennis

the 600,000 signatures necessary to place this measure on the
1996 statewide ballot.&nbsp; This initiative is set to be filed
with the Attorney General's Office for title and summary on

<p align="center"><em><b>New York Times</b></em><b> Runs Feature
On Todd McCormick Bust</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 17, 1995, Bryan, 0H:</b>&nbsp; The <i>New
York Times</i> featured a major story on the case of medical
marijuana user Todd McCormick in the national edition of this
week's Sunday paper.&nbsp; The Times is the second nationally
syndicated paper to publicize McCormick's legal battle since his arrest
on July 18.&nbsp; USA Today referred to McCormick in an August 21
editorial supporting the use of medicinal marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick was arrested this past July when Ohio State Patrolmen
discovered in excess of thirty pounds of marijuana in his
van.&nbsp; He is currently free on bail and staying with Don
Wirtshafter at the Ohio Hempery since having his bail dropped at
a September 7 bail reduction bearing.&nbsp; McCormick maintains
that the cannabis found in his vehicle, all of which was visibly
marked &quot;for medicinal use only,&quot; was intended to be
used to establish a Compassionate Use Club in Rhode Island and
was not meant for sale.&nbsp; He is charged with four felony drug
counts. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When asked to comment on the McCormick case, John A. Mutter,
president of the 3000 member American Judge's Association, told
the <i>New York Times</i> that: &quot;It strikes me as being incongruous
that a doctor can prescribe for the well being of his patients
narcotic drugs like morphine that are habit forming, but they
can't prescribe marijuana.&quot; <br>

Spell Victory<br>
For McCormick's Upcoming Trial</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 10, 1995, Columbus, OH:</b>&nbsp;
Civil liberty and personal privacy proponents achieved a major
victory last week when the Ohio Supreme Court ruled to severely
limit the rights of police to question citizens or search their
property after misdemeanor roadside traffic stops.&nbsp; Northcoast
NORML President John Hartman applauded the court's ruling.&nbsp;
&quot;People in the cannabis community will be driving a little
easier [now] in the state of Ohio,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a 4-3 decision, the court struck down the drug arrest of a man
whose car was searched following a routine traffic stop.&nbsp;
The court maintained that the evidence seized during the search was
invalid because the search itself was in violation of the Fourth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp; According to the AP,
&quot;The court said that although the driver gave his consent,
the search was improper because the deputy never told the driver
[that] he was free to go after the traffic stop and before the
drug search began.&quot;&nbsp; The law states that police cannot
automatically search a car based upon a traffic misdemeanor. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Defense attorney Harry R. Reinhart praised the ruling.&nbsp; He
explained that hundreds of innocent Ohio motorists are stopped
each year by police and intimidated into having their automobiles searched
because law enforcement officials purposely neglect to inform
citizens of their legal right to say no. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">One can only wait and see what potential ramifications this
decision may have on Todd McCormick's upcoming trial.&nbsp;
McCormick had his van searched after Ohio State Patrolmen pulled him
over &quot;because the curtains in [his] van were
closed.&quot;&nbsp; McCormick maintains that he did not give
police permission to search his vehicle. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Latest National Household Survey Results
Sound Marijuana Alarm (Again)</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 12, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Speaking at a formal press conference, both Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Drug Czar Lee Brown took
time out to once again urge Americans to denounce the use of
marijuana.&nbsp; &quot;Marijuana use is illegal, dangerous,
unhealthy, and wrong,&quot; Shalala reaffirmed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Armed with preliminary estimates from the 1994 National Survey on
Drug Abuse, the duo remarked that while overall illicit drug use
(defined as once in the past month) among the population as a
whole rose only marginally in the past year, the number of
teenagers using marijuana has nearly doubled since 1992.&nbsp;
&quot;Anyone who thinks we've licked the drug problem in this
country is living in a fantasy land,&quot; the Secretary remarked
at the press conference. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the study's preliminary findings, teens using
marijuana at least once a month rose from 4% in 1992 to 7.3% in
1994.&nbsp; Shalala called the findings &quot;a wake-up call for
America.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Put in historical context, however, the latest adolescent use
statistics still remain far below the peak reached in 1980.&nbsp;
According to annual studies conducted by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse, the number of high school seniors ever having
admitted to experimenting with marijuana dropped significantly
from 50.9 percent in 1980 to 38.2 percent in 1994.&nbsp; Although
neither Brown nor Shalala mentioned this data during the
conference, the Office of National Drug Control Policy did
specify that even with the recent increase in the number of
teenagers admitting to having used marijuana regularly, current
adolescent rates of marijuana use still rank well below what they
were fifteen years ago. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown speculated that the latest increase in teen marijuana
consumption might be due to pot's glamorization by the
entertainment industry. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Todd McCormick Free On Bail!</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 7, 1995, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; At a
September 7 bail reduction hearing, medical marijuana user and
San Diego Compassionate Use Club founder Todd McCormick had his
bail dropped from $50,000 to $2,000.&nbsp; He posted bail at
approximately 4:55 p.m. the following day and is currently
staying with Don Wirtshafter at the Ohio Hempery in Guysville. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick was arrested on July 18 when Ohio State Patrolmen
discovered in excess of thirty pounds of marijuana in his
van.&nbsp; McCormick maintains that the cannabis, all of which
was visibly marked &quot;for medicinal use only,&quot; was
intended to be used to establish a Compassionate Use Club in
Rhode Island and was not meant for sale.&nbsp; He is charged with
four felony drug counts. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile, Landmark State Decision Could
Spell Victory<br>
For McCormick's Upcoming Trial</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 10, 1995, Columbus, OH:</b>&nbsp;
Civil liberty and personal privacy proponents achieved a major
victory last week when the Ohio Supreme Court ruled to severely
limit the rights of police to question citizens or search their
property after misdemeanor roadside traffic stops.&nbsp; Northcoast
NORML President John Hartman applauded the court's ruling.&nbsp;
&quot;People in the cannabis community will be driving a little
easier [now] in the state of Ohio,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a 4-3 decision, the court struck down the drug arrest of a man
whose car was searched following a routine traffic stop.&nbsp;
The court maintained that the evidence seized during the search was
invalid because the search itself was in violation of the Fourth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp; According to the AP,
&quot;The court said that although the driver gave his consent,
the search was improper because the deputy never told the driver
[that] he was free to go after the traffic stop and before the
drug search began.&quot;&nbsp; The law states that police cannot
automatically search a car based upon a traffic misdemeanor. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Defense attorney Harry R. Reinhart praised the ruling.&nbsp; He
explained that hundreds of innocent Ohio motorists are stopped
each year by police and intimidated into having their automobiles searched
because law enforcement officials purposely neglect to inform
citizens of their legal right to say no. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">One can only wait and see what potential ramifications this
decision may have on Todd McCormick's upcoming trial.&nbsp;
McCormick had his van searched after Ohio State Patrolmen pulled him
over &quot;because the curtains in [his] van were
closed.&quot;&nbsp; McCormick maintains that he did not give
police permission to search his vehicle. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Distinguished Chicago Judge Advocates
Marijuana Legalization</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 14, 1995, Chicago, IL:</b>&nbsp;
Richard Posner, Chicago's chief federal appeals judge and one of
America's most prominent legal scholars, recommends that
marijuana use should be legalized as a way of reducing crime and
unclogging the courts.&nbsp; Posner, a Reagan administration appointee
once heralded by American Lawyer magazine as &quot;the most
brilliant judge in the country,&quot; is the highest ranking
judge to ever publicly advocate the repeal of marijuana
laws.&nbsp; His endorsement of marijuana reform was the focus of
a feature article in both <i>USA Today</i> and <i>The Times
Literary Supplement</i>, a British publication. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the <i>USA Today</i> article, Posner stated that: &quot;It is
nonsense that we should be devoting so many law enforcement
resources to marijuana.&nbsp; I am skeptical that a society that
is so tolerant of alcohol and cigarettes should come down so hard
on marijuana use and send people to prison for life without
parole.&quot;&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>'s Senior Policy Advisor, Richard
Cowan, was also quoted in the story. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>USA Today</i> also ran an editorial endorsing the use of
marijuana as a medicine last month.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Secret Service Threatens Couple For Stamping
One Dollar Bills</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 11, 1995, Woodstock, New York:</b>&nbsp;
A couple who habitually brand their one dollar bills with a
marijuana leaf and the quote: &quot;I grew hemp,&quot; were
recently contacted by Woodstock police acting on behalf of the
Secret Service.&nbsp; Joy Beckerman and James Horn, owners of the
Heaven On Earth Hemp Store, report that the police came to them
with Xerox copies of stamped dollar bills and a written warning
from the secret service specifying that the practice of defacing
United States currency was a federal crime.&nbsp; Although Horn
admits that the local officers were laid back about the whole
issue, he claims that the notice stated that the U.S. Attorney
General would be contacted and charges would be pressed if the
couple didn't immediately stop the stamping. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While Horn fully admits to stamping many of his dollar bills with
the pro-hemp message, he is alarmed that the federal government
seems to be targeting him alone.&nbsp; Since Heaven On Earth
sells the &quot;I grew hemp&quot; stampers, the couple argues
that the government has no way of proving that the bills in
question were defaced by them. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Horn says that he will continue to both sell stampers and stamp
some of his one dollar bills despite the warning.&nbsp; The
couple see their action as a way of informing the community of
hemp's industrial uses and its historical background as an
integral American crop. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Jury Rules That Hemp Seed Demonstration Is A
Protest, Not Cultivation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 24, 1995, Madera, CA:</b>&nbsp; A jury
has acquitted three marijuana activists who challenged
authorities to prosecute them for publicly planting 20,000 hemp
seeds in me Sierra foothills.&nbsp; Hemp proponents Ron
Kiczenski, Doug Weissman, and Craig Steffens were all found not
guilty of felony cultivation.&nbsp; The trio, collectively known
as the Three Hawk Stand, were arrested by sheriffs deputies
following a July 4 public protest during which the defendants
planted hemp seeds in front of both media and local
authorities.&nbsp; Had they been found guilty, the three activists
each faced up to three years in jail and a $10,000 fine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The men were found innocent in spite of the court's efforts to
disallow the defense from presenting evidence that hemp can be
utilized as an industrial crop and that the defendants' action was
done strictly as a political protest.&nbsp; Earlier in the trial,
Judge John W. DeGroot had ruled that the only relevant issue in
the trial was whether or not the trio planted an illegal
crop.&nbsp; &quot;Being a protest is not a defense to the
[cultivation] charge,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Ironically, Kiczenski believes that the Court's hardline approach
may have actually helped Three Hawk Stand's defense.&nbsp;
&quot;The prosecutor and the judge worked too hard,&quot; said
Steffens' attorney, Nancy Lord.&nbsp; &quot;The jury thought the
whole thing was rigged.&quot;&nbsp; The defendants were successful
in arguing that the seeds they had planted were legally
sterilized hemp seeds which were incapable of producing actual
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition to reaching the three not guilty verdicts, the jury
also presented a prepared statement to the court regarding the
reasons behind and the potential impact of their decision.&nbsp;
Jury foreman Dean Mitchell read the following: &quot;Some jurors
agree with the cause in which you believe; some jurors are
totally opposed.&nbsp; Our verdict went outside of your
cause.&nbsp; The evidence left reasonable doubt in our
minds.&nbsp; Our admonishment to you three defendants is that we
are not sending you on a seed planting mission, but rather we
suggest you pursue your cause through alternative methods.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Now that he's been acquitted, Kiczenski maintains that he will do
just that.&nbsp; Kiczenski plans to file a civil lawsuit
challenging the DEA's assumed control and jurisdiction over the
production of hemp. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kiczenski has received media attention in the past by mailing
marijuana to President Bill Clinton.&nbsp; He is a former High
Times &quot;Freedom Fighter of the Month.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Cannabis Patient Continues To Be
Denied Prescription<br>
Allegations of Civil Rights Abuses Prompt NORML Lawyers To Take
Action</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 2, 1995, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; Recent
events have discouraged hopes that medical cannabis user Todd
McCormick will be legally permitted to use his prescribed
medicine -- marijuana -- while in jail.&nbsp; According to
McCormick, Judge Anthony Gretich is now requiring that an
American physician who has physically examined McCormick must
additionally submit a written statement supporting his
prescription for cannabis.&nbsp; McCormick must also secure a
local Ohio doctor to oversee the administration of his
prescription. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick already has letters from three prominent American
doctors (<b>NORML</b> Board Chairman Lester Grinspoon M.D., <b>NORML</b>
Board member John Morgan, M.D., and Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.)
supporting his prescription.&nbsp; Inexplicably however, although
McCormick received these supportive statements on August 18, he
maintains that his public defender, John Schaffer, failed to file
any motions on his client's behalf until September 1.&nbsp;
McCormick had initially believed that the Court needed written
support from only one physician. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Even more alarming were recent reports of civil and
constitutional rights violations taking place against
McCormick.&nbsp; Following McCormick's live-from-prison telephone
interview with a local Ohio radio station, Warden Jim Dennis
reportedly forbade McCormick any further press contact.&nbsp; He
was also denied access to phone calls and visitors.&nbsp; In
response to these allegations, Cleveland attorneys Gordon S.
Friedman and Terry H. Gilbert of <b>NORML</b>'s Legal Committee
faxed a letter on September 1 to Warden Dennis informing him that
they bad been requested to investigate the abuse charges.&nbsp;
As a result of their letter, the Todd McCormick Alliance reports
that the warden has renewed McCormick's phone privileges and is
once again permitting him to speak to the media.&nbsp; The warden
is also allowing McCormick to use muscle relaxers to help
alleviate the pain and limited lateral head movement he suffers
as a result of acute nerve damage in his neck. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick is presently awaiting trial on four felony drug charges
following the discovery of 31 pounds of marijuana in his vehicle
by Ohio State Highway Patrolmen.&nbsp; McCormick maintains that the
cannabis, which was clearly marked &quot;for medicinal use
only,&quot; was intended to be used to establish a Compassionate
Use Club in Rhode Island and was not meant for sale.&nbsp;
McCormick had previously founded a Compassionate Use Club in San
Diego. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A hearing to determine whether or not McCormick's $50,000 bail
should be lowered will be held on September 7, 1995. <br>

Conviction</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 1, Bay City, MI:</b>&nbsp; Ed
Czuprynski, the Bay City attorney who in 1992 was sentenced to 14
months in federal prison for possessing 1.6 grams of marijuana,
has had his conviction reversed by the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals.&nbsp; Concluding that Federal Judge Robert Cleland
&quot;abused [his] discretion&quot; in his evidentiary rulings
during Czuprynski's trial, the higher court determined that the
prosecution lacked sufficient relevant evidence to show that Czuprynski
knowingly possessed marijuana.&nbsp; Czuprynski had maintained
throughout both his trial and conviction that the marijuana found
in his office had been planted and that his prosecution was political. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a written statement affirming the higher court's decision to
reverse, two of the judges admit that &quot;the [Czuprynski]
case...has occupied untold judicial resources.&quot;&nbsp; The
document also specifies that the amount of marijuana involved in
the case was &quot;minute&quot; and &quot;meager.&quot;&nbsp;
Federal sentencing guidelines for minor amounts of marijuana do
not recommend that a prison sentence should exceed more than 6
months. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski's September 1 victory is actually the second time that
his conviction has been reversed.&nbsp; Czuprynski first won a
reversal of his possession conviction in November of 1993, but the
conviction was later upheld following the government's
appeal.&nbsp; Czuprynski said that he would not be surprised if

maintains that he has no appetite without daily use of the drug and

<p align="center"><b>Update: Judge Considers Permitting Medical
Marijuana User To Smoke Cannabis<br>
While In Jail</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 24, 1995, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; In what
may end up being a precedent-setting decision, a Williams County
Judge is considering allowing marijuana activist Todd McCormick
to have legal access to medical cannabis while in jail.&nbsp;
McCormick is a medical marijuana user and co-founder of the San
Diego Compassionate Use Club--a facility in California that
supplies free marijuana to seriously ill patients based upon a
doctor's recommendation.&nbsp; He is currently awaiting trial in
Ohio where he faces four felony charges resulting from the
discovery of 31 pounds of cannabis in his vehicle by Ohio State
Highway Patrolmen.&nbsp; The marijuana was marked &quot;for
medicinal use only&quot; and McCormick maintains that it was
intended to be used to establish a Compassionate Use Club in his
hometown of Providence, Rhode Island. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At an arraignment last Thursday, Williams County Court of Common
Pleas Judge Anthony L. Gretick suggested that he might order the
Sheriff to allow McCormick to use cannabis while in jail if
McCormick could provide the court with written support by an
American physician.&nbsp; McCormick possesses a prescription from
a physician in the Netherlands that advises for the consumption
of ten grams of cannabis per day. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Responding to Gretick's suggestion, three prominent U.S. doctors
(<b>NORML</b> Board Chairman Lester Grinspoon M.D., <b>NORML</b>
Board member John Morgan, M.D., and Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.) wrote
letters supporting McCormick's need for medical marijuana.&nbsp;
However, according to a Toledo Blade reporter covering the court
proceedings, the judge is now also requesting that a local doctor
be summoned to endorse and administer the prescription to
McCormick.&nbsp; As this report goes to press, no official action
has yet to be taken by Gretick. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick's case gained national exposure this week when it was
mentioned in an August 21 <i>USA Today</i> editorial endorsing
the use of marijuana as a medicine for seriously sick
patients.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b> had a letter supporting marijuana's
medical utility printed in <i>USA Today</i> the following day. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on Todd McCormick's case, please contact
the Todd McCormick Alliance @ (619) 582-7303.&nbsp; For more
information on medical marijuana, please contact </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>California Residents Favor Access To Medical
Marijuana<br>
According To Recent Health Poll</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 21, 1995, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; A
recent poll by Mervin Field for the California Center for Health
Improvement indicates that although many Californians still
remain concerned about illicit drug use, the majority of the
state still support the medicinal use of marijuana.&nbsp; This
conclusion directly contradicts earlier statements made by Dr.
Andy Mecca, director of the state Department on Alcohol and Drug
Programs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the California Health Poll, 57 percent of the
respondents stated that they favored granting doctors the ability
to legally prescribe marijuana to their patients.&nbsp; By
comparison, only 22 percent favored similar prescriptions for
cocaine.&nbsp; Ironically, cocaine is currently classified as a Schedule
II drug which allows for its medical use in certain instances
while marijuana remains classified by the federal government as
having &quot;no medical use.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>New York City Buyers Club Busted<br>
Apparent Nationwide Crackdown On Medical Marijuana Clubs
Continues</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 21, 1995, New York, NY:</b>&nbsp; New
York City activists have reported that law enforcement officials
recently busted New York City's underground cannabis buyers
club.&nbsp; The New York club was one of over thirty such clubs
that currently operate and distribute medical marijuana to
seriously ill patients.&nbsp; Longtime AIDS and drug reform
activist Johann Moore was arrested at the scene and held
overnight.&nbsp; He is reportedly charged with one count of
felony sales. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bust of the New York City Medical Buyers Club--a small buyers
club that had consciously maintained a relatively low
profile--seems to support the notion that law enforcement
agencies across the country are beginning a concerted effort to
crackdown on medical marijuana clubs.&nbsp; In the past few
months, both Todd McCormick (San Diego Compassionate Use Club)
and Joanna McCkee (Green Cross Patient Co-op of Washington) have
been arrested and had their marijuana seized by law enforcement
officials. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Two NORML Chapters Fight For Their Rights...
And Win!</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Two NORML chapters recently emerged victorious in
their fights against local censorship restrictions.&nbsp; In two
separate incidents, Northcoast NORML (OH) and University of
Oklahoma NORML were initially denied access to public forums
because of their organization's marijuana-tolerant beliefs.&nbsp;
However, after threatening to take legal action in order to
defend their First Amendment rights, both chapters subsequently
prevailed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Northcoast NORML president, John Hartman, the local
chapter will now be allowed to display public service
announcements on the rear and/or side of Cuyahoga city
busses.&nbsp; Regional Transit Authority officials had originally
refused to post the organization's PSA's.&nbsp; However, upon
learning that an ACLU lawyer had accepted the case, the RTA
quickly reversed its opinion.&nbsp; The RTA has informed
Northcoast NORML that the group's displays must meet the same
requirements as do political advertisements and must bear the
organization's name and address.&nbsp; Hartman says that adhering
to these standards should not be a problem and hopes to use the
ads to raise awareness of the fact there have been over ten
million marijuana arrests since 1965. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a similar scenario, University of Oklahoma NORML will now be
permitted to run a month-long hemp exhibit in the display case of
the Norman (OK) Municipal Public Library.&nbsp; Originally, the
chapter's request to gain access to the display case was denied
by library management.&nbsp; OU NORML challenged this decision
and charged that the library was engaging in discrimination.&nbsp;
OU NORML further argued that the library's denial of their
request violated the written anti-censorship policy of the
National Library Association.&nbsp; Following this assertion, the library
promptly rewrote their own policy in order to justify their
previous decision.&nbsp; OU NORML then had an ACLU lawyer send
the library a letter requesting them to change their new policy
and grant the NORML chapter access to the public display
case.&nbsp; Library officials finally consented following the
ACLU's letter.&nbsp; The OU NORML hemp exhibit is slated to be on
display this upcoming February. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information regarding these cases, please contact

To Hold Hemp Rally<br>
By Board Of Selectmen</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 17, 1995, Marblehead, MA:</b>&nbsp;
Mass Cann: NORML has announced that it must cancel its scheduled
weekend Hempfest (Aug. 26-27) because of an abrupt change of
heart by the Royalston Board of Selectmen.&nbsp; Plans are
already underway to hold a protest on the green outside Royalston
Town Hall.&nbsp; The demonstration is slated to take place at
noon on August 26. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Steve Epstein, an attorney and Chairman of Mass Cann: NORML,
explained that the Royalston Board of Selectmen suddenly
&quot;changed its position and determined that the club did not have
the necessary permits [required] under state law to host the
event.&quot;&nbsp; Epstein further states that Mass Cann: NORML
had &quot;met [previously] with them on August 6 and were told
that no additional permits were required.&quot;&nbsp; Mass Cann:
NORML wasn't alerted to the fact that the group would need an
additional permit until August 11. The board refuses to allow the
event without the necessary authorizations. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">William Downing, President of Mass Cann: NORML maintains that:
&quot;The decision of the board was motivated by an illegal
desire to prevent [our organization] from expressing [its]
opinions on marijuana prohibition.&quot;&nbsp; He additionally
states that: &quot;They could stop Hempfest because of [a permit
requirement, but] they cannot stop 'HEMP-PROTEST' because of the
First Amendment.&quot;&nbsp; Mass Cann: NORML had been hosting
events similar to Hempfest for approximately the past six years. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 16, 1995, Fishers, Indiana:</b>&nbsp;
Following directly on the heels of this past June's U.S. Supreme
Court decision upholding an Oregon public school policy mandating
urine tests for all athletes regardless of probable cause, a
Fishers school board is attempting to force high school students
to submit to drug tests before they are issued parking permits. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Principle Gary Wiersema was asked by the board to adopt the new
policy before school opens August 23.&nbsp; Wiesema maintains
that such a proposal should not be instituted so swifty and has advised
the board to move slowly on the issue.&nbsp; &quot;Kids still
have rights,&quot; he told the Palladium-Item after an initial
meeting with the board. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An attorney for the school has stated that he believes such a
measure would stand up in a court of law based upon the U.S.
Supreme Court's previous rulings regarding drug testing.&nbsp;
&quot;If the rationale to randomly test athletes is because of
safety,&quot; he told the Palladium-Item, &quot;[then] the school
has the ability to control who drives.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Currently, between 10 and 20 separate schools have enacted random
drug testing policies for athletes in Indiana.</p>

from life threatening staph infections, high blood pressure,
migraines, and possibly anemia. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Connie Theis, Martinez's registered nurse and the woman who

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Martinez has yet to be convicted of any crime.&nbsp; He
is currently facing drug charges after being turned in to
authorities for possessing a coffee can of marijuana.&nbsp;
Martinez had been using marijuana as a therapeutic agent to help
relieve the pain he suffers daily after having been shot through
the left eye in 1991.&nbsp; He remains incarcerated in Durango

resolution calling for governments everywhere to &quot;immediately
rescind their policies of arresting ... marijuana consumers who
currently possess and/or cultivate cannabis for their own medical
use&quot; will be introduced by Dr. Erik Fromberg at the 37th
International Congress on Drugs and Alcohol Dependency.&nbsp; The
resolution further demands that governments start separating the
medical issue &quot;from the recreational drug issue and begin actively
studying cannabis' use as a therapeutic agent.&quot;&nbsp; Dr.
Fromberg is a representative from the Netherlands Institute on
Alcohol and Drugs (NIAD).&nbsp; The international conference is

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Also attending the Congress will be the Todd McCormick

The organization will be holding a round table discussion on the
medical use of cannabis on August 22 and is planning to hold a

<p align="center"><b>Registered Nurse Contacts NORML In An Appeal
To Save The Life Of Her Patient</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 4, 1995, Phoenix, AZ:</b>&nbsp; In an
attempt to stimulate national attention and awareness to the
plight of her patient, Richard G. Martinez, neuro-rehabilitation
nurse and Martinez's legal guardian, Constance Theis, has
contacted <b>NORML</b> with a story of unparalleled injustice. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">After having been shot through the left eye in 1991, Richard
Martinez was left with an excruciatingly painful nerve disorder
known as trigeminal neuralgia.&nbsp; In addition, many fragments from
the bullet could not be removed during surgery and still remain
lodged in Martinez's brain.&nbsp; The presence of these fragments
induces cognitive deficits and seizure disorders and also gives
rise to frequent bouts of intense nausea and severe
depression.&nbsp; To help alleviate Martinez's daily pain, he was
granted a legal prescription for Marinol -- a federally approved
THC synthetic drug.&nbsp; The Marinol, however, ended up being
far too expensive ($636.00 per month) for Martinez to afford on
his social security disability-based income.&nbsp; As a result,
Martinez turned to the next logical substitute, natural cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Martinez was turned in to authorities for possessing marijuana by
a relative in exchange for a small financial reward.&nbsp; He now
sits in Durango County Jail in Phoenix, Arizona, where he is
forced to sleep on a dirty floor and is prevented from taking his
proper medication.&nbsp; While in jail, Martinez has suffered
numerous staph infections in the eye socket and ear.&nbsp; Staph
infections put tremendous pressure on the heart and, if left
untreated, can be fatal.&nbsp; The tremendous swelling from these infections
is causing green pus to flow from Martinez's right nostril.&nbsp;
In addition, Martinez's serious infections are destroying
valuable tissue and bone in his face.&nbsp; This deterioration
has gotten so extreme that Martinez now believes that his eye may
actually be &quot;rotting.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Martinez is also experiencing critically high blood pressure and
is now at risk of suffering a stroke.&nbsp; This occurrence is a
natural physical result of untreated pain and infection.&nbsp;
The threat of a severe stroke -- in addition to his constant
fevers, infections, tissue deterioration, and ear aches -- makes
Martinez's incarceration highly life threatening. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the reports of three separate physicians, Martinez's
head wound seriously damaged his right frontal lobe and has
rendered him mentally incompetent.&nbsp; Therefore, he can not legally
stand trial.&nbsp; The state, however, wants Martinez to appear
in court regardless.&nbsp; Consequently, psychologists at the
Durango County Jail are working round the clock to have Martinez
declared mentally competent.&nbsp; Ms. Theis maintains that this
process can last as long a seven or eight months -- a time frame
that she believes Martinez will not survive.&nbsp; The bitter
irony is that the state is trying to legally rehabilitate a man
with braln damage solely for the purpose of throwing him back in
jail.&nbsp; All this because Martinez was trying to alleviate
daily pain, nausea, and seizures with the only effective
therapeutic agent he could financially afford -- marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Constance Theis maintains that her patient's life is in danger
every additional day he stays in the Durango County Jail.&nbsp;
She can be contacted at the following numbers: (602) 790-1595
(home) or (602) 325-1300 EXT 4435 (work).</p>

McKee, activist, medicinal marijuana advocate, and co-founder of
Washington's Green Cross Patient Co-op turned herself in to local
authorities to begin serving a two day sentence for leaving the
state against a judge's orders. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mckee, 52, was arrested on May 3 when regional task force agents
raided her medical marijuana cooperative in Brainbridge
Island.&nbsp; According to authorities, approximately 130 marijuana
plants were seized during the raid. McKee's Green Cross Patient
Co-op is believed to have been the first &quot;Cannabis Buyers
Club&quot; in the nation aggressively targeted by the law enforcement
community.&nbsp; Over 30 such &quot;Clubs&quot; currently operate
throughout the United States. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following her May arrest, McKee was released on her own
recognizance pending trial in September.&nbsp; However, a Kitsap
County Superior Court judge ordered her not to leave the
state.&nbsp; McKee recently defied this court order when she flew
to Washington DC to attend the National Institute on Drug Abuse's
first ever conference on marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McKee's arrest and subsequent legal problems have garnered both
considerable local and national media attention.&nbsp; USA Today
mentioned her probable return to jail in its July 20 issue and all
three local network affiliates were on hand to cover McKee's
surrender to police on August 2. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Ironically, McKee's return to jail comes less than three weeks
after San Diego Compassionate Use Club founder, Todd McCormick,
was arrested by authorities while on route to Rhode Island.&nbsp; McCormick
faces felony drug charges. <br>

proposal to eliminate the position of White House drug policy
advisor (currentiy held by Lee Brown) has been approved by the

stated that he will veto any legislation that intends to abolish
the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown's office has recentiy come under fire from both Republicans
and Democrats alike for a &quot;lack of visibility&quot; in
fighting illegal drug use and trafficking.&nbsp; ONDCP proponents
have countered by arguing that since the creation of a national
&quot;drug czar&quot; seven years ago, the Office has significantly
reduced the power of Colombian drug cartels and has helped lead
the campaign against adolescent marijuana use. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Compassionate Use Club Founder
Arrested On Route To Rhode Island</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 18, 1995, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; Longtime
activist and medical marijuana user Todd McCormick was arrested
and charged with two felony drug counts when Ohio State Highway
Patrolmen discovered in excess of thirty pounds of marijuana in
his van.&nbsp; McCormick's passenger, Natalie Byrd, was also
taken into custody and faces similar felony drug charges.&nbsp;
Both activists are currently being held at the Correction Center
of Northwest Ohio where bail has been set, without bond, at
$150,000 each. McCormick's preliminary hearing is scheduled to
take place today.&nbsp; Byrd's scheduled hearing has been
postponed to take place at a later date.&nbsp; McCormick, age 25, is
the founder of the San Diego Compassionate Use Club.&nbsp; The
San Diego Club is one of approximately thirty Cannabis Buyers
Clubs located across the country.&nbsp; The purpose of the Clubs,
many of which have recently received favorable media coverage and
have been grudgingly tolerated by local law enforcement, is to
supply cannabis to seriously ill patients based upon a doctor's
recommendation.&nbsp; Typically, these patients are suffering
from the effects of AIDS, cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS),
glaucoma, and spinal disorders.&nbsp; McCormick maintains that
the marijuana found in his van was intended to be used to
establish a Compassionate Use Club in his home state of Rhode
Island.&nbsp; He told police that it was not for sale.&nbsp; All
of the cannabis dispensed at McCormick's San Diego Club was
donated and was available to patients on a &quot;no charge&quot;
basis.&nbsp; The 30+ pounds of cannabis was visibly labeled
&quot;for medical use.&quot;&nbsp; Based on the evidence seized during
McCormick's arrest in Ohio on the 18th, DEA agents subsequently
raided his Rolando, California house three days later.&nbsp; None
of the four residents staying at the house at the time of the raid
were arrested; however, a small quantity of marijuana was
found.&nbsp; Also confiscated by federal agents were videotapes,
books on the subject of legalizing marijuana, various computer
disks, film, and smoking paraphernalia.&nbsp; In addition,
numerous petition signatures calling for a California marijuana
legalization initiative were also seized, but have since been
returned.&nbsp; All four residents have said that they are
committed to making marijuana medically available to chronically
ill patients.&nbsp; Although the significant amount of marijuana
present and the rural venue do not make McCormick's case ideal
for a medical necessity defense, he feels that a number of Fourth Amendment
violations make his case winnable.&nbsp; Most importantly,
McCormick contends that law enforcement officials searched his
vehicle without his consent or a warrant.&nbsp; McCormick
maintains that one officer claimed to &quot;smell pot,&quot; at
which time McCormick voluntarily showed the trooper his
prescription for medical cannabis.&nbsp; At this point, his van
was searched and the bundles of marijuana were found.&nbsp;
McCormick acquired his prescription from a doctor in Rotterdam,
the Netherlands.&nbsp; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Aside from being an activist on the front lines of the medical
marijuana issue, McCormick is also a medical marijuana
user.&nbsp; McCormick has battled cancer on ten different
occasions and first started smoking cannabis to alleviate the
significant side effects of radiation and chemotherapy.&nbsp; He now
uses the therapeutic effects of the drug to combat acute nerve
damage in his neck.&nbsp; This damage came about when the first
five vertebrae in his neck fused together as a result of the
cancer and greatly limits McCormick's lateral head
movement.&nbsp; McCormick attributes the regular smoking of
cannabis as the prime reason for the improvement in his condition
and lateral head mobility.&nbsp; He further maintains that the
prescription he acquired in the Netherlands makes it legal for
him to transport cannabis in all United Nations.&nbsp; Recently,
his prescription had enabled him to enter America through U.S.
Customs in Colorado while carrying cannabis.&nbsp; Those wishing
to donate funds to Todd McCormick's defense can send their

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Arrests Hit Ten Million
Mark...&nbsp; Drug Czar Compares Marijuana to Cocaine</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Based on projections from 1993 Justice Department
statistics (FBI Uniform Crime Reports), the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws estimates that the total number
of marijuana arrests since 1965 will pass the ten million mark on
July 20th, 1995.&nbsp; Mounting at the rate of more than <strong>one
thousand per day</strong>, more than 80% of these arrests are
solely for personal possession.&nbsp; The balance are for
cultivation--often for personal use--or for sale, usually a
involving a very small quantity. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">To put these numbers in context: Marijuana arrests in 1993
(380,690) made up approximately <strong>one third</strong> of the
1.1 million total drug arrests that year.&nbsp; By comparison,
there were approximately 600,000 arrests for violent
crimes.&nbsp; This year, the Clinton Administration sought to
provide 100,000 new police.&nbsp; Now, if an arrest, transporting
the arrestee to jail, paper work, etc. ideally takes only 2
hours, and there is only one officer involved, then marijuana
arrests currently use the time of approximately one hundred
thousand police per year.&nbsp; There are approximately 550,000 state
and local police officers.&nbsp; Thus, approximately 20% of their
total time is consumed by marijuana arrests. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Obviously, this burden on police resources is not the same in all
jurisdictions.&nbsp; In 11 states, marijuana possession has been
decriminalized and the police typically issue citations rather
than arrest an offender.&nbsp; Additionally, in most major cities
marijuana possession is a very low priority.&nbsp; However, in
some smaller towns, it seems to be a major focus for the
police.&nbsp; For example, in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, police
searched Scott Bryant's garbage for marijuana residue for several days
before getting a warrant and shooting him dead on April 17.&nbsp;
He was unarmed and less than an ounce of marijuana was
found.&nbsp; In a small town in Oklahoma, paraplegic and medical
marijuana user Jimmy Montgomery was sentenced to 10 years for
possession of less than two ounces.&nbsp; He is still awaiting
release on a medical parole. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moreover, the prospect of being able to seize valuable property
under civil forfeiture has created an incentive to seek out
marijuana cultivation.&nbsp; This is believed to have been the
reason for the 1992 raid on multimillionaire Donald Scott's
estate near Malibu that resulted in his being killed by
police.&nbsp; No marijuana was found.&nbsp; The effect of these
increasing arrests on marijuana availability, however, seems to
be negligible.&nbsp; According to Joseph Califano, Chairman of
the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, &quot;American
children are telling us they are drenched in drugs.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Clinton Administration is now devoting most of its efforts to
the suppression of marijuana.&nbsp; Drug Czar Lee Brown in a
press release on July 17 cited a survey commissioned by
Califano's group.&nbsp; Brown said that: &quot;91% of the
population blames illegal drug and alcohol abuse for the rate of
violent crime that we have in America today.&nbsp; This fact
alone should tell the media that they need to make the connection
between drug use and violent crime in their news
stories.&quot;&nbsp; However, in a letter to the editor of the
Summer issue of <em>Forbes Media Critic</em>, Califano himself
points out that marijuana &quot;has not been associated with high
levels of violence.&quot; In fact, most of the violence in our society
is associated with alcohol -- <strong>not marijuana</strong>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Perhaps even more misleading is the media advisory from Brown's
office announcing &quot;marijuana sends virtually the same
numbers to emergency rooms as cocaine.&quot;&nbsp; This statement
is supposedly based on numbers from DAWN, the Drug Abuse Warning
Network.&nbsp; In truth, the DAWN statistics say nothing of the
sort.&nbsp; First, they deal with emergency room <strong>mentions</strong>,
not causes of admission established by a doctor.&nbsp; The DAWN
figures further demonstrate that over 80% of marijuana mentions
are in conjunction with problems associated with alcohol,
cocaine, or some other drug.&nbsp; In cases where marijuana is
the only drug <strong>mentioned</strong>, the problem is almost
always a panic attack by inexperienced users.&nbsp; There is no
practical lethal dose of marijuana and the only adverse acute
effects of marijuana are transitory and not life or health
threatening. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Consequently, the hospital emergency room <strong>mentions</strong>
of marijuana are neither qualitatively nor quantitatively
comparable to those caused by cocaine.&nbsp; However, the
children of America might get the impression from Brown's
statement that the risks associated with cocaine are no greater
than those associated with marijuana.&nbsp; This conclusion would
seem to be the antithesis of drug education.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>
National Director Richard Cowan commented that the Clinton Administration's
drug policy concentrating on marijuana seems to be aimed at
avoiding &quot;inhale&quot; jokes at all costs.&nbsp; Another ten
million arrests is too high a price to pay for that.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Not All Marijuana Law Victims Are Arrested:<br>
Police Officer Who Fatally Shot Suspected Marijuana User Cleared
Of Criminal Charges</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 6, 1995, Beaver Dam, WI</b>:&nbsp;
According to a lengthy article in the <i>Madison Isthmus</i>, Detective
Robert Neuman -- the police officer who on April 28 fatally shot
suspected marijuana user Scott Bryant in his home -- has been
recently cleared of criminal charges by a Sheboygan County
District Attorney. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Officer Neuman shot and killed twenty-nine year old Scott Bryant
on April 28 when he and three other police officers barged into
Bryant's mobile home executing a no knock/no announce warrant.&nbsp;
Bryant was unarmed and did not resist arrest; his seven year old
son, Colton, was present during the shooting.&nbsp; A total of
less than one ounce of marijuana was found in the apartment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">District Attorney Wells concluded that, &quot;The shooting of
Scott Bryant was not in any form justified.&quot;&nbsp; However,
he also determined that the shooting was
&quot;unintentional,&quot; and thus, could not file homicide
charges.&nbsp; Wells theorizes that, &quot;[Officer Neuman's]
hand may have clenched either as he jerked his weapon toward the
noise and struck the door, or in 'sympathetic physical reaction'
to his other hand, which was also grasping.&quot;&nbsp; A
gun-maker of the Beretta used by Neuman finds such an occurrence
to be unlikely since the Beretta's double action draw length
&quot;helps reduce the chance of ... inadvertent
discharges.&quot;&nbsp; Neuman claims that he has &quot;no
recollection of pulling the trigger.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Wells also ruled out charges of criminal recklessness in the
Neuman shooting, claiming that the detective &quot;could not have
had a 'conscious, subjective awareness' that his gun handling
created a grave risk, since his partner was in the line of
fire.&quot;&nbsp; The <i>Isthmus</i> article further adds that
because of the employment of an &quot;outdated legal
definition,&quot; Wells also cleared Neuman of the charge of criminal
recklessness.&nbsp; As a result, Officer Neuman can return to
regular active duty. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The fatal shooting of Scott Bryant by law enforcement officials
is yet another example of the government's continued war against
marijuana users.&nbsp; In a similar instance, disabled Vietnam veteran
Gary Shepard was shot and killed by police in August of 1992 as
he and his family stood on the front porch of his home in rural
Kentucky.&nbsp; Shepard had been engaged in a day-long standoff
with law enforcement officials after he refused to let police cut
down the marijuana plants growing on his property.&nbsp; Perhaps
even more shocking was the October 2, 1993 fatal shooting of millionaire
rancher Donald Scott.&nbsp; Scott was killed when law enforcement
officials raided his Malibu property searching for 40 pounds of
marijuana.&nbsp; No marijuana was ever found.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Number Of Jail Inmates Experiences Third
Largest Increase Since 1983</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the most recent <i>Census of Jails
and Annual Survey of Jails</i> report, the jail population of the
United States rose by 30,638 inmates between July 1, 1993, and
June 30,1994.&nbsp; This growth marks the third largest annual
increase recorded since 1983. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Even more striking were the report's findings that: &quot;Since
1983 the jail inmate population has nearly doubled on a per
capita basis.&nbsp; During this period the number of jail inmates
per 100,000 residents rose from 96 to 188.&quot;&nbsp;
Consequently, the report estimates that about 1 in every 398
adult residents (and 1 in every 212 men) are in a local jail. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Not surprisingly, the largest source of growth among inmates in
local jails was drug law violators.&nbsp; Because of increased
law enforcement and stiffer penalties under the &quot;War on
Drugs,&quot; the number of jail inmates charged or convicted of
drug offenses increased from 20,800 in 1983 to 91,000 in
1989.&nbsp; Subsequently, the percentage of inmates serving time
in jail for drug offenses has skyrocketed from 10% in 1983 to
nearly 25% in 1989.&nbsp; This figure accounts for more than 40%
of the total increase in jail population.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Prohibition Subject To New Legal
And Scientific Challenge: Petition Demands U. S. Government
Provide Finding On Marijuana's Abuse Potential As Required By Federal
Law</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Calling marijuana prohibition a &quot;fraud and a
failure,&quot; longtime activist and former <b>NORML</b> National
Director Jon Gettman filed a rule making petition with the Drug
Enforcement Administration on July 10, 1995 demanding that the
agency immediately initiate proceedings to re-evaluate
marijuana's Schedule I status under the Controlled Substances
Act. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">By law, the DEA is required to forward such petitions to the
Department of Health and Human Services for a binding medical and
scientific evaluation.&nbsp; The petition is based on a
comprehensive review of recent scientific evidence demonstrating
that marijuana does not have &quot;sufficient abuse potential to
warrant Schedule I or II status under the Controlled Substances
Act.&quot;&nbsp; The CSA mandates that a scientific finding
affirming that a drug has a high potential for abuse is required
to maintain the complete prohibition of any drug or substance
under Schedule I.&nbsp; (21 USC 812(b)(1))&nbsp; <u>No such
finding </u><b><u>has ever existed</u></b><u> for marijuana</u>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">DEA Administrator Constantine has claimed in an exchange of
letters that abuse potential is irrelevant to the scheduling of
drugs with no accepted medical use.&nbsp; When Gettman reminded Constantine
that this position was explicitly rejected by the U.S. Court of
Appeals in 1977 (NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d 736), Constantine boldly
challenged him to pursue action in an April 21, 1995 letter to
United States Senator John Warner (R-VA).&nbsp; In this letter,
Constantine stated that: &quot;[The DEA is] unaware of any new
scientific studies of marijuana that would lead us to re-evaluate
its classification at this time; therefore no such evaluation is
now in process nor do we feel [that one is] necessary based on
the information available to us.&nbsp; [However,] if Mr. Gettman has
scientific data concerning marijuana which he wishes to bring to
our attention, we will be pleased to consider it, should he care
to share the documentation with us.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to Constantine's statements, Gettman has produced a
279 page petition referencing nearly 170 scientific journals and
government reports.&nbsp; Of prime importance to Gettman's arguments
is the recent discovery of a cannabinoid receptor system in the
human body.&nbsp; This discovery has radically altered
contemporary knowledge about marijuana's effects on the body and the
brain.&nbsp; According to Gettman, &quot;These new findings
directly contradict many of the DEA's on-record findings of
'fact' which have been used to block prior reconsideration of
marijuana's scheduling status.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Until 1990, no one knew how marijuana affected the
brain.&nbsp; Marijuana prohibition has assumed that science would
eventually prove marijuana had a high potential for abuse.&nbsp;
Science has demolished that assumption, and established marijuana
prohibition as a cruel fraud upon the American public. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">No scientist has ever established that marijuana has a high
potential for abuse, and now we know that no science can.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Simply put, drugs with a high potential for abuse induce
self-administration in animals, and affect the production of the
neurotransmitter dopamine.&nbsp; Marijuana does neither.&nbsp; To
retain marijuana in Schedule I creates a double standard
forbidden by the 14th Amendment - one set of rules for all other
drugs, and a different set of rules for marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A 78 page booklet entitled <i>The Scientific and Legal Basis for
the End of Marijuana Prohibition</i> reviewing some of the
research cited in Gettman's petition will be forthcoming from <b>NORML</b>
at a cost of $10 plus $2.50 shipping and handling.&nbsp;
Summaries of the scientific and medical evidence supporting the
petition are available from <b>NORML</b> and will soon be
available on the Internet.&nbsp; Jon Gettman has also described
this new research in articles in the March and July 1995 issues
of <i>High Times</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[<i>Jon Gettman can be contacted for further information about
this rule-making petition c/o </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>.&nbsp;
Other activists who wish to file their own similar rule making
petitions with the DEA should refer to sections 21 CFR Ch. II
1308.44 of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Justice manual.</i>]</p>

<p align="center"><b>10 Million Arrests and NIDA; Bad Science
Used to Justify Bad Policies<br>
by Richard Cowan, National Director of NORML</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On July 20th, NORML will mark the 10 millionth
marijuana arrest since 1965.&nbsp; While there is no way to be
certain on what date the actual 10 millionth arrest will take
place, Justice Department records indicate that it will occur
around this time.&nbsp; Our choice of this particular date was
spurred by the fact that it will be the last day of a two day
conference on marijuana sponsored by NIDA, the National Institute
on Drug Abuse. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NIDA is supposed to be a scientific organization dedicated to
finding the truth about &quot;drug abuse&quot; and effective ways
to deal with it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, NIDA long ago became a
politicized propaganda mill dedicated to justifying the continued
arrest of marijuana users.&nbsp; This problem is well illustrated
by an article by former NIDA head (and former Drug Czar) Robert
DuPont being run on newspaper op-ed pages as &quot;The Case
Against Legalizing Drugs.&quot;&nbsp; In it, DuPont exploits two
frightening sounding factoids about marijuana use in the
Netherlands. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">First, he says that from 1984 to 1992 adolescent marijuana use
increased by 250% in the Netherlands while it decreased by two
thirds in the US during that time.&nbsp; Even if one takes the dubious
American numbers at face value (They have been criticized by the
GAO and probably greatly understate real usage rates.), these
numbers hide more than thay reveal.&nbsp; DuPont fails to say that
-- even after 20 years of having marijuana readily available --
the rate of &quot;regular&quot; use (one or more times in the
last month) by Dutch adolescents in 1992 was <u>still below the
lowest use by American adolescents in the last 20 years</u>.&nbsp;
He also fails to say that regular use by American high school
seniors soared 40% in two years to 19% in 1994.&nbsp; All this
was while American marijuana users were being arrested at the
rate of 1,000 per day.&nbsp; Moreover, from 1984 to 1992 there
were almost 3 million Americans arrested on marijuana
charges.&nbsp; This is hardly a minor cost or a sign of a
successful policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Then he states that there has been a &quot;30% increase in
registered marijuana addicts&quot; in Holland.&nbsp; This is also
very misleading.&nbsp; The Dutch use the term &quot;addicts&quot;
very broadly to include both compulsive gamblers as well as
people who think that their marijuana use has become a
problem.&nbsp; Such persons are not registered as
&quot;addicts&quot; for any purpose other than being enrolled in
an out-patient therapy program.&nbsp; This is not the equivalent
of a methadone maintenance program. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In 1993, there were only 1,700 people enrolled in this program
out of a regular Dutch cannabis user population of approximately
650,000.&nbsp; This enrollment represents roughly one regular marijuana
user in 400.&nbsp; In the US we arrest the equivalent of one
regular marijuana user in 40 every year.&nbsp; Is that somehow a
better policy?&nbsp; Is being arrested harmless? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">DuPont next uses these numbers out of context to project what he
says would happen if the US followed the Dutch model.&nbsp; He
claims that, &quot;The evidence from the Netherlands suggest that
if the United States were to legalize currently illicit drugs,
the numbers would probably increase from the present 12 million
to something like the 50 million who use tobacco or even the 103
million who use alcohol.&quot;&nbsp; DuPont had to dig through
and ignore all of the facts that I have cited in order to support
his predetermined conclusion.&nbsp; Why would someone do
this?&nbsp; What a bizarre view of the American people this
reflects. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, even the carefully selected numbers that DuPont cites
out of context do not support his conclusions.&nbsp; Indeed, why
-- after 20 years of having marijuana readily available -- hasn't
Dutch marijuana use increased to the level of tobacco or alcohol
use there?&nbsp; In any case, whatever the level of marijuana use
in the future, Dutch statistics on marijuana &quot;addicts&quot;
do not indicate that it would be a major social or public health
problem. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Dutch consider their cannabis policies successful because
they have effectively separated cannabis from hard drugs.&nbsp;
Consequently, <u>their hard drug addiction rate remained stable
and they escaped the crack cocaine epidemic</u> that began in
America during the time of the decline in marijuana use that
DuPont cites as a triumph of American policy over the
Dutch.&nbsp; 'Twas a famous victory.&nbsp; I hope that America
does not have to suffer through any more of them.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Major Announcement</u></b><b>: Capricorn
Records To Issue HEMPILATION CD In Fall Supporting NORML And
Protesting Marijuana Prohibition</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Capricorn Records and NORML, the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, are collaborating
to put out a CD album this fall that will be a vocal protest
against the injustice of marijuana prohibition.&nbsp; <i>High
Times</i> Magazine, which covers the music scene in addition to
reporting on marijuana, helped assemble the talent.&nbsp;
Capricorn issued a press release from Nashville announcing the CD
and NORML issued the following statement from Washington. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Statement by NORML</b>:&nbsp; Since even before the days of
Harry Anslinger's aborted plans to arrest jazz musicians in the
1930s, there has been a connection between music, musicians, and marijuana;
however, it has been very hard to find connections between the
music business and the marijuana reform movement.&nbsp; <u>No
more</u>.&nbsp; Capricorn Records has broken down the closet door
by assembling an extraordinary group of today's hottest bands for
the first-ever benefit CD for NORML.&nbsp; It is appropriately
called HEMPILATION.&nbsp; The bands include the Black Crowes, Blues
Traveler, Cypress Hill, Drivin-N-Cryin, Gov't Mule (featuring
Warren Haynes), 311, Widespread Panic, Ziggy &amp; The Melody
Makers, and others.&nbsp; The artists are contributing &quot;HEMP&quot;
classics or original pieces. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The connection between NORML and Capricorn actually dates back to
the 1970's when Phil Walden, the President of Capricorn, served
on the NORML Board of Directors.&nbsp; When the HEMPILATION was
announced, Walden said he hoped that &quot;this project will not
only be a great source of entertainment, but will also help
spread the word about the many positive actions of NORML and the
benefits of hemp as more than a drug.&quot;&nbsp; Walden made
clear that the HEMPILATION wasn't an endorsement of using
marijuana but rather the belief that the criminal prosecution of
marijuana users was unjust and unfair.&nbsp; This, of course, is
NORML's position.&nbsp; We are not trying to get people to smoke
marijuana, but rather to get the government to stop arresting those
who do.&nbsp; &quot;HEMPILATION is a testament to these bands'
support of NORML's efforts to reform these laws,&quot; Walden
explained. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The liner notes for the CD will include more information about
hemp and marijuana prohibition and will contain a membership
application for joining NORML.&nbsp; This -- along with the
royalties donated by Capricorn and the artists -- will make an
enormous difference in the ability of NORML to work to end the
arrests of marijuana users.&nbsp; NORML naturally hopes that
everyone who buys the CD will become better informed and more
motivated to get involved in the defense of freedom, whether they
smoke marijuana or not.&nbsp; The HEMPILATION offers a way for
both music lovers and musicians to stand up for freedom. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">We also hope that more people in the music business will be moved
by the example of Capricorn and the HEMPILATION artists to
support NORML and the marijuana reform movement.&nbsp; It takes
courage for a businessman like Phil Walden to take the lead in
supporting NORML, but when others see the public support for
Capricorn and the HEMPILATION, they may find that standing up for
one's beliefs is a very satisfying experience.&nbsp; In fact, the
music business has the power to change America.&nbsp; It remains
to be seen how many other musicians and music industry executives
will be inspired by the example of Walden and the artists on the HEMPILATION
and will come forward. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Almost ten million Americans have been arrested on marijuana
charges since 1965.&nbsp; If the music business really got behind
the marijuana reform movement, these arrests would stop.&nbsp; A
lot of musicians like to sing about pot probably even more like
to smoke it and they may think that this makes them look
&quot;cool.&quot;&nbsp; However, what is really &quot;cool&quot;
is standing up for freedom.&nbsp; Freedom Is NORML. <br>

Capricorn Records, (615) 320-8470.&nbsp; For information on music

<p align="center"><b>Supreme Court Ruling On Student Drug Testing
Expected To Decrease Pot Use And Increase Alcohol And Hard Drug
Use By Students</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 26, Washington, D.C.</b>:&nbsp; Comments
on the Supreme Court ruling upholding the constitutionality of
random drug testing of student athletes generally overlook the
fact that such tests do not detect alcohol use and are far less
effective in detecting the use of cocaine and other hard drugs
than marijuana.&nbsp; Marijuana metabolites (not the drug itself)
are detectable in urine far longer than residues of cocaine,
etc.&nbsp; This will have the effect of encouraging the use of
hard drugs and alcohol which are far more dangerous than
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In his opinion supporting the ruling, Justice Scalia wrote that
the &quot;Fourth Amendment does not protect all subjective
expectations of privacy, but only those which society recognizes
as legitimate.&quot;&nbsp; After decades of hate propaganda to
justify arresting millions of marijuana users, the American
people have now been conditioned to believe that forcing someone
to urinate on command does not violate their legitimate&quot;
rights.&nbsp; What the Fourth Amendment <b><i><u>actually</u></i></b>
says:&nbsp; <b>&quot;The right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses and effects against unreasonable searches
and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall Issue, but
upon probable cause supported by Oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons
or things to be seized.&quot;</b>&nbsp; Thomas Jefferson had intended
to put in the part about &quot;only those which society
recognizes as legitimate,&quot; but he forgot.&nbsp; He was
probably suffering from short term memory loss because he grew

<p align="center">... a weekly service for the media on news
items related to Marijuana Prohibition.</p>

<p align="center">June 22, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b><i>JAMA, The Journal of the American Medical
Association</i></b><b> Prints Article By NORML Board Chairman
Calling For Medical Access To Marijuana</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Medical doctors should be legally permitted to
prescribe marijuana for their patients according to a commentary
in the June 21 issue of the internationally respected <i>Journal
of the American Medical Association</i>.&nbsp; The article is
written by NORML Board Chairman, Lester Grinspoon, MD of Harvard
Medical School and James B. Bakalar, also of Harvard, and does
not reflect the official position of the AMA.&nbsp; However, it
was printed after months of review by the JAMA editorial
board.&nbsp; The two page commentary gives a brief history of the
thousands of years of medical use of cannabis, including the
first part of this century in America. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Grinspoon and Bakalar argue that cannabis is much safer than most
of the drugs regularly prescribed by physicians (a lethal
overdose is virtually impossible) and that it is currently being used,
albeit illegally, by many thousands of people who have found that
no legally available pharmaceuticals work as well.&nbsp; (Eight
Americans receive free marijuana from the federal government
under a program closed to new patients in 1992.) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The authors point out that in 1988 the Drug Enforcement
Administration's own chief administrative law judge, the late
Francis L. Young, called cannabis &quot;one of the safest
therapeutic agents known to man.&quot;&nbsp; He added that it met
the legal requirement of currently accepted medical use in
treatment in the United States.&nbsp; Young then ordered that
cannabis be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II, so that,
as with morphine and cocaine, it could be prescribed by a doctor.&nbsp;
Regrettably, the politically appointed head of the DEA rejected
this order and continued the DEA's policy of blocking medical
research with cannabis while claiming that there is no medical research
to support its use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The commentary goes on to remind physicians that the AMA
originally opposed the federal Marihuana Tax Act in 1937 (passed
after testimony falsely claiming that cannabis caused violent crimes),
because it would interfere with cannabis' medical use.&nbsp;
Grinspoon and Bakalar conclude by saying that they are &quot;not
asking readers for immediate agreement&quot; that cannabis is
medically useful, but rather, they hope that physicians
&quot;will do more to encourage open and legal exploration of its
potential.&nbsp; The ostensible indifference of physicians should
no longer be used as a justification for keeping this medicine in
the shadows.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It remains to be seen if the extensive media coverage of the <i>JAMA</i>
commentary will lead to more attention to the book, <i>Marihuana,
the Forbidden Medicine</i>, (Yale University Press) by Grinspoon
and Bakalar.&nbsp; This book, published in 1993 and now available
in paperback, has been printed in Germany and France and will
soon be published in Italy.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it has not been reviewed
by a single major newspaper or magazine in the United
States.&nbsp; This blackout persists even though it has been
favorably reviewed by the <i>JAMA</i>, the <i>New England Journal
of Medicine</i>, and even by the conservative <i>National Review</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the meantime, the American mass media continue to give over
$800,000 per day in free advertising to the so-called Partnership
for a Drug-Free (sic) America, founded by the former CEO of a
major pharmaceutical company.&nbsp; The Partnership opposes
medical access to cannabis as a part of its campaigning for the
arrest of sick, dying and disabled Americans who use cannabis rather
than the pharmaceuticals, and the alcohol and tobacco sold by its
funders.&nbsp; How much longer will American physicians be
comfortable supporting the arrest of their patients in company with
the pushers of drugs that kill 500,000 Americans annually?</p>

<p align="center"><b>The Story Of Jimmy Montgomery And Other
American Victims Of Cannabis Prohibition Told At London Human
Rights Conference</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 17,</b> London, U.K.:&nbsp; The violation
of the basic human rights of American cannabis users was the
subject of a panel discussion at the London Human Rights
Conference organized by Liberty, a British rights advocacy
group.&nbsp; For the first time, cannabis users were recognized
along with more familiar victims of government oppression.&nbsp;
Richard Cowan, NORML's National Director spoke on the human
rights violations committed against marijuana users in
America.&nbsp; Cowan told the conference about the shooting of
Scott Bryant and other suspected marijuana users.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Conference attendees were especially shaken by
the plight of Jimmy Montgomery, the paraplegic sentenced to 10
years in Oklahoma prison for less than two ounces of
marijuana.&nbsp; Montgomery remains in prison despite hundreds of
calls from around the world to the Oklahoma governor's office by
readers of NORML's weekly faxes.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is believed that Montgomery may be released
soon -- not because his arrest was unjust or that his sentence
was outrageous or because his life is in danger -- but simply
because Oklahoma prisons are so overcrowded that they must
release someone.&nbsp; While Montgomery's release, for whatever
reason, will be welcomed, the fact that the narcocracy can get
away with such an outrageous injustice, unreported by the
American media, clearly demonstrates that they can effectively
get away with anything.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Walter Cronkite Calls For Bipartisan
Commission To Study Alternatives To Drug War</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 20:</b>&nbsp; On the <i>Discovery Channel</i>
Special, &quot;The Cronkite Report: The Drug Dilemma&quot; Walter
Cronkite [former CBS news anchorman and regarded internationally
as one of the most trusted figures in America---ed.] called the
drug war a failure.&nbsp; Cronkite called for a bipartisan commission
to study the alternatives to prohibition.&nbsp; He concluded by
saying &quot;We cannot go into tomorrow with the same formulas
that are failing today.&quot;&nbsp; [&quot;And that's the way it
is.&quot;---ed.]</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Counting Down</u></b><b>: The Ten
Millionth Marijuana Arrest Will Take Place On July 20, The Last
Day Of A NIDA Anti-Marijuana Propaganda Fest</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Based on projections from the U.S. Justice
Department arrest statistics, NORML has calculated that the ten
millionth marijuana arrest will take place on July 20.&nbsp;
While there is obviously no way of knowing the precise date of
such an event, the July date is a far more reasonable estimate
than most made in Washington.&nbsp; This particular date was
chosen to emphasize the role that government sponsored hate
propaganda, especially the politicized pseudo-science put out by the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) plays in maintaining
marijuana prohibition.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>On </u><b><u>July 19</u></b><u> and </u><b><u>20</u></b>,
NIDA is holding a &quot;National Conference on Marijuana Use:
Prevention, Treatment, and Research.&quot;&nbsp; The reference to
research is particularly ironic given NIDA's role in blocking
research on the medical uses of marijuana.&nbsp; According to
NIDA, the conference is a part of their &quot;Marijuana
Prevention Initiative.&quot;&nbsp; This is aimed at getting the
media to carry more propaganda to support the next ten million
arrests.&nbsp; NORML will be responding to what will undoubtedly
be billed as &quot;the latest research&quot; on marijuana.&nbsp;
This will probably include statements on how pot is far more
potent than it was in the past, even though NIDA's own numbers
show no increase in over ten years. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the weeks ahead, NORML will be attempting to get the media to
report the astronomical arrest statistics. These numbers and the
politicization of science in service to prohibition will be the only
real stories.&nbsp; The ten millionth arrest will be a human
tragedy.&nbsp; If it is ignored, it will be a national disgrace.</p>

Liberty, a London based human rights organization.&nbsp; It is
expected that more than 3,000 people from around the world will

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I hope that the international media and human rights
community will focus on the rising tide of violence and hatred
being inflicted on American cannabis users, which is being
ignored by the American media,&quot; said Cowan.&nbsp; He added,
&quot;having the persecution of cannabis users recognized at this
convention is a historic breakthrough in NORML's efforts to get
the world to count the cost of cannabis prohibition.&quot; <br>

Amsterdam Study Concludes That &quot;Tolerant&quot; Cannabis Laws
Do Not Lead To More Use</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 10,</b> Amsterdam, The Netherlands:&nbsp;
Contrary to what many people assume about the citizens of
Amsterdam, where the sale of cannabis in coffeeshops is allowed,
the majority of the population does not indulge in cannabis or
hashish. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Department of Social Geography of the Univ. of Amsterdam has
monitored the cannabis use of the Amsterdam population (ages 12
years-old and up) since 1987 by means of three large scale
household surveys.&nbsp; According to researcher Dr. Peter Cohen,
observing the period 1987-1994, the average age for first time
cannabis use in The Netherlands is a remarkably high twenty years
of age [as compared to 14 years-old in the U.S.---ed.]!&nbsp; The
research also indicates that despite the high numbers of
&quot;coffeeshops&quot; in The Netherlands, only 25% of the
population have ever used cannabis.&nbsp; In addition, only 6%
admit to using it daily. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">From these extensive surveys, Dr. Cohen has been able to develop
a profile of the &quot;average&quot; cannabis consumer: well
educated, single, outgoing, around thirty years-old, and of Dutch
descent.</p>

they want more: a drug dealer's [users---ed.] back taxes or their
time in jail. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The 14th Court of Appeals was asked to decide whether Mark
Stennett was punished sufficiently when, after his indictment for
marijuana possession, he was billed $49,070 by the State Comptrollers
Office.&nbsp; Since January 1990, the office has been allowed to
pursue such taxes known as the Texas Controlled Substances
Tax.&nbsp; It sells tax stamps to be purchased when a person obtains
contraband. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Citing a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court ruling regarding Montana's tax
stamp, the court decided that since Stennett was paying the tax,
pursuing criminal punishment would constitute double jeopardy.&nbsp;
Defense attorneys have long made such a claim.&nbsp;
&quot;Anybody who has a drug case and also got hit with a drug
tax is entitled to have their case dismissed,&quot; said one of
Stennett's attorneys, Tom Moran, &quot;Any lawyer worth his salt,

<p align="center"><b>Plight Of Oklahoma Paraplegic Pot Prisoner
To Be Topic<br>
At Major London Human Rights Convention</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">London: The continued imprisonment of Oklahoma
paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery will be addressed at a three day
Human Rights Convention to be held in London from June 15 to
17.&nbsp; The Convention, billed as &quot;A Festival of
Rights,&quot; is being sponsored by Liberty, the London based human
rights organization.&nbsp; It is expected that more than 5,000
people from around the world will attend the convention.&nbsp;
This will be the first time that the excesses of America's war on
marijuana users will be recognized as a violation of human rights
comparable to other forms of political persecution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML National Director, Richard Cowan, will be speaking at one
of the convention sessions about the inhumane treatment of Jimmy
Montgomery.&nbsp; Montgomery is a paraplegic who has almost died
several times while serving a ten year sentence in Oklahoma
prisons for less than two ounces of marijuana.&nbsp; Despite
months of calling the Oklahoma Governor's office by hundreds of
concerned Americans, Montgomery is still being held in Oklahoma's
severely overcrowded prisons. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Cowan will also speak about the killings by Wisconsin police of
two suspected cannabis users.&nbsp; One victim was a 15 year-old
boy allegedly shot by a drunken narc.&nbsp; &quot;I hope that the
international media and human rights community will focus on the
rising tide of violence and hatred being inflicted on American
cannabis users, which is being ignored by the American
media,&quot; said Cowan.&nbsp; He added, &quot;having the
persecution of cannabis users recognized at this convention is a historic
breakthrough in our efforts to get the world to count the cost of
cannabis prohibition.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">There will be more than 100 speakers at the convention, including
Pierre Sane, the Secretary General of Amnesty International;
Kader Asmal, a Minister in the South African government; and Lord
Lester, QC. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Back in America, Jimmy Montgomery's parole hearing has been
delayed to July 12, supposedly because the June 21 schedule is
full.&nbsp; NORML urges that concerned citizens continue calling Oklahoma
Governor Keating and other state opinion leaders to urge that
Montgomery's case be dealt with immediately.&nbsp; It is
unfortunate that Oklahoma is to be subjected to international opprobrium
because it cannot find a way to free a man who did not belong in
prison in the first place.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[To reach Governor Frank Keating, call (405)
521-2342 or fax (405) 521-3353.&nbsp; To reach the editors of the
two major newspapers in Oklahoma call 1.) <i>The Daily Oklahoman</i>,

<p align="center"><b>Oregon House Votes To Re-criminalize
Marijuana Possession</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 6,</b> Salem, Oregon:&nbsp; In a surprise
move under new rules that allow for only one hour's notice to be
given before legislative hearings, the Oregon House of
Representatives voted 47 to 13 to re-criminalize the possession
of less than one ounce of marijuana.&nbsp; The bill would raise
the maximum fine for possession from $1,000 to $5,000 and the
minimum fine from $100 to $500 per gram.&nbsp; This would mean a
minimum fine of $2,800 per ounce.&nbsp; Although there is no
direct jail penalty, persons unable to pay the higher fines could
be jailed.&nbsp; The bill also makes it a crime to be &quot;under
the influence&quot; of marijuana without defining just what that
means. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In 1973, Oregon was the first state to decriminalize marijuana,
but it does not have a higher rate of marijuana use than other
states.&nbsp; The sponsor of the bill cited the usual reasons,
the supposed &quot;increase&quot; in potency of marijuana, the
claim that it is the &quot;gateway&quot; to hard drugs (in 1973
it was the &quot;stepping stone&quot;), and the claim that 9 and
10 year-olds are smoking -- so adults mast be arrested. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Critics point out that the bill would cost the state at least one
million dollars per year by requiring the appointment of public
defenders for indigent defendants, plus the cost of imprisoning those
who cannot afford the much higher fines.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This bill demonstrates that Oregon is not immune
to the massive hate campaign against cannabis users being waged
by the prohibitionist establishment and the mass media.&nbsp;
This week, Gannett News Service carried a three-part series
claiming that teenagers who use marijuana just once in a year are
ten times more likely to be involved in violent crimes than
non-users.&nbsp; Of course, no comparable numbers were given for
alcohol use.&nbsp; This is the sort of &quot;reporting&quot; that
leads to the shooting of a 15 year-old by a drunken narc, which
-- of course -- was not mentioned in the Gannett articles.&nbsp;
So much for their concern for teenage violence.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b><u>Update</u></b>:&nbsp; The U.S. Sentencing
Commission is considering an amendment that impacts cannabis consumers.&nbsp;
The following is from the Drug Reform Coordination Network
(DRCNet):</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Earlier this spring, the U.S. Sentencing
Commission passed some amendments to the federal sentencing
guidelines that would reform the penalty structure for certain
drug offenses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>One amendment</u>, passed 7-0, would change the plant-weight
ratio use for marijuana to 1 plant = 100 grams.&nbsp; (Currently
1 plant is considered 100 grams for 49 plants or fewer, but
becomes 1 kilo [1000 grams] for 50 plants or more, with the
effect that defendants convicted for 50 plants spend almost 3
times as long in prison as those convicted for 49 plants.) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>A second amendment</u>, would provide a two point reduction in
offense level for certain non-violent, first time offenders who
qualify for the &quot;safety-valve&quot; exemption included in
last year's Crime Bill.&nbsp; This Amendment essentially matches
the exemption the law now grants from the mandatory minimum
statutes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The amendments will become law if Congress doesn't act by
November 1 to overturn them.&nbsp; <b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>:&nbsp;
What the Sentencing Commission </i><i><u>has not decided</u></i><i>
yet is whether the amendments will apply retroactively to current
inmates.</i> <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Please write the commission and ask them to make the following

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 30,</b> Sacramento:&nbsp; By a vote of
32-3, the State Senate approved a bill that would end California's
unpopular &quot;Smoke A Joint, Lose Your License&quot; law.&nbsp;
The bill, SB 1198, would formally opt out of a federal mandate

driving-related. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 24,</b> Isolated in a cell with no way
even to call for help, paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery endures the
stench of his untreated infections, suffers the pain of having to
tear off soiled bandages without any salve or ointments, and runs
the risk of life-threatening kidney and bladder infections because
guards cannot find the urine bag that his mother sent him.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Governor Keating's office claims to be doing
everything possible. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Governor Keating may be reluctant to look closely at the facts of
the Montgomery case.&nbsp; His office keeps telling callers that
Montgomery must have done something far worse than the trial records
indicate, because they do not want to believe that good people in
a small town, serving as jurors, could have done something so
terrible.&nbsp; He may be reluctant to recognize that the hate propaganda
fostered by the prohibitionist ideology that he espouses could
result in such a great injustice.&nbsp; Governor Keating should
spend a few minutes reviewing the record and then go and visit Jimmy's
prison cell and see and smell the stench of his lesions.&nbsp;
Then he might find the power and the courage to face the
consequences of hatred.&nbsp; The good people of Oklahoma have
been the victims of a crime of unspeakable evil, but it is
necessary to say that we are not damned by the evil done to us,
but rather by the evil done by us.</p>

Brown responded, &quot;The major illegal drug they're experimenting
with is marijuana.&nbsp; Marijuana is 40 times more potent today
than was the case 10, 15, 20 years ago...&nbsp; I don't think

explain why the only large scale testing of contraband marijuana,

Paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery remains in prison, and he is still not
receiving adequate medical care to properly treat his anti-biotic
resistant infections.&nbsp; As a result, his life remains in
danger.&nbsp; However, he is now receiving showers, a change of
clothes, clean bandages (from his mother), and is now able to
wash his clothes separately from the other prisoners.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The office of Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating is telling callers
that they are doing everything possible to get Montgomery
released to house arrest and they are actually urging people to
call and complain to the prosecutor, Richard Dugger, who blocked
his release.&nbsp; Callers have also received various versions of
spin control, depending on whom they talked to.&nbsp; One caller
was told that Montgomery had been selling marijuana to
children.&nbsp; Another was informed that since he was convicted
by a jury, he must have done something much more serious than
what &quot;the propaganda [NORML] is saying,&quot; but that the
state wanted him out of prison because he was costing them too much
money.&nbsp; A third caller was told that the Governor's staff
couldn't understand why this case was getting so much attention,
because they had not read anything about the case in the local media. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Montgomery will eventually be released, <b><i><u>if he doesn't
die first, and if you keep calling the governor's office.</u></i></b>&nbsp;

being treated.&nbsp; The State of Oklahoma may eventually free
him to house arrest, but they will not free the people of Oklahoma
from the chains of a lifetime of hate propaganda.&nbsp; NORML
would be interested in hearing any novel efforts at spin control
callers may have encountered from the governor's office.</p>

find organized opposition and minimal media coverage, which they
had to share with anti-prohibitionists.&nbsp; Bob Keizer, the
Dutch Minister who heads the Department of Alcohol, Drug and
Tobacco Policy of the Dutch Ministry of Health joined a group of
prominent American anti-prohibitionists--including the former
mayor of Hartford--to object to the misrepresentation of European
drug policies at a Press Conference on Monday, May 15th.&nbsp;
The day before the summit, reform activists demonstrated against
the conference from 1 to 4 PM. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The conference, billed as &quot;American Cities Against
Drugs,&quot; was held at tax-payers expense and had promised that
attendees would &quot;Hear from key European mayors about the
devastation Legalization is bringing to their cities.&quot;&nbsp;
Instead, attendees heard the former mayor of Stockholm warn
against flying KLM out of Amsterdam because the pilots may be
stoned on marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The conference was more notable for announcing the formation of a
new prohibitionist propaganda effort by Hollywood known as the
National Drug Prevention League.&nbsp; This was founded by the
Entertainment Industries Council (EIC), which is sponsored by
such great moral leaders as Frank Sinatra, Aaron Spelling, and
Fred Silverman. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Now the wonderful folks who brought us <i>Reefer Madness, Mary
Jane</i>, and other film classics are pushing a new music video,
&quot;Will you be there tomorrow?&quot;&nbsp; The video purports

eyes of children.&quot;&nbsp; Perhaps they will also make other
videos giving us their view -- &quot;as seen through the eyes of
children&quot; -- of other complex issues such as health care
reform, nuclear waste disposal, and flat rate versus progressive
taxation.&nbsp; &quot;Will you be taxed tomorrow?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">EIC says that it will be sponsoring an industry briefing session
on drugs and violence for Orlando-based entertainment executives
in July and is now organizing the industry's &quot;Drugs, Violence

he will remain confined to the prison where he does not even have

<p align="center"><b>PERMISSIBLE MURDERS IN AMERICA: ANOTHER
SUSPECTED MARIJUANA USER KILLED IN HIS HOME BY WISCONSIN POLICE</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 28,</b> Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, Scott W.
Bryant, 29, was shot dead by police as they charged through the
door of his home with a &quot;no-knock&quot; warrant.&nbsp;
Bryant was unarmed and did not resist the police in any
way.&nbsp; His seven year old son, who was sleeping in the next
room, had to watch his father die while an ambulance took 35
minutes to respond.&nbsp; Police later reported finding less than
3 grams of marijuana (one tenth of an ounce, enough for 2 or 3
&quot;cigarettes.&quot;) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This fatal shooting of a suspected marijuana user is just the
latest in a series of killings that have occurred over the last
several years.&nbsp; These incidents have generally been ignored
because the victims are accused of belonging to the one group in
America -- <i>suspected</i> marijuana users -- whom it is
apparently permissible to murder.&nbsp; These victims range from
the multimillionaire Donald Scott, shot dead in 1992 at his
estate near Malibu, to the disabled veteran Gary Shepard in the
hills of Kentucky in 1994.&nbsp; In all three cases the children
of the victims were present.&nbsp; Gary Shepard was killed by a
small army as he stood next to his wife, who was grazed by a
bullet, and his blood splattered on his four year old son.&nbsp;
None of these victims were in any way a threat to anyone.&nbsp; Donald
Scott did not even have any marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Media attention to these killings has ranged from slow to
non-existent.&nbsp; Even the Donald Scott case, which seemed to
have all the ingredients of a major news story -- money, intrigue
and beautiful scenery -- was not covered for more than 90 days
after the killing and was then quickly forgotten.&nbsp; The
police involved were never disciplined.&nbsp; Gary Shepard was a
poor man, a disabled Vietnam veteran who was crippled in Nixon's
war in Asia and killed in Clinton's war in America.&nbsp; His
killers are still on the job.&nbsp; It is unlikely that any
action will be taken against whomever shot Bryant. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The media are looking for an action story with good pictures, so
they find a bunch of &quot;good ol' boys&quot; playing soldier
who say things ranging from the bizarre to the basic.&nbsp;
Somehow it is considered dangerous rhetoric -- and therefore news
-- when militia leaders say that they will defend
themselves.&nbsp; However, NORML has been trying to get the media
to look into the role of the National Guard in marijuana
prohibition for over a year and a half.&nbsp; Our report quotes
the head of the National Guard saying that their job is to make
America drug-free <b><i><u>&quot;using any means necessary, no
matter what the cost.&quot;</u></i></b> (emphasis added) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Meanwhile, as the militias and their conservative allies focus on
the shooting of the wife and son of the heavily armed white
supremacist Randy Weaver in Idaho, they ignore the shootings of citizens
who have been accused of having marijuana -- even when they did
not have any pot at all.&nbsp; Of course, indifference to the
killing of marijuana users is precisely what the mass media have
in common with the militias and politicians.&nbsp; While the
militias prepare for an invasion by the UN, the media are running
around the country looking for heavily armed groups that are a
threat to the rule of law.&nbsp; Both are missing the real
danger: the involvement of the U. S. military in domestic law enforcement
and the extension of unlimited power to the police under the
guise of the &quot;War on Drugs.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">President Clinton has denounced the supposedly inflammatory
rhetoric of his critics, but he ignored the statement last year
by Thomas Constantine, the Director of the Drug Enforcement Administration,
that the &quot;non-violent drug user is a myth.&quot;&nbsp; This
is a blood libel that leads directly to the type of shooting that
occurred in Wisconsin.&nbsp; Former Bush Administration drug
policy advisor John Walters even mocked the suffering of
imprisoned Oklahoma paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery when his case was
reported by ABC television, saying, &quot;Apparently ABC couldn't
find a grandmother on death row for carrying a roach clip in her
purse.&quot;&nbsp; Apparently, the minor technicality of a trial
has been by-passed, execution first, verdict later.&nbsp; Could
all of this be a clue as to why the people no longer trust their
government and the media? <br>

Governor, Tommy Thompson, at (608) 266-1212.]</p>

<p align="center"><b>GOOD NEWS! JIMMY MONTGOMERY TO BE FREED ON
TUESDAY!</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Thanks to the calls by the readers of these
weekly reports, Jimmy Montgomery is expected to be released to
&quot;house arrest&quot; next Tuesday.&nbsp; NORML will issue a
special bulletin as soon as he is free.&nbsp; NORML salutes
Governor Frank Keating, Michael Pearson of Oklahoma NORML, and
all who have worked to end this injustice.</p>

<p align="center"><b>NORML And ACLU Attack Legitimacy Of Anaheim
Law</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 28,</b> Anaheim, In an well publicized
press conference, NORML and the Southern California American
Civil Liberties Union jointly announced that they have filed a
civil rights lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to
actively challenge Anaheim Ordinance No. 5396. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The controversial ordinance adds Sections 13.08.100.010 and
13.08.100.020 to the Anaheim Municipal Code and prohibits certain
prior drug offenders from the right to use public parks <b>for lawful
purposes</b>.&nbsp; This discriminatory legislation singles out
specific individuals from the general public based solely upon
their &quot;criminal&quot; history and forbids them from
participating in the many recreational, aesthetic, cultural,
associational, and other law abiding activities that generally
take place in city parks.&nbsp; Moreover, the restrictive Anaheim
ordinance remains in effect for three years <b>after</b> the
sentence has been served.&nbsp; Consequently, an individual
released from prison for marijuana cultivation in 1995 would be
effectively denied access from entering and/or participating in
any function taking place at a public park until the year
1998.&nbsp; Persons convicted of violating the ordinance face a
maximum six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both NORML and the ACLU charge that the Anaheim ordinance is
unconstitutional.&nbsp; Specifically, the lawsuit, <i>National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) v. City of
Anaheim</i> (95-2813 AAH), asserts that the legislation directly
violates NORML's right to free speech and assembly by precluding
members and speakers with prior drug convictions from both
attending and participating in a public rally for medical
marijuana that is scheduled to take place in La Palma Park.&nbsp;
The May 25th rally is being sponsored by NORML.&nbsp; The lawsuit contends
that, &quot;The absence of these NORML members from the rally
will, [in turn,] deprive the NORML members who can attend of
their right to associate with and exchange views with the absent
members.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML maintains that the Anaheim ordinance will greatly diminish
the force of NORML's message by disallowing several speakers from
voicing their opinions on the need for medical marijuana.&nbsp;
In addition, because the enforcement of Sections 13.08.100.010
and 13.08.100.020 of the Anaheim Municipal code threatens to
exclude citizens who are non-members as well, NORML charges that
the ordinance &quot;interferes with NORML's ability to recruit
new members and to reach the full audience it would otherwise be
able to reach.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The joint lawsuit also alleges that the Anaheim ordinance
violates the plaintiffs' right to petition the government for
redress of grievances and the right to due process. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit is activist and medical
marijuana patient, Craig McClain.&nbsp; Recently convicted for
growing five cannabis plants at his home, McClain is one of
NORML's scheduled speakers who is forbidden from entering La
Palma Park by the ordinance. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In effect, &quot;the Anaheim ordinance makes [McClain's] speech a
crime,&quot; remarked ACLU Staff Attorney Mark Silverstein.&nbsp;
&quot;However well-intentioned, the...ordinance offers a false
hope about combating serious crime.&nbsp; Measures like this let
politicians off the hook, substituting phony rhetoric for
measures that work.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The ACLU and NORML are asking for a preliminary injunction so
that McClain and other plaintiffs can legally attend the rally on
May 25. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information regarding the lawsuit, please contact Mark
Silverstein at Southern Cal. ACLU (213) 977-9500 x264 or Allen
St. Pierre at NORML (202)483-5500.]</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>NORML</b> REITERATES ITS
COMMITMENT TO NON-VIOLENCE</font></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following the tragedy in Oklahoma City, it has
been suggested that groups that are critical of government
policies are somehow encouraging violence.&nbsp; Since its
inception, NORML has had a commitment to non-violence in the
tradition of Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.&nbsp; NORML's principal
message is that marijuana prohibition is unjustified violence
against peaceful marijuana users.&nbsp; There have been almost
ten million marijuana arrests since 1965.&nbsp; Each of these
involves coercion and the threat of state violence.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Cowan, the National Director of NORML
said, &quot;Our message to the government, like that of the
'velvet revolution' that peacefully overthrew Communism in
Czechoslovakia, is that they need not fear us because we are not
like them.&nbsp; We want to end violence, not spread it.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML does not see the proposed anti-terrorist
legislation as a significant new threat to marijuana users, who
have almost no Constitutional rights remaining.&nbsp; It is the
narcocracy, not some &quot;new world order,&quot; that is the
real and present danger to our liberty.&nbsp; For sometime NORML
has been trying to get the media interested in the role of the
National Guard in domestic law enforcement, but to no
avail.&nbsp; As one witty observer complained, &quot;Why is it
that Americans are paranoid about the wrong things?&quot;&nbsp;
The problem with paranoia is that when you are fighting imaginary
devils you cannot see the very real evils.</p>

<p align="center"><b><i>Baltimore Sun</i></b><b>'s Front Page
Afflicted By &quot;Reefer Madness&quot;<br>
DEA Admits Shifting Agents From Cocaine To Marijuana Hunt</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 14,</b> <i>The Baltimore Sun</i> in a
lengthy headline story, &quot;Authorities hit the marijuana
trail, Police see resurgence of '60s drug&quot; pushed most of
the DEA's most successful propaganda lines.&nbsp; <i>The Sun</i>,
once the paper of H.L. Mencken, begins by giving the impression
that marijuana law enforcement has flagged during recent
years.&nbsp; Actually, the number of arrests has been increasing and
the 10 millionth marijuana arrest since 1965 will soon take
place. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article by Marcia Myers also parrots the DEA line that
marijuana is &quot;3 to 5 times stronger than it was 20 years
ago,&quot; although even the head of the National Institute on
Drug Abuse claims only a 3-fold increase and there is little
evidence to support any actual increase.&nbsp; The head of Maryland's
marijuana eradication program is quoted as saying that growers
&quot;have been able to cultivate a crop that will literally
knock your socks off.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition to citing this purported epidemic in barefootedness,
the article says that what it calls &quot;marijuana related&quot;
emergency room admissions have tripled in the last four
years.&nbsp; Actually, these numbers represent only emergency
room &quot;mentions&quot; of marijuana, and do not indicate that marijuana
was the cause of the visit.&nbsp; Had the reporter bothered to
check with the primary source on this data, she would have
learned that approximately 80% of such &quot;mentions&quot;
involve people who are actually having problems with other drugs,
but also &quot;mention&quot; having used marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article did break new ground in two areas:&nbsp; 1.) It
actually reported that forfeiture encourages police to work on
marijuana cases since the police agencies get to keep the
property they seize.&nbsp; 2.) It also revealed that the
Baltimore office of the DEA has shifted agents away from cocaine
cases to go after marijuana.&nbsp; They call this a &quot;more
balanced approach.&quot;&nbsp; This approach would be more
&quot;balanced&quot; only if one thinks that marijuana is somehow
as much a problem as cocaine, which this article implies.&nbsp;
Perhaps in the future <i>The Sun</i> will take a &quot;more
balanced approach&quot; to journalism and include a few more
facts with its ration of DEA propaganda.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Hair Testing For Marijuana Called
Unreliable, But Proceeds Anyway</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 7,</b> In a copyrighted story by C.
Eugene Emery, <i>The Providence Journal</i> reported that even
though the developer of the new hair test for drugs acknowledges
that the test is not a reliable indicator of marijuana use, they
are testing for it anyway. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The test, marketed by Psychemedics of Cambridge, Mass. is
designed to detect trace residues of illicit drugs that may have
been used over the last several months.&nbsp; One advantage of
hair testing over urine testing is that cocaine and heroin are
not detectable in urine after a day or two, while marijuana
metabolites can be detected for weeks.&nbsp; The urine testing
has the effect of encouraging the use of cocaine and other hard
drugs over marijuana.&nbsp; Urine testing is also considered
relatively easy to beat. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the <i>Providence Journal</i> story J. Michael Walsh of the
National Institute for Standards and Technology and former
executive director of President Reagan's Drug Advisory Council
was very critical of the reliability of hair testing in general,
but especially when used for detecting marijuana.&nbsp; Walsh
told the <i>Providence Journal</i> (which uses the hair test)
that, &quot;It is just inappropriate to deny employment or take
adverse action against an employee on the basis of such a
test.&quot; <br>

Pierre at NORML, (202)483-5500.]</p>

<p align="center"><b><i>National Review</i></b><b> Reports On
Jimmy Montgomery; Paraplegic Now Receiving Better Treatment;
Hopeful Of Release Soon.</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In an editorial in its <b>May 1</b> issue,
William F. Buckley, Jr.'s <i>National Review</i> commented on the case
of Jimmy Montgomery, a paraplegic sentenced to 10 years in
Oklahoma prisons for less than 2 ounces of marijuana.&nbsp; <i>NR</i>
noted that former deputy drug czar John P. Walters criticized ABC News
for reporting on the Montgomery case.&nbsp; Walters showed no
concern for Montgomery but rather complained, &quot;Apparently
ABC couldn't find a grandmother on death row for carrying a roach
clip...&quot;&nbsp; NR observes that &quot;something is seriously
wrong with a drug policy that condones such treatment -- a point
that the drug warriors tacitly acknowledge by changing the
subject.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the meantime, Montgomery is now receiving proper medical care
and has been moved to another prison facility.&nbsp; It is hoped
that this move is in preparation for his being released to
&quot;house arrest.&quot;&nbsp; Michael Pearson of Oklahoma NORML
reports that the numerous calls received by the Oklahoma
governor's office helped save Jimmy's life.&nbsp; <i><u>NORML
expresses its gratitude to all who called</u></i>.&nbsp; NORML
also expresses its sympathy to the citizens of Oklahoma City for
the tragic deaths in the Federal Building bombing.&nbsp; Hunting
down these cowardly murderers is the proper use for law
enforcement.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Prohibitionists React Hysterically To ABC
News Program Critical Of Drug Prohibition And Condemn &quot;Drug

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The complaints of John Walters about ABC's
reporting on the Jimmy Montgomery case were in a <i>Washington
Times</i> op-ed article published the day before the ABC program
actually ran.&nbsp; Walters also continued the prohibitionist
practice of claiming that &quot;drug legalization in Europe&quot;
has been a failure.&nbsp; He was later joined in the chorus by A.
M. Rosenthal, former managing editor of <i>The New York Times</i>,
who typically cited Zurich's Needle Park as an example of the
failure of &quot;drug legalization.&quot;&nbsp; None of them
offered any analysis of the Dutch policy of tolerating cannabis sale
in &quot;coffee shops.&quot;&nbsp; Instead they tried to paint
Holland as a violent crime-ridden country.</p>

ADMINISTRATION'S HARASSMENT OF SICK AND DYING AT SAN FRANCISCO
CANNABIS BUYERS CLUB<br>
AGENTS FOLLOW AND VIDEO TAPE PATIENTS AS THEY LEAVE CLUB</b><br>
<b>PREPARING A BUST?</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">April 11 - Over 500 citizens demonstrated
peacefully in front of the Federal Building in San Francisco
against the harassment by DEA agents of patients leaving the
nations largest Cannabis Buyers Club.&nbsp; Agents of the Drug
Enforcement Administration conspicuously followed and video taped
persons leaving the Club.&nbsp; The Club was originally founded
to provide people with AIDS access to cannabis to overcome the
nausea and loss of appetite associated with the disease and the medications
given for it.&nbsp; The Club now openly provides cannabis to over
4,000 sick, dying, and disabled Americans with a wide range of
medical problems.&nbsp; Patients must bring letters from their doctors
saying that no legally available medications help them. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is believed that the DEA's actions may be in preparation for
shutting down the club, which operates in open defiance of the
DEA's suppression of any use or study of cannabis for medical purposes.&nbsp;
A hearing will be held later this month by the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors to determine if the city should declare a
medical emergency to try to forestall any such action by the DEA.&nbsp;
Nothing that the city could do would be legally binding on the
DEA, but it is thought that the DEA might be inhibited by the
fear of adverse publicity.&nbsp; So far the national media have
largely failed to report on the persecution of those who use
cannabis medically, but large scale demonstrations in San
Francisco might draw unwanted attention to this policy.&nbsp;
This is a risk that the DEA may have to take to maintain its
reputation for utter ruthlessness and avoid clear proof of the
need for medical cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When Richard Cowan, NORML's National Director, visited the club
in February a staffer told him that one of the first things they
have to do with their clients is help them get over their fear of their
government.&nbsp; Even in liberal San Francisco, sick, dying, and
disabled Americans have to live in fear of the Federal
government.&nbsp; This harassment of people leaving the Club may
also be intended to reinstall such a fear.&nbsp; The Club will be
open on Good Friday.&nbsp; Will the DEA crucify the helpless? <br>

<p align="center"><b>MEANWHILE IN OKLAHOMA, PARAPLEGIC JIMMY
MONTGOMERY IS HAND-CUFFED TO A PRISON BED; LIFE IN DANGER; DENIED

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">April 13 - Lexington, OK, Jimmy Montgomery, a
paraplegic who was featured on a recent ABC News Special about
the excesses and failures of the Drug War, spends his days
handcuffed to a prison bed in Oklahoma without adequate medical
treatment for the anti-biotic resistant infections in his lower
body.&nbsp; He is no longer in a cell with 40 other prisoners,
but he has no access to a shower, even though the prison in which
he is confined received Federal funds two years ago for building
such a facility for the disabled. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Friends believe that Montgomery, who is serving 10 years for less
than 2 ounces of marijuana, may die within days if he is not
moved to University Hospital in Oklahoma City.&nbsp; There he
could be properly treated and could be visited by his mother who
is unable to visit him in prison.&nbsp; What a mockery it would
be if he died over Easter weekend while politicians, bureaucrats
and prison guards celebrate their &quot;salvation.&quot;&nbsp;

Recommendations To Reform Federal Sentencing Guidelines For
Marijuana</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">April 10 - Washington, D.C. -- The U.S.
Sentencing Commission announced it's approval of a proposed
amendment (#37) to federal sentencing guidelines pertaining to
the government's assigned weight of marijuana produced per plant. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since the late 1980's, the federal guidelines for domestically
grown marijuana offenses have not been based on the actual weight
of the plants, but rather on an arbitrarily assigned weight equivalent.&nbsp;
Under the current guidelines, 49 plants or fewer are considered
to weigh 100 grams each, but 50 or more plants are considered to
weigh 1,000 grams each. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Commission was persuaded by representatives from NORML, The
Drug Policy Foundation, Families Against Mandatory Minimums
(FAMM) and the Cato Institute who testified that <u>present
guidelines have created a &quot;sentencing cliff&quot; in which
persons convicted of cultivating 50 plants must be incarcerated
up to four times longer than an individual convicted of
cultivating 49 plants</u>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Further, a change in the guidelines helps to rectify the
&quot;home cultivation/bulk possession&quot; discrepancy.&nbsp; <i><u>For
example</u></i>: an individual convicted of cultivating marijuana
must serve the same five year sentence as someone who possessed
99 kilograms (218 pounds) of 'packaged' marijuana, despite the
fact that the plants would have produced less than 10 kilograms
(22 pounds) of usable marijuana.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The U.S. Sentencing Commission voted 7-0 to
approve a 100 gram per plant ratio for all plants, <i>regardless</i>
of the number involved.&nbsp; Unless Congress intervenes, the
Sentencing Commission's recommendations will become law on
November 1, 1995. <br>

<p align="center"><b><u>Update</u></b><b>: Jimmy Montgomery
Shares Prison Cell With 40 Prisoners</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 6,</b> Wheelchair-bound Jimmy Montgomery
has been forced to share a cell with <i>forty</i> other prisoners
who risk infection from the chronic anti-biotic resistant
infections afflicting the lower half of his body.&nbsp; On
Monday, Jimmy was picked up by law enforcement officials and sent
back to prison in Lexington, Oklahoma to serve the balance of a
ten year sentence for possession of less than two ounces of
pot.&nbsp; According to Oklahoma NORML Coordinator Michael
Pearson, cannabis reform activists in Oklahoma (and nationwide)
have been calling the Governor and the chief of the Bureau of
Corrections. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Pearson says that &quot;Jimmy's case is getting incredible
statewide media exposure.&nbsp; The Montgomery case is seen by
even the most conservative politicians as demonstrating why non-violent
offenders shouldn't be taking up valuable prison space.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[The Governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating, can be
reached at 405-521-2342.&nbsp; OK NORML, Michael Pearson, can be

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile... Willie Nelson's Pot Charges
Dropped</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 4, Waco, TX</b> About the time that
Oklahoma was re-imprisoning Jimmy Montgomery, an undoubtedly
relieved McLennan County District Attorney decided to drop
marijuana possession charges against Willie Nelson rather than
appeal an adverse cour ruling.&nbsp; The court had ruled that the
enormously popular Texas singer/songwriter had not been properly
advised of his rights and also that there was not probable cause
to search his Mercedes.&nbsp; Police had spotted the remains of an
alleged marijuana cigarette in the ash tray of Nelson's car when
they found Nelson taking a roadside nap.&nbsp; Since many Texans
who drive Mercedes roll their own tobacco cigarettes as an economy
measure, the police were not justified in assuming that the
cigarette was anything other than harmless tobacco, which is
still legal.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Nelson is very candid about his marijuana use and
has even talked about having smoked marijuana on the roof of the
White House when Jimmy Carter was President -- a few years after Montgomery
was paralyzed in an industrial accident.&nbsp; Had Nelson been
tried and convicted he could have been sentenced to six months in
jail ... and the District Attorney might have had to leave the
country.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[The contrast between the treatment of Nelson
with that of Jimmy Montgomery illustrates the extreme disparity
in consequences for the one thousand Americans who are arrested
everyday on marijuana charges.&nbsp; For some, it is only an
embarrassment.&nbsp; Others find their lives ruined.&nbsp; It is better
to be rich, famous and healthy than to be poor, obscure and
crippled -- especially if you want justice.]</p>

<p align="center"><b>Police Chief Of Hawaii County Suffers From A
Case Of 'Reefer Madness'</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 24,</b> In a letter written to U.S.
President Bill Clinton, Hawaii County Police Chief Wayne G.
Carvalbo stated: &quot;We request the reference to
&quot;hemp&quot; be deleted from executive Order Number 12919 ...
From a local law enforcement standpoint, we view the promotion of
hemp in Executive Order 12919 as a vehicle being utilized by pro
marijuana groups to promote the legalization of marijuana.&nbsp;
The proponents are using the false environmental arguments to
promote the use of a drug that bears substantial health risks to
the user.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>OKLAHOMA RE-IMPRISONS PARAPLEGIC JIMMY
MONTGOMERY ON POT CHARGE; FAMILY FEARS FOR HIS LIFE</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">April 4 - Today the State of Oklahoma
re-imprisoned paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery who has been confined
to a wheelchair for over twenty years and who suffers from
chronic anti-biotic resistant infections in his lower body.&nbsp;
Montgomery was sentenced in 1992 to ten years in prison for
possession of less than two ounces of marijuana.&nbsp; In 1993,
after serving almost a year of his sentence and nearly dying
twice because of the failure of the state of Oklahoma to provide adequate
treatment for the highly communicable infections, Montgomery was
released on an appeals bond arranged by NORML Legal Committee
member C. Rabon Martin.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Montgomery was actually convicted of possession
with intent to distribute marijuana, based on the testimony of an
acquaintance who had been arrested -- by a lawman named Lawless
-- for cocaine possession.&nbsp; This man was then given a
lighter sentence in exchange for testifying against Montgomery.&nbsp;
The police then attempted to seize the house in which Montgomery
lived.&nbsp; The house belongs to his elderly mother and there
was never any allegation that she knew of any of the alleged
marijuana use.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marijuana is widely -- but illegally -- used by
people with spinal chord injuries for the relief of pain and
spasm in their paralyzed limbs.&nbsp; Presumably the state of
Oklahoma will give Montgomery opiates, tranquilizers and muscle
relaxers instead of marijuana.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the state
previously failed to provide adequate medical care for him, which
endangered not only Montgomery, but also the other prisoners with
whom he was confined.&nbsp; Montgomery's family fears for his
life, not only from the infections, but also from other prisoners
who may fear infection by being confined with him.</p>

<p align="left">(Montgomery was also convicted of possession of
&quot;drug paraphernalia&quot; -- pipes -- and of possession of
two guns in the commission of a drug related felony.&nbsp;
Drive-by shootings by people in wheelchairs are a major problem
in small towns in Oklahoma.&nbsp; The only evidence of intent to distribute
was the testimony of another officer who claimed that he had
never seen anyone with two ounces who was not a major
dealer.&nbsp; This officer was subsequently arrested and charged
with embezzling from the police property room.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction
and sentence based solely on this officer's testimony -- <i>without
issuing a written opinion to explain this action</i>.)</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Montgomery's appearances at the National Press
Club and at a protest in front of the White House on November 15,
1994, National Medical Marijuana Day, were ignored by the
national media -- although some did complain about the smell of
marijuana smoke at the Press Club.&nbsp; NORML notes that Thomas
Jefferson said &quot;I tremble for my country when I reflect that
God is just; that his justice cannot sleep forever.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mr. Montgomery's attorney, C. Rabon Martin will
be seeking a writ of habeas corpus in U.S. District Court in
Oklahoma City.&nbsp; Martin can be reached at 918-587-9000.&nbsp;
The Governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating, can be reached at
405-521-2342.&nbsp; An ABC Television News Special &quot;<u>America's
War on Drugs: Searching for Solutions</u>&quot; will feature the
Jimmy Montgomery story on Thursday, April 6 at 10PM Eastern.</p>

<p align="center">... a weekly service for the media on news
items related to Marijuana Prohibition. </p>

<p align="center">March 30, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b>Editor of Arkansas Times Comes out of Her
&quot;Smoky Little Closet&quot;</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing in her regular column, Mara Leveritt, the senior
editor of the widely respected weekly <i>Arkansas Times</i>
revealed that she has smoked an average of one &quot;joint&quot;
per day for the last twenty years.&nbsp; Leveritt, who was named
Arkansas Journalist of Year by the University of Arkansas explained
that her purpose was not to encourage the use of marijuana, but
to spur a more rational discussion of marijuana
prohibition.&nbsp; By speaking out she hopes to make it more
difficult to demonize marijuana users. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">She said that &quot;we have come to accept as normal a most
dangerous form of political correctness: a situation in which
those on one side of the issue feel safe to speak, while any would-be
opposition exposes itself to heightened scrutiny.&quot;&nbsp; She
went on to say that &quot;If long term, regular users like myself
felt free to articulate their experiences with marijuana, the
walking, talking evidence that we represent would put our
marijuana laws to shame....&nbsp; And as we get older, our lives
begin to make the lies that have been broadcast about marijuana
look even more ridiculous.&quot; </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the Associated Press story on the article, Leveritt
acknowledged having belonged to NORML. NORML salutes her courage
and urges others who talk about the truth to stop living a lie.&nbsp;
Speaking the truth is a wonderfully liberating experience.&nbsp;
We have it on the highest authority that it will make us free. </p>

<p align="center">[Ms. Leveritt can be reached at 501-375-2985.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Alleged white House Shootist Reportedly
Smoked Pot and Listened to Rush Limbaugh<br>
A Dangerous Combination?</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the testimony of a friend, Francisco Duran, who
is accused of spraying the White House with bullets, allegedly
smoked marijuana and listened to Rush Limbaugh before setting out for
Washington.&nbsp; His friend who smoked marijuana with him, but
did not listen to Rush Limbaugh, said he tried to talk him out of
his plan to attack the President.&nbsp; Since marijuana -- unlike
alcohol -- is not conimonly associated with acts of violence,
marijuana users who listen to Rush Limbaugh are urged to watch
out for violent impulses. </p>

<p align="center"><b>New Test Allows Parents to Test Their
Children's Rooms for &quot;Drugs&quot;</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a major breakthrough in the technology of cementing family
values Barrington Technologies of New Providence, New Jersey, has
introduced a home drug detection kit, &quot;DrugAlert,&quot; that allows
parents to surreptitiously check their children's room and
personal belongings for drug residues. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A March 29 <i>Washington Post</i> story on the test quoted a
staff therapist at the Family Therapy Institute of Alexandria,
Virginia, saying that &quot;It usually takes two or three years
after a child is using before their behavior becomes so deviant
that parents are aware of their drug use, and by that time they
are well into addiction.&quot;&nbsp; He did not suggest at what
age parents might start using these tests, but presumably it
should be up to three years before there is any indication of a
problem.&nbsp; According to the Partnership for a Drug-Free (sic)
America, the median age of first drug use by children is 12 and
half.&nbsp; Therefore regular testing might begin at age 9.&nbsp;
The <i>Washington Post</i> story also reported on home urine
tests that are being sold.&nbsp; Parents can also collect their
children's urine samples from an early age.&nbsp; There are
conflicting opinions on the relative merits of surreptitious and
forced testing as tools to help the child mature in a drug-free
environment. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The DrugAlert kit supplies a small pre-moistened pad which
picks up drug residues when wiped across items that may have come
into contact with illicit drugs.&nbsp; To demonstrate the technology,
company executives spread cocaine over common objects - such as a
baseball trophy which one would expect a drug using child to
bring into contact with drugs.&nbsp; The surfaces were then wiped
with the DrugAlert pad and the pad was tested and demonstrated
the presence of the cocaine.&nbsp; It was not explained <i>where</i>
the company got the cocaine, whether from the DEA, the CIA, or
the Iran/Contra connection. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The company warns that children might pick up drug residues
without actually using drugs, and a company executive also
admitted that the company had not considered the possibility that children
might use the test to check their parents rooms for drugs.&nbsp; <u>Perhaps
the D.A.R.E. program could provide children with the tests so
that more parents could be reported to the police and thereby
saved from drugs</u>.&nbsp; Employers [such as editors or
producers -ed.] might test their employees' personal belongings
to detect drug traces.&nbsp; Presumably the tests will not detect
the residues of alcoholic beverages so that teenage binge
drinking will not be detected and personal liberty will not be
undermined. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Plants Thrive In Downtown Tel Aviv<br>
Is Marijuana Decriminalization Coming To Isreal?</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 24, The <em>Jerusalem Post</em> (JP) ran an article
featuring the actions of the country's most evident marijuana
reform organization, The Green Revolution. </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * Israel has a growing marijuana-smoking population and many
    of them believe that the drug, being natural rather than
    chemical, should be legalized. 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Recently, the drive towards legalized growing and smoking of
cannabis gained new momemtum.&nbsp; While the legalization
movement has been going on here for some time, the movement in
Tel Aviv has exploded.&nbsp; Over the past year, there have been
rallies and smoke-ins at Tel Aviv nightclubs, and organizers have
produced T-shirts, bumper stickers, buttons and pamphlets carrying
the familiar shape of the cannabis leaf. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">But buttons and signs aren't enought to bring about such a
radical change.&nbsp; [Marijuana reform group] The Green
Revolution has discovered the green thumb.&nbsp; Armed with
seedlings and a smile, about 15 revolutionaries have turned to
gardening.&nbsp; Their mission: to turn Tel Aviv into a marijuana jungle. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On one Friday afternoon in January, members of the group targeted
the Tel Aviv landscape, tilling the soil with about 1,000
seeds.&nbsp; The result: marijuana is growing all over downtown
Tel Aviv. 

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * [The JP further reports] After the Green Revolution made
    its strategy public, hundreds of others planted seeds, and
    not just in Tel Aviv.&nbsp; Sprouts have been spotted in Or
    Yehuda and Givatayim.&nbsp; Budding cannabis has been spotted
    around Tel Aviv City Hall, in the planters of Carlebach Steet
    office buildings and down other main streets. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * [But, there are detractors. -ed.] Dr. Benny Avrahami,
    director of the Tel Aviv Municipal Anti-Drug Authority. He
    admits that marijuana is hardly in the same league as hard
    drugs...though he considers marijuana to be the
    &quot;gate-opener&quot; to harder drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * Avrahami thinks that legalizing marijuana could lead to the
    collapse of Isreali society. 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;<i><u>If marijuana was to become legalized, in my opinion,
it would be social suicide for Isreal</u></i> [emphasis added
-ed.].&nbsp; So many of our youth would feel free to use it and
the more users, the more addicts.&nbsp; How can we afford to have
this when they are in the army and part of a society that may be
called up at a short notice to serve?&quot; 

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * One month after the fast seeds were planted, the group set
    out to see what had become of their gardening
    adventure.&nbsp; The payoff: 5-cm.-high marijuana plants around
    downtown... [Green Revolution members] will continue their
    fight for legalization, planting and campaigning, because
    they really want to be law-abiding citizens.&nbsp; But until
    that happens-- they'll just keep breaking the law.

<p align="center"><b>Alcohol Industry Association Hires Former
Head Of Drug Enforcement Administration</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">John C. Lawn, the former head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) has been appointed as Chairman and CEO of
the &quot;Century Council,&quot; which is described in the
March/April issue of <i>Healthy Drinking</i> magazine as being
&quot;the most prominent of the hundreds of programs supported by
the licensed beverage industry.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The appointment is seen as an extension of the efforts of the
alcohol industry to separate itself from the illegal drugs.&nbsp; <i>Healthy
Drinking</i>, supported by the alcohol industry, hails the
appointment, &quot;anxiously&quot; hoping that Lawn's connections
in the prohibitionist propaganda industry will help de-couple
alcohol from other drugs in prohibitionist propaganda. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The magazine wrongly states that the DEA has &quot;scrupulously
avoided confusing use with abuse and drinking with drugging, a
stance which seems beyond the ken of other federal agencies like Health
and Human Services.&quot;&nbsp; The alcohol industry seems
unaware that the DEA is now claiming that alcohol prohibition was
a success.&nbsp; For example, an official 1994 DEA publication,
&quot;How to Hold Your Own in A Drug Legalization Debate&quot;
(page 29) cites two prohibitionists who claim that alcohol
prohibition worked because it reduced alcohol consumption.&nbsp;
The Michigan Drug Czar Robert Peterson is quoted as saying that
&quot;Since the repeal of Prohibition, alcohol consumption has tripled.&quot;&nbsp;
This sort of statement is common in prohibitionist
propaganda.&nbsp; Much of the hard core constituency of drug
prohibition <i>also</i> supports alcohol prohibition -- but they
generally keep it low key. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Meanwhile, the magazine approvingly quotes Lawn using a standard
DEA line: &quot;Illicit drugs .... are illegal because they are
dangerous.&quot;&nbsp; Does this indicate that the alcohol
industry is betting its future on the assertion that alcohol is <u>not</u>
&quot;dangerous&quot; by the standards of a government that is waging
a war on marijuana, which by every objective measure is far less
dangerous than alcohol? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Cowan, the National Director of NORML, said that
&quot;the appointment of Lawn is not only cynical and
hypocritical, but also very misguided.&nbsp; The alcohol industry
is not going to protect itself from the prohibitionists by
pretending that alcohol isn't a drug.&nbsp; Lawn may well be able
to marginally influence some of the prohibitionist propaganda or
legislation passed by alcohol using (and abusing) legislators,
but this is more likely to lull the alcohol industry into
unwarranted complacency rather than to protect them. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The alcohol and tobacco industries need to learn that their best
protection from the therapeutic state is to tell the truth about
freedom and stop trying to pretend that their products aren't
'drugs.'&nbsp; Further, does the alcohol industry really want to
declare war on its natural allies in the anti-prohibitionist
movement in order to appease the prohibitionists who have them
next on their lists?&nbsp; Who is advising the alcohol industry
on this, the ghost of Neville Chamberlin?&nbsp; Or perhaps the
ghost of Harry Anslinger?&quot; </p>

Drinking</i> at 206-525-0449.&nbsp; For more information of a

therapy rather than incarceration. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The hour takes Crier to cities around the country, and to Europe,

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to <i>AP</i>, three South American nations --
Argentina, Uruguay and Venezuela -- already have systems similar

<p align="center">March 16, 1995 </p>

<p align="center"><b>NORML Testifies Before U.S. Sentencing
Guideline Commission</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 15, Washington, D.C., NORML National Legal Committee
member Marvin Miller, Esq., of Alexandria, VA led a group of
NORML witnesses who testified before the U.S. Sentencing
Commission and urged the adoption of proposed guideline changes
that would benefit marijuana-related defendants in federal court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Miller, a former member of the NORML Board of Directors and a
nationally prominent criminal defense attorney, urged the
commission to adopt two proposed guideline changes.&nbsp; The first,
proposed amendment #37, would correct an inequity in the current
guidelines regarding the weight assigned to marijuana plants, for
purposes of sentencing.&nbsp; Currenfly, if the offense involves less
than 50 marijuana plants, each plant is presumed to weigh 100
grams.&nbsp; However, if the offense, involves 50 plants or more,
each plant (including the first 49) is presumed to weigh one kilo
(1000 grams).&nbsp; This formula has created a &quot;sentencing
cliff&quot;-- causing an individual convicted of possessing 50
plants to receive a significantly longer sentence than an
individual convicted of possessing 49 or fewer plants; and an
individual convicted of possessing 100 plants (even if they are
seedlings) is sentenced the same as someone convicted of
distributing 100 kilos of bulk marijuana (although the 100
seedlings would not possibly produce anywhere near that amount of usable
marijuana). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Miller testified that the 100 gram per plant formula reflects
more accurately the actual potential yield from a single
marijuana plant, and urged the Commission to amend the guidelines
accordingly. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Miller also testified in favor of proposed guideline amendment
#42, regarding the treatment of wet marijuana (fleshly harvested
marijuana) for sentencing purposes.&nbsp; Currently the wet
marijuana is weighed as is, with the defendant receiving a longer
sentence under the current weight-driven guidelines.&nbsp; Under
the proposed amendment, when marijuana has a moisture content
sufficient to render it unusable without drying it, an
approximation of the weight without such excess moisture content
is to be used.&nbsp; Miller told the Commission they should be
looking at the usable amount of marijuana, rather than the bulk
amount -- for sentencing purposes generally -- and urged them to scale
back the penalties overall. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, NORML Board member David Boaz, Executive Vice
President of the Cato Institute, testified on behalf of the
Institute regarding marijuana.&nbsp; Boaz pointed out to the Commission
that there were approximately 784 marijuana offenders convicted
in 1992 for whom the minimum guideline range was greater than the
applicable minimum mandatory sentence.&nbsp; &quot;The cost of
keeping those 784 people in prison for one year is
$16,310,000.&nbsp; If we estimate that they would average four
additional years in prison based on current guidelines, the
taxpayers would be paying more than $65 million in additional
costs for those prisoners...&nbsp; We would be better served by
keeping violent criminals in prison longer by freeing up beds now
used by marijuana offenders.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Other NORML witnesses included former Board member and
cultivation expert Ed Rosenthal of California, and NORML/BACH
activist Lennice Werth of Virginia (who uses marijuana as a medicine).&nbsp;
Rosenthal focused on the issue of the presumed weight of a
marijuana plant, and Werth urged the Commission to find a way in
the guidelines to accommodate those who cultivate marijuana for
medical use.&nbsp; These standout activists were joined by FAMM
Director Julie Stewart and the Drug Policy Foundation Legislative
Director Cheryl Epps.&nbsp; Also present, but not testifying, was
NORML Board member Keith Stroup. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[The U.S. Sentencing Commission's recommendations will become law
in 180 days unless the Congress enacts laws otherwise.&nbsp; For
more information on the U.S. Sentencing Commission hearings and
the time frame in which the Commission can act on NORML's
recommendations, contact the U.S. Sentencing Commission's office

<p align="center"><b>U.S. Congressman Seeks To Halt Free-Speech
On Information Superhighway</b><br>
<b>(Or George Orwell Call Home)</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">October 6, Washington, D.C., prohibition fanatic U.S.
Representative Gerald B.H. Solomon (R-NY) extended his opposition
to any criticism of prohibition to include the Intemet.&nbsp; The following
are excerpts from an October 6 speech Rep. Solomon delivered on
the House floor: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Mr. Speaker, it was recently brought to my attention that
drug legalization advocates are using the electronic information
superhighway to organize the legalization movement and share information
on drug use.&nbsp; The information superhighway was certalnly not
created to propagate such misinformation and the criminal
activity associated with it.&nbsp; This use was brought to my attention
by drug legalization opponents who use the information
superhighway everyday in their vocations.&nbsp;
[Anti-prohibitionists don't use computers in their vocations?
-ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Apparently the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML) recently entered remarks which I personally made in
opposition to drug legalization on this House floor as an example
of 'rabid, right-wing prohibitionist propaganda.'&nbsp; Because I
believe, along with 95 percent of America [myth of consensus
-ed.], that the use of illicit drugs is wrong, I was singled out as
an enemy of drug users.&nbsp; Well, Mr. Speaker, I am
honored.&nbsp; <b><i>The use of illegal drugs is an anathema to
the social and moral fabric of our Nation</i></b>.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Pro-drug use and legalization messages on the information
superhighway through Internet are wrong...&nbsp; As more and more
Americans jump onto this latest technological advancement, more
and more citizens will have access to this ill-advised
information.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Drug legalization advocates from all over the country are
using this universal technology to further their movement and
deceive Americans.&nbsp; As Congress reviews this very important technology
during the 104th Congress, the use of this service by pro-drug
organizations and individuals for the propagation of this ilk
must be addressed.&nbsp; <b><i>As a nation founded on the freedoms
of speech and press, the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness must not be trampled by the disease of illegal drugs</i></b>.&quot;&nbsp;
[Emphasis added -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML National Director Richard Cowan comments:
&quot;Representative Solomon continues to demonstrate his fear of
free and open discussion.&nbsp; This is typical of the statist
mind-set.&nbsp; NORML believes that freedom has nothing to fear
from the truth--so it is appropriate that Solomon is running
scared.&quot; </p>

<p align="center"><b>'Drug Peace' In the Middle East?</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 14, The <i>Hayward Daily Review</i> reports that &quot;a

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 13, <i>Reuters</i> reports that U.S. authorities have
notified David Chandler, 42, that his death sentence will be
carried out March 30 in the first federal execution in 32 years. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to <i>Reuters</i>, Chandler was convicted in 1991 in
Alabama of hiring another individual to kill a member of his
marijuana smuggling ring who had become an informant.&nbsp;
Chandler is the first federal inmate to receive a death sentence
under the 1988 Omnibus Crime Bill.&nbsp; The federal Bureau of
Prisons sald five other inmates are awaiting execution under the
same drug kingpin law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>Reuters</i> reports that prison officials acknowledged that
Chandler's execution, which would be carried out by lethal
injection, could be delayed by his filing of a new appeal. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[NORML <b><i><u>strongly</u></i></b> protests the potential
execution of David Chandler.&nbsp; Mr. Chandler should not be
exposed to an ill-conceived death penalty statute solely because
of his alleged role in a marijuana trafficking operation.&nbsp;
Executing this man, in the name of the 'Drug War', will not deter
or hinder a single nanogram's worth of &quot;drugs&quot; from
being cultivated, sold or consumed in the U.S.&nbsp; <u>So why do
it</u>?&nbsp; For more information on Mr. Chandler's dreadful

depression.&nbsp; In time, McLemore received a prescription for
Marinol [synthetic marijuana pill -ed.].&nbsp; McLemore found that
Marinol not only stabilized his depression, it also curbed his
craving for alcohol.&nbsp; Due to the high cost and very limited
quantities of Marinol, McLemore supplemented medication with marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Finally able to lead a normal life, McLemore got a law degree,
became an assistant district attorney, and eventually opened his
own law office. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Upon his arrest in February, McLemore, after posting bond,
returned to jail because he felt as though he could not honor the
judges order that he not consume marijuana while out on
bond.&nbsp; McLemore stated that he didn't want to have his
mother lose her home (McLemore's mother put her home up for the
$l00,000 bond) because of his desperate need for an effective
medicine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">During McLemore's hunger strike, he has lost as much as 25
pounds.&nbsp; McLemore, in an issued statement from jail,
reported by the <i>Beaumont Enterprise</i>, said, &quot;Uncaring
legislatures, that have been totally corrupted by money, have
denied me and millions of others the relief this wonderful plant
provides.&nbsp; I have no liberty; the pursuit of happiness has
been denied me; and life is therefore a burden that I'm anxious
to relinquish. </p>

Positive Drug Tests -- Except MARIJUANA!</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 6, SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories reported
that there has been a drastic reduction in the number of people
testing positive for drug use -- while at the same time, the rate
of positive test results for marijuana shot up. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">SmithKline found that of more than 3.6 million drug tests
performed at their labs last year, 7.5 percent were positive for

percent. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The <i>Associated Press</i> reports that SmithK1ine Beecham said
&quot;a change in the screening threshold for marijuana required

in positive tests for marijuana use.&nbsp; [<b>NORML</b>
agrees.&nbsp; Beginning on January 1, DOT regulations mandate
that the threshold for positive marijuana screen be lowered from

Cannabis Buyers' Club</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 26, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> published a detailed
article on the Cannabis Buyers' Club in San Francisco.&nbsp; The
following are selected excerpts; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This is a different kind of drug store...dozens of people sit on
rummage-sale couches and folding chairs, smoking high-grade
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is business as usual at the Cannabis Buyers' Club, a
flourishing illegal marijuana market rooted in civil
disobedience.&nbsp; But this is a club no rational person would
aspire to join.&nbsp; Doing your shopping here means you are sick
or dying. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The underground pharmacy is part of a growing movement aimed at
gaining sick people the right to use marijuana.&nbsp; Across the
country thousands of patients with AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, epilepsy,
multiple sclerosis and other illnesses defy the law daily to
treat their ailments or ease their pain. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In San Francisco, long known for its tolerance, authorities have
chosen to ignore the law, saying that sick people who can benefit
from the plant should be able to buy it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">'I have no problem whatsoever with the use of marijuana for
medical purposes,&quot; said [San Francisco] Mayor Frank Jordan,
a former police chief.&nbsp; &quot;I am sensitive and
compassionate to people who have legitimate needs.&nbsp; <u>We
should bend the law and do what's right</u>.&quot;&nbsp;
[Emphasis added -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[In opposing the use of marijuana as medicine] Mike Heald, Drug
Enforcement Administration spokesman, said marijuana is strictly
controlled because the public does not believe that smoking it is
proper behavior.&nbsp; [Mr. Heald is enveloped in the &quot;myth
of consensus&quot; -ed.] He said marijuana, like alcohol and
tobacco, is a &quot;gateway&quot; substance that leads to the use
of hard drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and LSD -- a contention
disputed by marijuana advocates. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The club was founded in 1991, and more than 3,000 people bearing
notes from their doctors have flocked to the...club. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Some that have claimed to have benefited from the club] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* AIDS patient Jon Bush gained 30 pounds in the past six months
[with the use of marijuana] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* Hazel Rodgers, 75, volunteers her time at the club while at the
same time using marijuana to treat her glaucoma.&nbsp; Rodgers
was referred to the club by [SF] county supervisor Angela Alioto. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am an extremely strong advocate of medicinal
marijuana,&quot; Alioto said, &quot;I saw it work&quot;.&nbsp; [Alioto's
late husband used marijuana to treat the adverse reaction from
his cancer chemotherapy treatments. -ed.] </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 1, Sacramento, CA, California Assemblyman John
Vasconcellos (D-San Jose) is sponsoring a medical marijuana bill,
AB 1597, which would exempt patients with a physician's recommendation
from laws against personal possession and cultivation of
marijuana.&nbsp; The bill is similar to the medical marijuana
initiative being proposed by Californians for Compassionate Use (CCU)
for the 1996 ballot. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Iowa State Senators Urge Senator Harkin To
Support Medical Marijuana Research</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 21, Three prominent state senators from Iowa sent a
letter to Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) prodding him to pressure the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to allow a long
delayed medical study of the therapeutic effects of marijuana on
patients with AIDS.&nbsp; [This letter is representative of the
numerous letters that have been sent by elected state officials
all over the U.S. to federal representatives and officials within
the government.&nbsp; To date, 36 states have passed legislation
expressing their desire to see marijuana be made more readily
available for patients coping with life and/or sense-threatening
diseases or ailments.&nbsp; The problem is a recalcitrant and
unresponsive federal bureaucracy. -ed.] A selected excerpt of the
IA state senators letter follows: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We are respectfully asking that you consider contacting Dr.
Philip Lee, Asst. Sec. for HHS, and express your support for
allowing the first research project concerning medical marijuana
in over a decade.&nbsp; Our only objective is to find out exactly
how safe and effective marijuana is in treating glaucoma,
multiple sclerosis, AIDS and AIDS-related wasting syndrome, and
cancer.&nbsp; Many patients in Iowa, as well as the rest of the
United States, are eagerly anticipating the results from Dr.
Abrams' study [the long delayed study -ed.], and we ask that you
encourage this to happen.&quot; </p>

<p align="center"><b>Liberty Lovers -- Beware The Ides Of March!</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Excerpts from FIJA release] On March 15, wholesale florist
Yvonne Regas of Sparks, NV will be arraigned in U.S. District
Court in Reno, on charges of (1) Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice; (2)
Aiding and abetting Obstruction of Justice; and (3) Jury
Tampering. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Before deciding that such dastardly behavior deserves swift, sure
punishment -- such as the three to six years in prison this could
cost Ms. Regas, if convicted -- consider what she actually did:
she and a few friends put brochures published by Fully Informed
Jury Association (FIJA) under the wiper blades of cars parked
near the courthouse, during the trial of her son and ex-husband,
among others, on drug charges.&nbsp; That's it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">These brochures -- which have been distributed similarly by
untold numbers of people at hundreds of court houses around the
country over the past five years -- explain the rights, powers, and
responsibilities of trial jurors.&nbsp; Often, the brochures are
handed to all who enter the court house. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The point of the leafleting has been to advise jurors that they
possess the power to judge the law itself, and not just &quot;the
facts&quot;, as most modern jury instruction insist.&nbsp;
&quot;Jury nullification of law&quot; means that &quot;the
governed -- if informed of their power as jurors -- can
&quot;just say no&quot; to bad laws, and thereby check and
balance the government.&nbsp; [It is for this reason that NORML
supports the efforts of FIJA. Just imagine if every juror in a
marijuana-related case knew that they possess the power and
authority to nullify &quot;bad law&quot;.&nbsp; Is it possible
that there would be a marked reduction in criminal convictions
for marijuana-related &quot;crimes&quot;?&nbsp; Further, would
the government then realize that they've been operating under the
`myth of consensus' and substantively amend the law? -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Regas case has attracted some of the nation's premier
constitutional lawyers: Dr. Nancy Lord, Larry Becraft, and
(possibly) Jonathan Emord.&nbsp; They see this as a watershed
case for both the First and Sixth Amendments, and believe that
conviction of Ms. Regas could result in erosion of the rest of
the Bill of Rights. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If Regas is convicted, Nancy Lord fears it could also lead to
prosecutions [and certainly intimidation -ed.] of FIJA activists
around the country. </p>

<p>[To find out more about the Regas case, contact <b>LAWYERS FOR
LIBERTY</b>, c/o Nancy Lord, 1718 Peachtree St. NW, ste. 499,

<p align="center"><b>Drug Watch International And The DEA Combine
Forces To Kill<br>
Colorado Hemp Bill With Two Powerful Weapons: Lies And Threats</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 16, Denver, CO, Colorado's Senate Committee on
Agriculture, Natural Resources and Energy voted down Senate Bill
132, the Colorado Hemp Production Act. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill, sponsored by state senator Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn),
sought to 1.) establish a commission to study hemp as a cash crop
and the federal laws governing hemp cultivation [Similar to the
commission recently established by Kentucky's governor. -ed.],
and 2.) create a 'vehicle' for the establishment of a legal hemp
industry in Colorado.&nbsp; The measures were voted down 4-3 and 6-1
respectively. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While it is unfortunate that the citizens of Colorado are
temporarily unable to enjoy the economic benefits of a legal hemp
industry, the most disturbing aspect of these hearings was the apparent
impact of testimony provided by The Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) and Drug Watch International (DWI)
[prohibitionist organization -ed.]. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">First, DWI representative Beverly Kinard gave bizarre testimony
that included wild misrepresentations about hemp production, the
health effects associated with marijuana use and the groups and
individuals who advocate changing the laws governing marijuana.
Some of Mrs. Kinard's more notable direct quotes follow: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The Dutch National Board of Drug Prevention is extremely
    concerned because even with low THC marijuana, high
    concentrations of THC may be produced in some organs.&nbsp;
    [There is no such office entitled the &quot;Dutch National Board
    of Drug Prevention&quot;. -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Legalizing drugs in the Netherlands brought the crime rate
    up 400%.&nbsp; [&quot;Drugs&quot; are not legal in Holland
    and the violent crime rate has declined over The last 12 years.
    -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Hemp oil [derived from marijuana seeds -ed.] causes skin
    cancer overnight on laboratory rats.&nbsp; [Hemp seed oil is
    sold in health food stores. -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Marijuana affects every cell, every system and every organ
    in the body. The mental disorders include acute toxic
    psychosis, panic attacks, flashbacks, delusions,
    depersonalization, hallucinations, paranoia, depression and UNCONTROLLABLE
    HOSTILITY.&nbsp; [Emphasis not added!&nbsp; If so, why has violent
    crime declined in Holland? -ed.] 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While NORML contends that nearly all of Mrs. Kinard's testimony
was nonsensical, the DEA proved DWI one better.&nbsp; Special
Agent in Charge of the DEA's Rocky Mountain Field Division, Philip
W. Perry, testified that the DEA strongly opposes any
democratically-inspired challenges to their supreme control of
marijuana prohibition.&nbsp; In his written testimony, Agent
Perry asserts that &quot;In cases where federal and state law are
in opposition, the question of which law would control is well
settled.&quot;&nbsp; Agent Perry felt it necessary to reiterate
for the committee: &quot;Let us be clear that what we are talking
about in this Bill is marijuana.&nbsp; Calling it
&quot;hemp&quot; on the basis of an artificial threshold level of
psychoactive ingredient does not erase the fact that it is
botanically and legally the same plant.&quot;&nbsp; [Yes, that is
exactly the point! -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Agent Perry concluded by forcefully reasserting the federal
government's recalcitrant position regarding hemp and even more
bizarre, his interpretation of the parental-like role of federal
law enforcement: &quot;Although I am not an expert in the
economics of crop production [question: why then are you
testifying in an agriculture committee hearing? -ed.]...With 31
years of service in law enforcement...I can tell you, in my
professional opinion, this legislation is no more than a shallow ruse
being advanced by those who seek to legalize marijuana.&nbsp; The
people of Colorado deserve to be protected from this sort of
subterfuge. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The federal criminal law on this subject does provide such
protection and will be enforced with all the vigor at DEA's
command.&quot; [Emphasis added. -ed.] 

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information on this legislative debacle, including
copies of the DWI and DEA's tendentious written testimonies,
please contact Allen St. Pierre, NORML, 202-483-5500.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>DEA's Next Target: Hawaii</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 13, Kailua-Kona, In a letter from the mayor of Hawaii
County to the DEA, Mayor Stephen K. Yamashiro's executive
assistant asserted that the Mayor is totally supportive of hemp activist
Roger Christie's efforts to establish a legal hemp industry on
Hawaii. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Executive Assistant R.B. Legaspi writes, in part, that Mr.
Christie has secured the Mayor's endorsement and that &quot;The
Mayor [has] offered the use of county lands for an experimental
project growing low grade hemp for commercial purposes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In his letter, Mr. Legaspi pointed out to the DEA that this past
June 7, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12919, which
amongst other things, recognizes hemp as a &quot;Food
Resource&quot;. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The letter concludes with a reiteration, &quot;Mayor Yamashiro
does endorse...the cultivation of hemp and its conversion to
products useful to mankind.&quot;&nbsp; [Editor's note: Despite
the Mayor's pragmatism and support, the County of Hawaii is not
going to be able to legally cultivate hemp.&nbsp; The DEA will
likely employ the same heavy-handed tactics that it successfully
used in the above cited case in Colorado and deny Mr. Christie
his permit needed to legally cultivate hemp.&nbsp; The disproportional
level of influence and power the DEA asserts over
democratically-elected local and state officials is a clear
violation of the 9th and 10th Amendments.] </p>

able to adapt to law enforcement agencies by quickly changing
drug routes and methods of production. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gen. McCafferey acknowledged the difficulty of tackling the drug
problem, but like any true believer he concluded: &quot;I Think
part of the problem has been our decision to call it a war...I
prefer to think of it as a cancer.&nbsp; I don't think about

The Feds<br>
After Serving Eight Months In Prison For </b><b><u>ONE</u></b><b>
Joint!</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 16, Bay City, Michigan, in the latest twist in a
federal marijuana case involving attorney Edward Czuprynski, the
full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, all fifteen
judges, ruled <i>en banc</i> that a search of Czuprynski's law
office and home was constitutional. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski was federally indicted in May, 1992 for 1.6 grams of
marijuana [about a joint -ed.].&nbsp; Following a trial, he was
sentenced to serve a whopping 14 months in a federal penitentiary.&nbsp;
After eight months, however, a panel of three judges on the U.S.
Court of Appeals ordered Czuprynski's release from prison in July
of 1993 and ruled in his favor four months later on constitutional
grounds, the first of seven issues Czuprynski raised on appeal. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Upon the government's appeal, the full court's recent decision
examined only one raised constitutional issue and sent the case
back to the original three judge panel to review and rule on the
remaining six issues. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the 11-4 split decision, the dissenting justices commented
that they &quot;can not condone the type of prosecutorial
overkill that has taken place here,&quot; adding that &quot;it
only points out the great expense of this court's time and
resources in hearing a case <i>en banc</i> [which involves] such
an insignificant amount of marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski said he is considering an appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court and has secured the commitment from the American Civil
Liberties Union and the National Lawyers Guild to support his
effort. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski commented that &quot;I may have lost the latest
battle, but I'm confident I'll win this war,&quot; adding that,
&quot;the conviction against me resulted from a real railroading
that trampled all over my rights.&quot; </p>

conviction of two Douglas County residents suspected of watering
172 marijuana plants.&nbsp; The defendants Nancy Hadley and
Michael Wyman were charged with multiple felonies [including
intent to distribute, conspiracy, etc...] that could have yielded
them more than 40 years in prison. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Wyman's attorney, Pedro Irigonegaray, commented that the

to the multiple charges for distribution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML National Legal Committee (NLC) member William K. Rork</b>,
Hadley's attorney, asserted that the government erred in
assigning the potential weight of the 172 plants at 840 pounds. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rork and Irigonegaray called upon <i>High Times</i> editor Ed
Rosenthal, an expert on cannabis cultivation, to refute the
government's assertion. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rosenthal testified that 1.) the total bud yield from the 172
plants when mature would have been approximately 9.6 pounds and,
2.) the shelf life of marijuana is indefinite if frozen.&nbsp;
Therefore, the defendants were able to effectively claim that the
marijuana they were alleged to possess was compatible with
personal use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The jury agreed.&nbsp; Hadley and Wyman will likely receive
probation on two misdemeanor charges according to Irigonegaray. <br>

in &quot;drug warring&quot; funds.&nbsp; Selected excerpts from
the editorial follow: </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">-Something just doesn't make sense about the USA's drug
war.&nbsp; It's like no one wants to win.&nbsp; Tuesday, the
Clinton administration paraded out a new drug fighting plan for
1996.&nbsp; It proposes spending a record $14.6 billion -- $1.3
billion more than this year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">-Federal and state governments have spent $250 billion trying to
&quot;control drugs&quot; in the past 15 years, with the bulk of
the money going to law enforcement. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">-And still, Congress appears dissatisfied.&nbsp; Preening for his
presidential bid, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, says the Clinton
administration drug policy &quot;is still based on the
blame-the-society-first approach to crime and punishment.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    After campaigning as a tough-on-crime conservative, New York
    Governor George Pataki wants to cut sentences for drug

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 9, The following are selected excerpts from the <i>Baltimore
Sun</i>'s front page article: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -In a report meant to rekindle debate over drug policy, a
    Baltimore grand jury suggests that marijuana be
    &quot;decriminalized&quot;... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -&quot;It is time to take a very serious look at the drug
    problem in Baltimore City.&nbsp; Removing the profit from the
    drug trade maybe the only way to resolve it,&quot; says the report
    from the grand jury, which was assigned by a judge to study
    drug legalization. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    The grand jury says striking down laws against possessing
    small amounts of marijuana is an &quot;honest response&quot;
    to a finding that authorities seldom enforce such laws. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The report was hailed by Mayor Kurt Schmoke, who since 1988
    has advocated a national debate on alternative approaches to
    fighting drugs.&nbsp; &quot;I was pleased they came down on
    the side of making the war on drugs more of a public health
    war rather than a criminal justice war.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -When the grand jury was sworn in for a four-month term on
    Sept. 12, Baltimore Circuit Judge Joseph P. McCurdy Jr. told
    it to look into the issue of drug decriminalization.&nbsp;
    &quot;<u>Many of us feel that the war on drugs has not
    succeeded, that we are losing ground with each passing day,
    that we are wasting resources and that we have to look at
    this problem anew</u>,&quot; he said.&nbsp; [Amen. -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    David C. Condliffe, executive director of the Drug Policy
    Foundation, praised Baltimore as a city on the cutting edge
    of a &quot;sane&quot; drug policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    He noted that the Clinton administration yesterday announced
    a policy that shifts a larger percentage of drug fighting
    money away from treatment and prevention, and toward law
    enforcement.&nbsp; Pointing to the grand jury report, he said,
    &quot;Washington is simply out of step with the
    citizens.&quot;&nbsp; [NORML concurs -ed.]

<p align="center"><b>French Commission Narrowly Votes To
&quot;Decriminalize&quot; Marijuana</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 4, <i>Le Monde</i> reports that members of the
Henrion commission, appointed in March by Simone Veil, Minister
of Social Affairs, Health and Cities, to study a 1970 law
concerning the criminal penalties for drug possession in France,
have made some remarkable observations and recommendations. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The commission was asked whether the distinction between hard and
soft drugs should be upheld.&nbsp; According, to <i>Le Monde</i>
&quot;the commission judged that 'one can simply state that drugs
are more or less dangerous,' cannabis and its derivatives
(marijuana, hash, hash oil) being classified among the least
dangerous.&nbsp; By a close vote (9 out of 17), a majority
favorable to the decriminalization of the use and possession of
small amounts of quantities emerged.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>Le Monde</i> reports that there are varying estimates of how
many French citizens consume marijuana.&nbsp; The government
estimates 1 to 3 million users, while Sofres estimates a range of
4 to 5 million marijuana consumers. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The nine members supporting marijuana decriminalization purposed: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Prohibiting the consumption of marijuana prior to the age of
    16. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Prohibiting the consumption of marijuana in public places. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Strengthening the laws against driving while intoxicated on
    marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Creating misdemeanor laws dealing with individuals under the
    influence of marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Strictly banning the use of marijuana by public safety
    professionals (e.g.: flight controllers, high speed train
    operators, airline pilots, etc...) 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The nine members of the commission that favor changing the laws
went on to further state &quot;<b><u>If there is no deterioration
in the situation over the next two years, one could then envisage true,
regulated commerce under strict control of the State</u></b>,&quot;
according to <i>Le Monde</i>.&nbsp; [emphasis added -ed.]

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Recognizing the success of the Dutch policy of separating
marijuana from hard drugs, The European Parliamentary Commission
on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs voted Monday for &quot;cannabis
decriminalization.&quot;&nbsp; The full European Parliament is

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Drug Czar and Partnership For
A Drug-Free (sic) America<br>
Hold a Closed -- by Invitation Only -- &quot;Briefing&quot;</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Washington -- At the last minute, it was decided that a
&quot;briefing&quot; held this afternoon at the Old Executive
Office Building adjacent to the White House by Drug Czar Lee
Brown and James Burke, Chairman of the Partnership for a
Drug-Free America and the former CEO of pharmaceutical giant
Johnson and Johnson, was &quot;by invitation only.&quot;&nbsp;
This may have been done because of embarrassing questions having
been asked at their New York press conference on January
16.&nbsp; Consequently, the media were excluded from the
Washington version.&nbsp; This is unusual in Washington, where
media attendance at such &quot;briefings&quot; is generally
encouraged. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At the New York meeting the Partnership announced a series of new
radio and television and print ads which American media are now
running as a part of their support for the continuing arrest of
millions of Americans for using marijuana.&nbsp; That briefing,
like the ads, warned about the horrifying dangers of the
marijuana crisis now sweeping America and causing terror in our
streets, the main drug concern of both the White House and the
Partnership.&nbsp; The purpose of the briefings -- and the
apparent reason for their being by invitation only -- seems to be
the growing panic among prohibitionists about being asked
critical questions.&nbsp; The media have so seldom been critical of
any claims about marijuana made by the Partnership or the Drug
Czar's office that the prohibitionists have not yet developed a
strategy for answering them.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, it may
have been decided not to risk having anyone present who might
disrupt the meeting by asking questions. </p>

<p>(Please do not call either the Drug Czar's office at
202-395-6618 or especially the Partnership at 212-922-1560 and
ask them any questions.&nbsp; That sort of thing just upsets
them.) </p>

Helicopter Marijuana Searches</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On February 1 the Associated Press reported that Maine
Governor Angus King is discontinuing helicopter flights searching
for marijuana growing in rural areas of Maine.&nbsp; Governor King
said the flights were &quot;too expensive for the return.&nbsp; I
think it's intrusive.&quot;&nbsp; The Maine Civil Liberties
Union, which has represented four Maine families who objected to
the invasion of their privacy by flights -- in which no marijuana
was found -- hailed the Governor's action. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The AP story reporting the Governor's action quoted an anonymous
undercover agent as saying that an anonymous &quot;marijuana
trafficker&quot; had told him that anonymous &quot;local growers
had increased their yield substantially in 1994 in response to a
cessation in flights.&quot;&nbsp; Presumably the AP was unable to
find any anonymous supporters of privacy rights to quote
anonymous victims of the overflights. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML has published a special report on the role of the National
Guard in domestic marijuana eradication including the extensive
use of helicopters in both urban and rural areas. </p>

&quot;the so-called war on drugs which is conducted by the

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kentucky Governor Brereton Jones, reversing his previous

study the restoration of what once was one of Kentucky's most important
legal crops.&nbsp; (Illegal marijuana is currently the most
valuable cash crop in Kentucky.)&nbsp; In the late 19th century,
Kentucky produced more than 90% of the nation's hemp, which is
also the marijuana plant.&nbsp; This action has long been urged
by former NORML Board member and Kentucky Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Gatewood Galbraith. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is possible to grow varieties of hemp that have virtually no
psychoactive ingredients.&nbsp; It is generally recognized as one
of the most versatile agricultural plants, and it is cultivated
for non-drug purposes in China and most of Europe.&nbsp; There is
a strong demand for hemp fiber for clothing in America, but The
Drug Enforcement Administration opposes its cultivation in the
United States because it would send the wrong message: that
American farmers have been kept from growing an agricultural

<p align="center">January 26, 1995 </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Dutch Justice Minister Wants
to &quot;Regulate&quot; Marijuana Supply</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a January 21 interview with the Dutch newspaper <i>De
Volkskrant</i> (The People's Newspaper) published in The Hague,
the capital of The Netherlands, the Dutch Minister of Justice, Mrs.
Winnie Sorgdrager, said she wants to &quot;regulate the supply of
cannabis products&quot; being sold in more than 1,300 coffeeshops
around the country. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article explained that Sorgdrager is following her party's
opinion &quot;that the current policy allowing retail sale of
marijuana and hashish has to have its <u>logical sequel in
arranging the supply of the products...&quot;</u> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dutch policy is that &quot;the sale of cannabis products at
the 'frontdoor' of the coffeeshops is tolerated by the Justice
ministry but the supply at the 'back door', or even more, large
scale production, are strictly prohibited.&nbsp; Criminals have
therefore taken over that part of the market.&quot;&nbsp; Sorgdrager
said that she believes that &quot;we have to dispose of this
hypocrisy about that back and front door.&quot;&nbsp; She is
working with her colleagues in the Health Ministry on a Drug
Report to be issued this summer. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Most of the hashish sold is still imported (smuggled in), but
most of the marijuana is now grown in the Netherlands.&nbsp; The
smuggling is especially dominated by violence-prone gangs from
North Africa and Lebanon.&nbsp; The article goes on to explain
that &quot;Sorgdrager is seriously considering a division and
regulation of the cannabis market....&quot; separating the
domestic cannabis from imported hashish smuggled in by criminals
from abroad.&nbsp; The objective is to create a means of
supplying the Dutch market while preventing exports. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Dutch have followed the current policy for many years, so
if there were any serious social or individual health problems
associated with cannabis use, it would have become obvious by now.&nbsp;
It is also worth noting that, until recently, most of the
cannabis consumed was imported hashish which is much more potent
than most marijuana.&nbsp; This means that the &quot;new potent marijuana&quot;
line pushed by the DEA has no relevance to the Dutch experience
or to the supposed threat posed to America by the average
marijuana consumed today which -- according to the U.S. National
Institute on Drug Abuse -- is between 3 and 4%, far below the
average for hashish. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article also explained that Sorgdrager does not want to
use the terms &quot;liberalization&quot; or &quot;legalization&quot;
but prefers to use the term &quot;regulation.&quot;&nbsp; The
Dutch have long been pressured by France, Belgium and the United
States to arrest marijuana users, but the Germans, Swiss and others
in Europe are moving toward the Dutch model.&nbsp; The Dutch
policy generally is to try to reduce the level of violence in
their country, which nationwide has about half as many murders as does
Washington, D.C., alone.&nbsp; Amsterdam is slightly larger than
Washington, but has less than one tenth the number of murders. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On January 12th, NORML carried an exclusive report on the
protests by the Dutch government to the United States concerning
misrepresentations by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
regarding Dutch drug policies and their social
consequences.&nbsp; The DEA has not yet responded.&nbsp; The
statement by the Dutch Justice Minister has also been ignored by
the American media, while <i><u>The Wall Street Journal</u></i>
ran an editorial today entitled &quot;Eighth Grade
Potheads.&quot;&nbsp; If the editorial's hysteria was well
founded The Netherlands should resemble the United States, Bosnia,
or some other violence ridden society and should have a very high
rate of marijuana use and hard drug addiction.&nbsp; <u>Just the
opposite is the case.</u> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While American prohibitionists commonly claim that &quot;the
Dutch legalized drugs and it did not work,&quot; in fact all
drugs remain illegal in The Netherlands.&nbsp; As is the case in
the U.S., most Dutch &quot;drug related&quot; violence is the
result of prohibition, not of the drugs themselves -- except for
alcohol -- again as in the U.S.&nbsp; While it is Dutch policy to
tolerate the small scale sale and possession of cannabis, -- and
no one is arrested for the possession of personal amounts of any
other drug -- the sale of hard drugs is vigorously
prosecuted.&nbsp; Any &quot;cannabis coffeeshop&quot; which is
suspected of selling hard drugs is closed immediately.&nbsp; <u>One
of the primary objectives of the &quot;coffeeshop&quot; policy is
to separate cannabis from the hard drugs.</u> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This policy has been very successful, hence the DEA opposition
to it. Maintaining the connection between marijuana and hard
drugs is a vital component of U.S. drug policy.&nbsp; This is the basis
for the claims that marijuana is a &quot;stepping stone&quot;,
&quot;threshold&quot;, &quot;gateway&quot; to using other drugs.&nbsp;
The success of Dutch policy demonstrates that this is just the
opposite of the truth, so the Dutch policy must be misrepresented
until they can be pressured into merging the drug markets through
blanket prohibition as has been done in the U.S. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In fact, very few marijuana users in America ever become hard
drug users, but the ratio is even lower in The Netherlands.&nbsp;
Ironically, <u>marijuana use by Dutch teenagers is much lower
than in the U.S.&nbsp; Over 30% of U.S. high school seniors have
used marijuana in the last year, while only 12% of Dutch 18 year
olds have ever used cannabis</u>.&nbsp; It is Dutch policy to
strongly discourage teenage cannabis use through honest drug
education that is credible and effective -- because it does not exaggerate
in order to frighten politicians, editorialists and other
impressionable subgroups. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Cowan, the National Director of NORML, announced today
that NORML will begin a program to encourage American opinion
leaders -- and ordinary citizens -- to visit The Netherlands to
see for themselves the success of Dutch cannabis policy.&nbsp;
&quot;When Americans ask what would happen if we legalized
marijuana, they don't have to use their imaginations to find
out.&nbsp; They can just use their passports.&nbsp; Americans
certainly don't need to go to Holland to get marijuana, but they
should go to Holland to be reminded of what we all used to know:
FREEDOM WORKS.&quot; </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the February issue of <i>Playboy</i> magazine, actor Tim

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Playboy</b>: If they put you in charge of the war on drugs,
what would you do? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Robbins</b>: Legalize Marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Playboy</b>: And then? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Robbins</b>: And then we would save an enormous amount of
taxpayer money, specifically on the penal system, which is
overloaded with marijuana abusers.&nbsp; It's unbelievable.&nbsp;
When I did the <i>Shawshank Redemption</i>, every guard I talked
with who had worked in a prison had this opinion: Legalize
marijuana.&nbsp; There's no reason these kids should be here.... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marijuana is just like any other thing that might not be good for
you.&nbsp; If you do too much of it, it can screw up your
life.&nbsp; But it [marijuana -- ed.] can't screw up your life
like cocaine or heroin or downs or ups or LSD. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Playboy</b>: Is this an admission that you still smoke pot --
or was that just a phase you went through as a kid? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Robbins</b>: I take the Fifth.&nbsp; Considering the fact that
it's still illegal ... put it this way: Considering the fact that
I've used it in the past, and know what it is, and seen the
results of it, I don't view it as a dangerous drug.... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">But I don't want to advocate anything like [smoking pot] in
print, because it's a different thing for different people.... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Playboy</b>: So what would you say if your kids came to you
one day and said: &quot;Dad, did you ever take drugs in the
Sixties and Seventies?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Robbins</b>: I would say, &quot;No, it was the
Eighties.&quot;&nbsp; Yeah, I would be honest with them.&nbsp;
And I'd tell them exactly what each drug does to you. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Playboy</b>: You realize that, having admitted these things
now, you've just disqualified yourself from being a Supreme Court

Affairs Takes Issue With DEA<br>
Briefing Paper That Slanders Dutch Dutch Policy</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">January 9, The Hague, The
Netherlands.&nbsp; Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Hans van Mierlo
criticized the United States Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) for misrepresenting the commitment of the Dutch government
to enforce drug law violations, for misrepresenting the
prevalence of cocaine consumed by the citizens of the city of
Rotterdam, and for generally misrepresenting Dutch drug policy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At the request of a Member of
the Dutch Parliament, Minister van Mierlo responded to a recently
released DEA briefing paper entitled, &quot;<u>How to Hold Your
Own in a Drug Legalization Debate</u>&quot; [NORML Weekly News
Release, 11/3/94): The entire letter follows: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"></font><p><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica">&quot;The Minister will point out to
    the American Authorities that Dutch drug policy is falsely
    represented in a manual of the American Drug Battle Agency
    [DEA --ed.].&nbsp; The manual mentions that the police in the Netherlands
    are instructed not to take action against the street trade of any
    drug.&nbsp; That is not true. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In many municipalities in
    the Netherlands, the policing and prosecution of street
    traders of drugs is a high priority.&nbsp; Special cell space
    is reserved for that purpose. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Furthermore, according to
    the DEA manual, a study of the entire Rotterdam population of
    individuals fifteen years and older showed that 3.3% of this
    population uses cocaine.&nbsp; What the research showed was that
    3.3% of the entire population of Rotterdam between fifteen to nineteen
    years old mentioned that they had used cocaine [emphasis added
    - ed.].&nbsp; It is totally irresponsible to state that all
    of these people are cocaine users and ridiculous to relate
    the figures to the total Rotterdam population. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Further, data in the manual
    is not all wrong, but stripped of their context and therefore
    easily misinterpreted. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The mistakes made will be
    discussed with the American Authorities by the Minister of
    Foreign Affairs.&quot; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"></font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Richard Cowan, NORML National
Director, said that &quot;NORML is proud to have brought this
matter to the attention of the Dutch government.&nbsp; The
Netherlands is one of America's oldest allies.&nbsp; John Paul
Jones refitted his ships with Dutch supplies, including hemp rope
and sails, during the American Revolution and wrote movingly of the
kindness of the Dutch people.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML believes that the DEA lies
about Dutch drug policy to create the impression that Dutch
tolerance of marijuana sales is a failure.&nbsp; In fact it is a
great success.&nbsp; If Americans want to see how freedom works,
they should visit the Netherlands.</font> </p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Ohio's &quot;Smoke A Joint,
Lose Your License&quot; Law<br>
Found To Be Unconstitutional</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On November 29, 1994, in an
important court test of a classic unfunded federal mandate,
Medina County Municipal Court Judge Dale H. Chase ruled that
Ohio's mandated suspension of an individual's driver's license
for minor possession of marijuana is unconstitutional. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An excerpt from Judge Chase's
two-page decision follows: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"></font><p><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica">&quot;...suspension/revocation of the
    driver's license of an individual convicted of possession of
    drug paraphernalia is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment
    to the Constitution of the United States on the basis that
    there is no 'rational relationship' between a license suspension
    for violating a drug law and the Ohio statutes dealing with legal
    operation of motor vehicles. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The decision to suspend a
    driver's license for a violation of certain statutes which
    are not related to operation of vehicles would be no different
    than a decision to suspend an individual's vendor's license
    or other license issued by the state to conduct activities
    within the State of Ohio, to the extent that the licensing
    statute is not rationally related to the criminal statute
    involved. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Accordingly, the Court
    finds... mandating license suspension for certain offenses,
    is unconstitutional.&quot; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"></font>

v. Frye</u>, Case No. 94 CRB 00792 or for more information

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>U.S. Anti-Drug Agencies
Continue To Impede<br>
Medical Marijuana Research</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">January 8, The <i>San Francisco
Examiner</i> reported that University of California-San Francisco
clinical researcher Dr. Donald Abrams' proposed medical study of marijuana's
effects on AIDS related wasting syndrome continues to be blocked
by the U.S. government. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">For two-and-a-half years Abrams
has struggled to get marijuana for an FDA approved study to test
whether smoking marijuana can stimulate the appetite and body weight
of people who are wasting because of AIDS.&nbsp; He has gone
through three medical committees and two regulatory agencies,
found a foreign supplier of marijuana and solicited help from the
Dutch government.&nbsp; But he and the Community Consortium on
HIV research still don't know whether they'll be able to do the
test, according to the <i>Examiner</i>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The <i>Examiner</i> article
states that ,&quot;Dr. Philip Lee, Assistant Secretary for Health [and
Human Services --ed.], has postponed two meetings to discuss the
issue of smoking marijuana to stimulate appetite in AIDS
patients.&nbsp; A meeting is expected to take place within the
next two weeks, but indications from NIDA don't look good.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The <i>Examiner</i> interviewed
&quot;a government official that confirmed what many observers
already know: <u>Agencies determined to convince the public that
marijuana is dangerous are not keen about a study that could show
some beneficial effect</u>.&quot;&nbsp; [emphasis added --ed.] </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML would add that marijuana
is already being used illegally by thousands of people with AIDS
for the wasting syndrome and chronic nausea caused by AIDS and by
FDA approved pharmaceuticals such as AZT. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 11,1995, will mark
the 50th anniversary of the public release of </b><em><b>The Marihuana
Problem in the City of New York: Sociological, Medical, Psychological
and Pharmacological Studies</b></em><b> (&quot;The LaGuardia
Report&quot;).</b>&nbsp; The study was commissioned by Mayor
Fiorello LaGuardia in 1938 in order to discover the truth about
marijuana, which had been hastily prohibited a year earlier. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The study was completed in 1944,
published by Jaques Cattell Press (Lancaster, PA), and released
to the public in early 1945.&nbsp; <b>&quot;Its findings revealed
that marijuana's harmful effects had been greatly
exaggerated,&quot; explained NORML National Director Richard
Cowan.&nbsp; &quot;The report's conclusions demonstrate that the
War Against Marijuana Consumers has been a fraud from its
beginning.&quot;</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The massive research project was
carried out by a team of scientists from the New York Academy of
Medicine and the commissioners of the New York Departments of Correction,
Health, and Hospitals.&nbsp; It was the most thorough, extensive
marijuana fact-finding mission since the Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission released its monumental report in 1894. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The LaGuardia Report was
comprised of a series of studies -- from sociological observations
to controlled, scientific studies involving the consumption of
marijuana by subjects in a laboratory setting.&nbsp; <b>Among the
report's conclusions:</b> </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Mental Illness --</b>
        &quot;Indulgence in marihuana does not appear to result
        in mental deterioration.&nbsp; ... Marihuana does not
        change the basic personality structure of the
        individual.&nbsp; It lessens inhibition and this brings
        out what is latent in his thoughts and emotions but it
        does not evoke responses which would otherwise be totally
        alien to him.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Violence --</b>
        &quot;There was no aggressive or violent behavior
        observed.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Crime --</b>
        &quot;Marihuana is not the determining factor in the
        commission of major crimes.&nbsp; Juvenile delinquency is
        not associated with the practice of smoking marihuana.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Addiction --</b>
        &quot;The practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to
        addiction in the medical sense of the word.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Gateway to Hard Drugs --</b>
        &quot;We have been unable to confirm ... that marihuana smoking
        is the first step in the use of such drugs as cocaine,
        morphine, and heroin.&nbsp; The instances are extremely
        rare where the habit of marihuana smoking is associated
        with addiction to these other narcotics.&quot; </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In sum, the report stressed,
&quot;The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of marihuana
smoking in New York City is unfounded.&quot;&nbsp; The depth and
thoroughness of the study make these conclusions relevant beyond
1940s New York. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The LaGuardia Report provided
invaluable descriptive data and dispelled many of the myths which
led to the prohibition of marijuana.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it was
essentially ignored and had virtually no effect on the burgeoning
national policy of prohibition. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The January 12,1945, <i>New York
Times</i> article &quot;Experts Discount Marijuana as Big Factor
In Crime but Drive on It Will Be Pressed&quot; reassured a
frightened public that marijuana would remain outlawed.&nbsp;
Every large-scale study done over the last century has arrived at
the same conclusion; all have been ignored. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Of course, prohibitionists have
played an active part in making sure that the reports are
ignored.&nbsp; Today they claim that marijuana is now so much
stronger than it was in the past that it is virtually a different
drug, rendering all previous conclusions useless.&nbsp; For
example, the December 26 <i>U.S. News and World Report</i> blamed
a rap album for promoting marijuana &quot;20 times stronger than
grass of the past&quot; (&quot;Kids and Marijuana: The Glamour is
Back,&quot; p. 12).&nbsp; In actuality, potency has not
substantially increased over the past 20 years.&nbsp; (A report
on marijuana potency is available from NORML.) </font></p>

<A NAME="10"><STRONG>453B.10 Confidential nature of information.</STRONG></A>
<P>
Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the director or an employee of the department shall not reveal any information obtained from a dealer; nor shall information obtained from a dealer be used against the dealer in any criminal proceeding, unless the information is independently obtained, except in connection with a proceeding involving taxes due under this chapter from the dealer against whom the tax was assessed.

<HR>
<A NAME="11"><STRONG>453B.11 Examination of records by director---subpoenas.</STRONG></A>
<P>
For the purpose of determining whether or not the dealer should have paid taxes, determining the amount of tax that should have been paid, or collecting any taxes under this chapter, the director may examine, or cause to be examined, any books, papers, records, or memoranda that may be relevant to making such determinations, whether the books, papers, records, or memoranda are the property of or in the possession of the dealer or another person. The director may require the attendance of any person having knowledge or information that may be relevant, compel the production
<P>
of books, papers, records, or memoranda by persons required to attend, take testimony on matters material to the determination, and administer oaths or affirmations. Upon demand of the director or an examiner or investigator, the court shall issue a subpoena for the attendance of a witness or the production of books, papers, records, or memoranda. The director may also issue subpoenas. Disobedience of subpoenas issued under this chapter is punishable by the district court of the county in which the subpoena is issued, or if the subpoena is issued by the director, by the district court of the county in which the party served with the subpoena is located, in
the same manner as a contempt of court.

The director may petition the district court or a magistrate for an
administrative search warrant as authorized by section 808.14 to execute a distress warrant authorized by section 422.26.
<HR>
<A NAME="12"><STRONG>453B.12 Civil and criminal penalties for violation of chapter---interest.</STRONG></A>

The penalty and interest shall be collected as part of the tax.
<P>
In addition to the civil tax penalty and interest imposed by this section, a dealer distributing, offering to sell, or possessing taxable substances without affixing the appropriate stamps, labels, or other official indicia is guilty of a class "D" felony.
<P>
A person who possesses, prints, engraves, makes, issues, sells, or
circulates a counterfeit taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia, or places or causes to be placed a counterfeit taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia on a taxable substance, is guilty of a class "D" felony.
<P>
A person who uses, sells, offers for sale, or possesses for use or sale a previously used or expired taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia, or attaches or causes to be attached a previously used or expired taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia to a taxable substance, is guilty of a class "D" felony.
<P>

<HR>
<A NAME="13"><STRONG>453B.13 Credit for previously paid taxes.</STRONG></A>
<P>
If another state or local unit of government has previously assessed an excise tax on a taxable substance, the taxpayer shall pay the difference between the tax imposed under this chapter and the tax previously paid.

     Appeal from district count denial of petition for a writ of

Andreasen, JJ.
<HR><CENTER>2</CENTER>
<STRONG>LAVORATO, Justice.</STRONG>

     Richard A. Dressler appeals from the district count's denial of 

his Petition for a writ of certiorari against the Iowa Department of 

Transportation (IDOT).  In his petition, Dressler challenges as 

unconstitutional 1993 Iowa Acts chapter 16, section 4, codified at 

Iowa Code section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> (1995).  Section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> authorizes 

the IDOT to revoke the driver's license of a person convicted of 

certain drug, drug tax, or drug-related offenses.

     We reach only DressIer's contention that section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> 

violates double jeopardy guarantees.  We conclude section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> 

is constitutionally infirm under the federal Double Jeopardy Clause.  

We reverse the district court's order denying Dressler's petition for 

a writ of certiorari.  We remand to allow the district court to enter 

an order granting the writ.

     <STRONG>I.</STRONG>  <EM>Background Facts and Proceedings.</EM>

     In March 1994 Dressler pleaded guilty to the possession of a 

controlled substance.  <EM>See</EM> Iowa Code  <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A>.  About six weeks 

later, the IDOT notified Dressler in writing that his driving 

privileges were revoked for 180 days pursuant to Iowa Code section 

<A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A>.  The notice also informed Dressler that he was not 

entitled to a preliminary hearing on the matter.

     Dressler then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the 

district court.  In the petition he asked the court to find section 

321.209(8) unconstitutional on the three grounds he urges here.  

Dressler appeals from the court's order dismissing the writ.

     <STRONG>II.</STRONG>  <EM>Scope of Review.</EM>

     A writ of certiorari is proper under Iowa Rule of Civil 

Procedure 306 when one "exercising judicial functions . . . is 

alleged to have . . . acted illegally."  Our review of certiorari 

actions is generally at law.  <EM>Grant v. Iowa Dist. Ct.</EM>, 492 N.W.2d 

683, 685 (Iowa 1992).  Because Dressler alleges a constitutional
<HR><CENTER>3</CENTER>
violation, our review is de novo.  State v. Clarke, 475 N.W.2d 193, 
194 (Iowa 1991).

     <STRONG>III.</STRONG>  <EM>Applicable Law.</EM>

     Iowa Code section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> pertinently provides that 

          [t]he department shall upon twenty days' notice and 
     without preliminary hearing revoke the license or operating 
     privilege of an operator upon receiving a record of the 
     operator's conviction for any of the following offenses, 
     when such conviction has become final:
          [Sections 1-7 deal with vehicle-related offenses.]

          8.  A controlled substance offense under section 
     <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401</A>, 124.401A, 124.402 or 124.403; a controlled 
     substance tax offense under chapter <A HREF="453b.html">453B</A>; a drug or 
     drug-related offense under section 126.3; or an offense 
     under <A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/21/ch13.html">21 U.S.C. ch. 13</A>.

     <STRONG>IV.</STRONG>  <EM>Double Jeopardy.</EM>

     The Fifth Amendment to the federal constitution provides that no 

person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in 

jeopardy of life or limb."  U.S. Const. amend. V.  The protections 

against double jeopardy are enforceable against the states through 

the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal constitution.  <EM>Benton v. 

Maryland</EM>, 395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 2062, 23 L.Ed.2d 707, 716 

(1969).

     The Double Jeopardy Clause is violated when (1) a second 

prosecution for the same offense occurs after acquittal, (2) a second 

prosecution for the same offense occurs after conviction, and (3) 

multiple punishments occur for the same offense.  <EM>North Carolina v. 

Pearce</EM>, 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2076, 23 L.Ed.2d 656, 664-

65 (1969); <EM>State v. Taft</EM>, 506 N.W.2d 757, 760 (Iowa 1993).

     Dressler's double jeopardy claim falls within the third 

situation: multiple punishments occurring for the same offense.  He 

contends the State impermissibly inflicted two punishments upon him 

for the same offense-possession of a controlled substance.  Dressler 

claims he was punished the first time when he was incarcerated and

<A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A>.  He claims he was punished a second time when the IDOT 

notified him that, without the benefit of a hearing, his license was 

revoked for 180 days.

     Dressler says that to escape double jeopardy concerns, a state 

wishing to inflict postconviction punishment upon a defendant must do 

so in a single proceeding.  He contends that was not the case here, 

because the license revocation followed Dressler's initial conviction 

and sentence under section <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A>.  This, he argues, constituted 

multiple prosecution and punishment for the same offense in separate 

proceedings,  constitutionally prohibited by federal double jeopardy 

guarantees.

     To support his argument, Dressler relies heavily on two recent 

United States Supreme Court decisions: <EM>United States v. Halper</EM>, 490 

U.S. 435, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 104 L.Ed.24 487 (1989), and <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-144.ZO.filt"><EM>Montana 

Department of Revenue v. Kurth Ranch</EM></A>, 511 U.S. ___, 114 S.Ct. 1937, 

128 L.Ed.2d 767 (1994).  In <EM>Halper</EM>, the Court held that a civil 

penalty, imposed after a criminal penalty, may constitute a second 

punishment for double jeopardy purposes

     when the sanction as applied in the individual case serves 
     the goals of punishment.
          These goals are familiar.  We have recognized in 
     other contexts that punishment serves the twin aims of 
     retribution and deterrence.  Furthermore, "[r]etribution 
     and deterrence are not legitimate nonpunitive governmental 
     objectives."  From these premises, it follows that a civil 
     sanction that cannot fairly be said solely to serve a 
     remedial purpose, but rather can only be explained as also 
     serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, is 
     punishment, as we have come to understand the term.  We 
     therefore hold that under the Double Jeopardy Clause a 
     defendant who alreadv has been punished in a criminal 
     prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil 
     sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not 
     fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent 
     or retribution.

<EM>Halper</EM>, 490 U.S. at 448-49, 109 S.Ct. at 1901-02, 104 L.Ed.2d at 501-

02 (citations omitted).

     In <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-144.ZO.filt"><EM>Kurth Ranch</EM></A>, the Court had before it a postconviction drug 

tax assessment.  Employing a different analysis from that articulated 

in Halper, the
<HR><CENTER>5</CENTER>
Court held that the tax constituted a second punishment.  For that 

reason, the tax had to be imposed during the first prosecution or not 

at all.  The Court characterized the postconviction proceeding to 

collect a tax as "the functional equivalent of a successive criminal 

prosecution that placed the Kurths in jeopardy a second time 'for the 

same offence.'"  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-144.ZO.filt"><EM>Kurth Ranch</EM></A>, 511 U.S. at ___, 114 S.Ct. at 1948, 128 

L.Ed.2d at 782.  Simply put, as Dressler says, "a state wishing to 

inflict postconviction punishment on a defendant must do so in a 

single proceeding.  Otherwise, punishment following an initial 

conviction and sentencing is barred as double jeopardy."

     The question boils down to whether the license revocation is 

punitive or remedial.

     The State concedes Dressler was sanctioned in the criminal case 

<EM>before</EM> his license was revoked in a civil proceeding under section 

<A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A>.  But the State argues the subsequent revocation of 

Dressler's license is not subsequent punishment for possession of a 

controlled substance under section <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A>.  The State strongly 

asserts that the underlying purpose of section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> is remedial 

rather than punitive, designed solely for the safety of the public.  

For that reason, the State concludes, no double jeopardy violation 

occurred.

     We think the question whether the revocation was punitive rather 

than remedial is controlled by our recent decision in <A HREF="hills.html"><EM>Hills v. Iowa 

Department of Transportation</EM></A>, 534 N.W.2d 640 (Iowa 1993).  In <A HREF="hills.html"><EM>Hills</EM></A>, 

the defendant was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while 

intoxicated.  After a search incident to arrest, the defendant was 

also charged with possession of marijuana.  See Iowa Code  

<A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A>.  Before the defendant's pretrial conference -- at which 

the defendant intended to plead guilty to the possession charge -- 

section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> became effective.  As a consequence, the IDOT 

revoked the defendant's license
<HR><CENTER>6</CENTER>
over her objection that to do so was an ex post facto application of 

section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A>.

     On judicial revIew of the IDOT's decision, the district court  

reversed.  On appeal the IDOT argued that ex post facto protections 

did not apply to a revocation based on a controlled substance 

violation, because the revocation was a civil, rather than criminal, 

penalty.  <EM>See State v. Taggart</EM>, 186 Iowa 247, 254, 172 N.W. 299, 301 

(1919) (ex post facto protections apply only to penal and criminal 

actions, not civil actions).  This is the same argument the State 

posits against Dressler's double jeopardy claim here.

     In rejecting this argument in <A HREF="hills.html"><EM>Hills</EM></A>, we said the answer turned 

on whether the legislative purpose underpinning the controlled 

substance revocation is promotion of highway safety.  In concluding 

there was no direct connection between possession of controlled 

substances, driving, and public safety, we said that

     [p]ersons who illegally possess drugs are of course subject 
     to appropriate criminal punishment.  But many such persons 
     choose not to drive.  When they do not, they do not affect 
     highway safety.  Any connection between drugs, driving, and 
     public safety is at most indirect.  <EM>The amended statute 
     authorizing this license revocation was aimed essentially at 
     enhancing punishmen for controllcd substance possession.</EM>

<A HREF="hills.html"><EM>Hills</EM></A>, 534 N.W.2d at 642 (emphasis added).

     Our conclusion in <A HREF="hills.html"><EM>Hills</EM></A> that section 321.209(8) enhances 

punishment of a controlled substance possession dispenses with the 

State's assertion that this section is not a penal statute.  Because 

section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> twice punishes Dressler for the same offense -- 

possession of a controlled substance -- in a separate proceeding, we 

conclude it unconstitutionally contravenes Dressler's double jeopardy 

guarantees.

     <STRONG>V.</STRONG>  <EM>Disposition.</EM>

     We conclude that section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> violates double jeopardy 

principles by twice punishing Dressler for possession of a controlled 

substance in separate
<HR><CENTER>7</CENTER>
proceedings.  We therefore reverse the district court's order denying 

Dressler's petition for a writ of certiorari.  We remand to allow the 

district court to enter an order granting the writ.

     <STRONG>REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH DIRECTIONS.</STRONG>

<TITLE>New Iowa Double Jeopardy Ruling</TITLE>
</HEAD>

The Des Moines Register, Wednesday, February 7, 1996, page 1M 
 
Court restores driving privileges 
 
The ruling says the state may not automatically suspend licenses of 
convicted drug dealers. 
 
By THOMAS A. FOGARTY 
Register Staff Writer 
 
     Hundreds of convicted drug dealers will have their driving 
privileges restored and the state of Iowa could lose more than $16 
million annually in federal highway aid as a result of a little-
noticed decision issued last month by the Iowa Supreme Court. 
     The court struck down a 1993 state law that calls for the 
automatic six-month suspension of the driver's license of anyone 
convicted of a drug-related criminal charge.  According to the court, 
the license suspension was an unconstitutional second punishment for 
a single criminal action. 
 
Subject to Suspension 
     Shirley Andre, chief of the Department of Transportation motor 
vehicle division, said 8,483 people with drug convictions were 
subject to the suspension law before the court nullified it with its 
decision Jan. 17. 
     With the decision, Andre said, the department stopped imposing 
new suspensions and lifted those that were in effect.  Although the 
department has yet to systematically contact those serving their 
suspension that driving privileges have been restored, officials have 
informed drug offenders who have inquired about their driving statis. 
     Transportation officials have decided against expunging drug-
related suspensions from the driving records of those who have 
already completed them, Andre said. 
     The Supreme Court ruled in a case brought by Richard Dressler of 
Des Moines, who in March 1994 was stopped by authorities near Huxley 
for a broken taillight.  Officers discovered a small quantity of 
marijuana in his possession.  Dressler pleaded guilty and paid the 
fine on the criminal charge. 
     He challenged the license suspension in court.  Ironically, 
disposition of the case took so long that Dressler served the full 
suspension, so the ruling has no practical effect on him. 
     "It's the first step in the right direction of common sense," 
said Jeff Crispin, the Des Moines lawyer who represented Dressler.  
"There's no logical connection between these drug offenses and 
driving privileges." 
 
Unrelated Charges 
     The court decision addresses only license suspension for drug 
offenses that are unrelated to driving, such as possession or sale of 
drugs.  It has no bearing on license suspensions for those convicted 
of driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.  In fact, 
the Iowa Supreme Court issued an opinion on the same day last month 
upholding precedures for suspending the licenses of drivers charged 
with driving under the influence. 
     Three years ago, Gov. Terry Branstad recommended to the 
Legislature passage of license suspensions in drug cases.  Branstad's 
support of such a policy as a get-tough measure only partially 
explains how the law came to be. 
     In addition, the federal government said failure by Iowa or any 
other state to pass such a measure would cost state governments 5 
percent of their federal highway aid in 1994, and 10 percent in 
subsequent years.  At the time, transportion department lobbyists 
told lawmakers that the higher percentage represented about $16 
million a year for Iowa.  The sum presumably would be higher now, 
Andre said. 
     The federal deadline for state action on the legislation has 
passed, so the Supreme Court's decision to nullify the Iowa law 
leaves the status of future federal highway aid questionable.  Andre 
said officials are preparing a letter to U.S. Transportation 
Secretary Federico Pena explaining the situation and seeking his 
guidance. 
     "To my knowledge, no other state has been fraced with this 
particular challenge," said Andre. 
     In addition to sorting things out with federal highway 
officials, Andre said her agency has been discussing with Branstad 
staff possible legislative responses to the court's decision. 
     Andre and David Hudson, Branstad's legislative lobbyist, say 
it's too early to know what course of action will be recommended this 
session to the Legislature.  The options include repealing the 
unconstitutional provision outright, or developing a substitute 
provision that would achieve the same goals in a constitutional way. 
     In 1993, the federal government permitted states that opposed 
the license suspension policy for drug offenders to preserve their 
full highway allotment by passing a legislative resolution stating 
their intention not to pass such a law.  Even if that option remains 
for Iowa officials - and it's not clear that it does - Andre said 
it's an unlikely course of action, given Branstad's support for the 
suspension policy.

  1  1    Section 1.  Section <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/401.html#3">124.401</A>, subsection 3, Code 1995, is
  1  2 amended to read as follows:
  1  3    3.  <STRONG>a.</STRONG>  It is unlawful for any person knowingly or
  1  4 intentionally to possess a controlled substance unless such
  1  5 substance was obtained directly from, or pursuant to, a valid
  1  6 prescription or order of a practitioner while acting in the
  1  7 course of the practitioner's professional practice, or except
  1  8 as otherwise authorized by this chapter.  Any person who
  1  9 violates this subsection is guilty of <EM>a serious</EM> <STRONG>an aggravated</STRONG>
  1 10 misdemeanor <STRONG>for the first offense, and a class "D" felony for</STRONG>
  1 11 <STRONG>the second and each subsequent offense if the second or</STRONG>
  1 12 <STRONG>subsequent offense occurs within six years of the previous</STRONG>
  1 13 <STRONG>offense</STRONG>.  <EM>If the controlled substance is marijuana, the</EM>
  1 14 <EM>punishment shall be by imprisonment in the county jail for not</EM>
  1 15 <EM>more than six months or by a fine of not more than one</EM>
  1 16 <EM>thousand dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment.  All</EM>
  1 17 <EM>or any part of a sentence imposed pursuant to this section may</EM>
  1 18 <EM>be suspended and the person placed upon probation upon such</EM>
  1 19 <EM>terms and conditions as the court may impose including the</EM>
  1 20 <EM>active participation by such person in a drug treatment,</EM>
  1 21 <EM>rehabilitation or education program approved by the court.</EM>
  1 22    <STRONG>b.  Any person who possesses marijuana is guilty of a</STRONG>
  1 23 <STRONG>serious misdemeanor for the first offense, and is guilty of an</STRONG>
  1 24 <STRONG>aggravated misdemeanor for the second and each subsequent</STRONG>
  1 25 <STRONG>offense if the second or subsequent offense occurs within six</STRONG>
  1 26 <STRONG>years of the previous offense.</STRONG>
  1 27    <STRONG>c.  A person eighteen or older is guilty of an aggravated</STRONG>
  1 28 <STRONG>misdemeanor if the person knowingly or intentionally possesses</STRONG>
  1 29 <STRONG>any controlled substance in violation of this section in the</STRONG>
  1 30 <STRONG>presence of a minor.</STRONG>
  1 31    Sec. 2.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act shall not take effect
  1 32 unless an appropriation is enacted or the state's share of the
  1 33 cost is specified in accordance with section 25B.2, subsection
  1 34 3.  
  1 35                           EXPLANATION
  2  1    This bill provides that a person who unlawfully possesses a
  2  2 controlled substance other than marijuana commits an
  2  3 aggravated misdemeanor for the first offense and a class "D"
  2  4 felony for each subsequent offense if the subsequent offense
  2  5 is committed within six years of the previous offense.  The
  2  6 bill eliminates the six-month jail term and $1,000 fine for
  2  7 possession of marijuana and makes possession of marijuana a
  2  8 serious misdemeanor for the first offense and an aggravated
  2  9 misdemeanor for each subsequent offense if the subsequent
  2 10 offense is committed within six years of the previous offense.
  2 11 The bill also makes it an aggravated misdemeanor for an adult
  2 12 to unlawfully possess a controlled substance in the presence
  2 13 of a minor.
  2 14    The bill may contain a state mandate under chapter 25B and
  2 15 will not take effect unless an appropriation fully funding the
  2 16 cost to political subdivisions of complying with the bill or
  2 17 specifying the state's share of the cost of complying with the
  2 18 bill is enacted.

  1  2 as follows:
  1  3    901.10  IMPOSITION OF MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES.
  1  4    <STRONG>1.  A court sentencing a person for an act prohibited under</STRONG>
  1  5 <STRONG>section 124.406 or sections 124.401 and 124.413 may, at its</STRONG>
  1  6 <STRONG>discretion, waive the mandatory minimum term of confinement if</STRONG>

  1  8 <STRONG>not commit an assault as defined under section 708.1 while</STRONG>
  1  9 <STRONG>participating in the prohibited act, if mitigating</STRONG>
  1 10 <STRONG>circumstances exist, and if the mitigating circumstances are</STRONG>
  1 11 <STRONG>stated specifically in the record.  However, the state may</STRONG>
  1 12 <STRONG>appeal the discretionary decision on the grounds that the</STRONG>
  1 13 <STRONG>stated mitigating circumstances do not warrant a reduction of</STRONG>
  1 14 <STRONG>the sentence.</STRONG>
  1 15    <STRONG>2.</STRONG>  A court sentencing a person for the person's first
  1 16 conviction under section <EM>124.406, 124.413, or</EM> 902.7 may, at
  1 17 its discretion, sentence the person to a <STRONG>mandatory minimum</STRONG>
  1 18 term <STRONG>which is</STRONG> less than <STRONG>the mandatory minimum term which is</STRONG>
  1 19 provided by the statute if mitigating circumstances exist and
  1 20 those circumstances are stated specifically in the record.
  1 21 However, the state may appeal the discretionary decision on
  1 22 the grounds that the stated mitigating circumstances do not
  1 23 warrant a reduction of the sentence.
  1 24    Sec. 2.  Section <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/902/11.html">902.11</A>, unnumbered paragraph 1, Code 1995,
  1 25 is amended to read as follows:
  1 26    A person serving a sentence for conviction of a felony<STRONG>,</STRONG>
  1 27 <STRONG>other than a forcible felony,</STRONG> who has a criminal record of one
  1 28 or more prior convictions for a forcible felony or a crime of

  1 30 parole or work release unless the person has served at least
  1 31 one-half of the maximum term of the defendant's sentence.
  1 32 However, the mandatory sentence provided for by this section
  1 33 does not apply if either of the following apply:

  1 35 amended to read as follows:
  2  1    1.  The <EM>sentence being served is for a felony other than a</EM>
  2  2 <EM>forcible felony and the</EM> sentences for the prior forcible
  2  3 felonies expired at least five years before the date of
  2  4 conviction for the present felony.
  2  5    Sec. 4.  <STRONG>NEW SECTION</STRONG>.  902.12  MINIMUM SENTENCE &endash; ELIGI-
  2  6 BILITY OF FORCIBLE FELONS FOR PAROLE OR WORK RELEASE.

  2  9 conviction for a forcible felony or a crime of similar gravity
  2 10 in this or any other state shall be denied parole or work
  2 11 release unless the person has served at least eighty-five
  2 12 percent of the maximum term of the person's sentence.
  2 13    2.  A person serving a sentence for a conviction of a
  2 14 forcible felony who has a criminal record of two or more prior
  2 15 convictions for a forcible felony or a crime of similar
  2 16 gravity in this or any other state shall serve one hundred
  2 17 percent of the maximum term of the person's sentence and shall
  2 18 not be released on parole or work release.
  2 19    Sec. 5.  Section <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/903A/2.html">903A.2</A>, unnumbered paragraph 1, Code 1995,
  2 20 is amended to read as follows:
  2 21    <EM>Each</EM> <STRONG>Unless an inmate is sentenced pursuant to section</STRONG>
  2 22 <STRONG>902.12, subsection 2, an</STRONG> inmate of an institution under the
  2 23 Iowa department of corrections, is eligible for a reduction of
  2 24 sentence of one day for each day of good conduct of the inmate
  2 25 while committed to one of the department's institutions.  <EM>In</EM>
  2 26 <STRONG>Unless an inmate is sentenced pursuant to section 902.12,</STRONG>
  2 27 <STRONG>subsection 2, in</STRONG> addition to the sentence reduction of one day
  2 28 for each day of good conduct, each inmate is eligible for an
  2 29 additional reduction of sentence of up to five days a month if
  2 30 the inmate participates satisfactorily in employment in the
  2 31 institution, in Iowa state industries, in an inmate employment
  2 32 program established by the director, in a treatment program
  2 33 established by the director, or in an inmate educational
  2 34 program approved by the director.  <STRONG>Inmates who are sentenced</STRONG>
  2 35 <STRONG>pursuant to section 902.12, subsection 2, are eligible for a</STRONG>
  3  1 <STRONG>reduction of sentence of up to one day per month for good</STRONG>
  3  2 <STRONG>conduct while committed to one of the department's</STRONG>
  3  3 <STRONG>institutions.</STRONG>  Reduction of sentence pursuant to this section
  3  4 may be subject to forfeiture pursuant to section 903A.3.
  3  5 Computation of good conduct time is subject to the following
  3  6 conditions:
  3  7    Sec. 6.  APPLICABILITY OF WAIVER TO CURRENT INMATES.  The
  3  8 board of parole shall identify inmates currently serving
  3  9 mandatory minimum sentences for an offense under section 1 of
  3 10 this Act that would have been eligible for waiver of the
  3 11 mandatory minimum term if the inmates had been sentenced on or
  3 12 after the effective date of this Act.  For each inmate
  3 13 identified, the board of parole shall review the inmate's
  3 14 record and the circumstances surrounding the inmate's
  3 15 conviction and make a determination as to whether the inmate's
  3 16 mandatory minimum term should be waived.  If the parole board
  3 17 determines that the inmate's mandatory minimum term of
  3 18 confinement should be waived, the inmate shall be immediately
  3 19 eligible for parole.
  3 20    Sec. 7.  INTERIM STUDY COMMITTEE.  The legislative council
  3 21 is requested to establish an interim committee to study
  3 22 currently available sentencing and incarceration options.  The
  3 23 study may include but shall not be limited to a review of
  3 24 available jail, community corrections, and prison beds; the
  3 25 potential impact of the use of split sentencing on jail,
  3 26 community corrections, and prison bed space; security needs
  3 27 and costs associated with the implementation of hard labor
  3 28 requirements for persons incarcerated in corrections
  3 29 institutions; and the nature and costs associated with other
  3 30 sentencing options.  In addition to legislative members, the
  3 31 membership of the interim committee shall include the
  3 32 following public members:
  3 33    1.  A representative from the board of parole.
  3 34    2.  A representative from the division of criminal and
  3 35 juvenile justice planning of the department of human rights.
  4  1    3.  A representative from an association of sheriffs and
  4  2 deputy sheriffs.
  4  3    4.  A representative from the department of corrections.
  4  4    5.  A representative from a county board of supervisors.
  4  5    The committee shall submit findings and any recommendations
  4  6 in a report to the general assembly by January 1, 1997.
  4  7    Sec. 8.  RISK ASSESSMENT STUDY.  The department of
  4  8 corrections, in consultation with the board of parole and the
  4  9 division of criminal and juvenile justice planning of the
  4 10 department of human rights, shall conduct a study of the
  4 11 various risk assessment tools currently used in the Iowa
  4 12 corrections system to determine the relative risk posed by a
  4 13 criminal offender and the prospects for the offender's
  4 14 rehabilitation, and make findings and recommendations
  4 15 regarding the implementation and use of a risk assessment tool
  4 16 during or as part of the presentence investigation process.
  4 17 In conducting the study, the department shall also consult
  4 18 with faculty members with expertise in risk assessment who are
  4 19 from Iowa institutions of higher education which offer degree
  4 20 programs in criminology.  The recommendations and any
  4 21 corresponding findings shall be submitted in a report to the
  4 22 general assembly by January 1, 1997.
  4 23    Sec. 9.  SPLIT-SENTENCING PILOT PROJECT.
  4 24    1.  The general assembly finds that the implementation of a
  4 25 split-sentencing pilot project within this state could serve
  4 26 as a test for a fair and flexible method of dispensing
  4 27 criminal justice which provides for an incremental approach to
  4 28 the imposition of aggravated misdemeanor and felony criminal
  4 29 sentences and may help to reduce the current prison
  4 30 overcrowding problems while protecting the public safety.  A
  4 31 split-sentencing pilot project is therefore established in a
  4 32 judicial district to be determined by the supreme court.  The
  4 33 judicial district shall be selected based on the availability
  4 34 of jail space within the judicial district, and whether the
  4 35 judicial district in consultation with the county board or
  5  1 boards of supervisors and the sheriff or sheriffs desires to
  5  2 participate in the project.  Notwithstanding any other
  5  3 contrary provision of law, subsection 2 of this section shall
  5  4 apply within and only within the judicial district which is
  5  5 selected to participate in this pilot project from the date of
  5  6 the enactment of this Act through June 30, 1997.
  5  7    2.  By record entry at the time of or after sentencing for
  5  8 an aggravated misdemeanor or a felony, other than a class "A"
  5  9 felony, the court may sentence the defendant to serve up to
  5 10 ninety days of the sentence in the county jail and suspend the
  5 11 balance of the term imposed.  If the person is ordered to
  5 12 serve up to ninety days in jail, the costs of the person's
  5 13 confinement shall be paid by the state at the rate negotiated
  5 14 by the department of corrections with the judicial district
  5 15 under section 904.908.  Payment shall be made by the
  5 16 department of revenue and finance upon submission of a voucher
  5 17 executed by the sheriff.  Persons serving time in a county
  5 18 jail under this subsection shall be committed to the custody
  5 19 of the director of the department of corrections and the
  5 20 department shall be responsible for all prisoner medical
  5 21 costs.  
  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23    This bill provides that the court, when sentencing a person
  5 24 for certain drug offenses not involving a firearm or an
  5 25 assault, may waive an applicable mandatory minimum sentence if
  5 26 mitigating circumstances exist and are on record.  The waiver
  5 27 is appealable by the state.  The waiver may also be made
  5 28 retroactively applicable at the discretion of the parole
  5 29 board.
  5 30    The bill also provides that persons sentenced for a second
  5 31 forcible felony are to serve 85 percent of their sentence
  5 32 before they are eligible for parole or work release.  Persons
  5 33 sentenced for a third or subsequent forcible felony, under the
  5 34 bill, are to serve their entire sentence but are eligible for
  5 35 sentence reductions of up to 12 days per year for good
  6  1 behavior.  Persons confined in an institution under the
  6  2 control of the department of corrections are currently
  6  3 eligible for reductions of one day for each day of good
  6  4 behavior and an additional five days a month for participation
  6  5 in institutional employment, an employment program, or an
  6  6 educational or treatment program.
  6  7    The bill establishes a split-sentencing pilot project under
  6  8 which a court in the judicial district selected for the pilot
  6  9 project would be permitted to sentence a person convicted of a
  6 10 crime which is classified as an aggravated misdemeanor through
  6 11 a class "B" felony to up to 90 days in a county jail as part
  6 12 of the person's sentence and suspend the remaining term of
  6 13 confinement.  If a person is serving a sentence of confinement
  6 14 in a county jail, the person is committed to the custody of
  6 15 the director of the department of corrections and the costs of
  6 16 confinement in the jail and medical care will be paid by the
  6 17 state.
  6 18    The bill requests that the legislative council establish an
  6 19 interim committee to study currently available sentencing and
  6 20 incarceration options.  The committee is to include
  6 21 representatives of the board of parole, the division of
  6 22 criminal and juvenile justice planning, the sheriffs
  6 23 association, county boards of supervisors, and the department
  6 24 of corrections.
  6 25    The bill also directs the department of corrections to
  6 26 study the risk assessment tools currently used by the Iowa
  6 27 corrections system.  The department is to consult with persons
  6 28 with expertise in criminology, the division of criminal and
  6 29 juvenile justice planning, and the board of parole.

  1  1 A Joint Resolution supporting the use of marijuana for medical 
  1  2    purposes in the state of Iowa. 
  1  3    WHEREAS, significant scientific and medical studies have 
  1  4 demonstrated that marijuana is safe for use under medical 
  1  5 supervision and that the cannabis plant, in its natural form, has 
  1  6 important therapeutic benefits that are often of critical medical 
  1  7 importance to persons afflicted with a variety of life- 
  1  8 threatening and sense-threatening illnesses; and 
  1  9    WHEREAS, courts have recognized marijuana's medical value in 
  1 10 treatment and have ruled that marijuana can be a drug of 
  1 11 "necessity" in the treatment of glaucoma, cancer, AIDS, and 
  1 12 multiple sclerosis; and 
  1 13    WHEREAS, the people of the state of Iowa believe that well- 
  1 l4 trained medical professionals rather than remote federal 
  1 15 bureaucrats should be responsible for determining a patient's 
  1 16 medical care routine; and 
  1 17    WHEREAS, seriously ill Iowans and other Americans are 
  1 18 unnecessarily suffering because of federal policies which legally 
  1 19 prohibit marijuana's legitimate medical use; and 
  1 20    WHEREAS, Iowa Code section <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/206.html">124.206</A>, subsection 7, paragraph 
  1 21 "a", enacted in 1979, allows the use of marijuana for medical 
  1 22 purposes in the state of Iowa, expressing the intent of the Iowa 
  1 23 General Assembly that marijuana should be available for 
  1 24 legitimate medical purposes; and 
  2  1    WHEREAS, these problems are not particular to the state of 
  2  2 Iowa, but generally affect the citizens of all states adversely; 
  2  3 NOW THEREFORE, 
  2  4 BE IT RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA: 
  3  1    That the Iowa General Assembly memorializes the President
  3  2 and the United States Congress to end federal prohibitions
  3  3 against marijuana's legitimate medical use by creating a
  3  4 rational system of prescriptive medical access to marijuana;
  3  5 and
  3  6    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That copies of this Resolution be
  3  7 transmitted to the Honorable Bill Clinton, President of the
  3  8 United States; the Honorable Albert Gore, Vice President of
  3  9 the United States and President of the United States Senate;
  3 10 the Honorable Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the United States
  3 11 House of Representatives; the Honorable Robert Dole, Majority
  3 12 Leader of the United States Senate; Donna Shalala, Secretary
  3 13 of the United States Department of Health and Human Services;
  3 14 Janet Reno, United States Attorney General; and the members of
  3 15 Iowa's congressional delegation.  
  3 16                           EXPLANATION
  3 17    This resolution recites the Iowa general assembly's support
  3 18 for the removal of federal prohibitions relating to the
  3 19 legalization of marijuana for certain medical purposes in the
  3 20 state of Iowa.

Cannabis Research and International Law, A Thesis.

by Jon Gettman

(This article was written to clarify some ideas expressed in earlier
correspondence with Mario Lap.)

Summary:  International treaties requiring cannabis prohibition are based
on outdated scientific findings which lack modern day validity.  An effort
is underway in the U.S. to utilize legal and administrative procedures to
bring about an official review of this issue.  Advocates of ending cannabis
prohibition world-wide are invited to consider ways in which the research
behind this effort may aid efforts by other countries to call for a review
of the relevant international treaties.

        This article contains speculation about the impact of recent
cannabis-related research on international treaties.  This article presents
a thesis, and in no way attempts to present these assertions as
research-based analysis.  In fact I am presenting this speculation to
interested parties in hope that other people may be able to compile the
relevant research to transform this speculation into a well-founded
argument grounded in specific attributes of international law and treaty.

        The truth is, I don't know much about the international treaties
that concern cannabis control and prohibition.  I know a lot about United
States law, policy, and regulation, and what I know about the treaties
derives from that specific context.

        The way U.S. law is constructed, specific scientific findings are
required to classify a drug as prohibited.

        Until 1989 - 1994 no one knew what the mechanism of action was that
produced the characteristic effects of cannabis.  It has been assumed
throughout the 20th Century that cannabis affected the human brain in a
manner somehow similar to opium and opiate derivatives, and in both
domestic U.S. law and in International treaties this assumption has been
the basis for similar controls on both cannabinoids and opiates.  In the
U.S. this is manifest in the schedule I status of both cannabis and heroin.

        Until this period, henceforth described as circa 1991, all law and
policy about cannabis was based on a bet, on a wager that whenever science
figured out how it worked, it would prove cannabis worked like heroin.
Circa 1991 the discoveries, in fact, occurred, and it is now clear that
they bet on the wrong theory.  They bet on the wrong horse, and now they
don't want to talk about it and hope that nobody finds out.  They?
Politicians, government officials, and legislators in democratic societies
around the world who claim that prohibition is based on scientific
findings, not some form of repressive malice.

        Obligations affecting the prohibition and regulation of
cannabinoids related to two international treaties are codified in the U.S.
Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC Chapter 13.  These treaties are:  the
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 and Convention on Psychotropic
Substances, 1971.

        The mechanism of action by which cannabinoids affect the human
brain were discovered circa 1991.  This mechanism of action categorically
and definitively distinguishes cannabis from opiates, cocaine, and
amphetamines.  The latter list of drugs affects the neurotransmitter
dopamine, and cannabinoids to not.  See the following:

        1)  Cannabis produces effects by way of a receptor system .
Howlett, A.  "Pharmacology of Cannabinoid Receptors"  The Annual Review of
Pharmacology and Toxicology, 1995. (In press when copy received from
author.)

        2)  The receptor system allows a characterization of the dependence
liability of cannabis, and explains the fallacies of prior research
hypotheses.  Herkenham, M. (1992), "Cannabinoid Receptor Localization in
Brain:  Relationship to Motor and Reward Systems,"  P.W. Kalivas and
H.H.Samson (eds.), The Neurobiology of Drug and Alcohol Addiction, Annals
of the American Academy of Sciences.  654:19-32, 1992.

        (Incidentally, this characterization proves that patients who use
marijuana therapeutically are not engaging in denial when they attest to
medical benefits, and therefore patient anecdotes have increased scientific
validity.)

        3)  The receptor system also allows for explanation of tolerance to
cannabis, and provides evidence that tolerance and dependence to cannabis
are mediated differently in the brain. Oviedo, A., Glowa, J, and Herkenham,
M. (1993), "Chronic cannabinoid administration alters cannabinoid receptor
binding in rat brain: a quantitative autoradiographic study." Brain
Research, 616:293-302. 1993.

        My thesis, then, is fairly straightforward.  How can treaties
regulating cannabis that were signed in 1961 and 1971 be based on any valid
scientific findings when the mechanism of action for cannabinoids wasn't
discovered until circa 1991?

        U.S. law contains the following provision:

        "Nothing in the amendments made by the Psychotropic Substances Act
of 1978 or the regulations or orders promulgated thereunder shall be
construed to preclude requests by the Secretary of Health and Human
Services or the Attorney General through the Secretary of State, pursuant
to article 2 or other applicable provisions of the Convention, for review
of scheduling decisions under such Convention, based on new or additional
information."  21 USC 811 (d)(5)

        This provision refers to the U.S. legislation that was passed to
bring the U.S. into compliance with the 1971 treaty.  However this
underscores a fundamental aspect of the relationship between U.S. law and
our international treaty obligations.  If there is a conflict between the
two, U.S. law takes precedence and our government must take steps to change
the treaty, whether it is the Single Convention or the Psychotropic treaty.

        There have been two significant legal actions to reschedule
cannabis in the United States, by NORML, and by Carl Olsen.  I have
initiated a third.  The process itself is relatively straightforward.  A
petition citing evidence is filed.  If the evidence provides sufficient
legal and/or scientific grounds for consideration, then the Drug
Enforcement Administration must defer the petition to the Department of
Health and Human Services for a scientific and medical evaluation.  The
findings of this evaluation are binding on DEA, which is not allowed to
make such scientific and medical judgments in the absence of HHS findings.
The scientific findings provided by HHS are then used to apply statute to
obtain the appropriate level of regulation and control.  (The failure of
HHS to provide any findings on marijuana's accepted medical use in the
United States was in part DEA's justification for refusing action on
NORML's petition.)

        In legal papers filed in 1982 the DEA acknowledged that this review
process by HHS could produce evidence which would require the U.S.
government to seek a change in the international scheduling of cannabis.

        A 1977 ruling in NORML v. DEA by the U.S. Court of Appeals
determined that because of international treaty obligations, cannabis must
be placed in either schedule I or II of the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.
However U.S., courts have not ruled on the validity of the treaties in a
case where new evidence is submitted demonstrating the treaties are based
on invalid scientific assertions.

        The petition I filed in July, 1995 seeks the removal of all
cannabinoids from schedules I and II of the CSA because they do not possess
the high potential for abuse required for placement in those schedules
under U.S. law (see 21 USC 811(c) and 21 USC 812(b)(1)).  The petition
seeks only seeks the removal of cannabinoids from those two schedules, and
requests that the government appropriately schedule cannabinoids based on
the medical and scientific findings of the Department of Health and Human
Services.  In the U.S., this entire process is subject to review by both an
independent administrative law judge and the appeals branch of the
judiciary.

        The petition was accepted for filing by the Drug Enforcement
Administration on July 27, 1995.  Because the petition raises an issue
already decided by a U.S. court, it could (as Carl Olsen earlier and
shrewdly observed) easily have been dismissed under the doctrine of res
judicata, meaning (but not correctly translated) this was already decided.
However the petition raises a new issue, which is what happens if the
treaties are not based on valid science?

        Ending prohibition, in a technical sense, has always been
complicated by the treaties.  The U.S. government argues that the treaties
prevent them from ending prohibition.  And with apologies for the blatant
arrogance of this next remark, the whole world knows that the treaties will
not be changed unless the U.S. government agrees.

        In this specific case, it will be difficult for the U.S. Government
to ignore the scientific validity of the cannabinoid receptor research. The
petition for repeal is based on evidence from over 150 scientific journal
articles and government reports.  However the three articles cited above
are not only representative, but are in fact written by scientists with
reputations of the absolute highest caliber.  Dr. Miles Herkenham, key
author of two of the three studies cited above, is the chief of the
neuroanatomy section of the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH).

        It is my argument within the United States that in light of these
revolutionary research findings we have obligations under both U.S. and
international law to reassess the domestic and international legal status
of cannabis.

        My thesis is based on components of U.S. law, and this is all I
require for legal action within the United States.  It is my intention to
get the US to address the issue of international scheduling in light of the
recent scientific advances.  Perhaps the scientific findings supporting the
petition for repeal can support efforts by citizens of other countries to
have their governments seek the appropriate changes to international
treaties on cannabis.

        International treaties regarding cannabis prohibition are based on
invalid scientific findings that have been completely rejected by modern
day science.  How can any sovereign, democratic country justify adherence
to treaty provisions based on science which is so out of date?  Certainly,
these treaties provisions must be changed.

        How individuals around the world can bring this issue to the
attention of their governments is a question that deserves, I suggest, wide
consideration.

above will soon be available at the web site of the National Organization

The Scientific And Legal Basis
for the End of Marijuana Prohibition

by Jon Gettman

        The Controlled Substances Act mandates that schedule I drugs have a
"high potential for abuse."  A judicious reading of both the statute and
the legislative history finds that this abuse potential is the key
criterion for its scheduling under the CSA.(NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d 735
(1977))(21 USC  812 (b)(1))  However, it has long been recognized that
marijuana does not satisfy this essential criterion.  Therefore the
justification for marijuana's continued placement in schedule I is a
presumption rather than a finding.(See U.S. Cong. and Admin. News 1970 p.
4578, p. 4579, p. 4629. See also 51 FR 22947 (1986))

        As of April, 1995, the Drug Enforcement Administration was "unaware
of any new scientific studies of marijuana that would lead [them] to
re-evaluate its classification at this time."  According to a letter from
Thomas Constantine, Administrator of DEA, if this author "has access to
scientific data concerning marijuana which he wishes to bring to our
attention, we will be pleased to consider it, should he care to share the
documentation with us."  Extensive documentation was provided to
Constantine on July 10, 1995 as part of an administrative petition
subjecting DEA's consideration of these issues to judicial review.

        The CSA establishes an eight item list of scientific and medical
factors that are to be considered in scheduling decisions. (21 USC 822 (c))
These factors are defined further in the legislative history.(see U.S.
Cong. and Admin. News 1970 p 4601 - 4603)

        The first factor is the drug's relative or actual potential for
abuse.  The contemporary paradigm for evaluating the abuse potential of a
drug has been developed by the Committee on the Problems of Drug
Dependence.[<a href="#7">7</a>]  They have concluded that self-administration in animal
studies is the necessary characteristic of a drug with a significant,
severe potential for abuse.[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#21">21</a>, <a href="#32">32</a>]  However, animals will not self
administer marijuana.[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#17">17</a>, <a href="#32">32</a>]

        The second factor is evidence of the drug's pharmacological
effects.  In 1989 Leo Hollister remarked that: "Our studies of cannabinoids
over the past 22 years have touched upon virtually every aspect of their
actions.  They constitute the largest series of studies of the human
pharmacology of marijuana on record."[<a href="#15">15</a>]  Since then further research by
the likes of Donald Tashkin, Mario Perez-Reyes, Julian Azorlosa, for
example, have supplemented the classic work on the chemistry and
pharmacology of marijuana by Agurell, Dewey, Hollister, Martin, Mechoulam,
and Razdan.

        The third factor considered in scheduling decisions is scientific
knowledge about the substance.  In 1988, it became obvious that scientists
had been wrong in their theories about how marijuana acted on the
brain.[<a href="#17">17</a>, <a href="#18">18</a>, <a href="#27">27</a>]  Recent Evidence affirms that marijuana activates a
unique receptor system in the brain.[<a href="#16">16</a>, <a href="#17">17</a>, <a href="#18">18</a>, <a href="#31">31</a>]  In another
current finding, it has been discovered that tolerance to marijuana is the
result of receptor down-regulation, rather than receptor desensitization as
was previously believed.[<a href="#25">25</a>, <a href="#29">29</a>]  In addition, the theory that marijuana's
lipophilic qualities produce a harmful effect has also been
contradicted.[<a href="#22">22</a>, <a href="#30">30</a>]  The receptor has been cloned[<a href="#23">23</a>], an endogenous
ligand for the cannabinoid receptor has been discovered[<a href="#9">9</a>], and an orally
effective cannabinoid antagonist has been created.[<a href="#28">28</a>]

        The fourth factor is the history and current pattern of abuse,
including "social, economic, and ecological characteristics of the segments
of the population involved in such abuse."  Critical evaluations of the
National Household Survey, the Monitoring the Future Project, the Drug
Abuse Warning Network and other federally sponsored reports provide more
than adequate data to evaluate this factor.  Key observations are that
marijuana use and adolescent access persist despite increased enforcement.
Moreover, the National Household Survey indicates that risk perception
associated with marijuana use decreases as education and age increase.[<a href="#34">34</a>]

        The most interesting factor for advocates of harm reduction
policies, though, is the fifth factor: scope duration and significance of
abuse.  According to the legislative history, "in reaching [her] decision,
the Attorney General should consider the economics of regulation and
enforcement attendant to [a scheduling decision].  In addition, [she]
should be aware of the social significance and impact of such a decision
upon those people, especially the young, that would be affected by it."

        This fifth factor allows the introduction of several critical
issues, such as the impact of schedule I status and enforcement policies
have on the private therapeutic use of marijuana[<a href="#12">12</a>] as well as their
effects on the cultivation of marijuana for medicinal or personal use[<a href="#11">11</a>].
This factor also allows the introduction of cost/benefit analyses of
decriminalization laws in various states[<a href="#2">2</a>], as well as the evaluations of
various state legislatures on the significance of marijuana abuse as it is
reflected in the scheduling of the substance under state law.[<a href="#24">24</a>]

        The sixth factor concerns the risk, if any, to public health.  "If
a drug creates no danger to the public health, it would be inappropriate to
control the drug under this bill." A recent editorial in favor of harm
reduction policies in the American Journal of Public Health calls for
development of "a new system that is consistent with present scientific
knowledge and able to incorporate new scientific findings."[<a href="#8">8</a>]  The
Controlled Substances Act provides such a system, and reformers should try
and make the CSA work the way it was intended to before contemplating a new
system.  This factor alone allows for the introduction of harm reduction
policies into scheduling and national drug policy.

        The reputed threat to public health presented by marijuana is a
result of the drug's perceive relation to the use of other dangerous drugs.
The contemporary gateway theory, though, acknowledges that alcohol and
cigarette use precede marijuana use, and that marijuana use does not
predict in any way use of more serious drugs.[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#20">20</a>, <a href="#33">33</a>, <a href="#35">35</a>, <a href="#36">36</a>]
Consequently, the policy ramification of the gateway theory is that the
public health would benefit from successful policies that delay the age of
first use of any drugs.[<a href="#20">20</a>]  Why is marijuana singled out?

        Norman Zinberg clarified the relationship of drug, set, and setting
to the understanding and treatment of drug use and abuse in 1984.[<a href="#37">37</a>]  An
emerging public health model that advocates harm reduction, the study of
use and abuse, and performance evaluation is evidence of gaining
recognition for the utility of Zinberg's ideas.[<a href="#13">13</a>, <a href="#34">34</a>]  A meta-analysis of
correlations between school-aged use of alcohol, marijuana and tobacco
conducted by the Bowman Gray School of Medicine concluded that the primary
correlates of school aged drug use were prior use and access.[<a href="#13">13</a>]

        There is considerable social science data and theory to support the
rescheduling of marijuana under these last two factors representing the
epidemiology and the significance of a drug's actual use in the population.

        The animal models used to determine the abuse potential of a drug
represent synergy between pharmacology and root behavioralism.[<a href="#4">4</a>]  Despite
their excellent predictive validity, they do not present a biological
marker.  This lack of a biological clarification of marijuana's abuse
potential has been the excuse to keep marijuana in schedule I.  The
discovery of the cannabinoid receptor system annihilates that excuse.

        The seventh factor is the substances physic or physical dependence
liability.  It has been long recognized that marijuana is not physically
addictive.[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#14">14</a>, <a href="#17">17</a>]

        Advances in neurobiology have provided a biological model for
explaining substance abuse.[<a href="#19">19</a>, <a href="#21">21</a>, <a href="#33">33</a>]  Drugs of abuse affect the
production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with response and
reward and now held to explain the compulsive self-administration of
drugs.[<a href="#10">10</a>, <a href="#19">19</a>, <a href="#21">21</a>, <a href="#33">33</a>]

        However, cannabinoid receptors are not located on dopamine
producing neurons.[<a href="#17">17</a>]  In vivo microdialysis has shown that unlike other
drugs[<a href="#10">10</a>] THC, the active chemical in marijuana, does not affect striatal
dopamine levels.[<a href="#5">5</a>5]  (Earlier research that had indicated a cannabinoid
effect on dopamine was found to be strain-specific, and has not been
replicated in other animal studies.[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#17">17</a>, <a href="#33">33</a>])

        Heroin (schedule I), cocaine (schedule II) and amphetamines
(schedule III) all affect dopamine production.  Marijuana, cannabinoids,
and THC do not.  Where shall we schedule marijuana under existing
provisions of controlled substances act?

        The eighth factor concerns the relation of the substance to other
scheduled chemicals.  The discovery of the receptor system provides the
scientific basis for considering cannabinoids as a family with a similar
mechanism of action.  This is especially accurate with regards to the
drug's dependence potential.  Scientists have long accepted the validity of
assertions about marijuana based on research on its constituent parts, such
as THC, cannabinol, marijuana smoke, and experimental cannabinoids.

        There is no basis for distinguishing between the marijuana and THC
in a consideration of dependence potential.

        As a result of this and other information, I believe that
marijuana, cannabinoids, and THC should be removed from schedules I and II,
and I have begun the administrative proceedings to consider this issue.

        By law, petitions for rulemaking changes are sent to the DEA.(21
CFR 1308.44)  The DEA then forwards the petition to the Department of 
Health and Human Services for a scientific and medical evaluation that is 
binding on DEA in regards to scheduling decisions.(21 USC  811 (b))  The 
Court of Appeals has ruled that petitions must be judged on merit.(NORML v. 
DEA, 559 F.2d 735 (1977))

        The United States has an international obligation under various
treaties to verify this information and take steps to change the
international scheduling of marijuana.  Meanwhile, the subject of where
marijuana should be scheduled pending treaty amendment is open for debate.

        Twenty five years ago the government acknowledged marijuana did not
deserve schedule I status. Unfortunately, however, it decided to wait for
more evidence before ending marijuana prohibition.  The scientific evidence
has been mounting ever since, and none of it legitimately supports
marijuana's schedule I status.

        Justice delayed is justice denied.  The time has come for an end to
marijuana prohibition, and to acknowledge that for the last 25 years
marijuana users have been denied equal protection under the laws of the
United States and its Constitution.

currently enrolled in a doctoral program in the Institute of Public Policy
at George Mason University. His present research agenda concerns regional
development and the agricultural and industrial technologies required for
hemp-related development.  The petition for repeal was the result of a
research agenda concerning the policy implications of recent findings about
the cannabinoid receptor system.)

by Jon Gettman</CENTER>

<P>Cannabinoids are the active ingredients in marijuana, and
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the only psychoactive cannabinoid.
Excerpts from frequently cited journal articles follow the brief statements
below.  Because these excerpts are taken out of context, the reader is
encouraged to read the original journal articles.

<P>The primary marker of a drug with a severe dependence liability is
compulsive self-administration by animals in a clinical setting.  Animals
will not self-administer marijuana.

<P>Cannabinoids are non-toxic; lethal effects are non existent.

<P>The pharmacology of cannabinoids was well-characterized by the mid 1980's,
and indicates that marijuana does not pose greater health risks than
alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine.

<P>The discovery of the neural mechanism, the cannabinoid receptor system,
which accounts for the characteristic effects of marijuana began in 1989.

<P>Drugs with the highest potential for abuse have a direct effect on the
neurotransmitter dopamine; marijuana does not.

<P>Tolerance to marijuana has also been explained. It results from a natural
process and not cell toxification.  Research has proven that tolerance to
marijuana is not a characteristic of a dependence liability.

<P>Marijuana does not harm the immune system.

<P>The discovery of the neural cannabinoid receptor system provides evidence
of the physiological basis for the medical use of marijuana and
cannabinoids.

<P>Before 1989, because no one knew how marijuana's effects were produced,
scientists were allowed great breadth to speculate about the substance.

<P>Much of the harmful speculation about marijuana prior to the receptor
discovery has based in studies with severe methodological problems.

<P>Prior to 1989, many of these speculative hypotheses were presented to the
public as likely facts which supported various public policies; but no one
really knew what they were talking about.

<P>Primary Marker of Drug Dependence:  "[S]elf-administration of a drug to the
point where the behavior becomes obsessive and detrimental to the
individual is the primary criterion which must be met to classify a drug as
one with significant potential for dependence."  Cicero, T. (1992)
Assessment of Dependence Liability of Psychotropic Substances:  Nature of
the Problem and the Role of the College on Problems on Drug Dependence.
Contractor Document for the Office of Technology Assessment. (Springfield,
VA: National Technical Information Service.  1992.) (NTIS Doc.
#PB94-175643) pg. 6.

<P>Primary Clinical Test of Dependence Liability:  "If the abuse liability of
a substance as defined by the likelihood of it supporting drug-seeking and
drug-taking, is to be evaluated, an assessment of its reinforcing functions
by self-administration is clearly the method of choice."  Brady, J.V. "The
Reinforcing Functions of Drugs and Assessment of Abuse Liability."  In:
Problems of Drug Dependence, 1987.  Proceedings of the 49th Annual
Scientific Meeting, The Committee on Problems of Drug Dependence, Inc.
Harris, L. (ed.), National Institute on Drug Abuse Research Monograph 81.
Washington, D.C.: U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1988.  pp. 440 - 456. pg. 452.

<P>Marijuana Does Not Meet the Primary Test for Dependence:  "While
self-administration of drugs has been taken as an indication of
psychological dependence and/or abuse potential, few reports claim to have
established experimental models for self administration of Delta-9-THC . .
. This observation suggests limited potential for development of . . .
limited psychological dependence due to the weak reinforcing properties of
Delta-9-THC."  Abood, M.E., and Martin, B.R. (1992), "Neurobiology of
Marijuana Abuse," Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 13:201-206. pg. 203.

<P>The Toxicity of Marijuana:  "lethal effects of overdose by humans are
nonexistent or rare"  Dewey, W.  Cannabinoid Pharmacology. Pharmacological
Reviews. 1986 Vol. 38, No. 2.  pp. 151 - 178. pg. 172.

<P>The Extent of Parmacological Research:  "Our studies of cannabinoids over
the past 22 years have touched upon virtually every aspect of their
actions."  Hollister, L.  "Peregrinations Among Drugs of Dependence:
Nathan B. Eddy Memorial Award Lecture."  In: Problems of Drug Dependence,
1989.  Proceedings of the 49th Annual Scientific Meeting, The Committee on
Problems of Drug Dependence, Inc.  Harris, L. (ed.), National Institute on
Drug Abuse Research Monograph 95.  Washington, D.C.: U.S. Govt. Print.
Off., 1990.  pg. 36-43. pg. 42.

<P>The Relative Abuse Potential of Marijuana:  "Compared with other licit
social drugs, such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, marijuana does not
pose greater risks." Hollister, L.E.(1986), "Health Aspects of Cannabis",
Pharmacological Reviews, 38:1, 1-20. pg. 17.

<P>The Mechanism of Action for Cannabinoid Effects:  " [Quantatative
radiography has established that a cannabinoid receptor system in the
brain] "is the same receptor [system] that mediates all of the behavioral
and pharmacological effects of cannabinoids . . ."  Herkenham, M., Lynn,
A.B., et al., (1990) "Cannabinoid Receptor Localization in Brain,"
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 87:1932-1936, 1990. pg.
1935.

<P>Marijuana And  Known Drugs of Abuse:  "The effects of cannabinoids on
dopamine circuits thought to be common mediators of reward are indirect and
different from those drugs such as cocaine and morphine which directly
affect extracellular dopamine levels and produce craving and powerful
drug-seeking behavior." Herkenham, M. (1992), "Cannabinoid Receptor
Localization in Brain:  Relationship to Motor and Reward Systems,"  P.W.
Kalivas and H.H.Samson (eds), The Neurobiology of Drug and Alcohol
Addiction, Annals of the American Academy of Sciences.  654:19-32, 1992.
pg. 29

<P>Note:  Dopamine-based craving is believed to be neural mechanism
responsible for the phenomenon of denial, in which someone with a drug
dependency has strong urges to deny their dependency, and engage in all
sorts of fictions and escapades to maintain their supply and intake of a
drug. The accounts of patients who have used marijuana medically are often
dismissed on suspicion that these anecdotal accounts are motivated more by
drug dependency than therapeutic benefits.  The distinction noted above is
evidence that this sort of denial is not an element in patient accounts of
the therapeutic benefits of marijuana.

<P>Tolerance to Marijuana : "The magnitude of the present effect, like the
striking behavioral tolerance, may stem in part that, unlike other
psychoactive agonist drugs, cannabinoids can be administered in very high
doses.  It is ironic that the magnitude of both tolerance (complete
disappearance of the inhibitory motor effect) and receptor down-regulation
(78% loss . . .) is so large, whereas cannabinoid dependence and withdrawal
phenomena are minimal.  This supports the claim that tolerance and
dependence are independently mediated in the brain."  Oviedo, A., Glowa, J,
and Herkenham, M. (1993), "Chronic cannabinoid administration alters
cannabinoid receptor binding in rat brain: a quantitative autoradiographic
study." Brain Research, 616:293-302. pg. 300.

<P>Marijuana and Immunosuppression:  "In humans, immune suppression is subtle
and in many cases insignificant.  There is little evidence for cannabinoid
immunosuppression as a causative agent in disease."  Lynn, A.B., and
Herkenham, M. (1993) "Localization of Cannabinoid Receptors and
Nonsaturable High-Density Cannabinoid Binding Sites in Peripheral Tissues
of the Rat:  Implications for Receptor-Mediated Immune Modulation by
Cannabinoids"  Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 268:3
1612-1623. pg. 1620.

<P>The Cannabinoid Receptor System Discovery Explains Why Cannabinoids Have
Medical Value:  "Dense binding in the basal ganglia and cerebellum suggests
cannabinoid involvement in movement control . . . Anticonvulsant and
antiemetic effects of cannabinoids have therapeutic value.  The
localization of cannabinoid receptors in motor areas suggests additional
therapeutic applications.  Cannabinoids exacerbate hypokinesia in Parkinson
disease but are beneficial for some forms of dystonia, tremor, and
spasticity."  Herkenham, M., Lynn, A.B., et al., (1990) "Cannabinoid
Receptor Localization in Brain,"  Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, 87:1932-1936, 1990. pg. 1936.

<P>Before 1989, Theories Substituted for Facts About Marijuana's Mechanism of
Action :  "Because the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of action of
psychoactive cannabinoids were not understood, neuroscientists were allowed
great breadth to speculate upon the influence that these compounds might
have on the neurons of the brain." Howlett, A.C., Bidaut-Russell, M,
Devane, W., Melvin, L., Johnsons, M., & Herkenham, M.,  "The Cannabinoid
Receptor:  Biochemical, anatomical, and behavioral characterization."
Trends in Neuroscience  13:10, 420-423. 1990. pg. 420.

<P>Before 1989, Studies which Caused Some Scientists Alarm Were Based on
Faulty Research: "Most of the biochemical studies employed concentrations
of Delta-9-THC that were in excess of physiologically meaningful
concentrations that might be found in brain.  In addition, the criterion of
structure-activity relationship was not met -- that is, the potencies of
the various cannabinoids in the in vitro  assays did not correlate with
their relative potencies in eliciting characteristic behavioral effects.
Particularly damaging to the relevance of these in vitro studies was the
absence of enantioselectivity."  Herkenham, M. (1992), "Cannabinoid
Receptor Localization in Brain:  Relationship to Motor and Reward Systems,"
P.W. Kalivas and H.H. Samson (eds.), The Neurobiology of Drug and Alcohol
Addiction, Annals of the American Academy of Sciences.  654:19-32, 1992.
pg. 19.

<P>Before 1989, All Sorts of Research on Cannabinoids Was Conducted Because No
One Knew How they Worked on the Brain:   "Until recently, very little was
known about the cellular mechanisms through which cannabinoids act . .
.Without evidence that cannabinoids act through a specific receptor coupled
to a functional effector system, researchers were prone to study the
effects of cannabinoids on membrane properties, membrane-bound enzymes,
eicosanoid production, metabolism, and other neurotransmitter systems in
vitro." Herkenham, M. (1992), "Cannabinoid Receptor Localization in Brain:
Relationship to Motor and Reward Systems,"  P.W. Kalivas and H.H. Samson
(eds.), The Neurobiology of Drug and Alcohol Addiction, Annals of the
American Academy of Sciences.  654:19-32, 1992. pg. 19.

Substance Abuse: The New Paradigm
by Jon Gettman

Part 1 of 2.

Author:  U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment

Title: Biological Components of Substance Abuse and Addiction - 
Background Paper

Date:  September, 1993

Source:  Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office(OTA-BP-BBS-
117), 68 pgs.  $4.25 + postage from GPO (202) 512-1800.

        This OTA paper reviews medical research through 1992 
regarding the effects of various drugs of abuse on the brain, and by 
way of excellent references, provides a guide to the scientific 
literature for the interested public.  The paper provides:

        A discussion of the basic concepts of neuropharmacology, 
including the brain reward system, adaptive responses such as 
tolerance, dependence, and sensitization, and how the abuse liability 
of various drugs is evaluated and compared.

        A discussion of the specific effects on the brain of cocaine, 
amphetamines, caffeine, nicotine, phencyclidine, alcohol, 
barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiates, cannabis and Lysergic Acid 
Diethylamide.

        A discussion of research on inherited traits that may 
increase the risk of drug abuse, primarily reviewing studies on 
alcoholism, with some mention of opiate-related research.

Significance:

        Research on several drugs of abuse has converged on a single 
point -- their impact on the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine 
and their subsequent influence on human behavior through the brain 
reward system dominated by that neurotransmitter.

        The paper reports on the current attributes used for 
evaluating the abuse potential of drugs. OTA reports that no research 
indicates that cannabis (marijuana) shares these attributes. OTA 
fails to discuss the ramifications of such a finding.

Excerpts:

        "The capacity to produce reinforcing effects is essential to 
any drug with significant abuse potential, whereas tolerance and 
physical dependence most commonly occur but are not absolutely 
required to make such a determination . . . The predominant feature 
of all drugs with significant abuse potential properties is that they 
are self-administered . . . Animal models of self-administration 
provide a powerful tool that can give a good indication of the abuse 
liability of new or unknown drugs."  OTA 1993 pg. 5.

        "While marijuana produces a feeling of euphoria in humans, in 
general, animals will not self-administer THC in controlled studies.  
Also, cannabinoids generally do not lower the threshold needed to get 
animals to self-stimulate the brain reward system, as do other drugs 
of abuse."  OTA 1993 pg. 34.

Discussion:

        The executive summary explains that susceptibility to drug 
abuse is influenced by such factors as the biological response to a 
drug, a person's psychological makeup, and the drug's availability.

Title:  Technologies for Understanding and Preventing Substance Abuse

Date:  September, 1994

597) 260 pgs.  $15.00 + postage from GPO (202) 512-1800.

        Several committees of Congress asked the Office of Technology 
Assessment (OTA) to study the socioeconomic, psychological, 
physiological and genetic foundations for substance abuse and 
addiction.  OTA's report on the Biological Components of Substance 
Abuse and Addiction was published in 1993 (see above); this is the 
companion report that reviews social science research that has 
implications for prevention efforts.

        This report provides an extensive discussion of available 
data and the limitations of the studies that produce it.  Like its 
predecessor, it is a comprehensive guide to current research and its 
varying interpretations.

        This report does not address treatment or law enforcement 
issues

        There are not root causes for drug abuse, but risk and 
protective factors that influence the possibility of abuse within 
different sub populations in different settings.  Research into 
Necessary Preconditions, Individual Factors, and Activity Settings is 
reviewed, and policy options for prevention funding are discussed in 
conclusion.

        Appendices review the history of drug control policy in the 
U.S., existing federal prevention programs, and provide a list of 
original research papers contracted for this study and extensive 
references.

Significance:

        This paper re-presents the material from the 1993 OTA report.  
With regard to marijuana, while more research strides were made 
between the publication of the two papers, even less is reported 
about the biological basis for cannabis use than in the 1993 paper.

        Four models for considering prevention issues are reviewed, a 
Public Health Model, a Medical Model, a Criminal Justice Model, and 
the over-generalized approach of mass communications.

        Leading indicators of drug use are criticized  for several 
limitations, including the government's credibility, over-looked 
populations, measuring use but not abuse, and little opportunity to 
conduct multi-variate analysis.

        Teenage use of "legal" drugs precedes use of marijuana.

        The statistical results of 242 studies have been analyzed to 
sort risk factors into 11 major categories (50 sub categories), and 
to establish strong, moderate, and weak relationships between risk 
factors and school age drug use.

        Analysts are beginning to find the differences between drug 
use and abuse more interesting than the differences between legal and 
illegal drugs.

        Commercially marketed prevention programs, such as DARE, 
require extensive evaluation studies.  To date, the few evaluation 
studies that have been done do not indicate success at prevention of 
drug abuse.

Excerpts:

On the Brain Reward System:

        "Most drugs of abuse, either directly or indirectly, are 
presumed to affect the brain reward system.  Inducing activity in the 
brain reward system gives drugs of abuse positive reinforcing actions 
that support their continued use and abuse."  OTA 1994 pg. 45.

        "The rewarding properties of stimulant drugs such as cocaine 
and amphetamines are due directly to the effects of the chemical 
dopamine. Opiates, on the other hand, indirectly stimulate dopamine 
by activating other chemical pathways, which in turn increases 
dopamine activity.  All of these drugs have reinforcing properties.  
Phencyclidine (PCP) is also a strong reinforcer but its relationship, 
in any, to activity in the dopamine pathway has yet to be 
established.  Other drugs are either weak reinforcers or have not 
been shown to support self-administration in animal experiments.  
Nicotine stimulates dopamine neurons; however, its effect is modest 
when compared with cocaine or amphetamine.  Likewise, caffeine is a 
weak reinforcer, but the precise mechanisms of its reinforcment are 
unclear.  Finally, cannabis and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) also 
produce positive effects that clearly support their use."  OTA 1994 
pg. 47.

On the Stepping Stone and Gateway Drug Theories:

        "While study results vary somewhat, the sequence most often 
reported is that alcohol and cigarette use come first, followed by 
marijuana use and then by the use of other illicit substances."  OTA 
1994 pg. 74.

        "(T)he criminalization of marijuana may have caused some 
marijuana users to move on to other illicit substances through 
contact with the subculture of illicit users."  OTA 1994 pg. 74.

        In one study, "delinquency and youthful sexual activity 
tended to precede the use of marijuana and hard liquor. . . The early 
use of so-called gateway drugs, such as beer and cigarettes, may 
contribute to later problem behaviors, while the later use of 
marijuana, hard liquor, and other illicit substances may be more the 
result of extended participation in problem behaviors"  OTA 1994 pg. 
78.

        "Because many individuals who use substances do not go on to 
substance abuse, and because one level does not guarantee use at a 
higher level, these stages are descriptive but not predictive."  OTA 
1994 pg. 80.

On National Surveys:

        "Drug measures focus on use, rather than abuse or addiction.  
The common measures of drug use employed by the Household and Seniors 
Surveys - lifetime, past year, and past month use-are insufficiently 
refined to distinguish between casual and dependent use."  OTA 1994 
pg. 38.

On learning from those who use drugs without abuse:

        "What prevents some individuals from progressing from initial 
use to abuse to addiction? . . . Studying those individuals who do 
not progress from use to addiction may provide insights and lessons 
about how to prevent progression among those who do progress."  OTA 
1994 pg. 75

        "But what about those individuals who live in stressful and 
chaotic conditions - who are constantly exposed to many of these risk 
factors - yet who do not develop substance abuse problems?"  OTA 1994 
pg. 115.

On the Public Health Model for understanding abuse and addiction:

        "The legality or illegality of a drug is an artificial 
barrier that is not as relevant as the health-related considerations 
stemming from all types of drug use.  Rather than using 
legal/illegal, the public health approach categorizes drugs by such 
characteristics as addictive potential and long-term health risks. . 
.Dealing with the drug problem primarily as a moral problem is 
considered inappropriate and counterproductive (as part of the public 
health model)." OTA, 1994 pg. 29.

On Ethnographic studies of Marijuana Use:

        "Differences in marijuana smoking may also be partially 
attributable to gender.  In a recent review, it was shown that men's 
marijuana smoking was tied more to the  availability of the drug, 
while women's smoking was affected to a greater degree by social 
influences, such as weekday versus weekend smoking, and the smoking 
of their male partners. Women have also been shown to increase their 
marijuana smoking during periods of anger and other unpleasant 
dispositions."  OTA 1994 pg. 90.

        "Most of the ethnographic research on marijuana use has been 
conducted outside the United States.  Much of it was initiated in the 
1960's and 1970's . . .In Jamaica, for example, anthropologists Vera 
Rubin and Lambros Comitas directed a research team of 45 . . .Their 
controversial findings were that none of the deleterious social or 
medical consequences believed by many to be associated with the drug 
in the United States could be found among Jamaican users."  OTA 1994 
pg. 124.

Discussion:

        The findings OTA reports on marijuana are very exciting 
because of their possible impact on marijuana's legal status under 
federal law, however that is just one application of the technologies 
of this report, and but one measure of this report's significance.

        This is the most valuable report on substance abuse in the 
United States since the second report of the National Commission on 
Marihuana and Drug Abuse in 1973.

        The title is very important, and very revealing:  
"Technologies for Understanding and Preventing Substance Abuse and 
Addiction."  Ideas, theories, programs, policies, and though 
unmentioned, laws as well, are all technologies.  They are all 
subject to evaluation, or assessment, by conventional standards.  The 
drug war has reached a critical, and perhaps terminal stage where it 
has been going on long enough for empiricism to take over from 
theory.         This report represents the end of the "Just Say No!" 
monopoly on prevention efforts, one of the driving forces behind 
marijuana prohibition. Effectiveness is replacing strength as the 
standard of evaluation.

        OTA recognizes a prevention program market that receives one 
fourth of the funds given to local jurisdictions under the Drug Free 
Schools and Communities Act.  Three programs "have captured a sizable 
share" of the market, DARE, Quest: Skills for Living; and Here's 
Looking at You 2000. Only DARE has been evaluated sufficiently for 
conclusions to be drawn about the program.

        DARE is one of the better funded prevention programs and is 
delivered to 5 million students at a cost of $10 each.  Of the 
studies reviewed by OTA on DARE's effectiveness, "the average 
reductions in substance use were very small.  Use among control 
schools and DARE schools was roughly equal." (OTA, 1994 pg. 150-151)  
While the program has important strengths, school-based prevention 
technologies "have not been refined and tested enough to demonstrate 
their effectiveness."

        OTA commissioned a study involving 9930 statistical analyses 
from 242 separate studies reporting relationships between substance 
use by school age youths and its postulated causes, and OTA only 
summarizes the findings of this study in this report.  Tobacco, 
alcohol, and marijuana accounted for 82% of the completed analyses.

        Only four variables were held to have strong relationships to 
school-age drug use.  "1)  prior and concurrent use of substances, 2) 
substance use by peers and friends, 3) perceived peer attitudes about 
substance use, and 4) offers to use substances."  (OTA 194 pg. 147)  
Of the 15 variables with moderate relationships to substance use, 7 
were social variables involving resistance skills, peer pressure, and 
beliefs about consequences.

        These findings need to be examined in more detail, but they 
should be of immense help in evaluating the theoretical basis for 
many prevention programs which lack performance data for evaluation.

        The significance for policy discussions is that these 
findings suggest that availability itself is probably the greatest 
contributing factor to school-age drug use.

        The role of tobacco and alcohol marketing, and the role of 
head shops is discussed in the context of the availability of drugs 
as a necessary precondition for abuse.

        Distinctions are made between use, abuse, and addiction.  OTA 
is straightforward that substances differ in their abuse liability, 
and the line between use and abuse varies.  The goals of prevention 
programs vary between attempting to prevent initial use, delay 
initial use, or reduce or control continued use.  While there is a 
progression to the use of various drugs, OTA reports that these 
stages are descriptive, not predictive. There is considerable 
evidence that expectations play an influential role in drug use and 
abuse.

        Ethnographic studies and anthropology have begun to make 
important contributions to understanding substance abuse.  Four 
social contexts are recognized: a drug focused subculture, drug use 
as part of a larger lifestyle or identity, normal, recreational use 
among specific partners or peers, and use in social isolation.  
(Interestingly, medical marijuana use is provided as an example of 
drug use in social isolation.  Sad, true in too many cases, and 
unnecessary.)

        However, "most of the ethnographic research has concentrated 
on drug-focuses subcultures or on crime-related subcultures.  There 
are too few studies on other populations . . . (for example) no 
significant ethnographic studies of student drug use in almost two 
decades.  The drug problem has been defined in the public mind and 
among some funding sources as a problem of poor minority communities. 
. . Drug use and drug users are defined as the "other," different 
from the rest of society.  Ethnographers have paid relatively little 
attention to the relationship between culturally approved drug use 
(e.g., caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, psychoactive prescription drugs) 
and illicit drug use."  (OTA 1994 pg. 128-129)

        The elements of notable prevention programs include:  
promoting social and life skills, strengthening families, promoting 
healthy peer interaction, indirect and participatory approaches to 
substance use, and alternative activities.

        A considerable amount of material covered by OTA is not 
reviewed here.  This includes a review of all major drug use 
indicators and considerable discussion of the demographic differences 
in drug use by people of different genders and races.  Relationships 
between individual risk factors and aggressiveness, delinquency, 
physical and sexual abuse, and mental disorders are also discussed.

        Technologies are problem solving tools that have benefits and 
limitations.  This article has touched on a few of the technologies 
that are most relevant to marijuana law reform:  the brain reward 
system, the gateway drug sequence, the public health model, the 
isolation of primary causes of school-age drug use, the use of 
ethnographic studies, the elements of successful prevention programs 
and learning about drug abuse from drug use.  These are all tools 
that provide new ways to address, solve, and explain old problems.

        Advocates of marijuana law reform must become familiar with 
the latest findings in these and other areas, otherwise arguments for 
reform will become increasingly irrelevant as the context of public 
policy discussions evolves.

 Interview with Professor Raphael Mechoulam, Codiscoverer of THC

The International Journal of the Addictions, 21(4&5), 579-587, 1986.

        The interview was conducted by Stanley Einstein in Jerusalem 
on January 14, 1985.

        Mechoulam provides a brief history of research preceding his 
isolation of THC with Yehiel Gaoni in 1964, and discusses some of the 
possible therapeutic applications that can be derived from 
cannabinoids.

        "Probably the major barrier has been the unwillingness, or 
fear, by companies to develop drugs that are based on cannabis.  They 
are afraid, as I said before, of notoriety.  They were afraid that 
they would get into a jam of sorts.  So for the first ten years after 
our discoveries, essentially no work has been done whatsoever on the 
pharmaceutical properties of cannabis.  Even afterwards the work that 
was done, was done very, very timidly and very slowly.  Even when 
work done at a scientific level it was stopped at the corporate- 
administrative level . . . Most industries and governments do not 
know how to make use of scientists and scientific ideas."  pg. 587.

        This article reviews a) the acute and chronic effects of 
cannabis in humans b) the possible adverse effects of cannabis on 
health and c) the therapeutic uses of cannabis.  This article is 
cited frequently and is considered one of the most authoritative 
analyses of cannabis-oriented research to date.  Subsequent research 
has tended to support Hollister's conclusions, particularly in regard 
to tolerance and dependence.

        "Tolerance is not a problem when doses are small, or 
infrequent, or where the pattern of use of the drug is not prolonged.  
Tolerance only becomes a major factor with high, sustained, and 
prolonged use of the drug . . . Large doses of THC are required over 
long time periods for tolerance to develop.  As most social use of 
the drug does not meet these requirements, neither tolerance nor 
dependence has been a major issue in its social use."  pg. 9.

Brain

        Prior to this study, "one reason for our lack of insight 
concerning the actions of cannabinoid drugs in the (Central Nervous 
System) is that a clearly defined cellular mechanism(s) for this 
class of drugs has remained elusive."  pg. 605.

        It had long been suspected that the effects of cannabis were 
mediated by receptors in the brain, but until this study the 
technology to determine and characterize these receptors did not 
exist.  Prior research had established criteria for a 
pharmacologically distinct cannabinoid receptor; this study met those 
criteria by using autoradiographic binding of a potent isomer of THC 
to tissues from a rat brain.

        Herkenham's research team applied the technology developed by 
Howlett's team to locating cannabinoid receptors in guinea pig, rat, 
dog, monkey and human brains.

        Receptors are most dense in the basal ganglia, hippocampus, 
and cerebellum, and are sparse in the lower brainstem areas 
controlling heart and lung functions.  "High densities of receptors 
in the forebrain and cerebellum implicate roles for cannabinoids in 
cognition and movement." (pg. 1932.)

        Addressing recent interest in dopamine release in the brain, 
Herkenham notes that:  "The presence of cannabinoid receptors in the 
ventromedial striatum suggests an association with dopamine circuits 
thought to mediate reward.  However, reinforcing properties of 
cannabinoids have been difficult to demonstrate in animals.  
Moreover, cannabinoid receptors in the basal ganglia are not 
localized on dopamine neurons."  pg. 1936.

QUAD-CITY TIMES <tt></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police sealed off Davenport's
Credit Island Park and made more than 30 arrests Saturday after a
melee broke out between officers and participants at a
marijuana-themed festival there. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Davenport police officer, Chad
Langager, 36, was hositalized and expected to undergo surgery for
a serious knee injury. One festival-goer who allegedly had been
smoking marijuana came away with a broken nose. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hempfest - which is intended,
organizers have said, to promote the benefits of the hemp plant
from which marijuana is made - was only 90 minutes old when the
disturbance began. The crowd intervened after police moved in
about 1:30 p.m. to arrest four people sharing a marijuana
cigarette, authorities said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There's no free day I'm
aware of where we're not supposed to enforce laws,&quot;
Davenport Police Chief Steve Lynn said. &quot;We tried to deal
with it as effectively as we could.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police set up a command center at
Credit Island Park before the festival began. More than 50
officers, including Metropolitan Enforcement Group officers and
sheriff's deputies, were on the scene. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lynn said several people incited
the assemblage and called it &quot;a crowd of near-riot
proportion.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fracas, police reports
state that: officers were pushed, punched and spat upon; one
participant allegedly tried to wrench an officer's nightstick
from his grasp while others grabbed microphones in the park
pavilion and urged the crowd to resist police. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police used a substance called
Capstun similar to Pepper Defense Spray to disperse the 300 to
400 Hempfest participants who had come from around the Midwest. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witnesses said several children
were affected by the burning, choking mixture. Tamara Kirkland,
17, of Moline, said her 4-year-old niece had to be carried off
after she was sprayed. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lynn said the accidental spraying
of some children was unavoidable because of the circumstances. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twelve participants, including the
Hempfest organizer, Bob Moldenhauer, 43, of Rock Island, were
arrested. Moldenhauer was being held in the Scott County Jail on
$1,040 bond late Saturday, facing charges of possession of a
controlled substance, trespassing, interference and possession of
drug paraphernalia. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police reports state that
Moldenhauer was told to leave the scene. He initially complied,
but then returned and tried to hand officers leaflets. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he refused subsequent orders
to leave he was taken into custody and had to be taken to the
ground before he could be restrained, according to the reports. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other people arrested were being
held on various charges, including possession of marijuana,
inciting a riot and assaulting a police officer. More than 20
people, many of them in their teens, were issued citations, but
were not held in custody. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of the Capstun spray
outraged some crowd members such as Josh Abney, 19, of East
Moline. &quot;They sprayed me, and I threw my Mountain Dew bottle
at them,&quot; he said. &quot;They made it a riot.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanya Wheeler, 19, of Moline, said
she felt the police provoked the fracas. &quot;The mace wasn't
aimed at people smoking,&quot; she said. &quot;They were walking
around spraying everybody. I had it in my mouth, and it burns
your throat.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other witnesses also said the
arrests were made with excessive force. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lynn said the event never should
have been held in the park in the first place. Instead of
acquiring a permit, Hempfest organizers applied for the use of a
park shelter which only requires notifying the city's parks and
recreation department. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They trashed LeClaire Park
three years ago, and the city said they were not supposed to come
back,&quot; he said. &quot;But they circumvented the license this
time.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Hempfest was held in
September 1993 at Prospect Park in Moline, neighbors complained
to city officials, saying it was nothing more than a &quot;drug
party.&quot;</tt> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DAVENPORT -- What started out
to be a day of peace and love quickly descended into violence and
arrests, as this year's spring Hemp Fest at Credit Island Park
was closed early Saturday afternoon by police. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty-three people were arrested
on charges ranging from possession of controlled substances to
assault, and one Davenport police officer was seriously injured. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police and festival participants
alike described the incident as a &quot;riot&quot; situation. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 36-year-old police officer, a
16-year veteran of the department, suffered a leg injury that
requleed surgery at a local hospital. Because he is an undercover
officer, his name was not released by police. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police reported no other injuries. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday's festival began at noon.
Shortly before 1 p.m., police began making arrests.</tt></font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <font size="+2"><b><p>'Our intent was <br>
    not to close the <br>
    park down, but just <br>
    to monitor the <br>
    situation ....'</b></font> <font size="+1"><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officer Dave Kanaack, <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Davenport Police</font><br>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<tt>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's when some of the
festival-goers violently resisted arrest and started
&quot;throwing bottles and rocks,&quot; said Officer Dave
Kanaack, one of about 20 officers at the scene. &quot;Our intent
was not to close the park down, but juat to monitor the situation
with regard to Iowa laws.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since possession and recreational
use of hemp, from which marijuana is derived, is illegal, Officer
Kanaack said, &quot;We're not just going to look the other
way.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, some of the
festival-goers held a different viewpoint. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's not right. We should be
able to do what we want,&quot; said Joe Smith of Rock Island, who
came to the festival just before the violence broke out.
&quot;Everybody was just having a good time until this started. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It just broke out out of the
blue,&quot; he said after police closed the island at 1:33 p.m. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Smith said many in the crowd
defended those who were being arrested. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Everybody stood up for
everybody else,&quot; he said, estimating the crowd to be about
1,000. Other crowd estimates were much lower. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Smith said police officers
used Mace to control and subdue the festival-goers. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officer Kanaack said &quot;there
was an accident with a police officer&quot; who was trying to
control one individual and &quot;some residual spray got in the
direction of the crowd. Unfortunately, a lot of people were
involved in this.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hubert Evans of Davenport, who
left the park just before the riot broke out, called the police
department later Saturday to complain about their treattuent of
the public. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I don't appreciate them
being so reckless with people's lives, walking around
intimidating people,&quot; he said of police behavior before
arrests were made. &quot;They were creating a military threat in
a peaceful situation. It was deliberately provocative.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It used to be so different
at the different locations. They were so much more lenient,&quot;
said Sharon Valle of Bettendoff. &quot;Occasionally, cops would
stop by and look intimidating. But it would be very
peaceful.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least three men still were
being held in the Scott County Jail Saturday night. According to
a jail spokesman, the men, whose ages and addresses were not
available, were: Joseph Loughead, charged with rioting and
interference with official acts; Christopher Rice, charged with
assault with injury to a Police officer, rioting and Interference
with official acts; and Michael Winterlin, charged with assault
with injury to a police officer, interference with official acts
and disorderly conduct. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hemp Pest organizer Robert
Moldenhauer of Rock Island was arrested and charged with unlawful
assembly, failure to disperse and possession. He could not be
reached Saturday for comment. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Davenport officer Saturday night
said the department may be perceived to be harsher than others
because &quot;we've always pretty much had zero tolercance on any
kind of drug activity.&quot; He said that reflects Chief Steve
Lynn's position. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday's melee wes not the first
time tensions have risen between police and attendants of Hemp
Fest in the Quad-Cities. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police made &quot;several&quot;
arrests in May 1995 during a festival at Loud Thunder Forest
Preserve near Andalusia. Charges ranged from possession of
cannabis, minors in possession of alcohol and contributing to the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rock Island County Sheriff
Department Capt. Richard Fisher said at the time that the Loud
Thunder event &quot;was a complete disaster.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September 1993, Moline police
received complaints of illegal drug use, fighting, open profanity
and yards being used as bathrooms during a hemp fest in Prospect
Park. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that event, Moline Police
Chief Steve Etheridge said officers declined to make arrests in
Prospect Park, fearing the actions &quot;would start a
riot.&quot;</tt> </p>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DAVENPORT -- Hemp Fest
organizer Bob Moldenhauer said Monday he may move next year's
event to private property after the mass arrests at Saturday's
festival -- arrests he says were intended solely to silence him. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a vendetta against me --
it's not about the Hemp Fest anymore,&quot; he said. &quot;What
happened Saturday afternoon was a well-orchestrated effort,
pre-planned by the Davenport Police Department.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not true, police Lt. Dave
Struckman said Monday. Officers made arrests and closed Credit
Island Park only because some participants blatantly were
breaking laws and inciting riot, he said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A melee began after police tried
to arrest four people allegedly smoking a marijuana cigarette,
according to reports. Others in the crowd began throwing bottles
and rocks at police and using loudspeakers to encourage people to
resist arrest, police said. Mr. Moldenhauer said police arrested
him and the others to keep him and others from talking to the
crowd about Libertarian philosophies and decriminalization of
marijuana. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They wanted to silence me,
to keep me from telling people that government does not really
exist,&quot; he said. &quot;It's just a private corporation that
takes our money, and that's it.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody silenced Mr. Moldenhauer,
Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We gave him a forum,&quot;
he said. &quot;He had an hour and a half to exercise his right to
free speech. He could talk about anti-government, pro-marijuana
or whatever. But we had told these folks that we would not sit
back and let them violate the law.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some fest-goers openly were
smoking marijuana, even though police were nearby and had
supplied an &quot;amnesty barrel&quot; in which the public could
dump their marijuana as they entered, Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Our officers would have
loved to have been there and not had to do a damned thing,&quot;
he said, &quot;but it was too blatant to overlook.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police estimate 300 to 400 people
attended the event. Thirty-three were arrested on charges ranging
from possession of controlled substances to assault. During the
melee, a 36-year-old Davenport police officer had his leg broken
when Christopher Rice, 28, of Rock Island allegedly fought being
arrested, according to police reports. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Winterlin, 21, of
Bettendorf was charged with assault on a police officer,
disorderly conduct and interference with official acts after he
allegedly taunted police, chanted obscenities against the police,
spit in the face of one officer and punched another in the chest,
according to police reports. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That's inciting a
riot,&quot; Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officers employed a chemical spray
to subdue the crowd, but Mr. Moldenhauer said reports of its use
were exaggerated. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I only saw one (officer)P
using it, and I was standing right downwind from him,&quot; he
said. &quot;If he'd bee using a lot of it, I'd have known. It was
just an intimidation tactic.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jennifer Cooper of Moline said
police handled festival-goers too roughly. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;People who weren't moving
fast enough got kicked around and roughed up,&quot; she said.
&quot;One guy was still getting kicked after he was cuffed and on
the ground.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lt. Struckman said the police
department has received no complaints about officer's deportment
during Saturday's arrests. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fest organizers rented a city park
shelter under an individual's name instead of trying to get a
permit for the fest from the city, according to Scott County
Sheriff Mike Bladel, whose deputies assisted city police at the
park. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We weren't told we needed a
permit,&quot; Mr. Moldenhauer said. &quot;The city wanted things
to occur just as they did. I think next year we might move the
fest to private property. Then the police won't have any excuses
for this kind of thing.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That wouldn't stop police from
making drug arrests, Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Even on private property,
there are things called 'laws,'&quot; he said. &quot;It may be
private property, but if you open the event to the general
public, it becomes sort of public domain. Police could still be
there under-cover.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mr. Moldenhauer's view,
marijuana use is not prohibited by law in Iowa. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Under Iowa law, a person is
defined as a legal entity,&quot; he said. &quot;But according to
Black's legal dictionary, a legal entity is not a natural person.
So you can have all the pot you want because you're not a
person.&quot;</tt> </p>

<BR>QUAD-CITY TIMES

<TT><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the disturbance that landed him in jail and led to 30 other arrests, the Rock Island man who organized last weekend's Hemp Fest at Credit Island Park says he has no plans to 
discontinue the semiannual event and will move it to private property next time.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I ain't gonna let 'em stop Hemp Past,&quot; Robert Moldenhauer said Monday.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moldenhauer, 41, faces numerous charges, including criminal trespassing and marijuana possession, in the wake of the melee that broke out when police and fest-goers clashed Saturday afternoon.  The event, promoted last week with fliers that included a hand-drawn map directing participants to Davenport's Credit Island, attracted as many as 400 people from across the Midwest.  Davenport police said.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moldenhauer does not dispute police reports that list him as the event's organizer.  He said he reserved a park shelter by paying $20, and then paid a $150 damage deposit at the request of 
the city of Davenport's legal department.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the past six years, he has arranged numerous other Hemp Fests in the Quad-Cities, he said.  Some of the twice-a-year events have resulted in disturbances not unlike the one Saturday.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But instead of bouncing around from one city park to another and being &quot;hassled&quot; by police, Moldenhauer says he intends to move future Hemp Fests to private property.  If police try to intervene, they will be trespassing, he warned.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And we'll deal with trespassers the way trespassers should be dealt with,&quot; he said, declining to elaborate.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He denied that the purpose of Saturday's event was to promote illegal drug use, even though the fliers intercepted last week by police suggested otherwise.  The leaflets advised participants to &quot;remember to bring a bud,&quot; a reference to marijuana cigarettes.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moldenhauer argues the fests are designed only to promote the benefits of hemp -- the plant from which marijuana is derived and to educate people about the government.  He said police quashed Saturday's fest, not because of its hemp theme, but because they wanted to censor his views.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They intended to shut it down primarily to silence me,&quot; he said.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The government doesn't like to hear what I have to say because it exposes them as extortionists.&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police, who had a command center set up across the street from the park, said they were there only to monitor the situation and enforce the law.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They moved in after observing four people share a marijuana cigarette.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problems began when the crowd lashed out against the arresting officers.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some fest-goers formed a circle around officers, yelled obscenities and threw bottles at them.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One officer suffered a broken leg while trying to restrain one of the participants.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 36-year-old officer was recovering Monday at a Davenport hospital after he underwent surgery Saturday afternoon.</TT>

<TT>Rally Report
<BR>by Chris Rice

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday, May 16th, 1996 couldn't have been a more beautiful day for the Quad Cities Hemp Coalition's twelth semiannual Hempfest being held on Credit Island on the Mississippi River in Davenpot, Iowa.  It soon became apparent that this fest wasn't going to be as groovy as the others.  A heavy police presence greeted Hempsters, and police "Amnesty Barrels" decorated the entrance to the island.  Only an hour into the event, which started at High Noon, the police moved into the center of the crowd and attempted to search a woman's purse who had been seen smoking some kind of "hand rolled cigarette."  Members of the crowd informed the woman, who was not under arrest at the time, that she did not have to consent to a search.  The officer tugged on the purse while pursuading the woman to give it up.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, police decended on the crowd from their temporary island command post, slamming fest participants to the ground and spraying capstun on the crowd indiscriminately.  Thirty-three were arrested and hundreds were cleared from the island.  A police officer's leg was broken when another officer fell on him.  Chris Rice, a fest organizer, was charged with breaking the officer's leg even though he was faced down on the ground and handcuffed at the time.  Local news broadcasts showed a woman looking for her baby being sprayed in the face repeatedly with capstun.  Davenport police chief Steve Lynn (business phone # 319-326-7778) was present for the entire event.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A demonstration in response to this event is planned for Saturday, July 27th, 1996 at the Scott County Courthouse, 416 West 4th Street, Davenport, Iowa.  The police are saying that Hempfest is closed down for good and we need to show them otherwise.  Call Chris Rice (309) 794-9107 for info.

<FONT SIZE=+1><TT><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, May 18th, 1996 there was a Hempfest held on Credit Island in Davenport, Iowa.  The police decided they were going to shut down Hempfest and showed up in full force.  They stepped up to the front of the crowd and attempted to grab a woman's purse.  When members of the crowd told the woman that she doesn't have to consent to a search, the police officers responded by slamming festival participants to the ground and spraying the crowd with capstun indiscriminately.  The police are saying they have shut down Hempfest for good.  They think that we will stop fighting for our rights!  Well that's not going to happen.  Now is when we pull together and make an axample of Davenport, Iowa.  We are going to come back stronger than ever!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way that the police and Davenport are going to stop us from having this type of gathering is to stop arresting people for Cannabis; free our friends and family doing years in prison for Cannabis; and allow us to grow a personal amount to consume in our own homes and on other private property with the consent of the owner.  Stop sending armed masked men in black to break down our doors, invade our homes, throw us to the floor, and drag us away in the middle of the night to live for years in chains.  Then, and only then, will we stop demanding an end to this atrocity!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are tired of being used as an excuse for politicians to tamper with the rights guaranteed to us in the Constitution.  We love America and we want her to live up to her promise.  It's a free country:  Like it; Leave it; or change it.  We intend to change it back to the free land our founding fathers intended.  If you can't stand freedom, maybe you should leave!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often said, "They will change the law someday."  Ask yourself, "Who are they?"  It's obvious that the powers that be don't have concern for us.  "They" is us, "We the People".  It is up to us to force a change as peaceably as possible.  NOW!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a surprise to almost everyone when alcohol prohibition ended in 1933, and everyone was surprised when the Berlin Wall fell overnight.  Now we are up against the wall and it's time we start pushing.  We have the strength of numbers and the conviction of prior convictions.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are sorry if the police and courts set robbers, rapists, and murderers loose in order to prosecute us, but they have been doing just that for years!  The purpose of this action is to end this miscarriage of justice.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently people doing life in prison without parole on cannabis charges.  We are their only hope for freedom and they are counting on us.  Will you let them down, or will you wish you had done something when your turn comes?  If you don't do anything about this then you are also responsible because you allow it to happen.  Join with us and victory is ours!  Live in fear and you might be next!

<B><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><TT>WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP BRING AN END TO THE DRUG WAR?</TT></FONT></CENTER></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><TT>Spend a little money copying flyers for demonstrations and events.  Distribute them to friends, at the bar, at public events, concerts, 4th of July celebrations, and to the passer by on the street.

<P>Do not support businesses or buy products from companies that support the WAR ON DRUGS.  Call then and tell them why you will no longer buy their products even though you like them.

<P>Go to the County Clerk's office tomorrow end register to vote.  Vote pro hemp and against the DRUG WAR.  Write your elected officials and tell them what issues and positions will effect your vote in the next election.

<P>Tune your radio to AM 1420 between 2:00 P.M. and 6:00 P.M., Monday through Friday.  Tell talk radio host Jim Fisher how you feel about the WAR ON DRUGS.  If you are told that they don't want to talk about the WAR ON DRUGS today, it is easy to turn any other subject into a DRUG WAR subject.  To get on the air call (319) 344-7040.

<P>Pay for a billboard or a newspaper ad with a picture of friends and family imprisoned by the WAR OH DRUGS.  Include their name, age. charge. term, address, and a short biography describing how imprisonment has harmed them and their dependents.  People need to know that there are real people doing real time.  We need to put a face to a number.

<P>Attend demonstrations against the WAR ON DRUGS.  Attendance at demonstrations does not mean you are a drug user.  What it does is show the media that there are thousands of people that believe that there has to be a better alternative than a DRUG WAR that focuses on arrest and imprisonment.

<P>If you are in a band, write a song or two about this situation.  Pass out flyers at shows and use your pulpit to announce upcoming events.  Call (309) 794-9107 for information about a local compilation we would like to record to benefit this cause.  We will remember your efforts when we purchase recordings.

<P>If a police officer wants to search your vehicle or person, just say "NO!"  When they say "If you have nothing to hide, why can't I search?", tell them "It is my 4th Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search".  Stick to it.  You don't know if someone dropped a seed in your back seat.  Tell them to "go ahead and get the dogs" if threatened with them.  Let them waste their time.  You don't get any extra credit for helping them send you up.

<P>Think about whether you really want to smoke with someone who doesn't care if you could go to jail for doing it.  Expect people to back up their beliefs with actions.

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Hempsters demonstrate against the war on drugs.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Davenport, IA July 27, 1996.&nbsp;  The streets of downtown Davenport were infiltrated by a platoon of freedom fighters wearing tee-shirts that read "Bix smokes," armed with 10,000 flyers that describe the world renown jazz musician Bix Beiderbecke as a marijuana user.&nbsp;  Thousands of survivors from the Bix 7 Mile foot race and attendants of the Bix jazz music fest were eagerly snapping up the hand bills.&nbsp;  Meanwhile a few blocks away, a hundred hempsters demonstrated on the lawn of the Scott County Court House.
<BR>
<BR>A press conference hosted by Chris Rice, Quad City Hemp Coalition organizer, explains the demonstration's purpose is: to denounce the police macing and beating of hempsters at the May 18th QCHC rally at Davenport's Credit Island; as part of the Uniting Spirits march to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago to protest the war on drugs; and to educate the public of the role marijuana played in the jazz music community.&nbsp;  Speakers included QCHC Chris Rice, libertarian candidate Robin Miller, and Zenger Editor Jackson Clubb.
<BR>
<BR>Chris Rice told the crowd how police at Credit Island started the riot when they wrenched a purse from a woman's hands dispite her protest against search without consent.&nbsp;  Rice continued with how he was beat while being arrested for interferance with the search and how police claim that he broke a police officer's leg during his arrest.&nbsp;  Chris further told of his up coming trial and said, "The cops don't have a leg to stand on."&nbsp;  Read about Credit Island rally on the net at <A HREF="http://www.commonlink.com/~olsen/NORML/QCHC/qchc.html"> http://www.commonlink.com/~olsen/NORML/QCHC/qchc.html</A>.
<BR>
<BR>Libertarian candidate from illinios for US Senate, Robin Miller talked about the Libertarian Party platform entitled First Step Towards Freedom; included within he said, "Pardon everyone convicted of nonviolent drug offences ... to empty federal prisons of the marijuana smokers and others who are of no threat to society."&nbsp;  Miller pledged, "The Constitution is our contract with America."
<BR>
<BR>Jackson Clubb encouraged people to go to Chicago and participate in the Uniting Spirits march to the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp;  Clubb said that he was run out of town in the 1970's for organizing rallies and selling tee-shirts that read "Quad Shitties" depicting a cop beating a hippy.
<BR>
<BR>Others told how Henry County Illinios is one big drug war atrocity, where victims are intimidated by police into consent to search and are railroaded through court to jail.&nbsp;  A woman discribed how she served 12 terrible weeks in the Henry Co. jail for one joint.&nbsp;  Mr. Rice told of the excitement of cross country travelers when they see fields of wild marijuana; only to end up in jail for picking ditchweed that gives you a headache.
<BR>
<BR>No law enforcement was visible at the rally, except for two friendly Sheriff Dept. deputies who passed through on bicycles.&nbsp;  The demonstration concluded with 100 protesters carrying signs chantting, "Hay Hay HO HO, we don't want your drug war, Bix smoked reefer," and "We smoke pot and we like it alot."&nbsp;  Local press report "Hemp Fest Peaceful."

<BR>
<BR>
Dear Dr. Gieringer:<P>

Thank you for taking the time to contact me with your opinions.&nbsp;  As
your Senator, it's important for me to hear from you.<P>

I appreciate your comments regarding proposals to legalize certain illicit drugs as an attempt to address the problems of drug abuse and drug-related crime in America.&nbsp;  However, I firmly believe drug use is wrong and harmful and that it must stop.&nbsp;  This includes marijuana, a drug proven to be both harmful to the user and a major gateway drug for other, more dangerous substances.&nbsp;  Eighty-five percent of people who use harder drugs such as cocaine or crack admit to first having used marijuana.<P>

The effects of marijuana use are well documented.&nbsp;  Using marijuana
produces a dreamy state of consciousness in which ideas seem disconnected, uncontrollable, and free-flowing.&nbsp;  Time, color, and spatial perceptions may be distorted and enhanced.&nbsp;  Communicative and motor abilities are decreased during the use of these drugs.&nbsp;  Difficulty in depth perception and altered sense of timing, both of which are particularly hazardous, are also known effects of using marijuana.&nbsp;  Marijuana is addictive, causes difficulty with persistent memory and cognitive functions, causes personality changes, creates abnormalities in the lungs, creates abnormalities in the unborn, has residual effects on fetuses exposed in utero, and suppresses the immune system.<P>

The argument that the dangers of marijuana are overstated were more plausible in the 1960s and 1970s, when less was known about the full effects of this and many other drugs.&nbsp;  Today, supporting the idea of smoking marijuana for medicinal purposes is similar to supporting tobacco for weight or anxiety control.&nbsp;  There are better, safer, and more effective alternatives that are readily available whose side effects and interactive dangers are known.<P>

Claims that drug users only effect themselves and pose no threat to society are also misguided.&nbsp;  People who use drugs do so to alter their perceptions of reality.&nbsp;  When someone is high, they cannot be as alert to dangers that are always around us, dangers such as a boiling pot on the stove, a burning candle, or even something as simple as an open window.&nbsp;  Drug using workers are 3 to 4 times as likely to have on-the-job accidents, 4 to 6 times more likely to have off-the-job accidents, 2 to 3 times more likely to file medical claims, 5 times more likely to file workman's compensation, and 25 percent to 35 percent less productive on the job.&nbsp;  To claim that drug use affects only the user is to deny the reality that whatever we do effects those around us.<P>

The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) survey numbers on hospital admissions for drug related emergencies further confirms the alarming problems created by drug use.&nbsp;  At least 500,000 Americans ended up in hospital emergency rooms in 1994 because of drug-related episodes, 40,100 of these episodes were directly related to marijuana.&nbsp;  Marijuana is likely to be mentioned in combination with other substances, particularly alcohol and cocaine.&nbsp;  In 1994, alcohol and cocaine were mentioned during 48 percent of marijuana-related episodes.<P>

Please look at the statement that I made on the floor of the Senate that further addresses the idea of drug legalization.&nbsp;  Drugs are illegal because they are dangerous, they are not dangerous because they are illegal.&nbsp;  We need to work to keep our drug laws strong and effective.<P>

Once again, thank you for communicating your views to me.&nbsp;  Although we may disagree at times, I nonetheless appreciate and encourage your communication with me.&nbsp;  Knowing your concerns helps me to do the best job I can as your U.S. Senator.<P>

Sincerely,<BR>

<BR>September 12, 1996
<BR>
<BR>Carl,
<BR>
<DD>I just wanted to write you a letter and let you know how it's going with me.&nbsp;  As I'm sure you've heard, I was busted on February 13 by U.S. Customs & DEA SWAT teams at my house in Minneapolis.&nbsp;  I was originally charged with conspiracy for over 1,000 kilos of pot, money laundering and 5 counts of possession with intent to distribute.&nbsp;  Everyone on my indictment became informers except me.&nbsp;  Even when told I faced 20 years of federal time, I refused to even meet with narcs, or say anything at all about my activities.&nbsp;  In June I pled guilty to one count of possession of 500 pounds in February 1992.&nbsp;  In August I was sentenced to 63 months in the Bureau of Prisons.
<DD>The state of Texas is currently revoking my probation on an 80 pound possession charge, also from 1992, that may or may not result in more time.&nbsp;  I am presently on my way (hopefully) to a federal corrections institute in Minnesota.&nbsp;  Some people have insinuated that my arrest, like similar arrests of people like Arlin Troutt and Dennis Peron, have discredited the Grassroots Party and the Hemp Movement.&nbsp;  This is absurd.
<DD>The only "crime" I have ever been convicted of is possession of marijuana - the breaking of an unjust and unreasonable law.&nbsp;  The same goes for Arlin and Dennis.&nbsp;  Any you.&nbsp;  I am angry and disgusted by certain elements who are trying to defame people like us who have put their lives on the line to further a righteous cause.&nbsp;  I am not saying that everyone should break the marijuana laws, but I am sickened by self-righteous hypocrites who condemn those of us who have been arrested and given up years of our lives for nothing more than possession of a plant that is a gift from God.&nbsp;  There are three equally important aspects of the cannabis legalization issue: industrial, medical and HUMAN RIGHTS.&nbsp;  Human rights encompasses personal and religious use.&nbsp;  I have always said that the Hemp Movement will only be successful when all three aspects are accorded equal importance.
<DD>There are between 100,000 and a quarter million Americans in prison today for marijuana alone.&nbsp;  Their cause is EVERY BIT as legitimate and vital as that of medical users or "industrial use" advocates.
<DD>For one group of Hemp Activists to look down their noses at another is ridiculous and counter-productive.&nbsp;  It should be remembered that the purpose and intent of the laws against marijuana is the total eradication and extinction of the cannabis plant.&nbsp;  Were it not for "outlaws" who have kept the cannabis species alive over the last 60 years, the industrial and medical use advocates may well not have had a plant to be talking about.
<DD>Ghandi said, "We have a moral obligation to disobey unrighteous laws."&nbsp;  Thoreau said, "In a land where any are imprisoned unjustly, the only place for a truly just man is in prison."&nbsp;  I agree with them both.&nbsp;  I did not become an activist after my arrest - I've been at it for over seven years, and I've worked as hard and given as much as anyone in this movement has.&nbsp;  Now I am giving 5 years of my life in federal prison.
<DD>Marijuana prisoners ask for no special accolades or recognition - we know ourselves the worth of our sacrifice and dedication, for we are the ones who must pay its price.&nbsp;  But we do not deserve the condemnation and recrimination of anyone who claims to fight for Truth and Justice.&nbsp;  The Hemp Movement is stuggling to change a law that will change the world.&nbsp;  We need all the help we can get, and we must work together.&nbsp;  You keep doing your job, and we'll keep doin' ours.
<DD>Until We Win,
<DD>Russell "Bongo" Bentley
<BR>
<BR>P.S.&nbsp;  I don't know how much time you have for reading, but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND LIVING IN TRUTH by VACLAC HAVEL.&nbsp;  Read it, you'll be glad you did.

<P>Dear Mark:

<P>A few weeks ago you requested permission to provide a letter I'd written to Iowa Senator Grassley to various newspapers & other federal legislators.&nbsp;  I'd provided it to Carl Olsen (IA NORML) who forwarded it & placed it on the Internet, dispersing it at my request.

<P>You are encouraged to make that letter available to anyone who needs to be educated about Cannabis in an honest manner as opposed to the pervasive govt misinformation.

<P><CENTER>* * * * * * * *</CENTER>

<P>I've noted a recent federal push to control "pseudoephedrine" anti-histamines & cold pills in an effort to further enforce prohibition of "meth"amphetamine clandestine production.
<DD>It should be pointed out to these "pop-law" lawmakers that use of these remedies are a simple expedient to the outlaw lab production techniques, and that "meth" will still be made using bituminous (soft) coal, bleach, battery (sulfuric) acid, and salt, the latter two combining to make hydrochloric gas.&nbsp;  In the early 1900s this was a widely known process to make "chicken crank" so the hen would lay more eggs, grow faster, etc., along with helping the farmers of the era do more work!&nbsp;  "Chicken crank" was used in a variety of snake-oil concoctions "energizers" and was an ingredient in some soft drinks, namely 7-Up & Coca Cola.&nbsp;  It can also be produced from coal oil.
<DD>If Congress moves to control cold remedies, underground labs in this country will use commonly available materials to continue operation.&nbsp;  It seems the politicians are unaware that the 'Invisible Hand' of market demand is what fuels the market and no hysterical "pop-law" will slow it down, much less stop production.

<P>It should be understood I do not advocate "meth."&nbsp;  Nor do I advocate any war on Americans by Americans.&nbsp;  It is my belief that the (Lifestyle Police's) "DRUG WAR" is no more than VERY SICK POLITICS.&nbsp;  It's only product is misery imposed on the underprivileged and contempt for govt & authority as opposed to respect.&nbsp;  No govt has ever gained it's citizens' respect by means of prohibition and oppression.

<P>You have my permission to use this letter's contents in any way you deem appropriate.&nbsp;  Correspondents & supporters are desired.

<P><DD>Sincerely,
<DD>Jack D. Johnson, POW

<P>Dear Carl,

<DD>Thanks for the Summer 1996 NORML newsletter.&nbsp;  As your article on page 11 points out, the forfeiture - double jeopardy issue, which I was counting on, is now dead.&nbsp;  Never, in one term, has any U.S. Supreme Court so damaged the Constitution.
<DD>Besides the forfeiture - double jeopardy issue, they ruled that forfeitures from innocent owners is okay; that police can use pretext stops to search for drugs; limited federal judges' ability to make sure prisons provide legal access to inmates; and approved limiting habeas corpus in death penalty cases.&nbsp;  Now President Clinton is using the Olympic bombing to slip in roaming phone taps!&nbsp;  Who says 1984 isn't around?
<DD>On my appeal, we now expect the Iowa Supreme Court to rule on the legality of mushrooms.&nbsp;  On one level, there is no mention in the statute of any mushroom.&nbsp;  A look at the whole of Iowa's Controlled Substances Act would lead a reasonable person to the conclusion that mushrooms are legal.&nbsp;  They define "drug," in part, as "substances, other than food, intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body..."&nbsp;  Most people would consider a mushroom "food."&nbsp;  The definition of "manufacture" says, in part, "by extraction from substances of natural origin" and all I had was the "substance of natural origin" - mushrooms.&nbsp;  I was in no way "extracting" the psilocybin.
<DD>What the Iowa Supreme Court has to look at, though, is not whether it is fair to put me in prison for 20 years for having mushrooms not even listed as illegal.&nbsp;  What they really better consider is the precedent they will set in my case.&nbsp;  If they say a plant that naturally contains a listed substance is to be treated exactly like the extracted, or chemically synthesized, form, where does that leave the state of law?&nbsp;  Nicotine is illegal (Iowa Code  205.5) to possess or sell.&nbsp;  Every person with a pack of cigarettes would be in danger of prosecution.&nbsp;  Coffee, beans or brew, that contain caffeine would be subject to "drug" controls.&nbsp;  Home owners would be "manufacturing lysergic acid" if they grow morning glories.&nbsp;  Garden shops that sell San Pedro cactus, a common item, would be open to "sale of mescaline" charges.&nbsp;  The list goes on and on.
<DD>While the Iowa Supreme Court may not care to be fair in my case because it's legally correct to rule I broke no laws, they may think twice if they realize how they rule will affect tobacco and coffee.&nbsp;  NORML should take heed that an adverse ruling in my case opens the door for prosecutorial slight-of-hand and using my case to change a misdemeanor marijuana charge into a felony THC charge.
<DD>If the Iowa Supreme Court holds that mushrooms that naturally contain psilocybin are illegal, even if not specifically prohibited, because they happen to contain, naturally, psilocybin - where does that leave the Declaration of Independence and Constitution?&nbsp;  After all, they are documents that happen to "contain" an illegal substance since they are printed on paper containing hemp.&nbsp;  But then with the way the U.S. Supreme Court and our government is using the trumped up excuse of the "War on Drugs" to undermine these documents, they have already done much towards declaring them as "prohibited substances"!
<DD>We expect a ruling in my case in December or January.&nbsp;  As I said, now that the forfeiture - double jeopardy issue is dead, they will, now, have to rule on the mushroom legality issue.&nbsp;  Will the Iowa Supreme Court declare that much of life on this planet is illegal - which ruling against me will, in essence, do - because 1000s of living organisms naturally contain a controlled substance?&nbsp;  Or will they leave us safe to enjoy our poppy seed rolls, morning glory flowers and other items not specifically outlawed?&nbsp;  Tune in this winter...

<P><DD>Namaste,

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Dear Carl:
<BR>
<BR>Well, I went ahead and wrote my Religious Freedom/Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993/1st, 5th, 8th, 9th and 14th Amendments brief.&nbsp; (Whew!!)&nbsp;  Anyway, I doubt if I'd go through it again if I had all the stuff from your marijuana attack ...  and, I'm sure it was more than you would want to send anyway.&nbsp;  So, unless it was real easy for you, you can forget that request.
<BR>
<BR>But I have another one.&nbsp;  Since I am planning for the new trial,
which I hope will not be necessary, but "just in case" I want to be ready ... and have a couple of requests.
<BR>
<BR>One, the FIJA people wrote me and said you were the one to contact in Iowa.&nbsp;  They mention in the newletter on information they have in their "Activists' Supply Shop" that tells how to inform the jury at the trial.&nbsp;  Do you have that literature?&nbsp;  I couldn't tell from the list which it was, and couldn't afford it if I could have.&nbsp;  If you have this could you send me a copy?&nbsp;  (THE INFO FOR ATTORNEYS ON HOW TO SLIP IT IN IN OPENING/CLOSING ARGUMENT)
<BR>
<BR>Two, If my case does go to trial next year (Feb, March or April) would you be able, perhaps, to get a couple of persons to hand out the "True or False" FIJA leaflets?&nbsp;  I think that would help a lot as I will be making a good case to the jury on mushrooms safety, religious use, and the silliness of the law that prosecutes someone for something not even listed as illegal and sends them to prison for 20 years.&nbsp;  (THE TRIAL WOULD PROBABLY BE IN SCOTT COUNTY - FOR LEAFLETING)
<BR>
<BR>Three, Do you know any doctors, professors, biologists or psychiatric doctors that would write an Affidavit, and possibly testify at trial, on the safety and ????? of psilocybin and of mushrooms?&nbsp;  If so, could you send me their addresses so I could contact them and get affidavits for my motion and inquire if they would also be willing to testify if a new trial becomes necessary?
<BR>
<BR>Thank you for your support so far.&nbsp;  I hope you can help me out on the above three requests.
<BR>
<BR>Best regards,
<BR>Skip
<BR>
<BR>P.S.&nbsp;  I will be representing myself at any new trial.&nbsp;  No sell-out court-appointed lawyers <U>again</U>!&nbsp;  I <U>am</U> a paralegal and am studying on how to prepare & present my case at trial.

<DIV ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Dear Carl,
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>I've changed my mind, again.&nbsp;  Sorry.&nbsp;  I <U>would</U> like a copy of your original <U>DEA Petition</U> for an exemption and the appeal stuff.&nbsp;  The reason is that, regardless of the outcome of my case, I think my Sacred Mushroom Church has a real chance for an exemption - since Psilocybe mushrooms are situated much more similarly to peyote than marijuana.&nbsp;  Besides, I <U>have</U> used them as a religious sacrament for 22 years and it's about time I was able to do so legally.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>We plan to incorporate our church also.&nbsp;  Having your original Petition, etc., would guide me in the process I need to follow.&nbsp;  I think my argument has a much better chance than marijuana, as, from the Spanish Inquisition on, peyote <U>and</U> mushrooms have been used and persecuted/prosecuted together.&nbsp;  I think the religious use history, medical safety (Psilocybin is <U>THE</U> SAFEST HALLUCINOGEN, 10 TIMES SAFER THAN MESCALINE; AND MUCH LESS TOXIC, EVEN, THAN THC), and "pervasiveness" of <U>actual</U> use in the U.S. is so close to that of peyote that we'd really be in good shape under the RFRA of 1993.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>so, if it isn't too much of a problem, I would like the copies you said you'd make.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>This doesn't cancel the other items my last letter raised on the FIJA stuff.&nbsp;  If a new trial is necessary, I will want to raise, not only the religious freedom issue, but want the jury to be "fully informed."
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>I have Jonathan Ott (<U>PHARMACOTHEON</U>, <U>AGE OF ENTHEOGENS</U>, <U>HALLUCINOGENIC PLANTS OF NORTH AMERICA</U>, and other books) lined up to come from Mexico as on Expert Witness.&nbsp;  Also, Dr. John Beresford, retired Psychiatrist who did psilocybin experiments in the '60s, and now heads The Committee on Unjust Sentencing and The Albert Hoffmann Museum will be an Expert Witness.&nbsp;  I'm hoping for others, perhaps even Dr. Hoffmann, although his age, 93, might preclude his being able to come.&nbsp;  (He's close to both Dr. Beresford & Jonathan Ott)
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>I'm proceeding as if the new trial will be necessary.&nbsp;  Better to be prepared.&nbsp;  And I am getting ready to do a first class trial - and represent myself.&nbsp;  The motions are done, with supporting briefs, and I'm studying on trial presentation, objections, cross examinations, etc.&nbsp;  I'm preparing a trial notebook a'la F. Lee Bailey.&nbsp;  And with the cops & prosecutors destroying all 4,860 Mason jars of cultures, (knowing & <U>ADMITTING</U> I said I was growing many types of mushrooms), 2 weeks after I got in their jail, but before I could ask for preservation and independent testing - then lying on the stand about a "court order" to destroy the jars when it was the prosecutor who told the cops to destroy them - well, Mark Furman will look like a saint when I get through with the Quad City MEG officers who lied and the prosecutor who let them!
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>No Iowa choo-choo train trial this time, my friend.&nbsp;  Oh, I'd take a stand-by counsel to help - but I am going pro se.&nbsp;  Jury voir dire will be extensive this time.&nbsp;  Discovery motions, jury questionnaire motion & 75 sample questionnaire, etc., etc., are all typed and ready to go.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>They probably will decide not to even retry me at first glance of all the motions.&nbsp;  And each one is proper - not "frivolous" or like most "jail-house" lawyers do.&nbsp;  But then I am a trained paralegal.&nbsp;  I should have represented myself the first time - but, in county jail, there was no way to prepare.&nbsp;  Here in Anamosa ... I've got afternoons and all day Thursdays and Fridays and have been using the time in the law library and on the typewriters.&nbsp;  It has been my only activity.&nbsp;  Then, in my cell, I study for trial presentation - the one area of law I wasn't trained in at paralegal school.&nbsp;  Lists of questions for "cross," for me "Experts," exhibits, order of proof, etc., will all be in the trial notebook - ready to go.&nbsp;  And, I've got the luxury of the first trial's transcripts to prepare with.&nbsp;  All they have to present I've got time to prepare to counter.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>Well, I rattled on for more than you probably wanted to read.&nbsp;  Thanks for all the help.&nbsp;  Let me know about the FIJA stuff when you send the "EXEMPTION" stuff.&nbsp;  I can't tell you how big a help you've been.&nbsp;  Hope we get to meet someday - I'm sure we will ....

Subject: Re: Atlanta Mayor's Drug Education


                      OPENING A DISCUSSION ABOUT
                    EFFECTIVE ANTI-DRUG STRATEGIES


                             May 15, 1995
                          by Eric E. Sterling
           President, The Criminal Justice Policy Foundation


  There is a movement, gathered here in Atlanta, Georgia, that 
argues that the means to fight the drug problem cannot be discussed.  
This movement is based on a false fundamentalism:  society's fight 
against drugs can be carried out either by means of prohibition 
(namely the status quo) or it must surrender to what it calls 
legalization.  The arguments of those who advocate legalization are 
too dangerous even to be heard.  Thus the Atlanta Resolution's first 
point is to reject all proposals to legalize illicit drugs.  This is 
simplistic thinking at its worst.

  Ninety-five percent of The Atlanta Resolution is plain common 
sense, but that is not what the Atlanta conference has gathered to 
discuss. 

  The conference agenda describes the catastrophe that would result 
from legalization, but no person who advocates any version of 
legalization has been invited to present their view or to answer 
questions.  The conference characterizations of drug legalization 
are as fair and as realistic as using Star Wars movies to describe 
the outcome of the NASA manned space flight program.  Implicit in 
the conference agenda is that our current strategy is simply dandy.

  But the American people don t think our current strategy is dandy 
at all.  A nationwide survey in February 1995 by Peter Hart Research 
Associates for Drug Strategies, Inc. found that 50% of the American 
people gave the Federal government a grade of F or D for dealing 
with the problems of drug use and addiction, and 59% gave those 
grades for the problem of drug-related crime.  Only 10% would give 
the Federal government a grade of A or B for dealing with drug use, 
and only 11% for drug-related crime.  Only 6% of Americans thought 
that drug abuse was less of a problem today than 5 years ago.

  A strategy must set forth goals and means.  The 1995 National Drug 
Control Strategy (the Strategy) promulgated by President Clinton 
sets forth clear and worthwhile goals that are a distinct 
improvement from previous strategies (Table 1-1).  The means 
proposed, however, are largely the same ones -- prohibition, and its 
enforcement -- which have failed.

  The National Drug Control Strategy is, in a sense, schizophrenic 
-- it reads as though it were drafted by a committee of Dr. Jekyll 
and Mr. Hyde.  It reflects an internal conflict between realistic 
goals and priorities, and the exaggeration characteristic of 
politicized discussions of the drug problem.  The Strategy writes 
about various drug problems oblivious to the causes of the problems 
and reasonable methods to correct those problems.

  Prohibition has failed to reduce crime or addiction.  There is no 
prohibition-based strategy that will substantially address those 
problems.  A drug-free society is unrealistic.  Our strategy of 
punishing drug addicts is akin to expelling from school students 
with learning disabilities.  To claim to be taking the profits out 
of $50 billion of a year's drug trafficking through the yearly 
forfeiture of $1 billion in property is absurd.  Even sales taxes 
would be more effective in taking the profits out.  Certainly much 
more extensive taxation is required but it is only possible when 
prohibition is repealed.

  We must change our strategy, but we must do so cautiously.  A 
regulatory, management approach to the myriad drug problems is 
called for.  It should be tailored to specific issues and adopted 
incrementally.  There will be addicts and crime no matter what we do.  
An example of regulatory complexity is the regulation of alcohol, 
one legal drug.  There are probably 10,000 different alcohol laws 
reflecting multiple goals from revenue collection to reducing 
consumption.  For this one drug, the regulation of the sale, 
advertising, taxation, and places of distribution and consumption 
vary in every jurisdiction depending whether it is beer, wine or 
whiskey.  Alcohol regulation has evolved since 1933.  In some ways 
it has improved, and in others it has gotten worse.  Developing a 
comprehensive regulatory scheme for dozens of classes of drugs can t 
be accomplished overnight.  There is much necessary market and 
regulatory research.


       National Drug Control Strategy -- A Strategy Founded on
                        Deceptions and Failures

  A strategy for action should identify the most important problems 
and recognize the limits of what the strategy can effect -- it must 
be honest.  The first problem identified in the White House's 
National Drug Control Strategy -- February 1995:  The crime-drug 
cycle continues.  Second, More teenagers are smoking pot.  The third 
problem is described as:  Less of them [America's teenagers] think 
cocaine use is dangerous.

  What does the Strategy say about the crime-drug cycle?  It simply 
sets forth the number and percentage of drug-related murders for the 
past eight years which ranged between 751 (3.9%) in 1986 and 1403 
 (7.4%) in 1989, down to 1287 (5.2%) in 1993, and states that there 
has been a marked increase youth homicide reported by Dr. Alfred 
Blumstein.  The Strategy provides no analysis of the problem.  It 
fails to explain the crime- drug cycle and how to break it.

  Mostly, the crime-drug cycle exists because drugs are prohibited.  
Prohibition inevitably requires violence.  All businesses are 
subject to conflict among market- participants.  Such conflict is 
resolved nonviolently for legal businesses by means of the courts or 
other nonviolent dispute resolution programs.  Prohibited businesses 
are forced to resolve conflict illegally -- either through violence 
or through adjudication by organized crime figures who rely upon 
violence for enforcement.

  Prohibition markets are especially attractive robbery targets 
because of the inevitably high volumes of cash and over-priced 
contraband.  Unlike legitimate businesses that can take checks or 
credit cards, illegal drug markets take only cash.  Legitimate 
business can hire licensed security guards.  Prohibition businesses 
only hire for protection those who demonstrate they are prepared to 
kill.  Legalizers share the nation's goal of ending the crime-drug 
cycle.

  Second, certainly teenage marijuana use is a problem.  But more 
teenagers start a lifetime of addiction to cigarettes every year 
than use marijuana one time, and the smoking prevalence is 
increasing.  More teenagers got drunk in the past two weeks than 
used marijuana once in the past year, and the alcohol consumption 
prevalence is up.  The Strategy presents strong evidence that 
teenage use of liquor is a more serious problem in violence and 
suicide than teenage marijuana use. Teen drunkenness is also a major 
factor in teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease, school 
failure, and crime.  Dr. Lloyd Johnston pointed out over a decade 
ago that teen tobacco use is one of the best predictors of teen hard 
drug use, but aside from a couple of paragraphs in the 150-page 
Strategy, alcohol and tobacco are ignored.

  Teen smoking and drunkenness are not political hot-buttons.  There 
is no multi- billion Federal, State and local tax-funded 
establishment to address those problems.  The sponsors of the 
Partnership for a Drug Free America earn millions of dollars 
annually from the promotion of tobacco and alcohol.  And the tobacco 
and alcohol industries are among the biggest of corporate 
contributors to political campaign committees of both political 
parties.  They fight every effort to increase the taxes on alcohol 
and tobacco and to limit the advertising of these drugs.  Public 
health and safety is not on their agenda.  Our political leadership 
is craven in failing to challenge these industries.  Most legalizers 
share the nation's goal of reducing teenage drug, alcohol and 
tobacco use.

  Typically, the Strategy is given to exaggeration.  Saying fewer 
teenagers think cocaine is dangerous, the Strategy implies that 
children are largely misled about the dangers of drugs.  In fact, 
89.3% of last year's high school seniors believed that they would be 
at great risk if they took cocaine regularly.  Or the Strategy says, 
&quot;Drug using adults from every social strata are clogging court 
dockets, crowding emergency rooms...&quot;  Clogged court dockets, a top 
national emergency...or some trial lawyers nightmare?  The serious 
problems are often nowhere near as widespread as implied by the 
Strategy.  In 1991, there were 93.5 million emergency room visits 
according to the 1993 Statistical Abstract, and less than 500,000 of 
them were drug-related, hardly crowding emergency rooms.  Emergency 
room episodes involving drugs have tripled since 1985 -- when the 
war on drugs was kicked into high gear under President Reagan.  This 
data is actually more evidence that our prohibition-based strategy 
is failing to protect the public.

  Outside the realm of exaggeration, hype and political posturing, 
in the real world of 1995, the three most pressing problems from 
drugs in America are the violence in the drug trade, the spread of 
AIDS, and the immense and growing power of the criminal underworld.  
This has been the case for at least a decade:

  *  Drug trade violence was identified as the cause of 40% of the 
homicides in New York City in the late-1980s.  More importantly, the 
drug trade is responsible for the proliferation of guns among 
American youth.  Since 1985 the white juvenile homicide rate grew by 
80%, and the black juvenile homicide rate more than doubled, growing 
120%.  According to Dr. Alfred Blumstein, this is directly linked to 
the prohibition-created crack cocaine trade.

  *  In 1993, AIDS became the biggest killer of Americans between 
the ages of 25 and 44.  In 1992, there were 24,000 new AIDS cases 
where the infection involved the injection of drugs.  By 1992, 
roughly 40% of all new AIDS cases involved injection of drugs.  On 
average, each AIDS case costs the taxpayers $100,000.  Unless 
checked, dirty needle - related AIDS will soon cost $24 billion per 
year.

  *  Large, international criminal organizations -- funded with drug 
profits -- are steadily growing more powerful.  They are subverting 
democratic governments on every continent around the world.  In the 
1990 election, the drug cartels assassinated four candidates for 
President in Colombia.  Last year, the leading candidate for 
President of Mexico was assassinated in a crime linked to political 
protection of the drug traffickers.  These criminal organizations 
have acquired enormous economic power rivaling that of the largest 
corporations on the Fortune 500.  Only one drug trafficking cartel, 
based in Medellin, Colombia, has been put of out business, but 
dozens of others around the world are growing, and increasingly 
collaborating.  The Strategy claims success because the number of 
casual users of cocaine has gone down.  However, the consumption of 
cocaine in the U.S. has actually remained stable since 1985. The 
profits from supplying that cocaine (as well as heroin and 
marijuana) is the greatest transfer of wealth to criminals in the 
history of the world.

  Americans have been given a Strategy that denies the reality of 
prohibition economics, that ignores the law of supply and demand, 
and that is blind to the relation between cause and effect.  What is 
needed is a more effective national drug strategy that is no longer 
bound by the counterproductive paradigm of prohibition.

  This paper outlines a strategy to fight violence and reduce AIDS 
that could be more effective.  It is based not on polls, but on what 
is humane and realistic.  It is based on what can be accomplished, 
not on political slogans such as attaining a drug-free America.


    1.  Remember that drug laws and drug policy should help people, 
                              not hurt them

  People who have drug problems should not be demonized, they need 
help.  People with drug problems are usually in some kind of 
physical or psychological pain.  Addicts should not be treated like 
lepers in the Old Testament who were stoned by their neighbors or 
banished.  People who don t have drug problems, and who aren't 
hurting anyone, should be left alone.

  Everyone who wants to quit using drugs should be able to get 
appropriate treatment.  Addicted single parents need residential 
treatment that won t break up families.  Pregnant addicts need 
treatment, not imprisonment -- but most treatment programs won t 
accept pregnant addicts.  HIV positive addicts should be the top 
priority for treatment, yet many programs won t take HIV positive 
people.  All drug addicted prisoners should get treatment, but no 
one should be prosecuted or imprisoned simply to get treatment.

  Relief of physical pain is one of the oldest medical traditions 
and a basic human value.  Our policy should be compassionate toward 
those who are in pain from disease or from its treatment.  Marijuana 
has well documented medical uses.  Even the Chief Administrative Law 
Judge at the Drug Enforcement Administration, Francis L. Young, 
after hearing evidence gathered from around the nation over a four-
month period, agreed that marijuana has medical uses.  Those 
Americans who can benefit from using marijuana medically should get 
it legally from their doctors.  This is a perfectly respectable 
position, and it was endorsed by the National Association of 
Attorneys General on June 25, 1983.

  Heroin relieves pain for some people who obtain no relief from 
other drugs -- those people should get heroin legally.  In the late 
1980s, without weakening the severe penalties for the unauthorized 
use of heroin, the conservative Canadian government joined the 
United Kingdom in legalizing heroin for medical use only.

  The medical uses of marijuana and heroin do not mean these drugs 
are good.  Nor does it mean these drugs are better than other drugs.  
Simply, these drugs are useful for some people.  The people who can 
benefit from these drugs should not be denied them.

  Some persons, justifiably concerned about the abuse of these drugs 
by drug addicts and by children, oppose even the very carefully 
controlled medical use of these drugs because medical use of 
marijuana or medical use of heroin supposedly sends the wrong 
message.  First, drug abusers aren't listening for this message.  
Cocaine, Valium , Dilaudid , and most controlled substances have 
uses in medicine, but many addicts who abuse those drugs don t care, 
even if they are actually aware of such uses.  Drug abusers don t 
rationalize their drug use as medical.

  Secondly, there isn't a single positive value we want our children 
to learn that is not being undermined by a host of wrong messages.  
For every virtue -- honesty, thrift, industry, studiousness, 
cleanliness, chastity, charity, responsibility, civic-mindedness, 
moderation, non-violence, or sobriety and abstinence from drugs -- 
movies, television, advertising and popular music are sending 
messages that directly conflict with positive values.  Every 
teenager everyday has to deal with, and we hope disregard, seductive 
messages that conflict with virtue.

  Exaggerating the dangers to children of the wrong message when it 
comes to subtleties of medical practice is unwarranted and 
irrational.  It is the job of drug abuse prevention programs to 
teach children the important differences between drugs prescribed by 
doctors and street drugs.  People who are dying or going blind 
should not be forced to endure more suffering because drug abuse 
prevention programs might sometimes be ineffective in helping 
children draw the necessary distinctions between the legitimate and 
the inappropriate uses of drugs.

  The Controlled Substances Act makes cocaine, THC, methadone and 
other synthetic opiates perfectly legal -- when their use is 
prescribed for by a physician in the proper circumstances.  Debating 
how systems of control can be improved does not undermine the drug 
abuse prevention effort.  To say that the American public should not 
openly debate other forms of drug legalization because children 
might get the wrong message, is like saying the public should not 
debate gun control, militia groups or the Second Amendment because 
children might get the wrong message.  It is fundamental to the 
health of democratic governments that public policies be debated.


   2.  Adopt a public health approach toward all drugs and drug users

  This requires a comprehensive approach toward all drugs, not 
simply  now illegal drugs.  What we should be concerned about is the 
drug abuse problem -- not just the illegal drug problem.  Illegal 
drug use does not exist in legal or &gt;social isolation.  Treatment 
professionals recognize cross-addiction and polydrug abuse.  
Prevention professionals recognize a gateway relationship between 
legal drugs and use of illegal drugs.  Tighten the regulations 
surrounding alcohol and tobacco -- for adults and for children -- 
and this will help reduce the use and abuse of other drugs as well.  
In order to delay the onset of teen alcohol and tobacco use, which 
delays the onset of other drug use, we must reduce the promotion and 
availability of tobacco and alcohol to children.

  To respond to our drug problem we must expand honest anti-drug 
education.  Honest comprehensive prevention programs work.  
Cigarettes kill more than 400,000 Americans in a year and are as 
addictive as heroin or cocaine, according to the U.S. Surgeon 
General.  Yet forty-four million addicted cigarette smokers have 
quit in the past thirty years.  This is the result of a tremendous, 
successful public health campaign.  This campaign succeeded without 
jailing or urine-testing cigarette smokers, without prosecuting 
tobacco sellers, without prohibition, and in spite of the annual 
expenditure of billions of dollars to promote tobacco-use.  Most 
policy makers reject the idea of prohibiting cigarettes because it 
would be a disaster of corruption and crime, and wholly inconsistent 
with American values.

  Cigarettes, alcohol, or marijuana can be gateways toward use of 
harder drugs.  Therefore prevention programs need to focus on all 
drugs.

  We must continue to evaluate drug abuse prevention programs.  
Mathea Falco in The Making of a Drug-Free America (1992) pointed out 
that most programs have not been evaluated.  Research Triangle 
Institute reviewed 18 studies in September 1994 and found D.A.R.E., 
America's most common drug abuse prevention program, was 
substantially less effective in reducing drug use among the children 
who took the program than certain other approaches.  If we are 
serious about prevention, we must be willing to abandon programs 
that don t work well, even if they are politically popular.

  Quality medical care and drug abuse treatment must be easily 
available for those who need it.  Heroin addicts, crack addicts, the 
mentally ill, the homeless, the uninsured, and everyone at risk of 
catching or spreading contagious disease are the highest treatment 
priority.  This will help halt the transmission of disease, and 
reduce the use of illegal drugs as pain killers for untreated 
disease.

  To stop the spread of blood borne disease among injecting drug 
addicts, clean needles should be exchanged for used ones.  This is 
the recommendation of the National Commission on HIV and AIDS, and 
top government scientists who have studied the issue.  Distribution 
of hypodermic syringes is a crime in eleven states which should be 
repealed.  Until 1965 (Griswold v. Connecticut), distribution of 
condoms to any person was a crime in some states.  Thirty-years ago 
sale of condoms in supermarkets and convenience stores was 
unthinkable.  Now, for the widely accepted public health purpose of 
fighting sexually transmitted disease, condoms are widely 
distributed to the sexually active as one component of a public 
health program.  When we think about drugs and disease in less 
judgmental terms, public health distribution of hypodermic syringes 
to drug injectors will no longer be shocking.

  Under appropriate controls and supervision, drugs must be made 
available to addicts to reduce harms.  Smoking tobacco is the most 
dangerous means for ingesting nicotine.  If Nicorette gum were 
cheaper and more freely available many more smokers and snuff 
dippers would be likely to quit.  Cigarettes, after all, are only 
crude, disposable nicotine ingestion devices -- of the most 
dangerous kind.  Nicotine is addicting but is not as dangerous as 
the tars, particulates and gases in cigarette smoke.  Heroin is 
addicting but is not as dangerous as HIV, hepatitis, and the 
adulterants added by criminals who distribute street drugs.

  Heroin addicts who can t or won t quit should not be banished to 
the underworld, nor put at risk of death from criminally 
contaminated drug supplies.  They ought to be able to get clean, 
affordable opiates under medical and pharmaceutical supervision if 
it will prevent them from spreading disease or committing crimes.  
Incidentally, Dr. Alfred Blumstein, former president of the American 
Society of Criminology, whose work on the crime-drug cycle is cited 
in the Strategy, endorses this approach to certifiable addicts.  
(Of course, the use of heroin by addicts must not violate the 
principle of user accountability discussed below.)

  In considering why some people use and abuse drugs, we must 
address the causes and contributing factors.  One major cause is 
family violence and sexual abuse.  Another co-factor with drug abuse 
is teenage pregnancy.  Public health and family-strengthening 
programs to address those problems are key parts of an anti-drug 
strategy.  To further prevent addiction and overdoses, patients and 
doctors need to know more about prescription drugs and their risks 
and interactions.


   3.  Insist Upon Drug and Alcohol User Accountability and 
                        Responsibility

  People who hurt or endanger others must be held responsible for 
their actions.  Drug or alcohol use is not an excuse for criminal or 
negligent conduct.

  Protection of public safety (e.g. safety on the streets, of 
travelers, medical patients, etc.):  In critical safety situations 
we should require performance tests to detect actual impairment by 
drugs (legal and illegal), alcohol, exhaustion, etc.  Following any 
kind of accident, it is perfectly appropriate to immediately test 
the blood of pilots, engineers, drivers, surgeons, etc. for evidence 
of use of alcohol and drugs -- legal and illegal.  This would be 
appropriate not only for airplane, rail, maritime or motor vehicle 
accidents, but also for medical accidents such as administering 
medications improperly or making mistakes in surgery.  Past use of 
intoxicants identified by urine or hair tests is irrelevant to 
public safety and drug user accountability.

  We must encourage increased professional responsibility and peer 
supervision of professions like medicine, airline piloting, etc. to 
police against on-the-job recklessness such as alcohol or drug use.  
Suspected misconduct that threatens public safety must be 
investigated and prosecuted where criminal recklessness has occurred.

  Criminal conduct:  Drug or alcohol use is not an excuse for 
criminal conduct such as robbery, theft, forgery, etc.  All drug 
addicted offenders and prisoners should get treatment.  But in the 
absence of actual harm or substantial risk of endangering others, 
Americans should not be prosecuted or imprisoned as a means to get 
treatment.

  Convicted predatory criminals such as robbers, rapists, 
assaulters, and burglars should be drug and alcohol-abstinent while 
on probation and parole.  This requires frequent and extensive 
surprise drug and alcohol testing, and a system of consistent 
sanctions for violations.

  Drug and alcohol user licenses:  Drug and alcohol use are 
privileges, and should be subject to licenses which can be revoked 
for misuse.  Some states adopted alcohol use licenses after national 
prohibition was repealed.  Persons who use drugs or alcohol might be 
required to get special liability insurance coverage.  It should not 
be presumed that persons over 21 are responsible alcohol or drug 
users.


  4.  Insist upon vendor accountability and responsibility

  Just like users, vendors of drugs and alcohol need to be held 
responsible for their actions.

  Violence, corruption, product adulteration, tax evasion, and 
antitrust violations by drug, alcohol and tobacco sellers are crimes 
and should be investigated and punished.  Adulteration and 
mislabeling of drugs and alcohol should also be subject to product 
liability civil law remedies.  Vendors must comply with reasonable 
regulations and inspections, pay taxes, and resolve marketplace 
conflicts through the law, not violence.  These provisions are much 
more easily investigated and enforced in a regulated environment 
than under prohibition.

  Convicted criminals can t be licensed to legally sell alcohol now 
-- they shouldn't be allowed to sell other drugs after the repeal of 
prohibition.

  The prohibition against sales to minors of tobacco, alcohol and 
other drugs must be enforced.

  Sales to those who have been denied or deprived of their privilege 
to use alcohol or drugs should be prohibited.  Like alcohol dram-
shop laws, over-the-counter sales of drugs to those who are already 
intoxicated should not be permitted.

  Promotion of alcohol, tobacco and drug use should be severely 
limited.  Advertising that either targets kids or is placed in media 
in which kids have legitimate interest in (e.g. professional and 
amateur athletics, popular music, motion pictures, etc.) should be 
disallowed.


  5.  Maximize the reach of law and respect for the law

  Drug and alcohol buyers should be discouraged from patronizing 
criminals.  For example, growing one's own marijuana is today a 
felony, and growers risk the forfeiture of their homes or land.  
Every marijuana user today (between 9 and 20 million persons) either 
becomes a felon or has to patronize criminals.  Shouldn't home 
cultivation for personal use be encouraged, even under prohibition?  
We should be reducing the commercial opportunities of criminals, not 
expanding them.  Even under prohibition, decriminalizing home 
marijuana cultivation would sharply reduce the tens of billions of 
dollars in annual profits now funding organized crime.

  Almost no police officers or revenue agents are killed or injured 
enforcing the liquor laws.  Marijuana, the most widely consumed 
illegal drug, should be taxed and sold to adults with warning 
messages -- but with prohibition of the promotion we suffer from 
with tobacco and alcohol.  Very few law enforcement officers will be 
killed or injured enforcing a managed, regulated drug trade.

  6.  Set appropriate priorities and achievable social goals

   Remember that there are no magic solutions to the problems of crime,
violence and drug abuse.  The principal immediate goal should be to
reduce the harms from drug and alcohol use and commerce to a minimum.
We must realistically acknowledge that we are not aiming for the
elimination of these problems, but a dramatic reduction in their
severity.

Reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS, hepatitis and other diseases.

  Make clean needle/used needle exchange programs available to all
populations of injecting drug users.  Use such programs to introduce
injecting drug users to health care, drug abuse treatment, and safer sex
practices.  Public health workers with clean needles need to go into
shooting galleries.  Glass crack pipes that break and cut the lips are
spreading HIV as well.  They need to be replaced in crack houses.
Condoms need to be distributed in crack houses and to prostitutes who
are working the streets and crack houses.  Treatment for STDs that cause
sores such as syphilis, herpes and gonorrhea needs to be made available
to further reduce the risk of HIV transmission.  Perhaps prostitutes
should be licensed and subject to daily and weekly examinations by
public health doctors.

Refocus Domestic Law Enforcement.

  All crimes of violence need to be investigated and prosecuted.
Prosecute crime by traffickers and users, with the highest priority
being violent crime (including domestic violence) and burglary.  Street
crime is generally the responsibility of state and local law enforcement
agencies.  Special squads need to be established and given plentiful
resources to investigate crimes of violence such as street robbery, car
jacking, and house invasion with the same intensity of focus that is now
given to homicide or rape.  We can afford such anti-violence measures
when we stop spending so disproportionately to support the prohibition
strategy.

  Crime Prevention:  Community-oriented policing is an effective way to
make streets safer and prevent crime by involving the community in the
policing effort.  An example is when a local patrol officer gives to
neighbors his or her beeper number to call when a crime is being
committed, not simply an anonymous 911 operator.  Police should
encourage community groups to expand neighborhood watch and citizen
patrol efforts.

  James Q. Wilson in Broken Windows pointed out how the rules of the
street can affect the crime rate.  For example, drunks can sit on a
stoop, but to prevent the climate of disorder that exists when drunks
sprawl on the sidewalk, the police enforce an informal rule that drunks
cannot lie down.  In a similar manner, state and local law enforcement
and prosecutors should concentrate on directing drug trafficking
indoors, off the street and out of residential neighborhoods, commercial
districts during business hours, playgrounds, parks and schools.
Drug-free school zones can be accomplished by sustained enforcement in
and around the schools and by heightened sentencing for sales that take
place at schools as a matter of prosecutorial policy. However, mandatory
minimum sentences are ineffective and unjust.  Enforcement operations
that lure traffickers to school-zones to create longer sentences have
been properly characterized by judges as
 sentencing entrapment  and are unjust and dishonest.

  Corrections:  Corrections policy needs to be reformed.  Repeat,
serious violent offenders need to be incarcerated.  Record keeping must
be accurate to assure that repeat offenders are identified and not
released by mistake.  Records and fingerprint files need to be fully
automated.  Prisons should not be used for simple drug possessors and
users, or for non-violent drug offenders.  Unfortunately, over 20% of
the Federal prison population is now non-violent, first-time drug
offenders.  These offenders should have their sentences commuted to
community supervision.

  Market-place violence:  When drug buyers don t pay the sellers
promptly and in full for the drugs they purchase, there is no legal
recourse.  When drug sellers sell drugs of less than represented purity,
there is no legal recourse.  When one drug seller leaves his employer to
go into business for himself, taking the boss s customers with him,
there is no legal recourse.  Today these examples of normal commercial
problems result in violence because of the prohibition strategy.  Drug
market-related violence will be ended only by legal regulation.

  Drug user violence:  Drug use cannot be an excuse for acts of violence
(see the user accountability principle above).  Those who commit acts of
violence forfeit the privilege of using drugs legally.  Those who commit
crimes under the influence of drugs or to buy drugs must be placed in
drug treatment in connection with the appropriate punishment.

  Some drug user violence is committed in the course of obtaining money
to buy drugs.  Drug addicts often have a great need for money because
they have developed a tolerance and because the drugs are expensive as a
result of prohibition.  (Indeed, before the wholesale failure of our
drug strategy in the 1980s DEA measured its success by the increased
price of illegal drugs.) Some of this crime will be eliminated when
addicts have a legal source of drugs.  (Of course many robbers who use
drugs are simply robbers and must be targeted and treated as robbers).

  Except for alcohol and PCP very little drug user violence is a result
of the mental effects from the ingestion of the drugs.

  A great many drug users are not committing robbery, burglary or other
crimes.  Some want drug treatment, but many drug users do not.  As we
have witnessed in public health campaigns addressing tobacco, alcohol,
and physical fitness, well-designed education and social controls are
very effective over time in changing the self-destructive behaviors of
many persons.

  Anti-crime efforts generally:  Leaving behind the prohibition-based
stereotypes of young men as dope dealers and bad guys will improve
police-community relations in a critical segment of the population.
Replacement of open-air drug markets with carefully- regulated clinics
and other access systems will help make streets safer and allow
residents to feel safe walking in their communities, leading to more
retail businesses that provide more jobs.  Capital will not go to drug
dealers, but will stay in the community.

Strengthen International Law Enforcement.

  The U.S. Justice and Treasury Departments should concentrate on the
highest-level and international traffickers, arms dealers and money
launderers whose violence and corruption is undermining governments and
the global financial system.  These are complex cases requiring the
reassignment of law enforcement agents and prosecutors away from minor
level offenders.  Right now, the majority of the productivity of U.S.
law enforcement is the imprisonment of street-level dealers, bodyguards,
mules and couriers (55.2%), and only a very small fraction are
high-level dealers (11.2%) or international scope traffickers (23.7%).

  The current prohibition strategy has boosted revenues of organized
crime all over the world, increasing their ability to buy weapons, bribe
government officials, take over news media outlets, and corrupt
legitimate business.  The criminals will profit from the opportunities
created by the prohibition-based Strategy much faster than the Strategy
will bring them to justice or confiscate their revenues.

Raise revenue from important economic sectors; reduce the financial
power of criminals and drug, alcohol and tobacco organizations.

  Another goal is to obtain revenue from the commerce in drugs and
alcohol to cover the social costs as much as possible.  Federal alcohol
taxation now raises some $11 billion per year.  Alcohol and tobacco
taxes should be substantially higher, but at rates that do not
substantially increase the problem of cigarette bootlegging.  Excise
taxes, occupational taxes, and user fees on marijuana alone could raise
$10-20 billion yearly for state and Federal governments.  Such taxes
should initially be set at low levels to draw buyers from the criminal
markets, which will help eliminate such markets, but enforcement will
certainly be required.  After the black market infrastructure has
decayed, taxes should be steadily raised to discourage use. 

Expand prevention programs and efforts targeted at youth.

  Experimentation with drugs, alcohol, tobacco and inhalants has
increased in recent years.  Families, communities and schools need to
identify and concentrate prevention efforts on the kids who are at high
risk for becoming seriously involved in drug use.  What is needed is not
simply an anti-drug program, but a comprehensive effort that: (1)
provides counseling around the problems from which drugs are often an
escape;  (2) provides stimulating curricula in schools;  (3) provides
peer group activities that are constructive and safe;  (4) provides
opportunities for athletics, recreation, and socializing across the wide
variety of interests that kids have;  (5) effectively intervenes in
cases of domestic violence;  (6) effectively promotes and supports teen
pregnancy prevention; and (7) promotes non-violent dispute resolution. 

Offer economic alternatives and build effective schools.

  The opportunities of drug trafficking offer enormously tempting routes
to reach the American dream of prosperity.  Ending prohibition will
close off much of the huge underground economy.  Training in the
legitimate tools of entrepreneurship must be offered to our children,
and economic opportunities need to be created to provide real
alternatives to crime for the young.  In addition to an education that
prepares our youth for the workplace of the 21st century, youth must
learn that for them opportunity truly exists. 

  Ending drug prohibition is the key to sharply reducing the violence
and crime that make business investment in inner cities such an
infrequent reality.  The elimination of prohibition-related crime will
draw manufacturing, research and development, retail, and housing into
communities with readily available labor that are already equipped with
the infrastructure of rental buildings, public utilities, and
transportation. 


  7.  Be honest and self-critical

  In September 1994, the Research Triangle Institute (a highly-respected
research institution hired by the National Institute of Justice to study
high school drug abuse prevention programs) reported that D.A.R.E.  --
the largest drug abuse prevention program in the country -- was
ineffective in reducing drug use among teenagers.  The Justice
Department chose not to publish the study, and D.A.R.E.  America
attempted to intimidate the American Journal of Public Health when its
editors decided to publish these important conclusions.  If policymakers
were really concerned that a large percentage of teenagers were truly
becoming much less fearful of cocaine use, they would to take action to
protect children from the inadequacies of drug prevention programs that
receive over $400 million in Federal funds annually. 


  8.  Respect other peoples, other nations and other cultures

  It is pathetic for America to blame other countries for our drug
problems.  Government corruption is a global epidemic that is spread by
drug prohibition, and tragically such corruption exists in many places
in the United States.  America s failed domestic drug policies aggravate
the corruption problems in many other societies. 

  Careful economic research has shown that there is no crop eradication
strategy and no military operation overseas that can substantially
reduce the availability of drugs in the U.S.  The notion that it is more
efficient or more economical to stop drugs at the source has been
conclusively shown to be false.  To deploy military or paramilitary
forces against peasants who grow coca or opium not only wastes money, it
politically strengthens anti- Western, anti-government political
insurgencies.  To incarcerate mules who are at the bottom of the
distribution organizations is a waste of very expensive prison space. 

  Indians in Peru and Bolivia chew coca leaf, and professionals drink
coca tea -- these are harmless practices.  Those practices are the
business of those societies, not ours.  It is silly that coca users in
Peru and Bolivia are international outlaws in violation of the Single
Convention on Narcotics.  Under regulation and genuine control, coca
growing will be less profitable than it is now. 

  U.S. anti-narcotics policy now includes a variety of economic
development schemes for the Andes.  Andean economic development must be
sustainable; it will never succeed dependent on gimmicks, subsidies, or
price supports.  As long as prohibition remains in place, legitimate
economic development can never be an effective anti- narcotics strategy
because the legitimate economy can never be more profitable than
prohibition-induced drug trafficking or cultivation. 

  In our own country, peyote (which contains the entheogenic alkaloid
mescaline) is the sacrament of the Native American Church.  The use of
peyote by members of the church has been protected under Federal law
(but not state law) since 1965.  There is no evidence of a peyote abuse
problem, but Indians and non-Indians are prosecuted for their possession
of peyote.  With the passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom
Act Amendments of 1994, Native Americans will no longer be subject to
criminal prosecution and religious persecution by various states for
possession or use of peyote for bona fide traditional ceremonial
purposes in connection with the practice of a traditional Indian
religion.  Spiritual peyote use is no more drug use than sacramental
wine consumed at Communion is drug use, and thus religious peyote use
must be protected.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms
that all people are free to be religious seekers.  Peyote use by
non-Indians is not a social or public health problem.  All Americans
should be free to use peyote in a religious manner, without regard to
their race or parentage. 


  9.  Recognize that drugs are a major commodity in international trade

  Drugs have been a part of international trade since coffee, tea and
spices were introduced to Europe centuries ago.  This trade has never
been stopped by banning it, and it can t be.  Take control of this
enormous trade away from criminals and corrupt customs officials by
regulating it and taxing it. 

  What the world community needs from the U.S. is a substantially
intensified fight against the enormous power of prohibition-based drug
trafficking cartels.  The legitimate elements in Colombia and Mexico,
for example, are continually being subverted by prohibition-financed
corruption.  The U.S. should deploy its largely incorrupt Justice and
Treasury Departments against the highest level drug traffickers, and
after prohibition is ended, continue the fight against other criminal
subversion of legitimate governments and the global economy. 

  Simultaneously, the U.S. should renounce increasing cigarette exports
as a principal objective of U.S. trade policy.  It is not criminal,
simply despicable, to push an addictive and dangerous drug on others. 
Americans, pushing tobacco in Asia, are as contemptible as the British
when they forced China to accept Indian opium in the 19th century. 


  10.  Be creative and flexible to meet our goals

  Through regulation, encourage means of drug administration that are
less harmful and easier to control -- physically, socially, culturally,
and legally.  Be restrictive of more harmful means, or means that are
harder to control.  For example, try to limit smoking of drugs --
nicotine, cocaine, heroin, marijuana -- which gives intense rushes but
which is much more harmful and harder to control than other forms of
ingestion.  Smoking can be discouraged.  Oral ingestion is less intense,
less habit-forming, and less harmful, and perhaps can be encouraged as
an alternative when appropriate. 


  11.  Turn down the volume on drug messages  

  Drugs should neither be promoted, nor hysterically attacked.  Prevent
drug advertising from being aimed at youth, for example, via Spuds
MacKenzie (the dog promoting Budweiser) or Camel cigarette s Joe
Camel/Smooth Character, or in youth- oriented media. 

  Keep anti-drug messages in front of children but keep them reasonable
and truthful.  The This is your brain, This is your brain on drugs, Any
questions?  TV spot featuring a skillet and frying eggs is an example of
a ludicrous anti-drug message.  Its dishonesty and exaggeration invited
contempt.  Some young people asked friends to get stoned by saying,
 Want to fry an egg?  To bombard children with the message that the most
important thing in world is that you shouldn t do drugs inevitably is an
enticement. 

  TV PSAs that show realistic scenarios affirming kids who decline drugs
offered by friends are important.  Anti-drug messages should be
interspersed with appropriate messages regarding safer-sex and pregnancy
prevention practices, staying in school, non- violence, etc.  TV PSAs
should be part of community-wide, integrated anti-drug programs such as
Project STAR, developed with NIDA assistance. 


                               Conclusion

  Whatever we do about drugs, sadly there will continue to be drug use
and drug abuse.  By thinking about drug use as a moral crusade, and
maintaining prohibition and
 zero tolerance, we exempt the drug trade from any regulation and
control.  Prohibition maximizes the violence and disease associated with
drugs.  Prohibition keeps drugs inordinately profitable and continuously
tempts people -- all over the world -- to sell them for easy money. 
This proposed anti-prohibition strategy is not for legalizing drugs for
 legalization s sake -- ending prohibition is simply the recognition
that legal markets are more easily controlled, regulated, and
effectively policed, more humane toward those who are ensnared in the
miseries of drugs, and ultimately cost-effective. 

  Those who propose that the fight against drug abuse can only take
place if there is an enforced consensus and no debate or discussion of
the issues are ignorant of history.  The existence of facts is not
determined by a vote.  Those who believe that only prohibition can
reduce drug use ignore the 44 million Americans who have quit smoking
cigarettes. 

  Those who favor prohibition who refuse to talk with those who
criticize prohibition demonstrate to the world that they lack confidence
in their position.  If those who promote the current strategy were
confident that it was effective, they would welcome debate, not fear the
criticism implicit in the advocacy of legalization. 

  James Burke, the Chairman of the Partnership for a Drug Free America,
is concerned that allowing discussion of legalization demotivates the
anti-drug warriors.  That is probably true, but that is not the fault of
the legalizers, it is the fault of the drug war strategy, for the
Strategy is failing and the few successes are insignificant.  If those
in the trenches fighting the drug war believed they were successful,
they would not be
 demotivated by anything said by the relative handful of legalizers.  If
they are demoralized probably it is because, in their hearts, they know
they are not succeeding.  If the chairmen of Ford, Chrysler or General
Motors said that Toyota and BMW should not be allowed to advertise, or
Saabs and Hondas should not be reviewed in Car and Driver because it
demotivated their workers, it would appear they were afraid of the
marketplace and we would consider them unfit to lead their corporations. 

  The American people give the Federal government failing grades in the
fight against drugs and they know that our current strategy is not
working.  But they are tired of being afraid of being robbed or burgled
or shot at, and seeing kids on drugs, and they want changes and positive
results. 

  When Americans are asked if they favor legalization, they dissent
strongly.  What models of legalization have they had the opportunity to
consider? They don t want crack sold in the Safeway or heroin sold like
popcorn.  For good reason they don t want drugs (and alcohol and
tobacco) sold to their kids. 

  But is the only drug policy choice one between the current, failed
approach of prohibition or the pure, unregulated free-market that
actually exists almost nowhere in the American economy?  Is the world of
drug policy somehow uniquely only black or white? The reality is that
there is a middle ground of regulation and control, consistent with
traditional American values and capitalism, that offers us hope of
helping more people, reducing crime and violence, preventing disease,
and protecting individual privacy. 

  The Atlanta Resolution says that legalization is a simplistic
solution, and thus should be rejected.  In reality, legalization is much
less simplistic than prohibition, zero tolerance or just say no.  To
reject all proposals, even the sophisticated ones, without reading them
and critiquing them, is evidence of fear, not confidence in the
correctness of the Strategy of prohibition. 

  To remotivate America to fight drugs requires an effective,
sophisticated, non- prohibition strategy that is free of the hypocrisy,
exaggeration, viciousness, divisiveness and partisanship that has
characterized the war on drugs. 

  What America could use is a good dose of fair and honest discussion
about drug policy.  If we won t talk calmly with each other about one of
our nation s most serious problems, then truly, our democracy is likely
to fail and fade away.

     Eric E. Sterling is the President of The Criminal Justice Policy
  Foundation.  His analysis of criminal justice issues is regularly
  sought by top Federal officials and the national news media.  He
  frequently lectures at colleges and universities, and to professional
  societies. 
  
     Mr. Sterling served as Counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives
  Committee on the Judiciary from 1979 until 1989.  On the staff of the
  Subcommittee on Crime, (Rep. William J. Hughes (D-NJ), Chairman), he
  was responsible for many issues including drug enforcement, gun 
  control, money laundering, organized crime, pornography, terrorism,
  corrections, and military assistance to law enforcement. He was a
  principal aide in developing the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of
  1984, the Anti-Drug Abuse Acts of 1986 and 1988. 
  
     Since 1981 he has worked closely with the nation s police to blunt
  attacks on the 1968 Gun Control Act, and to more effectively control
  armor piercing ammunition, plastic firearms, machine guns, assault 
  weapons, and explosives. 
  
     Mr. Sterling was an adjunct lecturer at The American University,
  School of Justice.  He is admitted to the Supreme Court of the United 
  States and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.  He is a member of the
  American Bar Association, the American Society of Criminology, and the
  American Public Health Association.  Mr. Sterling has been honored by
  the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the U.S. Postal
  Inspection Service for his assistance to their law enforcement 
  missions. 
  
  
              THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY FOUNDATION
                                  
     A criminal justice system that is honest, fair and effective is
  one of America s most important institutions.  The character of our
  national life depends upon our safety and our liberty which depend 
  upon the integrity and effectiveness of our justice system.  It was
  an awareness of the grave threats to the American criminal justice
  system that inspired Boston-businessman and philanthropist Robert C.
  Linnell to establish The Criminal Justice Policy Foundation in 1988.
  The foundation is a non-profit educational tax-exempt charity under
  section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
  
     The Criminal Justice Policy Foundation promotes innovative
  solutions to problems facing the criminal justice system. The 
  foundation assists policy makers, criminal justice professionals,
  and the public to prevent crime and improve the quality of justice
  by disseminating information through education programs,
  publications, and the news media.  The foundation also provides
  advice regarding legal organization, outreach, research, media
  relations, legislation, and coalition building.  The foundation
  provides speakers to all types of organizations. 
  
     The foundation is collaborating with other foundations, the
  National Council on Crime and Delinquency, and the Office of Juvenile
  Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department on Justice, in
  sponsoring a National Forum on Youth Violence, May 31 - June 2, 1995. 
  
     The foundation supports the educational work of the National Drug
  Strategy Network (NDSN).  The Network distributes a comprehensive
  monthly newsletter, NewsBriefs and meets periodically in Washington,
  D.C.

<CENTER>DRUG LEGALIZATION</CENTER>
* Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday the New York Times ran a piece noting that the lead story in the next issue of the National Review is going to call for the legalization of drugs. The rationale for this argument is that the war on drugs has failed and that the only solution is to declare defeat and turn the asylum over to the inmates.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>I am not sure just what information the folks at the National Review are using, but the facts are flawed and the argument is dumb and irresponsible.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>Mr. Buckley, the author of the piece, is safe in making such arguments because he personally does not plan to use drugs. No one of his immediate acquintance is likely to start using dangerous drugs. So the consequences of his advocacy will not be felt personally. Instead, the burden of his ideas will be borne by countless families whose kids -- the most at-risk population -- will fall victim to the consequences of drug abuse. The costs will also be borne by the public purse, as we have to treat the walking wounded.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>Although there is no public support for the idea of legalization, and none in the Congress, some of our culture elite -- left and right -- keep raising the idea as if it had some intellectual merit. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I am therefore submitting for the R<SMALL>ECORD</SMALL> a longer statement on the common mistakes made in the legalization argument that I hope will help in closing this latest chapter in foolishness.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>The statement follows:</B></FONT>
<FONT SIZE="1"><B>
<CENTER>STATEMENT BY CHARLES E. GRASSLEY: DRUG LEGALIZATION</CENTER>
<SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>I have been increasingly concerned about the tendency in some quarters to
promote the legalization of drugs in this country. If there is any idea that
is essentially without merit and without public support, it is that this
country should entertain seriously the notion that dangerous drugs should be
legalized and made widely available. Drug legalization is truly an
invitation to the Mad Hatter's Tea Party.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Unfortunately, many in the media and in our cultural elite, who have a
disproportionate access to public communication and opinion outlets, have
once again started to advocate some form of legalization. While this
advocacy is not likely to lead to a major change in public policy, it can
and does have an adverse influence on thinking about the dangers of drug. It
sends a mixed message about the dangers of use that is particularly harmful
when it touches our young people.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
As Bill Bennett and Joe Califano noted recently, drugs are illegal because
they are dangerous, they are not dangerous because they are illegal.
Legalization advocates, however, deploy a variety of arguments on behalf of
their position that ignore this essential fact. They all too often resort to
scare tactics, misrepresent reality, or skip over inconvenient facts. I
think that it is important to set the record straight.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
There are a number of misconceptions about our efforts to deal with the drug
problem. It is important to understand these and the common arguments used
to promote them in order to arrive at a reasoned and reasonable
understanding of what the drug problem is about. One of the first points to
note is that our last drug epidemic--during the 1960s, 1970s, and early
1980s--was the result of arguments made by some that drugs were really not a
problem and that everyone would feel better, live better, and prosper from
the self-administration of dangerous drugs.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
The claim, made with considerable fervor, was that drugs were liberating and
that only a repressive society would prevent people from achieving their
true potential. By the late 1980s, we finally came to realize just what a
cruel hoax, a big lie, these claims were. We are still trying to cope with
an addict population from that ear, a period that has left us with a legacy
of lives blasted by drug use, a cost that is borne by families and the
public purse. We cannot afford to ignore this lesson, to repeat a disaster
based on the enthusiasms of a few.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10><I>Mistake #1: Prohibition doesn't, can't work. Efforts to keep people from using drugs, like alcohol prohibition, only encourages the idea of forbidden fruit, increases crime, and will always fail.</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
The argument that prohibition doesn't work relies on a collective amnesia
about this country's experience with alcohol prohibition between 1920 and
1934. In the first place, Prohibition did not make the use of alcohol
illegal, only its manufacture and sale over a certain strength. It was, in
effect, a control regime legalizing personal use. This effort came at the
end of a very long history
in this country of trying to reduce the consumption of alcohol from
dangerous heights. The modern parallel is with the efforts to reduce tobacco
use.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Second, Prohibition did not lead to a major increase in violent crime, as is
often claimed. The major increase, particularly in violent crime in this
country, came between 1900 and 1910, well before the prohibition movement.
Violent crime remained fairly stable or declined during Prohibition. While
it is true that crime rates decreased after Prohibition this was not the
result of ending Prohibition. Nor did Prohibition create organized crime.
Major organized crime groups existed well before alcohol prohibition and
they prospered after it ended.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Third, major health problems, such as cirrhosis of the liver and
alcohol-related psychoses, declined sharply during Prohibition. Alcohol
consumption, even though it was not illegal, also declined sharply. It
increased in the years following the repeal of Prohibition, as did the
associated health problems.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Fourth, it is important to remember also that alcohol, unlike dangerous
drugs, had wide social acceptance and a long history of use. Alcohol can
also be used by most people without creating impairment, either temporary or
long term. Marijuana, cocaine, and heroin have no such long history of
popular public use or acceptance, and their use is solely for the purpose of
intoxication. In fact, the public has opposed these substances once they
learned how dangerous and destructive they were. This is also true
historically in this country and internationally. No society today has a
legalization regime for dangerous drugs.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
In addition, it is clear that control efforts, when reinforced by serious
law enforcement, prevention, and education programs do deter use, especially
among young people. Our own recent experience illustrates how effective we
can be. After decades of increasing use in this country, we reversed the
trend of drug use when, beginning in the mid-1980s, we decided to just say
no and to get serious about doing something. Overall drug use, apart from
addicts, declined by more than 50 percent; cocaine use by 70 percent.
Unfortunately, more recently, as we have moved away from these serious
programs we have seen a return to use in the most at-risk
population--teenagers.<BR>
<BR><CENTER>[Page: S328]</CENTER>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #2: Legalization will mean less crime because the profit motive is removed and we will lock fewer people up when we make our drug laws more
humane</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
First, most prisoners in state and Federal prisons are not there for drug
offenses as their first or major offense. Most offenders are in jail for
violent or repeat offenses. Of these, despite the wildy exaggerated numbers
often cited, only 10 percent of Federal prisoners and 17 percent of state
inmates committed their crimes to obtain drugs. Indeed, research shows that
most career criminals came to drug use after starting their criminal
activities, not before. Legalization will not greatly reduce the crime rate,
especially for violent crimes. Indeed, in so far as the pharmacological
effects of drugs, particularly cocaine and other stimulants, exacerbate
violent tendencies, legalization will produce far greater violent crime
rates as the number of 'legal' addicts soars.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Second, the vast majority of prisoners serving time from drug offenses are
not there for use but for
trafficking--individuals whose actions destroy lives and menace
neighborhoods.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Third, legalization will not end black markets for drugs, unless we are
prepared to legalize drug use for all ages down to the age of 6 or 7. Only
the most radical legalization advocates want to see kids using drugs. But to
leave any population out of a legalization regime means leaving a black
market. Crime will not simply disappear nor will the organizations that are
currently trafficking in illegal drugs.
</B></FONT></MULTICOL></DIV>
<DIV><MULTICOL COLS=3 WIDTH=100%><FONT SIZE="1"><B>
<SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #3: Legalization will mean a healthier climate in which controlled
drug use will provide quality control and monitored use</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
This argument misses or misrepresents the issue. The issue is not whether we
make drugs, which are inherently dangerous to use, more pure, but whether we
permit their use at all. Britain led the way in trying to treat dangerous
drug use as a therapeutic problem, regulating addicts through doctors' care.
This was not an open drug policy for anyone to use drugs but a policy just
for addicts. The result was a disaster. It did not prevent the spread of
drug abuse. It only made doctors complicit in the act of promoting an
addiction for which they had no cure. In effect, it reversed the normal
doctor-patient relationship, putting doctors in the position of making their
patients worse off. As a result, in Britain, addiction soared, addicts got
worse not better, and the black market flourished. Similar experiences have
visited similar efforts in other countries. Now, it seems that Switzerland
is experimenting with a variation of this approach. The results are likely
to be a similar disaster, making the government and the medical community
complicit in spreading addiction.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
It is also important to keep in mind, that dangerous drugs are not
synonymous with other controlled pharmaceuticals. The latter are controlled
but they also have a therapeutic purpose. Dangerous drugs have no medical
purpose. They are addictive and destructive. To argue that these drugs
should be self-administered with the only control being over their quality
is to argue for a massive increase in the addict population, adding an even
greater burden to an over-taxed health-care system. In effect, the
legalization argument requires society to endorse a self-destructive
behavior and then requires society to provide perpetual care to the victims
at public expense.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #4: Deterrence does not work</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
When you talk to former addicts or those who have given up use, one of the
most important reasons they give for their decision to quit or seek
treatment was the threat of criminal prosecution, the difficulty of
acquiring drugs, and the cost. When drugs are perceived as expensive,
dangerous and wrongful to use, difficult to get, and involve a risk of
criminal prosecution, potential users forego use, and many current users
quit. This remains true even though most enforcement efforts focus not on
users but on violent offenders and drug traffickers.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
No program to prohibit drug use can be universally effective. Although we
have long-standing laws against child abuse or murder or theft, these have
not prevented any of these acts completely. No one doubts their importance,
however, or the role they play in discouraging yet more of these actions
than if they were not prohibited.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #5: Legalizing drugs will remove the `Forbidden Fruit' appeal of
drugs, which leads most new users, especially the young, into use</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
If this is a valid argument, then anything that society prohibits for the
general good would succumb to the same argument. Forbidding child abuse
encourages child abuse. Prohibiting murder encourages it. This is the logic
of the argument. In fact, the reverse in the case. We educate people's
understanding of what is rightful or wrongful to do by the laws that we
declare and enforce. Even during Prohibition, when use was legal, the simple
message sent by society that use was bad caused significant drops in use.
Whenever we have enforced our drug laws and backed these up with education
and prevention programs endorsed by our civic and cultural leaders, we have
seen use decline and young people forego use. When we ignore this simple
reality we see kids returning to drug use.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Unless one contemplates making cocaine and heroin routinely available to
12-18 year olds, something even few legalizers argue, then legalization will
not remove the so-called `Forbidden Fruit' appeal. It will only add the idea
that society condones use while continuing to prohibit access to the most
at-risk population. Just the absence of a clear message on drug use in the
last few years has seen teens returning to use in disturbing numbers. A
legalization message would have devastating results.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #6: Drug use is a purely personal choice. It is a victimless crime. The state has no right to keep people from using drugs</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
The idea that an individual who uses drugs does so in some vacuum that
affects no one else is another one of those fictions that obscures the
facts. In the first place, drug users don't stay home. They go to work and
play with the rest of us. They use the highways, they drive the school buses
and trains, they fly the planes. They also encourage others to use, thus
spreading the problem.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
People under the influence of dangerous drugs are more prone to workplace
accidents, are more likely to have highway accidents, are more prone to use
violence in public and family disputes, and are at greater risk for health
care than are non-users. Addicts are far more likely to lose control over
their own lives, and are more in need of public intervention. A considerable
percentage, perhaps as many as 60 percent, of the homeless are drug and
alcohol addicts.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Some 2 percent of live births in this country--over 100,000 babies--are born
addicted with life-long disabilities because their mothers used.
Conservative estimates of the yearly social costs of drug addiction at
current levels run around $70 billion. These costs are borne by families and
the public purse. The number of users and consequently the number of addicts
would soar under a legalization regime, compounding all the problems we
currently have. There is no such thing as a purely private use of drugs
without consequences. There is no known cure for addiction. A choice for
legalization would be a self-inflicted disaster.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #7: Since alcohol and tobacco are legal, and cause far more harm
than dangerous drugs, we should make heroin, cocaine, etc., legal to be
consistent. Doing so would not increase the number of users significantly</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Here is the legalization argument at its most outrageous. What people are
asked to accept is the idea that because we have substances generally
available that already cause major harm--tobacco and alcohol--we should add
dangerous drugs to the occasions for woe for the sake of consistency. What
the argument says is that since we have one major problem we should make it
worse by adding another. Who are we kidding?
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
In order to rescue this logic from being completely ludicrous, people are
asked to believe a further assertion: that under a legal regime there won't
be an increase in users. Really? Let's look at what we are being asked to
believe. We are going to make drugs cheaper and freely available. We are
going to see them aggressively marketed by the producers. We are going to
have society condone the use of addictive substances. But, we are not going
to see a significant increase in use. Such is our understanding of human
nature?
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
We saw what happened with drug use in this country in the 1960s and 1970s
when we allowed the de facto legalization of drugs, condoning personal use
and not enforcing our laws. That partial legal environment caused a dramatic
increase in use. Can anyone doubt the effects if we condoned use outright?
We cannot afford this kind of logic.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
These are by no means the only myths. Others hold that drug laws are
racist--which is another big lie, but even if true it is hardly an argument
for making drugs legal; that the health consequences of personal use are
exaggerated; or that drug laws lead to locking up lot of innocent people. 
None of these arguments can sustain serious attention or thought. Nor is
there any major public support for drug legalization. The argument is
pressed by only a few, some liberal, some conservative. To make the argument
requires, however, suspension of judgment, a willingness to accept
assertions over facts, and a professional absence of mind that ignores
experience.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Unfortunately, while the argument for legalization has little public
support, it is a major agenda item of many of our cultural elites. They have
a disproportionate influence on our public discourse, on our radios and
television, in the movies, in music and the arts. This means they have a
disproportionate influence on the most at-risk population for drug
users--our young people. By helping to obscure the message of the dangers of
drug use, by encouraging it as part of a `liberated' life style, they
contribute directly to use. When our political leaders remain silent they
aid and abet this. The result in the 1960s made the point. Our recent
experience confirms it: When you replace `Just Say No' with `Just Say
Nothing' or `I didn't inhale,' you are opening the door to trouble.

<HEAD><TITLE>Medical Necessity - Historical Background</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000" LINK="#0000FF" VLINK="#FF0000" ALINK="#FF00FF">
<H2>April 1996
<P>
Dear candidate:</H2>
<P>
<CENTER><H1>Historical Background<BR>
Medical Necessity</H1></CENTER>

<H2>	Over the past 20 years, thirty-seven states have passed legislation
recognizing marijuana's therapeutic value.  Iowa enacted a law allowing
doctors to prescribe marijuana in 1979.  See Iowa Code  <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/204.html">124.204</A>(4)(m),
<A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/204.html">124.204</A>(7) and <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/206.html">124.206</A>(7)(a).  To understand the history of this legislation
and the need to amend current state law, a brief review of some national
court decisions is enlightening.
<P>	In 1976, a glaucoma patient by the name of Bob Randall was brought to trial
for growing marijuana plants on the balcony of his apartment in Washington,
D.C.  The court dismissed the charges, ruling that Randall's use of
marijuana was a "medical necessity."  Federal agencies began providing him
with marijuana, and Randall became the first American to receive marijuana
for the treatment of a medical disorder.
<P>	In 1981, a multiple sclerosis patient by the name of Sam Diana was
convicted for possessing marijuana in the state of Washington.  The
Washington Court of Appeals overturned the verdict and returned the case to
the lower court for retrial.  The Appeals Court ruled that "medical
necessity" was a valid defense.  On retrial, the Washington court concluded
that Diana was "not guilty by reason of medical necessity."
<P>	In 1989, a glaucoma patient by the name of Elvy Musikka was brought to
trial for cultivation of marijuana plants.  The court found Musikka not
guilty, ruling that her use of marijuana was a "medical necessity."
<P>	In 1991, a hemophilic patient by the name of Kenneth Jenks was brought to
trial for growing marijuana plants.  Kenneth received AIDS at a hospital
through a blood transfusion and transmitted the disease to his wife before
he knew that he had the disease.  Both Kenneth and Barbara were found guilty
at trial, but the Florida Court of Appeals reversed their convictions,
ruling that their use of marijuana was a "medical necessity."  The Florida
Supreme Court affirmed the reversal of their criminal convictions.
<P>	The federal government is the only legal supplier of medical marijuana in
the United States, and currently supplies marijuana to only 8 medical
patients, two of whom, George McMahon and Barbara Douglass, are Iowans.  In
1991, the federal government decided to stop accepting any new applications,
effectively nullifying all state laws allowing medical use of marijuana.
Without a federal license, no one can use medical marijuana by prescription
in the United States.
<P>	In 1994, Judge Irwin, an Iowa district court judge for Pottawattamie
County,  ruled that "medical necessity" is a recognized defense to
prosecution for possession of marijuana in the state of Iowa.  A copy of
that order is enclosed with this letter.
<P>	Iowa law says that possession of marijuana is legal when used for medicinal
purposes pursuant to rules of the board of pharmacy examiners.  We have
contacted the board of pharmacy examiners and discovered that the only rules
are those contained in the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration
and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
<P>	In 1991, an Iowan with multiple sclerosis by the name of Ladd Huffman was
approval by both the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement
Administration to receive medical marijuana.  However, his prescription was
never filled, because the federal government decided to stop accepting new
applications.  Ladd's application was one of 28 which was approved but was
never honored.
<P>	It is our position that seriously ill people who use marijuana for medicine
should not be arrested and required to prove their medical necessity in a
criminal trial.  Seriously ill patients using marijuana as medicine should
be able to have a hearing with the board of pharmacy examiners, or other
qualified board.  If they have a legitimate medical necessity, they should
be certified and exempted from criminal prosecution by the state of Iowa.
The Iowa Legislature should amend current state law by immunizing certified
medical marijuana users from prosecution by the state.</H2>

<BR>Dear Sirs,
<DD>As a person running for an office that is responsible for creating legislation that sets the standards and laws for the State of Iowa, I would not feel comfortable trying to second guess any legal decisions handed down by a Supreme Court, be it State or Federal.
<DD>As for my either supporting the enacting of medical necessity legislation pertaining to the medicinal use of marijuana to protect from criminal prosecution, I would have to see the proposed House File before taking a stand one way or another on the matter.
<DD>I, too, like two of the people you cite in your historical background, have Multiple Sclerosis.&nbsp;  To date, I've no need of THC to stem any medical problems that are related to the M.S.&nbsp;  With the advent of genetic engineering, new drugs to fight M.S. are being brought out 
for testing and approval by the FDA on, seemingly, a regular basis.
<DD>I do feel that THC in it's natural form is not needed as a therapeutic substance at this time.&nbsp;  Unless I am proven wrong about my thoughts on this and concerns for the potential for abuse of the substance, I would tend to be disinclined to support any legislation in this regard.
<DD>Thank you.

<BR>Dear Mr. McMahon & Mr. Olsen
<DD>Cancer has not been very kind to my family.&nbsp;  In 1978, my brother died from Hodgkins Disease.&nbsp;  1988 my sister was treated and cured of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, and in 1992, my nephew was cured of advanced Hodgkins.&nbsp;  I need to look into the issue of marijuana for medical use because I have seen personally how it could possibly have made chemotherapy
more tolerable to my family.

<BR>Dear Carl:
<DD>Thank you for sending me the letter regarding the medical marijuana bill (Senate File 361), as well as a copy the resolution adopted in California last month.
<DD>Whether the current problem is at the federal level (and it appears to be federal), I do have a few concerns about any statutes or resolutions dealing with the medical or therapeutic uses of marijuana.&nbsp;  The chief one is that there continue to be adequate safeguards to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to the drug.
<DD>However, in the event that Rep. Miller introduces the resolution, I will discuss the matter with the appropriate committee chair and House leadership.
<DD>Sincerely,

<BR>Dear Mr. Olsen:
<DD>I appreciated receiving the documents you sent supporting your efforts to legalize marijuana for medical purposes in Iowa.&nbsp;  You present some good arguments and I will take the time to read your information.&nbsp;  I do, however, have continued concerns about the short and long term side effects of marijuana use even in face of apparent short term help for certain patients.

Re:&nbsp; State of Iowa v. Helmers, Allen Douglass PIN #483567994
Case No. FECR047575 <br>
<br>
To Whom It May Concern <br>
<br>
I am writing to plead for mercy in the case of <a
href="helmers1.html">Allen Helmers</a> listed above. <br>
<br>
How can any of you morally justify your actions when considering
the facts in this case?&nbsp; To send a disabled man to prison
for smoking marijuana for pain (his <a href="verduyn.html">doctor</a>
advises him that it is the best and safest way for him to manage
his pain), and at the same time allowing an uninsured drunk
motorist to go free (7 days in jail and 18 months probation)! <br>
<br>
Seriously ill people who use marijuana as medicine should not be
arrested and required to prove their medical necessity in a
criminal trial. Seriously ill patients should have their claims
heard by the Iowa Board of Pharmacy Examiners or some other
qualified board.&nbsp; If a seriously ill patient has a legitimate
medical necessity, that patient should be certified and be
exempted from criminal prosecution by the state of Iowa. <br>
<br>
Iowa recognizes the defense of &quot;medical necessity&quot; to
prosecution for the possession of marijuana in the state of
Iowa.&nbsp; <a href="../iowa/pleas.html">State of Iowa v. Jan
Pleas</a>, No. 22690, Pottawattamie District Court (June 16,
1994).&nbsp; Iowa law recognizes the therapeutic value of
marijuana.&nbsp; Iowa Code 124.206(7)(a). <br>
<br>
Please refer to the enclosed documents. <br>
<br>
Thank you. <br>

<CENTER>_________________________________________________________________</CENTER>
    On the 23rd day of May 1994, the State's Motion to Strike

Affirmative Defense came before the Court.  The Court, having

reviewed the pleadings, heard the oral arguents of the parties,

and examined the case law provided, makes the following

findings:

    Defendant claims, in her Notice of Affirmative Defense of

Medical Necessity, that the marijuana found in her residence

during a police search was medically necessary to stabilize the

interocular pressure in her left eye, which has glaucoma.

Defendant further claims that there was a specific threat of

immediate harm, that Defendant did not bring about the

circumstances necessitating the illegal act, that no alternative

drug was effective in minimizing the effects of glaucoma, and

that the harm avoided was greater than the harm caused.

Plaintiff argues that the affirmative defense of medical

necessity is not a recognized criminal defense in the State of

Iowa, and so should be stricken.

    The Court finds that the necessity defense, by which the

defendant much choose the lesser of two evils, is a recognized

defense in the state of Iowa.  In <U>State v. Walton</U>, the Iowa

Supreme Court stated that the necessity defense is available

only in emergency situations where the threatened harm is

immediate and the threatened disaster imminent.  311 N.W.2d 113,

115 (Iowa 1981).  Additionally, no alternative option must exist

by which the defendant could avoid both evils.  <U>Id</U>.

    Defendant is entitled to attempt to establish the defense of

necessity.  If the trial judge finds that Defendant has

established the required elements of the necessity defense in

the State of Iowa, the judge may then instruct the defense of

necessity.  The Court declines to rule that the defense of

medical necessity does not exist in the State of Iowa.

    IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that Plaintiff's Motion

to Strike Affirmative Defense is hereby denied.

    DATED this 16th day of June, 1994.

<p>People's Representative, U.S. <a

a Federal Prisoner at the U.S. Pentitentiary at Lewisburg,
PA.&nbsp; I am serving a 35-year sentence for Conspiracy to
Import and Conspiracy to Possess Marijuana.&nbsp; In 1972 I
visited one of your predecessors to the United States Senate, the
Honorable <a href="../../MEDICAL/IOWA/hughes.html"> Harold Hughes</a>.&nbsp;
The subject of our discussion at that time was the religious use
and the sacramentality of the herb commonly known as
marijuana.&nbsp; After a brief discussion of approximately one
half hour, the former <a href="../../MEDICAL/IOWA/hughes.html">
Senator Hughes</a> cancelled his schedule for the following
afternoon and spent that entire afternoon discussing all manner
of subject matter as diverse as the possible spiritual properties
of marijuana and ranging to his possible dark horse candidacy for
the Presidency of the United States.&nbsp; I was accompanied by
two colleagues, Thomas Reilly, who later became known nationally
as <a href="../tropic.html"> Brother Louv</a> - the spokesman for
the <a href="../coptic.html"> Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church</a>,
and Jacob Shnurman who is presently living in Des Moines and
employed in some capacity by the State of Iowa.&nbsp; I mention
this previous encounter simply to indicate to you that I have a
long and storied experience with this controversial herb and I do
possess the credentials of an herb man. However, the purpose of
this letter is not for myself nor is it an attempt to enlighten
you concerning the spiritual properties of this &quot;plant of
renown.&quot;&nbsp; I am writing you at the behest of my good
friend of many years, Carl Olsen, in behalf of a man I do not
know at all, <a href="../../MEDICAL/HELMERS/helmers1.html"> Allen
D. Helmers</a>. I am sure that you are aware of the plight of <a
href="../../MEDICAL/HELMERS/helmers1.html"> Mr. Helmers</a>.&nbsp;
He is attempting to petition for relief from the very real pain
which he suffers daily from the physical debility that he
acquired from breaking his back, initially, and, subsequently,
from a traffic accident caused by an alcohol-impaired driver. Is
there no one within the government at any level in these United
States who possesses the human compassion to hear the cry of
these helpless and hopeless folks who are suffering each
day?&nbsp; Isn't there anyone to speak in these legislative halls
of mischief for the souls who claim that their pain is either
relieved or more tolerable when they puff some smoke from a plant
which has been a part of creation long before pharmaceutical
manufacturers or drug enforcement operatives worked their
diabolical sciences and created the propaganda that has maligned
the most beneficial plant on this planet?&nbsp; Is there anyone
who is not brainwashed by this vicious lie about marijuana or who
is not afraid of the ominous repercussions of a federal
bureaucracy that thoroughly intimidates those it purports to
serve? I do not see anyone whose motives have not been
compromised by the political process.&nbsp; Human suffering is
the least of concerns by this juggernaut that has no
feelings.&nbsp; How is it that these people who claim to
represent the people can ignore the sincere cries of medical
relief that arise from thousands of suffering souls who have
risked the fearsome tactics of law enforcement agencies to
medicate themselves and then risk retribution when they are
honest? Lord, how long will thou look on?&nbsp; Let your
conscience be your guide.&nbsp; Everyone is accountable for their
actions. With minimal hope, I remain your brother, <a

The collection of <i>Cannabis </i>hemp germplasm at the Vavilov
Research Institute (VIR) consists of 397 accessions from 3
different eco-geographical groups: Northern, Central and
Southern. Eighty-five collection accessions were sown in
isolation at 4 locations in Russia in 1993 for the purpose of
maintaining the gene pools and replenishing the reserves of seed
for distribution. Sixty accessions yielded from 10 to 2,000 grams
of seed each. The remaining 25 accessions yielded no seeds.<br>

<p> <font size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>

<p> The most important project of the International Hemp
Association is a grant of humanitarian aid to the N. I. Vavilov
Institute of Plant Industry (VIR) in St. Petersburg, Russia. The
VIR was founded in 1924 by plant collector and geneticist N.I.
Vavilov (Fig. 1), one of the first scientists to recognize the
importance of plant genetic resources conservation. The institute
is the longest existing seedbank in the world and houses a
priceless collection of over 400,000 seed accessions.</p>

<p>The Department of Industrial Crops of the VIR maintains the
largest <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm collection in the world. Most
of these accessions are either wild landraces or fiber hemp
varieties, and many of them are found in no other gene banks.
Under normal storage conditions, hemp seeds can be kept for about
5 years before losing viability. Maintaining a <i>Cannabis</i>
collection therefore involves reproducing the accessions at least
once every 5 years. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union,
the funding of the VIR has dramatically decreased, threatening
the maintenance of its collections. If the <i>Cannabis</i>
accessions of the VIR are not reproduced they will surely become
extinct before their true value is ever realized and utilized.
Especially in light of the renewed interest in <i>Cannabis</i>,
it would be very short-sighted to let this collection die.</p>

<p> In 1993 the VIR, with the sole support of the IHA, began a 4
year program to preserve and evaluate its <i>Cannabis</i>
germplasm. The collection consists of 397 accessions of <i>Cannabis</i>
seeds from three basic eco-geographical groups: Northern, Middle,
and Southern, collected from 16 nations (Table 1). The collection
represents wild and traditional cultivated varieties as well as
products of plant improvement programs. The vast majority of the
accessions are classified as low-THC chemotypes of <i>Cannabis
sativa</i> L. All of the accessions will be reproduced during the
first three years, and in 1996 the entire collection will be
grown in replicate gardens and each accession will be
characterized.</p>

<pre>Two key requirements must be fulfilled before an accession can
be considered adequately reproduced. The primary goal of a germplasm
preservation project is the conservation of the entire gene pool.
It is very important that the population size is large enough
to ensure that nearly all of the genes within the gene pool are
reproduced in the resultant seed. We have set a minimum limit
of 1,000 plants in each population. This should ensure 99% preservation
of the gene pool. The second goal is to reproduce the accession
in sufficient amounts to distribute seed to researchers worldwide.
We have set a minimum limit of 200 grams of seed for storage and
later reproductions. Two hundred grams is approximately 10,000
seeds and will allow 5,000 seeds to be stored in an active collection
for reproduction and 5,000 seeds to be kept in long-term storage.
Seeds can only be released to the research community if more than
200 grams of seed from each accession are held by the VIR.

This paper reports the results obtained in 1993.

<font size="3"><b>Materials and methods</b></font></pre>

<p> Eighty-five accessions of hemp contained in the germplasm
collection of the Department of Industrial Crops at the VIR were
sown with the purpose of germplasm maintenance, replenishment of
seed stocks for distribution, and installation in long-term
storage. The accessions were planted at 4 VIR Experiment Stations
in Russia (Fig. 2): Pavlovsk (59N) near St. Petersburg,
Ekaterinino (53N) in Tambov Province, Kuban (44N) near
Krasnodar, and Volgograd (48N).</p>

<pre>At the Pavlovsk Experiment Station 15 collection accessions belonging
to the Northern and Central groups were sown in isolated plots.
Each plot contained one hemp accession, the distance between the
plots being 3-4 kilometers.  The accessions were sown according
to their ripening period, with early-ripening varieties planted
nearer to late-ripening varieties to avoid stray pollination.

Agrometeorological conditions during 1993 were unfavorable for
the growth and development of hemp. The spring was late and cold.
Air and soil temperatures in May and early June were lower than
average by 4-5 C. Because of this the spring sowing was
delayed by 15 days compared to the average sowing date. The plots
were planted on June 10-13. The seed was sown in densely planted
rows spaced 20 cm apart. The size of the plot varied from 8-12
m<sup>2</sup> depending on the number of seeds available.

The absence of rainfall in late May and strong winds dried out
the soil. The first seedlings appeared 10-12 days after sowing
and continued to appear for several days. During the course of
the whole vegetative period the air temperature was well below
average, while the rainfall was above average. Therefore, the
development of the plants was delayed.

Sowing of the seed and maintenance of the plants in the isolation
plots were performed according to the methods developed by the
Department of Industrial Crops. Maintenance of the plots consisted
of hoeing the soil when needed, thinning the rows where seedling
density was too high, weeding, applying fertilizer, removing male
plants after they finished flowering, covering the female plants
with gauze nets at the time of ripening to protect the seeds from
birds, and harvesting of the seed plants.

The remaining 70 collection accessions of the Central and Southern
eco-geographical groups were sown at the Ekaterinino, Kuban and
Volgograd Experiment Stations. At the former two stations accessions
were sown in isolated plots. At the Volgograd Station isolation
was achieved by using wooden and gauze isolation chambers. In
1993 the agrometeorological conditions there were as described
for the Pavlovsk Station, especially the dry and cold spring.
This caused a delay in sowing, sporadic germination of the seeds,
and poor condition of the seedlings. During the course of the
vegetative period the rainfall was 2-3 times the average for many
years. This also impeded the development of the plants.

<font size="3"><b>Results</b></font></pre>

<p> At the Pavlovsk Experiment Station, complete flowering was
observed in early August. Seed formation occurred in late August
and early September. Frosts arrived in the end of September and
the temperature fell to minus 5 C. These frosts killed the
plants that had not matured and been harvested. Thus out of the
15 collection accessions planted at the Pavlovsk Station, 10
accessions yielded from 10-1,000 grams of mature seed, two
accessions did not ripen, two accessions were stolen, and one
yielded only immature seeds (Table 2).</p>

<pre>Discussion and conclusions</b></font></pre>

<p> In the introduction to this paper we defined two key
requirements which must be fulfilled before an accession can be
considered adequately reproduced: at least 1,000 plants have to
produce a total quantity of at least 200 g of seed.</p>

<pre>Due to poor weather conditions, poor germination, limited space
and theft, only 14 of the 60 accessions reproduced were of sufficient
population size (more than 1,000 plants). Of these 14 accessions
only 10 were reproduced in sufficient quantity to allow distribution
(more than 200 g seed). This means that although 60 of the 85
accessions were reproduced, only 10 were reproduced with sufficient
population size and in sufficient quantity to satisfy our criteria.

Eighty-five <i>Cannabis</i> seed accessions were sown, 60 <i>Cannabis</i>
seed accessions were reproduced, and 10 seed accessions were reproduced
in sufficient quantity for distribution. Although the 1993 <i>Cannabis</i>
germplasm reproductions yielded minimal tangible results, we must
remember that this is the first time any <i>Cannabis</i> reproductions
have been attempted during the confusing period since the dissolution
of the Soviet Union. The extensive VIR system for germplasm preservation
has been partly reactivated and the future is now much brighter.
Our limited success is encouraging, considering that this is only
the first year of the VIR/IHA <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm preservation
project. We feel that the project should certainly be continued.
However, persistence and considerable additional financing will
be required to complete the reproduction and evaluation of the
entire <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm collection of the VIR within
the remaining three years of the project. Only one thing is certain,
we will never succeed if we do not focus our most concerted efforts
on <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm conservation.

<p> In 1994 the VIR and IHA continue their <i>Cannabis</i>
germplasm preservation programme. A third partner, the Italian
ENEA Institute is involved as well. A total of more than 100
accessions has been sown on five locations: Pavlovsk, Ekaterinino
and Kuban in Russia, Ustimovka in Ukraine and Bari in Italy.</p>

<pre>In Russia and Ukraine plant emergence and early growth have been slow due to cold spring wheather, but with the advent of higher summer temperatures crop growth has accelerated.

A detailed report on the results obtained in 1994 will be presented in the next issue of this journal.

Due to inflation in Russia, the costs of the project have doubled in 1994 relative to 1993. Donations to help continue this project are very welcome. Persons or organisations donating US $100 or more to the project will receive a VIR memorial medallion and/or pin and/or a copy of the VIR <i>Cannabis sativa</i> descriptor list, a 34 page booklet in English and Russian.</pre>

<p> The effect of the cultivation of fibre hemp (Cannabis sativa
L.), cv Kompolti Hibrid TC, on the population dynamics of the
soil-borne pathogens <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> (Fungi), <i>Meloidogyne
chitwoodi</i> and <i>Pratylenchus penetrans</i> (Nematoda) was
studied in greenhouse and field experiments. Fibre hemp
suppressed the population of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> strongly. A
reduction in population of <i>V. dahliae</i> was also noted.
Removal of stubble of hemp from soil after harvest was found to
inhibit formation of survival structures (microsclerotia) of <i>V.

<p> <font size="4"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>

<p> Dutch agriculture faces an increasing problem with soil-borne
pathogens (including nematodes) due to intensive growing of a
limited number of crops in short rotations. Government plans to
reduce the use of soil disinfectants by 50 % by the next century
may well aggravate the situation. A possible solution to the
problem is the introduction of new crops in the rotation.</p>

<p> It is generally assumed that long rotations are less
susceptible to soil-borne diseases than short rotations. However,
this assumption may not apply to soil-borne pathogens with a wide
host range (polyphagous pathogens). Several fungi (e.g. <i>Verticillium
dahliae</i> and <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>) and nematodes (e.g. <i>Pratylenchus</i>
spp. and <i>Meloidogyne</i> spp.) have a very large number of
host plants. Introduction of new crops of unknown host status
into a rotation may cause or aggravate problems with these
pathogens. Therefore, the population dynamics of important
polyphagous pathogens on new crops must be assessed before a safe
introduction can be made.</p>

<p> Fibre hemp is one of the potential new crops under
investigation in the Netherlands. Even though hemp is an ancient
crop, there are few reports on soil-borne diseases in this crop
and the general impression is that cultivation of hemp poses few
problems with plant diseases (Termorshuizen 1991). Soil-borne
diseases however often remain undetected due to the inconspicuous
symptoms. Furthermore, the absence of damage in a host plant does
not mean that the pathogen cannot multiply on the host.
Therefore, the population dynamics of some important soil-borne
pathogens on hemp were investigated.</p>

<p> The pathogens selected in this study were the fungus <i>Verticillium
dahliae</i> and the nematodes <i>Meloidogyne chitwoodi</i> and <i>Pratylenchus
penetrans</i>. These pathogens are potentially very harmful to
potato, which is the major crop in arable farming in the
Netherlands. <i>V. dahliae</i> is a major factor in the early
dying syndrome in potato, which can lead to severe yield
reduction. This pathogen has extremely persistent survival
structures (microsclerotia), that can endure in soil for over 12
years. Control of this pathogen is therefore very difficult
(Heale 1988).</p>

<p> The Columbian root-knot nematode <i>M. chitwoodi</i> has a
wide host range including many representatives of the <i>Gramineae</i>,
which are commonly used in rotational programmes with potatoes
(Santo et al. 1980). Low population levels of <i>M. chitwoodi</i>
already cause major crop losses of potato because of reduced
tuber quality and heavy infestations can substantially decrease
yields. Tuber infestation by <i>M. chitwoodi</i> causes necrotic
areas and other blemishes, rendering the tuber unsaleable
(Viglierchio 1987).</p>

<p> <i>P. penetrans</i>, the root-lesion nematode, has an
extremely wide host range. This species can cause severe growth
reduction and yield loss in potato production (Mai et al. 1977,
Santo 1989). Furthermore, <i>P. penetrans</i> increases the
effect of <i>V. dahliae</i> in the early dying syndrome of potato
(Kotcon et al. 1985, Rowe et al. 1985).</p>

<p> <font size="4"><b>Materials and Methods</b></font></p>

<p> The investigations described in this paper were carried out
using the Hungarian fibre hemp cultivar Kompolti Hibrid TC. This
cultivar was chosen for its good agricultural properties and
prior use as a standard in a cluster of research projects on
fibre hemp as an arable crop for paper production in the
Netherlands (&quot;National Hemp Programme&quot;).</p>

<p> The effect of cultivation of fibre hemp on the selected
pathogens was assessed by comparing the population before sowing
and after harvest of the crop. <i>M. chitwoodi</i> and <i>V.
dahliae</i> were studied in field and greenhouse experiments. The
reproduction of <i>P. penetrans</i> on hemp was studied in the
greenhouse only. The effect of fibre hemp on changes in
population of the pathogens was compared with the effect of crops
with known host status.</p>

<p> The greenhouse experiment with <i>V. dahliae</i> was carried
out using a organic sandy soil to which microsclerotia of <i>V.
dahliae</i> were added (2,500/ml soil). In 400 ml pots, hemp,
wheat and pea were grown (5 pots per treatment). A control
treatment contained no plants (fallow). Wheat and pea are
resistant and susceptible, respectively, to <i>V. dahliae</i>.
Afterwards, above-ground parts of the plants were removed and the
population of <i>V. dahliae</i> was estimated.</p>

<p> The population of <i>V. dahliae</i> was assessed with a
bioassay, using the potato as test plant. Rooted potato cuttings
were planted in 400 ml pots containing the soil to be tested. The
pots were placed on a greenhouse bench at 19 C and watered
sparingly. At two to three days intervals, the number of leaves
showing wilt symptoms was determined. The disease progress was
monitored until the first potato plants died (60 days after
planting). The cumulative disease score was calculated per plant
and taken as the measure of the soil population of <i>V. dahliae</i>.</p>

<p> Formation of microsclerotia on crop residues of fibre hemp
such as plant tops and stubble was studied in some detail. Since
microsclerotia were very rarely observed on plant parts that were
vital (green) at harvest, the effect of pulling stubble directly
after harvest on the formation of microsclerotia was determined.
In a field infested with <i>V. dahliae</i>, plant tops were
collected and green stubble was removed from the soil after
harvest. Three weeks later, when the stubble had died, another
batch of stubble was collected in the field. On both occasions,
the plant material was left to dry on top of moist soil in a
greenhouse, to simulate drying in the field. Once they were
air-dried, the number of stubbles containing microsclerotia was
assessed.</p>

<p> The reproduction of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> on hemp was studied
in a greenhouse and in the field. In the greenhouse experiment
reproduction of the nematode was determined after 1 generation.
Three week old hemp seedlings were inoculated with 200, 400, 800,
1,600 or 3,200 nematodes (hatched second-stage juveniles) in 400
ml pots in 5 replications. After 1 generation cycle of the
nematodes (7 weeks at 20 C), the number of newly formed eggs on
the roots was determined by the method of Vrain (1977). The
susceptibility of hemp was also tested in the field. On a sandy
soil heavily infested with <i>M. chitwoodi</i> (mean population
1500 eggs+larvae per 100 ml soil) fibre hemp was compared to five
other crops. All crops were grown in 6 x 6 m plots. Before sowing
and after harvest of the plants, the centre of the plot (1 x 1.5
m) was sampled with an auger (100 random samples, in total  3
litre soil per plot). The population of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> was
determined with an Oostenbrink elutriator ('s Jacob and van
Bezooijen 1984). The experiment was set up as a randomized block
design with 4 replications.</p>

<p> The reproduction of <i>P. penetrans</i> on fibre hemp and,
for comparison, sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i> L.) or
fiddleneck (<i>Phacelia tanacetifolia</i> Benth.) was determined
in a greenhouse experiment. <i>P. tanacetifolia</i> and sugar
beet are susceptible and resistant, respectively, to <i>P.
penetrans</i>. The test plants were grown in 400 ml pots
containing potting mixture and coarse river sand (1:2, on volume
base). The plants were inoculated with a nematode suspension or
with nematode-infested oat root pieces. <i>P. penetrans</i>
originated from a greenhouse culture maintained on oats (courtesy
of Mr. van Bezooijen, Agricultural University Wageningen).
Nematodes for inoculum preparation were extracted from oat roots
in a mist chamber ('s Jacob and van Bezooijen 1984). Nematodes
were inoculated in suspension (470 per plant) or in infected
roots (210 per plant). The experiment was stopped at senescence
of the hemp plants, 2 months after inoculation. Nematodes were
extracted from the root system in a mist chamber and from the
soil with an Oostenbrink elutriator. The experiment was carried
out in a completely randomized design on a greenhouse bench at 20
C. Per inoculum type, 5 replicates per plant species were
taken.</p>

The effect of the plants tested on the resulting disease index of
the potato test plants is shown in Table 1. Fibre hemp gave a
disease index in the bioassay that was not significantly
different from the resistant host plant wheat and the fallow
treatment. The susceptible host plant pea caused a significantly
higher disease index. This experiment was repeated with similar
results.</p>

<p> Fibre hemp sustained a large population of <i>P. penetrans</i>,

final population.</p>

<p> <font size="4"><b>Discussion</b></font></p>

<p> Fibre hemp (cv. Kompolti Hibrid TC) was shown to be resistant
to <i>V. dahliae</i> and <i>M. chitwoodi</i>, but susceptible to <i>P.
penetrans</i>, under experimental conditions. Furthermore, it is
suggested that pulling of the stubble of fibre hemp directly
after harvest will reduce the formation of new microsclerotia of <i>V.
dahliae</i>. However, the experiments were conducted under
greenhouse conditions or in field trials at a single location and
in one year. This can make generalization of the results
precarious. Inclusion of crops of known host status in the
experiments reduces this problem. In this way it is possible to
draw conclusions on the host status of fibre hemp by comparison
with the other species.</p>

<p> Fibre hemp can possibly be used to suppress <i>M. chitwoodi</i>.
In the field experiment strong suppression was found and in the
laboratory experiment reduction of the population of <i>M.
chitwoodi</i> was evident even at very low inoculum levels. This
is an important result, because of the wide host range and the
high damage potential of this nematode.</p>

<p> The population suppression of <i>V. dahliae</i> by hemp was
similar to that on wheat or in the fallow treatment. But
above-ground parts of fibre hemp may contribute to the population
of <i>V. dahliae</i>, if the stubble is allowed to die off
naturally. Pulling the stubble inhibited the formation of
microsclerotia. This measure can further reduce the population of <i>V.
dahliae</i> after the cultivation of fibre hemp.</p>

<p> It seems that fibre hemp is susceptible to <i>P. penetrans</i>.
The results of the greenhouse experiment call for caution in
introducing fibre hemp in the crop rotation at sites where
problems with <i>P. penetrans</i> occur and susceptible crops are
grown. However, since this conclusion is based on greenhouse
experiments only, further studies are necessary to assess the
risks under field conditions.</p>

<p> The host suitability of a large number of hemp cultivars to
the root-knot nematode <i>Meloidogyne hapla</i> was tested by De
Meijer (1993). This author found varying resistance levels,
ranging from highly resistant to moderately susceptible host
quality. The standard cultivar, Kompolti Hibrid TC, had an
average reproduction rate of <i>M. hapla</i>, both in a
laboratory and a field trial. Similar results were obtained by
Kok and Coenen (unpublished results). However, since some sources
of hemp germplasm showed very high levels of resistance (De
Meijer 1993), it should be possible to develop fibre cultivars
with good yield properties and a high resistance level to <i>M.
hapla</i>.</p>

<p> Modern European fibre hemp cultivars are thought to be
relatively closely related. Landraces, ornamental cultivars and
drug varieties however seem to be more distantly related (De
Meijer and van Soest 1992). Therefore, generalization of the
results to the latter types of hemp is precarious.</p>

<p> The results presented indicate that fibre hemp reacts
differently to various soil-borne diseases and that the notion
that fibre hemp will cause no problems with diseases in crop
rotation is not generally justified. Cultivation of fibre hemp is
likely to reduce the population of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> and of <i>V.
dahliae</i>. Problems with <i>P. penetrans</i> however could be
increased by fibre hemp. The results presented here are, however,
more of a qualitative than of a quantitative nature. Long-term
field studies are necessary to accurately assess the quantitative
impact of the cultivation of fibre hemp on soil-borne diseases.</p>

 with AIDS. However, many patients find that smoking Cannabis offers a superior route of administration and therefore illicitly self-medicate. <P>

<H4>Introduction</H4>



For those not familiar with marijuana and in need of it for medical purposes, the prospect of consuming an illicit drug may seem rather daunting. However, marijuana is used by 20-30 million people in the US and many times that number worldwide, under comp
letely uncontrolled circumstances, with little apparent harm. It is the world's fourth most popular recreational drug behind caffeine, alcohol and nicotine. Unlike these latter drugs, Cannabis is not addictive and no one in the several thousand year histo
ry of its use is known to have died from its effects.  The intent of this article is to provide the prospective medical user with an introduction to this drug as a possible therapeutic option. The basics of our subject start with the realization that this
 much-discussed drug, like many of the others we consume, is from a plant with an interesting natural history. <P>



<H4>Cannabis, the plant</H4>



Cannabis is a dioecious annual producing approximately equal numbers of male and female plants. Marijuana comes from the flower-associated bracts of female Cannabis. The male plant is much less useful for this purpose. Almost all of the Cannabis found wor
ldwide is classified as Cannabis sativa. Many taxonomists argue that C. indica and C. ruderalis are also valid species names (Emboden 1974, Schultes et al. 1974) although this remains controversial (Small and Cronquist 1976). However, even accounting for 
these additional species, 95% of the cultivated Cannabis in the world would still be classified as Cannabis sativa.<P>

<P>

As it grows well at low temperatures, Cannabis is well adapted to temperate climates (Van der Werf 1994). Ancient northern Asian and European societies used Cannabis mostly for its fiber and seed. It is also an aggressive weed plant at higher latitudes wo
rldwide. South Asian and African cultures used Cannabis mostly for its drug content, and the frost-free climates allowed more time for development of the psychoactive resin. Intense levels of ambient ultraviolet radiation and of insect predation in the tr
opics may also have contributed to a natural selection for these drug types (Pate 1983). In any case, Cannabis has evolved into two basic races. Plants grown for fiber and seed are universally called "hemp". Cannabis grown for its drug content is commonly
 called "marijuana" or "drug Cannabis". Its female flower bracts are covered with numerous small resin glands containing the pharmacologically active cannabinoids (Fig. 1) that that are unique to this genus.<P>



Most of the psychoactive properties of marijuana can be attributed to its content of a cannabinoid (Fig. 1a) named delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In some literature, it is designated as delta-1-tetrahydrocannabinol due merely to a conflict between tw
o methods of naming chemicals, but it is the very same molecule. Modern hemp varieties are nearly devoid of THC and, therefore, cannot be practically diverted into the drug trade. Hemp has been heavily selected for high fiber content, high stalk yield, hi
gh seed yield, and low (<0.3 %) inflorescence THC content (De Meijer et al. 1992). Drug-type Cannabis varies widely in THC content from approximately 1-2% in unselected strains to over 10% in the best modern varieties (Watson 1994). It is not feasible to 
"get high" on hemp, and most marijuana produces very little low-quality fiber. Hemp should never be confused with marijuana, as their roles cannot be reversed.<P>



<H4>Cannabis, the medicine</H4>



Cannabis has been recognized for centuries as a valuable therapeutic agent. Folk uses of Cannabis include treatment of insomnia, inflammation, various psychoses, digestive disorders, depression, rheumatism, migraine, neuralgia, fatigue, constipation, diar
rhea, parasites, appetite disorders and it has also been employed by women to facilitate childbirth, stimulate lactation, and relieve menstrual cramping (Mechoulam 1986). These traditions continue in every region where Cannabis is available. Modern Wester
n Cannabis users also frequently claim relief from many of these same medical complaints. <P>

<P>



Cannabis or THC have been used experimentally to effectively lower the elevated intraocular pressure of glaucoma (Adler and Geller 1986) and have shown potential for the treatment of alcoholism (Rosenburg 1976) and drug dependence (Hine et al. 1975). THC 
has been used as a bronchodilator for the relief of asthma symptoms (Graham 1986) and may also be effectively used as an analgesic for pain relief (Segal 1986). It has even been shown to have antibacterial properties (Van Klingeren and Ten Ham 1976).<P>

<P>

The low toxicity of THC is best indicated by its widespread use with very few reports of anything even approaching an overdose. Occasionally, people may get too "high" for their psychic comfort, but their bodies continue to function fairly normally. The d
osage sufficient to kill half of the organisms tested (LD50) for orally ingested THC is approximately 1 g/kg of body weight. Simply interpreted, this means an average sized human would have to consume 50-100 g of pure THC to reach the LD50 level. Since hi
gh-potency Cannabis contains approximately 10% THC, a person would have to eat at least 500-1,000 g of this marijuana before having a 50% chance of death. A 1 g marijuana cigarette of 10% THC Cannabis contains 100 mg of THC and is usually shared among sev
eral smokers. Clinically effective oral doses for the relief of nausea start at 5-10 mg. This means that, even accounting for pyrolytic decomposition and smoke loss, there is a several-thousandfold difference between an effective dose of THC and a potenti
ally lethal one! For alcohol, this difference is only about twentyfold. Other common non-prescription drugs, such as aspirin, have similar relatively narrow margins of safe use. Research into the actions of the natural cannabinoids led to the creation of 
many artificial ones based on variations of their basic molecular structure. However, none of these artificial compounds are currently approved for medical use in the US. Nabilone proved to be toxic to laboratory test animals and in 1978, human tests were
 suspended, although it is available in Canada, Switzerland and the United Kingdom as Cesamet. Levonathrodal, another synthetic cannabinoid analog, was not approved for use in the US, also following incidents of toxicity in test animals.<P>



Other natural cannabinoids (Fig. 1b-d), such as cannabichromene (CBC), cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG) have been shown to have potential therapeutic value, and can be isolated from both non-psychoactive as well as psychoactive Cannabis varieties,
 Epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, dystonias, and other neurological disorders have been experimentally treated with CBD (Consroe and Snider 1986). CBD has also been shown to relieve anxiety, especially the minor anxiety occasionally associated with the medic
al use of THC (Zuardi et al. 1982). CBC, CBD, and CBG and related analogs have been shown to have anti-microbial action (ElSohly et al. 1982, Van Klingeren and Ten Ham, 1976). These non-psychoactive compounds are generally not restricted by international 
regulations prohibiting Cannabis and THC. <P>



Various delivery systems for these cannabinoids, such as suppositories, time release encapsulation, eye drops, nasal sprays, aerosols, topical ointments, and transdermal patches will eventually become available. Several such cannabinoid delivery systems h
ave already been patented (e.g., ElSohly 1990, Hussain 1984).<P>

<P>

The only cannabinoid medicine currently available in the US is a synthetic THC encapsulated in sesame oil (generically known as "Dronabinol"). It is sold under the trade name Marinol as a Schedule II controlled substance (allowing restricted prescription
, similar to morphine and cocaine) and was afforded a narrow, specific legal exemption from the Schedule I status of other Cannabis products (forbidden from clinical use). It has been accepted and prescribed in the United States since 1985 as an anti-emet
ic to treat the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy (Levitt 1986). Use as an appetite stimulant to correct the weight loss related to anorexia in AIDS patients was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on December 22, 1992 (Anonymous 1992
). THC is not a cure for cancer or AIDS, but helps to relieve suffering and improve quality of life, perhaps prolonging the lives of those afflicted. THC may also eventually win approval as a general appetite stimulant for anorexia nervosa and other appet
ite disorders.<P>

<P>

Before other cannabinoids or Cannabis can become available to patients in the US, they must be similarly rescheduled. This also applies to the non-psychoactive compounds or even an otherwise identical, but plant-derived THC medicine! On April 29, 1991, th
e UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs decided that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol should be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances to facilitate its therapeutic use. Similar rescheduling in each member count
ry would allow doctors to prescribe it as a medicine and permit easier research. This has already been accomplished in England and Germany. Patients claim there is an acute need to reform the laws concerning other Cannabis products, especially in response
 to the medical plight of thousands of cancer and AIDS patients. If economic incentives could be created by liberalizing outdated anti-Cannabis laws and streamlining new drug registration and testing procedures for AIDS related medicines, several new Cann
abis medicines would appear on the market within the next few years.<P>

<P>

Currently, in the US, the cost of a single dose of Marinol ranges between $4.00 and $8.00 and the average patient cost ranges from $12.00 to $32.00 per day. Since Marinol is expensive, narrowly prescribed and often less effective than crude Cannabis pre
parations, potent sinsemilla-type (seedless) marijuana remains the most viable form of Cannabis medicine, despite the fact that its illegality artificially inflates its cost. Physicians learned as much from their patients and began to publish guidebooks o
n the appropriate medical use of Cannabis (e.g., Roffman 1982), which is most often smoked or consumed in baked goods.<P>

<P>

In some respects, it may be unfortunate that Cannabis has played such a prominent role in the American media's coverage of the counterculture movement since the 1960s. The popularization of Cannabis as the drug of choice increased its exposure to the gene
ral public, but government disinformation promoted the mainstream cultures confusion of it with hard drugs. It has been difficult for even the more knowledgeable patients and practitioners to view Cannabis as a genuine medicine rather than merely a recre
ational drug. Of course, many doctors are also reluctant to suggest Cannabis use because it is illegal. Marinol is too expensive for many patients to afford and orally ingested anti-emetics are of questionable value because their application must be care
fully timed to avoid vomiting the drugs. Many patients who both smoke Cannabis and swallow Marinol report that THC absorbed through the lungs offers more immediate relief, better dose titration, fewer side-effects and shorter duration of action. <P>





<H4>Conclusions</H4>



For millennia, Cannabis has been used as an effective medicine. Modern research has revealed the clear potential for this plant and its cannabinoid products to resume their place in the pharmacopoeia. Further work is urgently needed to determine how Canna
bis can be best utilized as a clinical tool. Meanwhile, cancer and AIDS patients and members of the medical marijuana movement have taken responsibility for their own health and self-medicate without a doctor's prescription. <P>

<H6> A brief review of the history of paper making reveals the important role of hemp in the development of the industry. The technical aspects of classical hemp pulping and paper making and the present status of the hemp pulp and paper industry are discu
ssed. It is shown that for new applications of hemp as a paper making fibre source, new pulp technology is required. This article is the first in a series about hemp pulping and paper making. </H6>

<HR>







<H3>History of paper making</H3>



The use of fibre hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) for pulp and paper dates back more than 2,000 years. The oldest surviving piece of paper in the world was discovered by archeologists in 1957 in a tomb near Sian in Shensi province, China (Temple 1986). It is abo
ut 10 cm square and can be dated precisely between the years 140 and 87 BC. This paper and similar bits of paper surviving from the next century are thick, coarse, and uneven in their texture. They are all made of pounded and disintegrated hemp fibres. Pa
per historians agree that the earlier Egyptian papyrus sheets should not be referred to as paper, because the fibre strands are woven and not wet-laid (Hunter 1957). The Chinese paper-making craftsmanship was transferred to Arabic and North-African coun
tries, and from there to Europe. The first European paper making was reported in the first half of the 16th century (Hunter 1957). <P>

Until the early 19th century, the only raw material available for paper making was rags. Rags are worn-out clothes. Since at that time clothing was solely made of hemp and flax (sometimes cotton), almost all paper in history was thus made of hemp and flax
 fibres. With the industrial revolution, the need for paper began to exceed the available rag supply. Although hemp was the most traded commodity in the world up to the 1830s (Conrad 1993), the shortage of rags threatened the monopoly for hemp and flax a
s paper-making fibres. This was the major incentive for inventors and industries to develop new processes to use the worlds most abundant (and cheap) source of natural fibres: our forests.<P>

Currently, only about 5% of the world's paper is made from annual plants like hemp, flax, cotton, sugarcane bagasse, esparto, wheat straw, reeds, sisal, abaca, banana leaf, ananas and some other more exotic species. The world hemp paper pulp  production i
s now believed to be around 120,000 tons per year (FAO 1991), which is about 0.05 % of the worlds annual pulp production volume. Hemp pulps are generally blended with other (wood-) pulps for paper production. There is currently no significant production 
of 100 % true hemp paper.<P>



<H3>Renewed interest in hemp paper</H3>



The recent renewed interest in hemp as a paper-making fibre seems to originate from a strong environmental motive. All primary forests in Europe, and most in North America have been destroyed, amongst others for paper production. Now we accuse the nations
 which still have primary forests of not guarding theirs. <P>

In Europe all trees harvested for paper making were intended for that purpose, so there seems to be no valid reason to switch to a non-wood or tree-free fibre source. This of course is a little different in the Americas and in Asia and Australia, where 
primary forests are cleared at a huge environmental cost. In these regions hemp has a number of advantages as an alternative source of paper-making fibre. Hemp does not need pesticides or herbicides, and yields three to four times more usable fibre per he
ctare per annum than forests. And last but not least: paper recycling was invented to make up for the mistake of cutting down our primary forests. Technically speaking, one doesnt need to recycle hemp paper, because it is a renewable raw material.<P>

One disadvantage of using hemp or other annual plants as fibre source is that the present pulping technology has been optimised for tree-fibre pulping, so some adjustments in the pulping processes need to be made when applying this technology to hemp fibr
es. Before going into technical details, we will first examine the technology of pulp and paper making.<P>





<H3>Pulping and paper making</H3>



Paper making is essentially the rearranging of elementary fibres from whatever source (a tree, a hemp stalk, an old pair of jeans or even a scoop of algae) into a flat thin sheet. <P>

Elementary fibres are the basic building blocks of trees and many plants. The average paper making fibre is about 2 mm long and about 20 micrometers (0.02 mm) thick. All fibres are assembled of chains of cellulose molecules, arranged as a rigid structure.
 These building blocks are glued together with other biological components (lignins, pectins), which give a certain flexibility and strength to the tissue, so that the tree or plant can bend at high stresses, and doesnt break in a storm, and is able to c
arry its seeds and fruits. The following explains what is needed to process a fibre source into paper (Smook 1982):



<H4>Pulping (from fibre source to pulp):</H4> 

<UL><LI>cleaning: all non-fibrous components need to be removed from the raw material, and the remaining fibres must be cleaned of dirt, rocks and other contaminants.

<LI> fiberizing: the elementary fibres are taken apart by either chemically removing the glue that holds them together, or mechanically tearing the fibre structure apart. From this step on, the material is referred to as "pulp".

<LI>cutting: especially hemp fibres are too long to give a homogeneous paper sheet, so the fibres have to be cut to the right size. 

<LI>classification: the fibres suitable for use in paper are separated from the ones too short, too long, too wide, too thin, too crooked, too dirty and too old. Fibres can be classified by weight (centrifugal and gravitational processes) and size (variou
s sieving processes).

<LI>bleaching: optionally, the suitable fibres may be bleached to a higher "whiteness". The whiter a sheet, the better the contrast with the ink. Old-style pulp mills use chlorine compounds with hazardous side-effects. Modern pulp mills use oxygen-based b
leaching (compounds like oxygen, ozone and peroxide). Hemp pulp can be bleached with relatively harmless hydrogen peroxide. For some applications bleaching is not required, for instance for packaging paper and board.

<LI>refining: this is a separate process step in which the fibre surfaces are "roughened". The greater surface roughness of a fibre, the better it adheres to other fibres in the paper sheet and the greater the strength of the paper.

</UL>

<H4>Papermaking (from pulp to paper):</H4>

<UL><LI>Dilution: in order to lay the fibres evenly into a homogeneous sheet, the pulp is diluted with large amounts of water (sometimes up to 200 times as much water as fibre pulp).

<LI>Formation: the fibre-water slurry is poured on a fine mesh wire. Most of the water will fall through the wire, leaving the fibres to settle into a flat sheet.

<LI>Drying: in the next steps, the wet sheet is dried by subsequent pressing and steam heating.

<LI>Sheeting: finally, the formed sheet is cut to the required size.</UL>

These processes are essentially the same for manual paper making and for modern paper machines, with the difference that the old paper maker put out one handmade sheet per minute, and the state-of-the-art Fourdrinier newsprint paper machine puts out 15,00
0 square meters a minute: a 10 meter wide sheet at 90 kilometers an hour! <P>





<H3>Remainders of the hemp pulp industry</H3>



Although there are thousands of non-wood paper mills in the world, only a few of them use hemp as a fibre source. At present 23 paper mills use hemp fibre, at an estimated world production volume of 120,000 tons per annum. Most of the mills are located in
 China and India, and produce moderate quality printing and writing paper. Typically, these mills do not really have a fixed source of fibre, but they simply use whatever can be found in the region. About 10 of the mills are located in the western world (
US, UK, France, Spain, eastern Europe, Turkey), and these mills produce so-called specialty papers such as: 

<UL><LI>cigarette paper: even popular American cigarette brands have a 50% hemp cigarette paper and filter. Some countries still have legislation prescribing the use of hemp in cigarette paper, because other fibres (like spruce) generate hazardous fumes w
hen incinerated (!).

<LI>filter paper (for technical and scientific uses)

<LI>coffee filters, tea bags

<LI>specialty non wovens

<LI>insulating papers (for electrical condensators)

<LI>greaseproof papers

<LI>security papers

<LI>various specialty art papers</UL>

These papers can generally only be produced from special fibres like hemp, flax, cotton and other non-wood fibre sources. The average hemp pulp and paper mill produces around 5000 tons per annum. This should be compared to a normal pulp mill for wood fi
bre, which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum. The only reason the remaining mills can still produce at this extremely small size is that there is a very special use for the pulp. This partly explains the high price for a hemp pulp: about US $25
00 per ton versus about US $400 for a typical bleached wood pulp. The remaining mills in the western world are unable to cope with western environmental regulations because of their small size and archaic technology. Some mills survive by shipping their w
aste water to a large wood pulp mill nearby, others have to close down. There is a clear shift in capacity towards countries that do not as yet take environmental problems very seriously.<P>

One reason for the high price of hemp pulp is the inefficient pulping processes used. Another reason is that hemp is harvested once a year (during August) and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through. This storage requires a lot of (most
ly manual) handling of the bulky stalk bundles, which accounts for a high raw material cost.<P>





<H3>Classical pulping technology</H3>



Most mills predominantly process the long hemp bast fibres, which arrive as bales of cleaned ribbon from preprocessing plants located near the cultivation areas. The bales are opened and fed into a spherical tank, called a digester. Water is added (5 to 1
0 times the fibre weight), together with the cooking chemicals to remove the "glue" components lignin and pectin from the fibres. Most mills use sodium hydroxide and sulphur cocktails.<P>

The fibres are cooked for several hours (sometimes up to eight hours) at elevated temperature and pressure, until all fibres are separated from each other. After cooking, the cooking chemicals and the extracted binding components are separated from the fi
bres by washing with excess water. This is where most of the polluting waste emerges from the process. Often wastes are discharged as such into the local surface water.<P>

The remaining clean fibres are then fed into a Hollander beater, which is best compared to an industrial size bathtub, with a large wheel revolving around a horizontal axis at one point in the tub. The wheel pumps the pulp round and round, and meanwhile c
uts the fibres to the right length, and also gives the fibres the required surface roughness for better bonding capacity. This beating goes on for up to twelve hours per batch. Some mills add bleaching chemicals in this beating process, other mills pass t
he pulp from the beating machines to separate tanks for bleaching. These separate bleaching treatments often use chlorine compounds, which are also discharged into the environment. The bleached pulp is then ready to be pumped to the paper machine, or can 
be pressed to a dryness suitable for transportation to a paper mill elsewhere. The processing time of more than twenty hours make this process very expensive, as the costly equipment and handling must be depreciated over a very low throughput.<P>





<H3>Necessity for new technology</H3>



New applications for hemp as a paper making raw material require a new pulping technology which must be able to use hemp from wet storage. Some new technologies have been developed, albeit in laboratory or on pilot scale. The next item in this series abou
t hemp pulping and papermaking will discuss these new technologies and their benefits.<P>

<html><TITLE>Commercial hemp cultivation in the Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries</TITLE>

<body><H1>Commercial hemp cultivation in the Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries</H1>



From the late middle ages until the 19th century hemp was grown in the Netherlands for use in the fishing industries. 

Further light has been shed on this interesting subject by a study carried out at Wageningen Agricultural University with financial support from the Historical Research Foundation, which is part of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO
). By the end of this year, H. Hoogendoorn will publish the results of this study in his PhD thesis.<P>



The rise of commercial hemp cultivation was associated with an increasing demand for vegetable oils and for fibrous materials. In a sea-faring nation such as the Netherlands, there was a major demand for hemp fibre as the raw material for making ropes, sa

ils and fishing nets. This demand was very large during the 17th century, which for the Dutch was their Golden Century. The herring fleet and the sailcloth industry gave preference to hemp produced in the Netherlands for the manufacture of nets, rigging a
nd cordage, and sails. (The word canvas is, in fact, derived from the Latin word Cannabis) The sail makers required a fine type of fibre and Dutch hemp producers introduced specific processes in order to meet this demand. This commercial chain from raw ma
terial to finished product provided a living for a large number of specialists such as hacklers (who combed the fibres), spinners, weavers and sail canvas manufacturers and represented a significant contribution to the contemporary economy. The Dutch mode
l became an example for the other countries.<P>



Commercial hemp cultivation was a specialty in the western part of the central Netherlands, and required a number of special facilities in the areas of agricultural engineering, hydraulic engineering and commercial management. The hemp farmers grew the cr
op on a small scale using advanced water-supply methods, and largely as a monoculture, therefore necessitating the intensive use of manure. Hemp cultivation was a labour-intensive activity, and the process of "retting", in which the crop was soaked in wat
er in ditches to separate the fibres, led to a high level of environmental pollution.<P>



After the 17th century, developments on both the supply and demand sides led to the gradual decline of hemp cultivation. Dutch maritime activity had passed its zenith, and other fibrous products such as flax, cotton, jute and even silk competed with hemp.
  Moreover, cheaper hemp was imported from eastern Europe. It became increasingly difficult for Dutch hemp farmers to produce at a profit, and they therefore gradually changed over from a combination of hemp growing and cattle rearing to dairy farming. Cu
rrent overproduction in the foodstuffs sector means that agricultural interest is once again being shown in hemp, while new industrial applications for hemp fibres are also being studied.<P>

<HR>

Pulling, retting, grassing, breaking, scutching and hackling were going on in East Anglia in Elizabethan times. There was even a law which enforced hemp growing on pain of a fine. The hemp produced was quite coarse and was used for smocks, sheets, bolster
s, fishing nets and rope. All over the area there are village names to remind us of the long hemp growing tradition such as Hempstead, Heckfield and Bleach Green. So in 1993 when Hemcore was formed by two East Anglian businesses to redevelop the hemp crop
 in the area, we were treading a well-worn path, albeit one that hadn't been walked for 50 years.<P>



The reasoning behind our move into hemp production involved a common mixture of circumstances and opportunities, in detail:

<UL>

<LI><B>Market Openings:</B>

 for the fibre into paper and textiles, for the core of the plant as livestock bedding, for the seed as fishing bait and bird seed.



<LI><B>Growing Opportunities:</B>

 with farmers looking for alternative crops to remove the pressure from over production in most of the main arable crop markets.



<LI><B>Environmental Benefits:</B>

 which were commonly seen as coming from hemp cultivation, both in the growing crop and in the replacement of synthetic or imported products in the market place.

</UL>

<H3>The project</H3>

In 1992 my partner Robert Lukies and myself set up a trials programme covering as many different varieties of hemp as we could obtain. These trials were taken through to harvest at Hatfield Broad Oak in Essex and the resulting plants were trial processed.
 
Following the successful outcome of these trials, a decision was made to go ahead with a commercial venture. An application was made to the British Home Office for a licence to grow 600 ha (1,500 acres) of hemp in 1993. After considerable discussion a lic
ence was granted on February 18, 1993, and our plans went into action for establishing a new U.K. hemp industry. <P>

 In March 1993, Hemcore Ltd. was formed. It is owned by Harlow Agricultural Merchants, a large East Anglian Merchanting Company and Robert Lukies, who farms and runs a seed processing business in Essex. During March and April, 30 growers were chosen and s
ites were approved by the Home Office. 

<P>

<H3>The growing crop</H3>

Drilling took place during the first week of May at approximately 50 kg/ha of seed, drilled 2-3 cm deep on 10-18 cm row widths. We found it important to obtain as fine as possible a seed bed with minimum compaction and used conventional cereal drills for 
sowing. No agricultural chemicals were used in the growing of the crop, but we did find it very responsive to fertilizer. We used fertilizer rates of about 120 kg/ha of nitrogen, 100 kg/ha of phosphate and 160 kg/ha of potash. 
The impressive growth rate of the hemp crop is already well known and our crops certainly lived up to expectations, average heights reached were 3 metres with some up to 3.5 m. Maximum heights were reached in early to mid August. There were noticeable pla
nt losses between establishment and full growth, with final plant populations ending at around 180 per metre square.<P>



In July and August, a number of incidents occurred where people stole cuttings of our contract crops. It is extremely doubtful whether they were rewarded for their troubles, but they were certainly of considerable nuisance value and caused the authorities
 some concern. One particularly troubled crop was harvested in early August to get it out of the way, otherwise harvesting did not begin until September.<P>



<H3>The harvest</H3>

   September and early October were very wet in East Anglia in 1993. This proved a considerable test of our pioneering harvest plans. Whilst we tried different machines and methods, the mainstay of our operation hinged on a modified rape swather and John 
Deere Round Balers. We are particularly grateful to the latter company for their wholehearted support. Although weather conditions delayed a large proportion of the baling until mid October, we were delighted by the condition of the crop, and in the end e
very hectare of every field was cleared. Following such a steep learning curve, we intend to put into practice for the '94 harvest a number of new plans that give us a lot of confidence for the long-term future of hemp production.<P>



<H3>The market</H3>

I will not go into detail on processing, as a large amount of what we are doing is at the prototype stage and all of it is confidential. Suffice to say that we have at the moment two products coming out of the factory, fibre from the stem sheath for paper
 and possibly for the textile trade, and the core of the stem which is going into the livestock bedding market. Both products have created a lot of interest and there seems at the moment to be good demand. <P>



<H3>Summary</H3>

1993 was a year of considerable achievement for Hemcore. The ripples from what we have done have gone round the world. We succeeded in a difficult year to grow and harvest 600 hectares of hemp and we will build on this in 1994. We have continued to do ext
ensive variety and agronomic trials and these too will be extended this year. Processing caused us many more problems than we originally envisaged. Marketing will also present a challenge as the present volumes are only satisfying a small niche market. We
 have made it clear from the outset that Hemcore's philosophy, unlike that of much of the agricultural world, will be to satisfy market leads, not to be output driven.<P>

<TITLE>Hemp or wood: potential substitutes</TITLE><body>
<H1>Hemp or wood: potential substitutes</H1>
<H2>V.S. Krotov</H2>
<H3>The Ukranian Pulp and Paper Research Institute</H3> <H4>18/7 Kutuzovstreet, Kiev 252133, Ukraine</H4>
<HR>
<H3>Introduction</H3>

Three major factors are restraining the development of the pulp and paper industry of Ukraine:

<UL><LI>1. The capital costs for the construction of new production facilities are high, with payback time often exceeding the normative service life of the main process equipment. 

<LI>2. The current obsolete equipment causes environmental problems, as it has a high consumption of raw materials, water and energy and a relatively low yield of finished products. Over 10 % of the raw materials, the pulping chemicals, and almost all bleaching agents are discharged into the environment.

<LI>3. Ukraine is sparsely wooded, and a lack of traditional raw materials hampers the development of its pulp and paper industry. Forests take up only 13.2 % of its territory, and logging covers about one third of its pulp requirements. At the same time, Ukraine's agriculture generates millions of tons of fibrous products: cereal straw, sunflower and corn stems, flax, hemp and others. 
In this paper fibre hemp as a raw material for paper pulp will be compared to poplar.</UL>

<H4>Pulping of non-wood raw materials</H4>

In principle, all fibre-containing by-products can be used for pulping, but their processing in the pulp and paper industry is more expensive than the processing of wood. Agricultural by-products are more bulky and dispersed over larger territories than wood, making their transport and storage more costly. Other factors increasing the costs of pulping of non-wood raw materials using existing technologies are:

<UL><LI>-heterogenous morphology of the raw material containing stems, leaves, spikes, seeds etcetera, and the presence of non-fibrous impurities (e. g. soil),

<LI>-high ash content of raw materials and especially the presence of silicon compounds,

<LI>-lower pulp yield as compared to wood pulping.</UL>

The negative effect of these factors on production and environmental safety can be minimized by additional expenses for the preparation of raw materials, the removal of silicon and the disposal of wastes. However, the extra costs involved would make non-wood pulp more expensive than wood pulp.


<H4>Poplar or hemp?</H4>

The development of a competitive pulp industry in sparsely wooded countries requires:
<UL><LI>1. Setting up plantations of fast-growing plants with a high yield of fibrous raw materials,

<LI>2. The development of a new technology adapted to the specific characteristics of local raw materials, including  agricultural by-products.</UL> 

For the conditions of Ukraine, the choice of plants to be grown on plantations and to be used for pulp and paper is limited to fast-growing poplars or hemp. The technology for growing poplar in short rotation (12 years) plantations has been developed by one of the Ukrainian Research Stations. In the south of Ukraine, Toropogritsky's poplar is recommended for growing. The annual increment of such poplar plantations on irrigation areas of the Kherson Region varies from 20 to 40 m3/ha, depending on fertility, planting pattern and irrigation practice. Taking an average annual increment of 30 m3/ha, and a poplar wood density of 420 kg/m3, we obtain an amount of wood of 12.6 ton per ha per year. A feasibility study for such poplar plantations has shown that the costs of the wood were four to five times higher than those of aspen wood logged and delivered to the Kherson Pulp and Paper Mill from Central European regions of Russia.<P>

Hemp is promising as a raw material for pulp and paper. Southern hemp is most suitable for growing under the conditions of Ukraine, since it is hardy, suffers little damage from pests and diseases, and can be grown in monoculture for many years. At present its yield of dry stems is 8-10 ton/ha in many areas, which is four to five times more than the average annual increment in Ukranian forests and approaches the increment of the most productive plantations of fast growing poplars. <P>

<H4>Perspectives</H4>


The Ukranian Institute of Bast Crops (UIBC) at Glukhov, Sumy Region, has bred hemp cultivars containing practically no psycho-active components. Until the present the hemp selection was aimed at breeding varieties for the textile industry, i.e. the selection work took into account the bast portion of the stem, as well as the content of THC. In the pulp and paper industry, the entire stem can be used. Based on its large experience, the UIBC expects it can breed cultivars yielding 12-14 ton/ha of dry stems. In this case the stem yield is comparable to the wood yield of the best polar hybrids. As opposed to hardwoods such as poplar, hemp can meet all the requirements of the paper industry for short- and long-fibred pulps for practically any paper or board grade.
In 1992, UIBC compared the labour costs of growing and harvesting hemp to those of poplar. Proceeding from the present average yield of 6 ton/ha for hemp and from an annual increment of poplar of 12.6 ton/ha, the costs were comparable. Thus, hemp plantations are more efficient than poplar plantations as a source of raw materials for the pulp and paper industry. However, the advantages of hemp can be realized only if a new technology allowing pulping of the entire stem is developed. Such a technology has been developed at the Ukrainian Pulp and Paper Research Institute. Its basic concepts are summarized in a research proposal (page 28) and will be presented more in detail in a future paper.<HR>

<TITLE>Hemp in Australia</TITLE><body>

<H1>Hemp in Australia</H1>

<HR>





<H2>The Tasmanian Hemp Company</H2>

<H3>In the beginning</H3>

"What happens to those beautiful native forests in Tasmania?" was the question posed in a Dutch living-room in 1988 when we were sharing photographs and experiences. After explaining that a good proportion ended up as woodchips for Japan which we then bought back as paper, a friend said that he had seen something on Dutch TV about hemp for paper. I was brought up as a logger's daughter in Tasmania, and began to feel very angry with myself for not having seen beyond trees for paper.  

So began our long search to track down this curious phenomenon. Our lives are now totally dominated by hemp, despite the warnings of a visiting Dutch Hemp Project leader not to let it do so.



Frits' niece helped us to locate the Dutch university students researching hemp and our knowledge (and Frits' translation skills) began to improve dramatically. Since then, we have visited the Dutch Hemp Project's pulp researchers and the research farm and hosted two of the top researchers for a whirlwind tour here in 1993.<P>



<H3>The Tasmanian hemp story</H3>

Our achievements, apart from notoriety and positive public education throughout Australia, include three annual licensed trials of low-THC hemp supervised by the University of Tasmania. Frits harvested our 1994 trial between a morning rehearsal and evening orchestral concert with the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra at the end of March. Our bureaucrats are nervous about the venture, but have not yet put a stop to our endeavours, although they suggest that we should walk before we run. In our opininon we have walked for too long: the world can't wait for sensible solutions and our campaign has broadened from hemp for paper to hemp for just about everything! Tasmanian farmers are most interested and the general public is supportive. The only abusive phone call we ever had was from an elderly ex-employee of one of Australia's pulp and paper manufacturers who claimed the Dutch were "decadent"!<P>

 We set up the Tasmanian Hemp Company to help our negotiations with government and business. We had already founded the Hemp for Paper Consortium Incorporated, a small non-profit community association aiming to spread information on the agricultural, industrial and environmental benefits of a hemp industry. I began by submitting a plan to the Tasmanian Government in February 1991 for an environmentally sound pulp mill based on hemp. This was in answer to a call for expressons of interest in a Northern Tasmanian Pulp and Paper Mill. Frits' translations of Dutch research as well as information gathering since 1988 provided the basis for the submission.<P>

The later establishment of the company was seen as a practical example of promoting an industrial approach to hemp, a lead which the consortium had hoped would be taken up by business people in Tasmania. This did not happen, however, mainly through lack of government interest. Considering the enormous obstacles placed in the way of the Hemp for Paper Consortium Incorporated when lobbying for licences to grow hemp, it is little wonder that others have not wanted to venture in.<P>

Our company is the first importer of hemp fabric to Tasmania. We are sewing this into clothes which we sell, to promote products that could be produced from fibre grown here. Our biggest step will be achieving a commercial licence to grow hemp here in Tasmania, for which we began negotiations with the Tasmanian government officials recently.
It is interesting to note that our licence applications now need to go through the Poppy Advisory Board of Tasmania. Tasmania is the only Australian state which grows opium poppies. The poppy officials are nervous of Tasmania's "clean" image being ruined by the media painting Tasmania as the drug state of Australia, were we also to grow hemp. They insist that the low THC content of our crop will not get in the way of a good story.

<H3>Our objectives</H3>

<UL><LI>Long-term: to develop hemp as a new crop and a sustainable industry which will help overcome Australia's problems of soil degradation, pollution from agricultural chemicals, and controversy over the use of native forests.

<LI>  Short-term:<UL><LI> a) to provide organically grown hemp for export to existing markets, 

<LI>b) to set up separating machinery in Tasmania as a first step to down-streaming, so that companies in Tasmania interested in either the bast or core fibre can be supplied (e.g. to replace expensive, imported Kraft pulp; to provide horse bedding), 

<LI>c) to set up a small integrated pulp/paper/textile/fluff mill in Tasmania.</UL></UL><P>

<H2>Tasmanian trials</H2>



During the 1992/93 growing season, the University of Tasmania at Hobart, carried out field trials together with the Tasmanian Hemp Company to investigate the production potential of fibre hemp in Tasmania.<P>

 The dioecious Hungarian cultivar Kompolti was sown in a replicated field experiment at a rate of 50 kg/ha of seed. Sowing dates were November 2, 16 and 30 and the experimental plots were harvested about 4 months later. All crops emerged rapidly within a week of sowing, and full ground cover was reached soon. Weeds were effectively smothered, so no extra control methods were required. No significant pest or disease damage was observed. Irrespective of sowing time, plants started to form inflorescences in the middle of January, which slowed down vegetative growth in favour of reproductive development. Yields were 8.0, 8.4 and 6.1 ton/ha of stem dry matter. Delta-9-THC content was measured in young leaves and female inflorescences several times during the growing season, and it was always well below the legal limit of 0.3 %. If better adapted (i.e. later flowering) varieties were used, yields of 10 to 12 ton/ha of stem dry matter could probably be obtained in Tasmania.<P>

<H2>Australia, Eucalypts and Hemp</H2>



In many countries around the world, the impact of decades of neglect and thoughtless exploitation of the natural environment is beginning to show. Australia is one such country. Despite much rhetoric to the contrary, it remains that our country continues to suffer severe degradation of the land, air and water due to thoughtless agricultural, forest and water management policies.<P>

Australia enjoyed unparalleled prosperity for decades, based on the production of wool and wheat. The agricultural base has broadened to include sugar cane, many fruits and cotton for domestic consumption and export. The fragile soils of the Australian continent were not suitable for chemical methods of farming, neither were they able to withstand the impact of imported domestic cattle and sheep. Intensive herbicide and pesticide dependent cultivation methods lead to high costs and decreasing returns.<P>

One of the most profound problems has been that of water management. Even though Australia has lush tropical rain forests in the north-east, it is the driest continent on earth. Large scale damming of rivers and sinking bores for irrigation have led to severe salination due to evaporation, concentrating trace amounts of salt present in artesian water. This has been compounded by clearing of tree cover. The most shameful aspect of policy here is to allow the clear-felling of old growth forest to be chipped for Kraft paper.<P>

 The roots of Eucalyptus trees reach deep into the subsoil to extract water. After clearing of trees, the water table rises, bringing buried salt to the surface. In some parts of the inland river system thousands of hectares have been permanently lost to a smothering layer of salt. Excess phosphates from chemical fertilizers have entered the waterways. With flow rates seriously reduced by irrigation, the protective flushing effect is lost and there have been several outbreaks of toxic blue green algae.<P>

Fortunately, there have been small improvements. Forward thinking people have formed a "land care" organization to plant trees and practice more sustainable farming. There is a growing movement in Australia to introduce fibre hemp for the production of fabric and paper, as well as developing a ligno-cellulosic ethanol fuel industry. Despite recent developments in Europe and England, where fibre hemp cultivation under licence is in progress, little cultivation is taking place. The legislative power to regulate hemp is held by each state government. Modest progress has been made in Tasmania by the "Hemp for Paper" Consortium.
In New South Wales, the most populous state with the most suitable agricultural land and climate, there has been a complete refusal by the authorities to allow fibre hemp trials, despite the support of Universities, agricultural firms and farmers. Economic projections have indicated that hemp will be a highly profitable crop, provided we can convince the government to follow the United Nations policy on fibre hemp and permit industrial scale trials.<P>

<html><TITLE>Paper from Dutch hemp?</TITLE><body>
<H1>Paper from Dutch hemp?</H1>


<H3>Hayo M. G. van der Werf</H3>
<H4>International Hemp Association, Postbus 75007, 1070 AA Amsterdam, The Netherlands</H4>
<HR>
From January 1990 until December 1993, a total of 12 research institutes in the Netherlands spent Dfl 17 million (US $9 million) on a hemp research programme. The objective of this programme was to establish whether fibre hemp can be of economic interest to farmers and to the pulp and paper industry in the Netherlands. The major research disciplines within the programme were: plant breeding, crop physiology, plant pathology, harvest and storage technology, pulp technology, and economics and market research. This research yielded a large amount of factual information, which was recently summarized in two reports in Dutch (Bakker et al. 1993, Van Berlo 1993).<P>

Several researchers who were involved in the Hemp Research Programme will contribute papers on the results they obtained in their field to this and following issues of this Journal. One of the major results of the programme: a business concept, outlining the required specifications for a viable hemp-paper business to be set up in the Netherlands, is summarized in this article (Van Berlo 1993).  
<HR>
<H3>The business concept</H3>
<H4>Pulp markets</H4>
Market research  has shown that both high-value and low-value markets are relevant for fibre hemp grown in the Netherlands. High-value pulp markets consist of applications in Light-Weight Coated paper (LWC), sanitary papers and tissues, and 'fluff', which is used in the production of diapers. In the Netherlands, the size of each of these three markets is about 10,000 ton/year. Low-value pulp markets consist of applications in the production of massive and corrugated cardboard. In the Netherlands, the market for hemp pulp for cardboard production is about 160,000 ton/year. Pulp quality specifications, such as whiteness and purity, are lower for low-value markets than for high-value markets.<P>
The high-value market is the eventual major objective, but initially pulp will be made for the low-value cardboard market, because it does not require top quality specifications. Pulp technology will be gradually optimised, and pulp production for high-value markets will then be possible. First the LWC market will be approached, and finally the sanitary paper, tissue and fluff markets. The low-value market will continue to be served, as the high-value market probably can not absorb all the pulp produced.
Initially, when pulp is produced for low-value markets only, a market price of Dfl 600/ton of pulp is expected. After several years, when pulp will be produced for both high- and low-value markets, a price of Dfl 1,000/ton is possible. <P>

<H4>Hemp production</H4>
A hemp-growers cooperative should be set up by arable farmers in the north-east of the Netherlands. In the first year, the members of this cooperative will grow 2,500 hectares (1 hectare or ha = 2.47 acres) of fibre hemp. Over a period of 6 to 7 years, this area will expand to 11,000 ha and the cooperative will consist of a total of 1,000 to 1,100 farmers. In the crop rotation, hemp will replace cereals. Initially a yield of 10 ton/ha of stem dry matter is expected. After 5 years, improved cultivars will be available and an average stem yield of 12 ton/ha is expected. Initially farmers will get Dfl 130/ton of stem dry matter, this price will increase to Dfl 180/ton as pulp production is geared more to high-value pulp markets. In addition, the European Union (EU) supplies a Dfl 1,700/ha subsidy to hemp growers. The crop is harvested in September by contractors who will use modified silage maize harvesters. The crop is ensiled on the farm and sodium hydroxide is added to the chopped stems for preservation.<P>

Provided the EU maintains its Dfl 1,700/ha subsidy, and if a an average yield of 12 ton/ha at a price of Dfl 180/ton is obtained five years after the start of the project, the farmer's gross margin (financial yield minus direct costs) will be Dfl 2,343/ha. This is more than the gross margin of wheat and less than that of potato.<P>

<H4>Pulp production</H4>
The pulp factory will be set up stepwise. It will start at a production capacity of 20,000 ton/year of pulp. Ensiled hemp will be brought from the farms to the factory and separated into bark and core using a flotation system. Both fractions will be pulped using chemo-mechanical pulp technology. The resulting pulp will meet the requirements of the low-value market. At this scale, pulp technology and waste water treatment technology will be further optimised. 
The size of the factory will then be increased to 40,000 and finally to 90,000 ton/year by adding parallel chemo-mechanical pulp lines. As the pulping process will be more sophisticated, pulps for the high-value markets will be produced. A total investment of Dfl 127 million would be required for a pulp factory producing 90,000 ton/year for both high- and low-value markets.

<H4>Financing</H4>
In order to be economically feasible, the pulp factory should reach a capacity of at least 40,000 ton/year. This would require an investment of Dfl 57 million. Three sources could contribute to this investment:
<UL><LI>a) Shares. Shares are owned by the hemp growers (Dfl 500/ha), other farmer cooperatives, banks and paper factories. Shares should finance 50 % of the total investment.
<LI>b) Subsidies. Subsidies from several sources should supply 25 % of the total investment.
<LI>c) Low-interest loans. These should be supplied by national and regional governments, and make up the remaining 25 % of the total investment.
Based on this financial structure and on the other assumptions outlined above, the shares would yield a return on investment of 16 % with a pay back time of 4.8 years. </UL>

<H4>Feasibility of the business concept
</H4>
A committee, consisting of representatives of farmers, the paper industry, farmers cooperatives and of the provincial and national government, was asked to give its advice on the business plan. This committee concluded that some of the assumptions the business plan relies on are uncertain, which make it impossible to decide on its feasibility. The committee recommends further research to resolve the uncertainties. This research should include setting up a pilot plant producing 1,000-5,000 ton/year of pulp, and growing the hemp required to supply the pilot plant. The pilot plant would allow improvement of the pulp technology and a better estimate of the costs involved. This additional research would take about 2 years and cost Dfl 8-10 million. Currently, funding for this pilot research is being solicited from the paper industry and the national and provincial governments.

<H2>Bioregional Fibres, the potential for a sustainable regional paper and textile industry based on flax and hemp. </H2>



<H3>By S. Riddlestone, P. Desai, M. Evans and A. Skyring.</H3>

This report, printed on hemp-straw-recycled paper, is a study of the feasibility of reviving the cultivation and processing of flax and hemp as a sustainable industry in south-east England. <P>
The first section of the report provides the background of the study. It explains why the authors think that local production for local needs is required for a sustainable society. The environmental and social problems accompanying the growing of cotton and the need for alternatives to cotton are summarized; the link between paper use and the disappearance of ancient forests is outlined.<P>
The second section starts with an interesting overview of the history of flax and hemp, followed by a review of cultivation and processing of flax and hemp in the 1990s, with particular emphasis on the situation in the European Union. It discusses textile and paper markets in the UK and evaluates the potential of flax and hemp as sustainable alternatives to cotton and wood.<P>
Section three provides details of the expertise and technology available and under development for processing hemp and flax into textiles and paper. It goes into the details of fibre extraction and pulping technologies. The environmental and economic implications of the technologies are discussed.
Sections four and five summarize the main points from the previous sections, build models for a bioregional fibre industry in south-east England and present conclusions and recommendations.
This study makes very interesting reading for all those interested in fibre hemp. It is well written, well documented and very quantitative.  The attitude and approach of this study is nicely illustrated by the following citation from Section II.8, entitled: 'Current and potential uses and markets for hemp': "Much of the information promoted in favour of the revival of hemp comes from the lobby for the legalisation of Cannabis as a recreational drug. Some of these sources are quoted in this section, but our own experience has suggested that in certain instances the case for hemp is overstated. The facts will have to be verified in the field. Nonetheless, hemp is a truly remarkable plant with a myriad of potential uses."<P>
For both flax and hemp the study advocates whole crop utilisation. The highest value line fibre should be processed into textiles, the lower value short fibres (tow) should be pulped to produce high quality paper. The woody core (hurds) can be used for paper, composite boards or heat generation. The study points out that currently, there is no hemp textile industry in western Europe. If hemp is to be revived for textile use, considerable investment in machinery would be required.<P>
In conclusion, this study provides a realistic assesment of the role fibre hemp may play in a more sustainable society. It indicates the potential of the crop, as well as some problems to be resolved. All in all, this publication seems very much worthwhile for those seriously interested in the topic. HvdW.

<H3>Marijuana, the first twelve thousand years </H3>



<H4>By Ernest L. Abel</H4>
<H5> 1980. Plenum Press, New York  US $39, 289 pp.</H5>

<B>Marijuana, the first twelve thousand years</B> is the single most complete and authorative work on the history of the genus Cannabis. Abel presents his thorough and unbiased investigation of the history of drug Cannabis, as well as the even more ancient uses of Cannabis hemp as a source of edible seed and fiber for the manufacture of paper, rope, and textiles.<P>
The detailed explanations of the spread of hashish by the Arabs, and the introduction of hemp to the New World by European colonists, provide fascinating reading for historians and Cannabis aficionados alike. The section presenting the relationship between hemp and slavery is particularly enlightening. Abel describes the strategic importance of supplies of high quality hemp, especially for naval rigging. The Romans, Venetians, Portuguese, Dutch, and English all used the power of hemp to exert their naval might and build trade routes to the world's corners.<P>
Abel's sources span a wide range of disciplines, and are well referenced in an extensive bibliography. A detailed index allows ready access to the many facts contained in the text.<P>
No Cannabis researchers, nor botanical libraries, could possibly consider their collections complete without including the extensive knowledge contained in <B>Marijuana, the first twelve thousand years</B>.

<H1>Interview</H1>
<H2>Professor Dr. Raphael Mechoulam, the discoverer of THC</H2> 
<HR>
Although research into the psychoactive components of Cannabis began before the start of this century, it was not until 1964 that Dr. Raphael Mechoulam, of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, identified delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as the most active compound. Mechoulam's discovery led to a lot of research into other natural and synthetic cannabinoids. In recent years many exciting discoveries were made. In 1990 the cannabinoid receptor, the "lock" into which cannabinoids fit, activating the specific biochemical events, was discovered. This of course intensified the search for the cannabinoid-like brain molecule that binds to the cannabinoid receptor. In 1992 William Devane and Raphael Mechoulam identified a natural brain molecule that binds to the cannabinoid receptor. They called it anandamide, from the Sanskrit word for "eternal bliss". While the substance mimics the action of THC, interestingly, it doesn't look anything like it. Additional natural anandamides have since been found and it is specula
ted that a family of receptors may exist. 
One thing is certain: the pace of cannabinoid research has picked up and the field is entering a new and exciting era! An exclusive interview (June 17 1994) with the man who has been in the forefront of Cannabis research for the last thirty years: Professor Raphael Mechoulam.<HR>

<B>David Pate:</B> Can you describe anandamide, its possible function in the brain and where its discovery leads us?<P>
<B>Raphael Mechoulam:</B> It has been known since 1988 that THC acts on a specific receptor in the brain. This specific receptor obviously was not built by the brain just for the sake of tetrahydrocannabinol - a compound present in a plant - which is of course foreign to the receptor. Presumably the receptor is present because it has a function, which has nothing to do with a plant constituent. We considered that possibly this particular receptor is activated by a compound found in the brain itself. We succeeded 2 years ago to identify such a compound in pig brain. We called it anandamide. It binds to this cannabinoid receptor. Anandamide differs completely from THC in its structure. THC is an aromatic compound, while anandamide is a fatty acid derivative. It also has a nitrogen atom in it, which is rather unusual for fatty acid derivatives.<P>
 
<B>DP:</B> Any speculation as to why it is there, what it actually does, both the receptor and its ligand?<P>

<B>RM:</B> We know that the cannabinoid receptor system is involved in sedation; at high doses THC can even cause catalepsy in animals. In humans we know that Cannabis has a lot of effects which together cause the well known "high".  These also include memory effects and some effects on movement. Most of the effects caused by THC are also seen with anandamide in animals. Anandamide has not yet been given to humans but judging from the animal effects these two compounds seem to parallel each other in activity. Whatever THC does, anandamide does as well.<P>

<B>DP: </B>What is the role of anandamides in the brain?<P>

<B>RM: </B>Anandamides and the receptor are found in areas of the brain which have to do with the coordination of movement, with memory and with emotions. We assume that the brain has anandamides and the receptors to participate in the regulation of movement and to participate in memory and emotions. But there is no proof that this is indeed the case, it is a circumstantial evidence.<P>
<B>DP:</B> Since three natural anandamides have been found, how broad do you think the family is? Are there multiple types of receptors?<P>


<B>RM:</B> The three anandamides which are known bind to the same receptor. They are actually a family of closely related compounds. This is well known with other fatty acid derivatives in the body which also appear in large families of closely related substances, such as prostaglandins and the leukotriens. The three  anandamides so far known seem to have the same biological activity, but once we know more about how and what they do we may find small differences. <P>

<B>DP:</B> Are there families of receptors as well?<P>

<B>RM:</B> This is another point. In the brain, so far, just one receptor has been found. However, a second receptor has been found in the spleen, it is related chemically to the brain receptor and anandamide binds to both the central receptor (in the brain) and to the peripheral receptor (in the spleen). Anandamide has not been found so far in the periphery, so chances are that the fact that it binds to the receptor in the spleen is just because the structures of the two receptors are somewhat close. Maybe the brain transmits the brain mediator. The peripheral receptor seems to have its own endogenous ligands. As a matter of fact we have found an endogenous compound in the gut which binds to both the central and peripheral receptors. We are working on it at the moment and have not published its structure or function. I think that the peripheral receptor has to do with the immune system as it is well known that THC affects this system. At present however this is just a speculation.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Can you further speculate on what triggers production of anandamides naturally and whether they are degraded by an enzyme system like the cannabinoids?<P>

<B>RM: </B>Incidentally, also in answer to your previous question, the peripheral receptor is found in the spleen, but there is also a receptor in the testis, we do not know whether it is the peripheral or the central receptor and we know that THC and anandamides act on the sperm. There is a paper in publication in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showing that both THC and anandamides act on activation of the sperm before it fertilizes the egg. So it is involved, whether that is relevant or not, I don't know. <P>
We do not know what triggers the production of anandamides. Inciden-tally, Bill Devane and J. Axelrod at NIH have now found an enzyme which synthesizes anandamide in the brain from arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. The anandamides are labile compounds and they are degraded by an enzyme - an amidase. <P>

<B>DP:</B> Are there interactions between the cannabinoid receptor and other receptors or receptor systems?<P>

<B>RM:</B> Most definitely. The cannabinoids (and presumably the anandamides) like most mediators in the body interact with other systems: the dopaminergic, the adrenergic, the opiate systems etc. For example we have found that when anandamides are injected into the brain the concentration of cortical steroids goes up. There are indications that the cortical steroids themselves may act on the cannabinoid receptor, presumably bringing down its activity.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Were you surprised that anandamide was the structure it was and not a protein?<P>

<B>RM:</B> No, there is no reason why it should be a protein. As a matter of fact, we thought originally that anandamide should be a lipid-soluble compound, because the cannabinoids are lipid-soluble, and therefore chances were that the compound in the body will be lipid-soluble and it turned out to be a fatty acid.<P>

<B>DP:</B> How do cannabinoids and anandamides happen to fit into the same receptor, considering their structures are quite different?<P>

<B>RM:</B> We assume that in space and in distribution of electronic charges the anandamides and the cannabinoids take up the same kind of structure. A few groups are using models to calculate the electronic densities and the structures of both types of compounds in space and to compare them. However, as yet no definite answer has been provided.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Are the relative affinities of cannabinoids and anandamides and their receptors about the same?<P>

<B>RM:</B> Anandamides and THC have more or less the same affinity for the receptor. There are synthetic cannabinoids which are a hundred and maybe a thousand times more active than THC. But that is irrelevant, THC and anandamide are not very potent, but then the body does not want very potent compounds. It wants compounds with intermediate potency, because if the potency is very high and there is a chance increase of the compound the body will go into stress. Changes in the body are usually gradual so one does not need very active compounds in the body. This is of course a generalization which does not aply to all body constituents as there are some compounds present in the body which act at extremely low concentrations.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Do you think there is sufficient research into cannabinoids and will cannabinoids play a significant role in the future of therapeutic medicine? If so, for what indications?<P>

<B>RM:</B> After the identification of delta-9-THC as the active component of Cannabis there was a huge wave of research in chemistry, pharmacology and clinical aspects dealing with this plant constituent. Many thousands of papers were published on it. By the late 1970s research started slowing down as the mode of action was not clear at all. With the discovery of receptors and of endogenous ligands interest has very much increased and numerous new laboratories are working on various aspects. We can expect in the future clarification of many of the problems associated with cannabinoid activity and possibly advances in the field of therapeutics. So far the only cannabinoid which has been legalized is THC for use in cases of vomiting due to cancer chemotherapy. THC has also been used for a few other things like appetite stimulation (in cases of AIDS) as well as in glaucoma. There is also illegal use in some  neurological diseases such as spasticity in multiple sclerosis and even in asthma. In the past several companies worked on synthetic cannabinoids as analgetics or in reduction of blood pressure but these projects were terminated. The synthetic compounds produced still caused psychotropic effects which were unacceptable. In the last few years we have synthesized and widely tested a cannabinoid, HU-211, which causes none of the typical psychotropic cannabinoid effects but is a blocker of the action of the stimulatory transmitter glutamic acid, in particular on one of its subreceptors named NMDA. This receptor is involved in stimulatory activity. However, during trauma it causes excessive opening of ion channels in many cells in the vicinity of the trauma. This introduces large amounts of calcium ions into the cells and they may die. Blocking this activity is of considerable potential importance in cases of trauma and possibly stroke, and a company with which we are associated is developing HU-211 as an anti-trauma agent. We expect to start human testing within a few months.The discovery of anandamide has apparently stimulated interest in several pharmaceutical companies. I am aware of a Japanese company which is working in the field as well as a French one. Apparently the French company has discovered an antagonist to anandamide - the first ever described antagonist in the cannabinoid series. They are about to present it at a forthcoming meeting.<P>

<B> DP:</B> Do you see the very limited use of cannabinoids in medicine as the result of their intrinsic medicinal value or as the result of the restrictions surrounding them?<P>

<B>RM:</B> In the past most companies  refrained from working on cannabinoids mostly  because of the legal restrictions. It seems reasonable to expect that as at the moment there are no such legal restrictions concerning anandamides it will be easier for companies to start projects in this field. I expect that such research projects will be mostly in the neurological area and possibly in inflammation research and immunology. This assumption is based on the high concentrations of the cannabinoid receptor in the basal ganglia - an area involved in coordination of movement and the peripheral receptor being in the spleen - an organ of immune importance.  <P>

<B>DP:</B> Do you think new delivery systems would help cannabinoid therapeutics gain more acceptance?<P>

<B>RM: </B>Definitely. One delivery system which has not been investigated is the aerosol system. People smoke cannabinoids, this is the best way of getting them into the body, and getting them to act fast. And in asthma for example, THC is known to be a bronchodilator. So if people want to use a compound against asthma, obviously they will prefer inhalation rather than any other way and very little work has been done in this area. <P>

<B>DP:</B> Was THC patentable at the time of your discovery? Why didn't you patent its synthesis?<P>

<B>RM:</B> We didn't patent THC as it was of no apparent medical use. One cannot patent compounds which have no practical use. <P>

<B>DP:</B> I'm thinking now of the Unimed use of this as a pharmaceutical.<P>

<B>RM:</B> We didn't patent the synthesis either. I had asked my university authorities about this and they decided against it. There was no apparent practical use of THC or its synthesis. On the other hand we should have patented the major cannabinoid metabolite - THC-11-oic-acid which we identified and synthesized in 1972. This acid stays in the body for a very long time and most tests of cannabinoid use look for the presence of this acid rather than for THC itself. Numerous radio immuno assays are based on this acid  and we realize now that it was foolish not to patent it.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Is this approach basically a reflection of your background, which is academic rather than industrial?<P>

<B>RM: </B>Yes, now we patent quite a few things, we patented HU-211 and that's why a company was willing to take it over. We now patent quite a few more compounds, but at that time we didn't and it is a pity, and the university lost a lot of money.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Is there any relatively unknown  or unusual Cannabis research, past or present, that deserves a wider mention?<P>

<B>RM:</B> Well, if you look at what is going on now, there is a huge amount of research going in all kind of directions. For example, groups working on the immune system may be using the receptor in the spleen. Research goes into subjects like emotions, asking why does Cannabis do what it does? People are looking into schizofrenia and finding some unusual things, some relationship between cannabinoids and schizofrenia, I think it has to do with the receptor. Even though all these things are not well defined, I am under the impression that there is a burst of research in many directions. Where that will lead I don't know. I think that the most promising approach is to look into neurological problems, coordination of movement and things of that sort.<P>

<B>DP:</B> So the cannabinoids serve less as prototypes for drugs per se, but rather as probes of the systems, which other drugs may be later able to affect.<P>

<B>RM:</B> Many if not most drugs used today are really structural modifications of natural products, be they plant products of known therapeutic value, or hormones, or transmitters. In most cases the new drugs have less side effects than the natural product. I expect that this is going to happen with the cannabinoids and anandamides. Academic and industrial research groups will probably try to modify these molecules in order to minimize the side effects as well as to make the compounds more specific. This is what we did with HU-211 and this is probably going to be done with these compounds in other fields as well.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Is there anything else you may want to add to any of the previous questions?<P>

<B>RM:</B> Research in the last 20 years has shown that Cannabis differs from most other illicit drugs - it is not a major addictive agent and it seems to act through mechanisms which are quite different from those of the opiates and cocaine.  Hence investigations in this field may lead us into understanding of very basic problems in biology such as memory and emotions. There are few tools for work in these areas and any additional one may be of great importance. The National Institute of Drug Abuse of the USA which is the major granting agency in the field of drug abuse is looking into cannabinoids with great interest now and this will be of considerable help. I would like to mention that the United Nations which has a huge budget devoted to drug abuse prevention does not support research at all. This is a strange situation and probably reflects the background of the officials dealing with drug abuse at the UN level. They view drug abuse as a social problem with little value of research for the solution of this problem. Too bad. <P>

<B>DP:</B> Would you say that the perceptions are changing as cannabinoids are seen less as a source of problems and more as a source of opportunity for exploration?<P>

<B>RM:</B> Right, you just put it down very well.<P>
<B>DP:</B> Sorry, I didn't want to put words in your mouth.<P>
<B>RM:</B> No, no, you just said it.<P>

"In 1824, domestic hemp was pitted against Russian hemp by rigging the USS Constitution on one side with 
American and the other with Russian grown hemp, 'and after being thus worn for nearly a year, it was found, 
on examination, that the Russian rope, in every instance, after being much worn, looked better and wore more 
equally and evenly than the American.' But the commander said, 'the difference between them was not so 
great as to warrant a declaration that the proof was conclusive in favor of the Russian....'"<br>

"The Federal Government in 1841 authorized a bounty, which allowed for the payment of not more than $280 
per ton for American water-retted hemp, provided it was suitable for naval cordage. Many of the planters 
prepared large pools and water-retted the hemp they produced. But the work was so hard on Negroes that the 
practice was abandoned. Many Negroes died of pneumonia contracted from working in the hemp-pools in the 
winter, and the mortality became so great among hemp hands that the increase in value of the hemp did not 
equal the loss in Negroes." <br>

"Several [varieties of hemp] are grown in this country, that cultivated in Kentucky and having a hollow stem, 
being the most common. China hemp, with slender stems, growing very erect, has a wide range of culture. 
Smyrna hemp is adapted to cultivation over a still wider range and Japanese hemp is beginning to be 
cultivated, particularly in California, where it reaches a height of 15 feet.  Russian and Italian seed have been 
experimented with, but the former produces a short stalk, while the latter only grows to a medium height. A 
small quantity of Piedmontese hemp seed from Italy was distributed by the Department in 1893, having been 
received through the Chicago Exposition...." <br>

"In Nebraska, where the [hemp] industry is being established, a new and important step has been taken in 
cutting the crop with an ordinary mowing machine. A simple attachment which bends the stalks over in the 
direction in which the machine is going facilitates the cutting...The cost of cutting hemp in this manner is 50 
cents per acre, as compared with $3 to $4 per acre, the rates paid for cutting by hand in Kentucky."  <br>

"The most important fact to be recorded in connection with the hemp industry during the past year is the 
successful operation of a machine brake in the fields of Kentucky. This machine breaks the retted stalks and 
cleans the fiber, producing clean, straight fiber equal to the best grades prepared on hand brakes, and it has a 
capacity of 1000 pounds or more of clean fiber per hour.  So far as we have any record, this is the first 
machine having sufficient capacity to be commercially practical that has cleaned bast fiber in an entirely 
satisfactory manner." <br>
USDA. 1905  Report of Office of Fiber Investigations. Bureau of Plant Industry. p. 145. <P>
 
"When the work with hemp was begun in Wisconsin, there were no satisfactory machines for harvesting, 
spreading, binding, or breaking. All of these processes were performed by hand. Due to such methods, the 
hemp industry in the United States had all but disappeared.  As it was realized from the very beginning of the 
work in Wisconsin that no permanent progress could be made so long as it was necessary to depend upon 
hand labor, immediate attention was given to solving the problem of power machinery. Nearly every kind of 
hemp machine was studied and tested. The obstacles were great, but through the cooperation of experienced 
hemp men and one large harvesting machinery company, this problem has been nearly solved. The hemp crop 
can now be handled entirely by machinery." <br>

293. p.5.<P>
 
 
 
"The organized hemp growers of Wisconsin, working in cooperation with the field agent of fiber 
investigations [Andrew Wright], have so improved the quality and standardized the grades of hemp fiber 
produced there that it has found a market even in dull times. The hemp acreage in that State has been kept up, 
although there has been a reduction in every other hemp-producing area throughout the world." <br>
USDA. 1921. Annual Report of the Department of Agriculture: Hemp. p. 46.<P>
 
 
 
"The crop of hempseed last fall, estimated at about 45,000 bushels, is the largest produced in the United States 
since 1859. A very large proportion of it was from improved strains developed by this bureau in the hempseed 
selection plats at Arlington and Yarrow Farms." <br>
USDA. Bureau of Plant Industry. 1917. Report of the Chief. p. 12.<P>
 
 
 
"Early maturing varieties, chiefly of Italian origin, are being grown at Madison, Wisconsin, in cooperation 
with the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station. This is the third year of selection for some varieties, and 
the results give promise of the successful production in that State of seed of hemp fully equal to the Ferrara of 
northern Italy." <br>
USDA. Bureau of Plant Industry. 1918. Report of the Chief. p. 28.  <P>
 
"The second-generation hybrid Ferramington, combining the height and long internodes of Kymington with 
the earliness and heavy seed yield of Ferrara, gives promise of a good fiber type of hemp that may ripen seed 
as far north as Wisconsin." <br>
USDA. Bureau of Plant Industry. 1919. Report of the Chief. p. 21. <P>
 
"The work of breeding improved strains of hemp is being continued at Arlington Farm, Va., and all previous 
records were broken in the selection plats of 1919.  The three best strains, Kymington, Chington and 
Tochimington, averaged, respectively, 14 feet 11 inches, 15 feet 5 inches, and 15 feet 9 inches, while the 
tallest individual plant was 19 feet. The improvement by selection is shown not alone in increased height but 
also in longer internodes, yielding fiber of better quality and increased quantity." <br>
USDA. Bureau of Plant Industry. 1920. Report of the Chief. p. 26. <P>
 
"In 1929 three selected varieties of hemp (Michigan Early, Chinamington and Simple Leaf) were grown in 
comparison with unselected common Kentucky seed near Juneau, Wis. Each of the varieties had been 
developed by 10 years or more of selection from the progeny of individual plants. The yields of fiber per acre 
were as follows: Simple Leaf, 360 pounds; Michigan Early, 694 pounds; Chinamington, 1054 pounds; 
common Kentucky, 680 pounds." <br>
USDA. 1929. Bureau of Plant Industry, Annual Report. p. 27.<P>
 
"The hemp breeding work, carried on by the Bureau for more than 20 years, was discontinued in 1933, but 
practical results are still evident in commercial fields. A hemp grower in Kentucky reported a yield of 1750 
pounds per acre of clean, dew-retted fiber from 100 acres of the pedigreed variety Chinamington grown in 
1934. This is more than twice the average yield obtained from ordinary unselected hemp seed." <br>

The New Deal Bureaucrats and their fellow "dollar a year" fiber racketeers of the War Production Board are 
now offering Hemp Marijuana (dope) narcotic to the American people instead of increased food production. 
The American people are footing the bill. <P>
In one of the most dastardly propositions ever "cooked" up the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the War 
Production Board are manipulating the proposition of a promotion and scheme to grow and produce hemp 
from a plant, outlawed by law, that is the fount of the insiduous [sic] drug known as Marijuana, the worst and 
most serious source of all (dope) narcotic evils afflicting children, in the schools and outside, and grown-ups 
alike in all walks of life. The fiber itself from this plant is worthless. The seeds from this plant fly far and wide. 
The resultant wild growth becomes dangerously uncontrollable. In the face of shortage and scarcity of labor, 
foodstuffs, linseed oil, fibers and other critical materials which are peculiarly being denied us, these corruptors
 [sic] of American life are now engaged in the promoting of 350,000 acres, erecting 100 buildings and building 
a large volume of equipment and machinery in a number of Mid-Western States for the production of this narcotic
 (dope) plant product, all of which must reach the staggering cost of $500,000,000 and end in catastrophic
 failure. A number of land-
grant educational institutions are in on this racket. The Commodity Credit Corporation and the War 
Production Board and the Defense Plant Corporation, through their own created socalled [sic] "War Hemp 
Industries, Inc., Agency," something new in the New Deal bureaucratic set-up, are running this (dope) 
narcotic show with private racketeers as undercover men. Large profits have been made already by them on 
the seeds by cheating and gipping [sic] the government. The financial "kill" is figured to be colossal for all the 
participants. The kill to agriculture, industry, (the choicest and most fertile land or soils are being demanded) 
and health and welfare of the American people is going to reach disastrous proportions from which recovery 
may never be found possible. Congressman Hampton P. Fulmer, Chairman, Agricultural Committee, and 
Congressman Paul Brown, overseeing the Commodity Credit Corporation, and certain other members of the 
Congress, among them Senators Harry S. Truman and Scott W. Lucas, and Donald 
M. Nelson, Chairman, War Production Board, and John R. Hutson, President of the government Commodity 
Credit Corporation, Agricultural Adjustment Administration, etc. (the latter active participant) are acquainted 
with the facts as are being described here and have been presented to them in detail. The power-pressure of 
the participants in this narcotic (dope) racket is obviously superior to the best interests of the American people 
even during these dangerous times of their sacrifices and sufferings at home and on the battle front. The truth 
of the above report is vouched for. Do you want this (dope) narcotic in your community? You are lined up for 
it. It is to be noted that increased acreage for guayule rubber has been stopped because of the acute food 
shortages but though rubber scarcities exist yet. <P>

NOTE:---This whole hemp marijuana racket will be dumped out of existence right after the war is over in 
accordance to with [sic] a statement from Washington, D.C., but obviously not before the "kill" in taxpayers' 
money has been made and the narcotic has been spread to dope them. <br>

<H3>Clean hemp pulp technology</H3>

<P>
At the Ukranian Pulp and Paper Research Institute (UPPRI) a new  ammonia-sulfite-alcohol drip percolation pulping technology has been developed on laboratory scale. Current pulping technology for bast fibre crops such as hemp and kenaf requires the separation of the stems into bast and core. The processes of removal, storage and utilisation of the core involve environmental and technical problems which had not been solved so far. The pulping of the bast encounters problems associated with the tendency of its long fibres to twist. 

The new drip percolation technology makes it possible to process the whole hemp stem into pulp. Costs for capital, energy and labour are less than with current technologies and environmental pollution is strongly reduced.<P>

The UPPRI wants to set up a pilot plant with a capacity of 7 ton/day of air dried pulp to further develop and optimize the new technology. The project will be partially financed from the institute's budget. The UPPRI is looking for parties interested in this project. A more detailed proposal is available at the IHA, or inquiries can be made to The Ukranian Pulp and Paper Research Institute: 18/7 Kutuzovstreet, Kiev 252133, Ukraine. <P>

<H3> Marijuana and driving ability</H3>
After alcohol, Cannabis is the drug which is found most often in the blood of drivers involved in road accidents. The effects of THC, the major psychoactive component of Cannabis, on driving ability have been investigated by Dr. H.W.J. Robbe at the Institute of Human Psychopharmacology of the University of Limburg in Maastricht, The Netherlands.<P>

In his PhD thesis, "Influence of Marijuana on Driving" (available through the IHA), which  Robbe defended on May 26, he concludes that marijuana is not a safe drug in traffic. After using marijuana drivers were less able to drive in a straight line. However, compared to the effects of alcohol and many medicines (antidepressants and sedatives) on driving ability, the effects of marijuana are not exceptional.<P>

The use of a moderate amount of marijuana did not affect driving ability, but the drivers thought their ability had been negatively affected. The use of a moderate amount of alcohol had a negative effect on driving ability, while the drivers thought their performance had not been affected.  The use of alcohol seems to stimulate risky behaviour, whereas the use of marijuana leads to a more prudent driving style. <P>
<HR>
<H3>Higher yields from late hemp</H3>
By growing very late-flowering  cultivars at a relatively low plant density, fibre hemp yields can be much higher than when using conventional cultivation techniques. This is the main practical conclusion from the research on fibre hemp conducted by Dr. H.M.G. van der Werf at the Research Institute for Agrobiology and Soil Fertility and the Agricultural University in Wageningen, The Netherlands.
<P>
In his PhD thesis, "Crop physiology of fibre hemp" (available through the IHA), which van der Werf defended on June 30, he concludes fibre hemp may be an interesting new crop. Traditionally fibre hemp is sown very densely (300-400 plants/m2), and harvested in August. By using late-flowering hemp cultivars and harvesting these at the end of September the growing season is longer and yields can be increased by about 30 %. <P>
Such late high-yielding hemp crops are not compatible with the traditional high plant density. As a result of severe inter-plant competition, many plants die during August and September in these late crops ("self-thinning"). As a consequence of the occurrence of self-thinning, in fibre hemp optimum plant density is lower when the yield is higher.

<p>The production of cannabinoids and their associated terpenes
in <em>Cannabis</em> is subject to environmental influences as
well as hereditary determinants. Their biosynthesis occurs in
specialized glands populating the surface of all aerial
structures of the plant. These compounds apparently serve as
defensive agents in a variety of antidessication, antimicrobial,
antifeedant and UV-B pigmentation roles. In addition, the more
intense ambient UV-B of the tropics, in combination with the UV-B
lability of cannabidiol, may have influenced the evolution of an
alternative biogenetic route from cannabigerol to
tetrahydrocannabinol in some varieties. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<em>

<p>Cannabis</em> may have been the first cultivated plant.
Records indicate use of this crop for paper, textiles, food and
medicine throughout human history (Abel 1980). It is a dioecious
annual with rather distinctive palmate leaves, usually composed
of an odd number of leaflets. Best growth occurs on recently
disturbed sites of high soil nitrogen content, so it is commonly
found as a persistent weed at the edge of cultivated fields.
Mature height ranges from 1 to 5 meters, according to
environmental and hereditary dictates. Typically, the male plant
is somewhat taller and more obviously flowered. These flowers
have five yellowish tepals, and five anthers that hang
pendulously at maturity, dispersing their pollen to the wind. The
female plant exhibits a more robust appearance due to its shorter
branches and dense growth of leaves and flower-associated bracts.
Its double-styled flower possesses only a thin, closely adherent
perianth, but is further protected by enclosure in a cuplike
bracteole (i.e., perigonal bract), subtended by a usually
monophyllous leaflet. A single achene is produced per flower and
shed or dispersed as a result of bird predation. The life cycle
of the male is completed soon after anthesis, but the female
survives until full seed ripeness. </p>

<p><em>Cannabis</em> seems a virtual factory for the production
of secondary metabolic compounds. A variety of alkanes have been
identified (Adams, Jr. and Jones 1973, De Zeeuw <em>et al.</em>
1973b, Mobarak <em>et al.</em> 1974a &amp; 1974b), as well as
nitrogenous compounds (ElSohly and Turner 1976, Hanus 1975b),
flavonoids (Gellert <em>et al.</em> 1974, Paris <em>et al.</em>
1975b, Paris and Paris 1973) and other miscellaneous compounds
(Hanus 1976a &amp; 1976b). Terpenes appear in abundance (Hanus
1975a, Hendricks <em>et al.</em> 1975) and contribute to the
characteristic odor of the plant (Hood <em>et al.</em> 1973) and
some of its crude preparations, such as hashish. The compounds
which comprise the active drug ingredients are apparently unique
to this genus and are termed cannabinoids. Cannabinoids were
originally thought to exist as the phenolic compounds, but later
research (Fetterman <em>et al.</em> 1971a, Masoud and Doorenbos
1973, Small and Beckstead 1973, Turner <em>et al.</em> 1973b) has
indicated their existence predominantly in the form of carboxylic
acids which decarboxylate readily with time (Masoud and Doorenbos
1973, Turner <em>et al.</em> 1973b), upon heating (De Zeeuw <em>et
al.</em> 1972a, Kimura and Okamoto 1970) or in alkaline
conditions (Grlic and Andrec 1961, Masoud and Doorenboos 1973).
There are over 60 of these type compounds present in the plant
(Turner <em>et al.</em> 1980). </p>

<p>Much has been published concerning the influence of heredity
on cannabinoid production (e.g., Fetterman <em>et al.</em> 1971b,
Small and Beckstead 1973), but ecological factors have long been
thought to have an important influence by stressing the <em>Cannabis</em>
plant (Bouquet 1950). The resultant increased biosynthesis of the
cannabinoid and terpene containing resin, in most cases, seems
likely of advantage to the organism in adapting it to a variety
of survival-threatening situations. This work reviews these
biotic and abiotic challenges and speculates on the utility of <em>Cannabis</em>
resin to the plant. </p>

<h3>Anatomical distribution and biogenesis of the cannabinoids</h3>

<p>The major sites of cannabinoid production appear to be
epidermal glands (Fairbairn 1972, Hammond and Mahlberg 1973,
Lanyon <em>et al.</em> 1981, Malingre <em>et al.</em> 1975) which
exhibit a marked variation in size, shape and population density,
depending on the anatomical locale examined. While there are no
published reports of glands present on root surfaces, most of the
aerial parts possess them, along with non-glandular trichomes (De
Pasquale <em>et al.</em> 1974). These epidermal glands seem to
fall into two broad categories: stalked and sessile. The stalked
gland (Fig. 1, front page) can consist of a single cell or small
group of cells arranged in a rosette on a single or multicellular
pedestal. Lack of thorough ontogenetic study has led to the
speculation that some of this variation may be attributable to
observation of various developmental stages (Ledbetter and
Krikorian 1975). The sessile gland possesses no stalk and has
secretory cells located at or below the epidermal surface
(Fairbairn 1972). In either case, the glandular cells are covered
with a &quot;sheath&quot; under which the resins are secreted via
vesicles (Mahlberg and Kim 1992). This sheath consists of a
cuticle that coats a polysaccharide layer (presumed cellulose)
originating from the primary cell wall (Hammond and Mahlberg
1978). The resins accumulate until the sheath bulges away from
the secretory cells, forming a spheroid structure. The resin is
then released by rupture of the membrane or through pores in its
surface (De Pasquale 1974). The cannabinoid content of each plant
part varies, paralleling observable gland distribution (Fetterman <em>et
al.</em> 1971, Honma <em>et al.</em> 1971a &amp; 1971b, Kimura
and Okamoto 1970, Ohlsson <em>et al.</em> 1971, Ono <em>et al.</em>
1972), although Turner <em>et al.</em> (1978) have disagreed.
Roots contain only trace amounts. Stalks, branches and twigs have
greater quantities, although not as much as leaf material.
Vegetative leaf contains varying quantities depending on its
position on the plant: lower leaves possessing less and upper
ones more. Leaf glands are most dense on the abaxial (underside)
surface. The greatest amount of cannabinoids is found in the new
growth near each apical tip (Kimura and Okamoto 1970, Steinberg <em>et
al.</em> 1975), although Ono <em>et al.</em> (1972) seem to
differ on this point. This variation in leaf gland placement may
be due to either loss of glands as the leaf matures or a greater
the endowment of glands on leaves successively produced as the
plant matures. Additional study on this point is required. </p>

<p>Once sexual differentiation has occurred, the generation of
female reproductive organs and their associated bracts increases
total plant cannabinoid content. Bracts subtending the female
flowers contain a greater density of glands than the leaves. The
small cuplike bracteole (perigonal bract) enclosing the pistil
has the highest cannabinoid content of any single plant part
(Kimura and Okamoto 1970, Honma <em>et al.</em> 1971a &amp;
1971b). Second only to this is the flower itself (Fetterman <em>et
al.</em> 1971b). Since it has no reported epidermal gland
structures, the cannabinoids present must be due to either
undiscovered production sites or simple adherence of resin from
the inner surface of its intimately associated bracteole. This
conjecture is supported by the finding that the achenes do not
contain substantial amounts of the cannabinoids (Fetterman <em>et
al.</em> 1971b, Ono <em>et al.</em> 1972). Reproductive
structures of the male plant are also provided with greater
concentrations of the cannabinoids (Fetterman <em>et al.</em>
1971b, Ohlsson <em>et al.</em> 1971). Stalked glands have been
observed covering the tepal, with massively stalked glands
occurring on the stamen filament (Dayanadan and Kaufman 1976). In
addition, rows of very large sessile glands are found situated in
grooves on the anther itself (Dayanadan and Kaufman 1976,
Fairbairn 1972) and apparently provide the pollen with a
considerable cannabinoid content (Paris <em>et al.</em> 1975a). </p>

<p><em>Delta</em>-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the cannabinoid
responsible for the main psychoactive effects of most <em>Cannabis</em>
drug preparations (Mechoulam 1970). In some varieties of <em>Cannabis</em>,
additional cannabinoid homologs appear that have the usual pentyl
group attached to the aromatic ring, replaced by a propyl (De
Zeeuw <em>et al.</em> 1972b &amp; 1973a, Fetterman and Turner
1972, Gill 1971, Gill <em>et al.</em> 1970, Merkus 1971, Vree <em>et
al.</em> 1972a, Turner <em>et al.</em> 1973a) or occasionally a
methyl group (Vree <em>et al.</em> 1971 &amp; 1972b). Other
claims have been made for butyl (Harvey 1976) or heptyl (Isbell
1973) substitutions, but the latter announcement seems
particularly tenuous. THC is thought to be produced by the plant
(Fig. 2, next page) from cannabidiol (CBD) which, in turn, is
derived from cannabigerol (CBG) generated from non-cannabinoid
precursors (Hammond and Mahlberg 1994, Shoyama <em>et al.</em>
1984, Turner and Mahlberg 1988). CBG is also the biogenetic
precursor of cannabichromene (CBC). Some of the cannabinoids
(e.g., cannabielsoin, cannabinol, and cannabicyclol) are probably
degradation products of the enzymatically produced cannabinoids
(e.g., CBD, THC and CBC, respectively). </p>

<h2>Cannabinoids and environmental stress</h2>

<h3>Desiccation</h3>

<p>THC is a viscous hydrophobic oil (Garrett and Hunt 1974) that
resists crystallization (Gaoni and Mechoulam 1971) and is of low
volatility (Adams <em>et al.</em> 1941). Since the sticky resins
produced and exuded on the surface of the plant are varying
combinations of THC, other cannabinoids and a variety of
terpenes, they can be seen as analogous to the waxy coatings of
the cacti and other succulents that serve as a barrier to water
loss in dry environments. </p>

<p>Bouquet (1950) has mentioned that the western side of
Lebanon's mountainous <em>Cannabis</em> growing areas is less
favorable for resin production because of humid sea winds. De
Faubert Maunder (1976) also observed that the copious separable
resin needed for hashish production occurs only &quot;in a belt
passing from Morocco eastwards, taking in the Mediterranean area,
Arabia, the Indian sub-continent and ending in Indo-China.&quot;
These are mostly areas notable for their sparse rainfall, low
humidity and sunny climate. Is it merely coincidence that resin
is produced according to this pattern, as well? </p>

<p>Experimental evidence is accumulating that reinforces these
notions. Sharma (1975) reported a greater glandular trichome
density on leaves of <em>Cannabis</em> growing in xeric
circumstances. Paris <em>et al.</em> (1975a) have demonstrated a
marked increase in the cannabinoid content of <em>Cannabis</em>
pollen with decreased humidity. Murari <em>et al.</em> (1983)
grew a range of <em>Cannabis</em> fiber cultivars in three
climatic zones of Italy and found higher THC levels in those
plants grown in the drier &quot;continental&quot; (<em>versus</em>
&quot;maritime&quot;) climate. Hakim <em>et al.</em> (1986)
report that CBD-rich English <em>Cannabis</em> devoid of THC
produced significant amounts of THC and less CBD, when grown in
the Sudan. This trend was accentuated in their next generation of
plants. </p>

<p>Haney and Kutscheid (1973) have shown significant correlations
of plant cannabinoid content with factors affecting soil moisture
availability: content of clay or sand, percent slope of plot, and
competition from surrounding vegetation. In some cases, this last
factor was noted to have induced a stunted plant with
&quot;disproportionally smaller roots&quot;, which would tend to
increase both the frequency and severity of desiccation stress. </p>

<p>In a study of 10 Kansas locations, Latta and Eaton (1975)
found wide differences in plant cannabinoid content, observing
that &quot;<em>delta</em>-9-THC ranged from 0.012 to 0.49% and
generally increased as locations became less favorable for plant
growth, suggesting increased plant stress enhanced <em>delta</em>-9-THC
production.&quot; Mention was also made of a positive correlation
between competing vegetation and THC content. Although the
sampling area was not considered very moisture deficient, they
speculated that &quot;Greater difference among locations might
have been observed under drought conditions.&quot; </p>

<h3>Temperature </h3>

<p>Temperature may play a role in determining cannabinoid
content, but perhaps only through its association with moisture
availability. Boucher <em>et al.</em> (1974) reported an increase
in cannabinoid content with temperature (32o C. <em>vs.</em> 22o
C.), however, some variables such as increased water loss due to
accelerated evaporation and plant transpiration at high
temperatures were left unaccounted. In contrast, Bazzaz <em>et
al.</em> (1975), using 4 <em>Cannabis</em> ecotypes of both
tropical and temperate character, demonstrated a definite
decrease in cannabinoid production with increased temperature
(32o C. <em>vs.</em> 23o C.). Later studies by Braut-Boucher
(1980) on clones of 2 strains from South Africa revealed a more
complex pattern of biosynthesis according to strain, gender and
chemical homologue produced. Clearly, further study of this
parameter is needed. </p>

<h3>Soil Nutrients</h3>

<p>Mineral balance seems to influence cannabinoid production.
Krejci (1970) found increases related to unspecified &quot;poor
soil conditions&quot;. Haney and Kutcheid (1973) have shown the
influence of soil K, P, Ca and N concentrations on Illinois <em>Cannabis</em>.
They report a distinctly negative correlation between soil K and
plant <em>delta</em>-9-THC content, although K-P interaction, N
and Ca were positively correlated with it. These minerals were
also shown to affect the production of CBD, <em>delta</em>-8-THC
and cannabinol (CBN), although the latter two compounds are now
thought to be spontaneous degradation products of <em>delta</em>-9-THC.
Kaneshima <em>et al.</em> (1973) have demonstrated the importance
of optimal Fe levels for plant synthesis of THC. Latta and Eaton
(1975) reported Mg and Fe to be important for THC production,
suggesting that these minerals may serve as enzyme co-factors.
Coffman and Gentner (1975) also corroborated the importance of
soil type and mineral content, and observed a significant
negative correlation between plant height at harvest and THC
levels. Interestingly, Marshman <em>et al.</em> (1976) report
greater amounts of THC in Jamaican plants growing in
&quot;organically&quot; enriched (<em>vs.</em> artificially
fertilized) soils. </p>

<h3>Insect predation</h3>

<p>Wounding of the plant has been employed as a method to
increase resin production (Emboden 1972). This increase may be a
response to desiccation above the point of vascular disruption.
Under natural circumstances, wounding most often occurs as a
result of insect attack. This is a source of environmental stress
which the production of terpenes and cannabinoids may be able to
minimize. <em>Cannabis</em> is subject to few predators (Smith
and Haney 1973, Stannard <em>et al.</em> 1970) and has even been
utilized in powdered or extract form as an insecticide (Bouquet
1950) or repellent (Khare <em>et al.</em> 1974). Its apparent
defensive mechanisms include a generous covering of non-glandular
trichomes, emission of volatile terpenoid substances, and
exudation of the sticky cannabinoids. <em>Cannabis</em> is often
noted for its aromatic quality and many of the terpenes produced
are known to possess insect-repellent properties. Among these are
alpha and beta pinene, limonene, terpineol and borneol. Pinenes
and limonene comprise over 75% of the volatiles detected in the
surrounding atmosphere, but account for only 7% of the essential
oil (Hood <em>et al.</em> 1973). Consistent with glandular
trichome density and cannabinoid content, more of these terpenes
are produced by the inflorescences than the leaves, and their
occurrence is also greater in the female plant (Martin <em>et al.</em>
1961). </p>

<p>No insect toxicity studies using isolated cannabinoids have
been published to date. Rothschild <em>et al.</em> (1977) found
THC-rich Mexican (<em>vs.</em> CBD-rich Turkish) <em>Cannabis</em>
fatal to tiger moth (<em>Arctia caja</em>) larvae, but not
Nigerian grasshopper (<em>Zonocerus elegans</em>) nymphs.
Rothschild and Fairbairn (1980) later found that pure THC (<em>vs.</em>
CBD) sprayed on cabbage leaves, does repel the large white
cabbage butterfly (<em>Pieris brassicae</em>). </p>

<p>The cannabinoids may also serve as a purely mechanical
defense. A tiny creature crossing the leaf surface could rupture
the tenuously attached globular resin reservoirs of the glandular
trichomes (Ledbetter and Krikorian 1975) and become ensnared in
resin. A sizable chewing insect, if able to overcome these
defenses, would still have difficulty chewing the gummy resin,
along with the cystolithic trichomes and silicified covering
trichomes also present on the leaf. The utility of these
epidermal features as insect antifeedants is also inferable from
their predominant occurrence on the insect-favored abaxial leaf
surface. Although the above strategies represent a seemingly
sophisticated system, many other plants (Levin 1973) and even
arthropods (Eisner 1970) utilize similar defense mechanisms,
often employing identical terpenes! </p>

<h3>Competition</h3>

<p>Terpenes may also help to suppress the growth of surrounding
vegetation (Muller and Hauge 1967, Muller <em>et al.</em> 1964).
Haney and Bazzaz (1970) speculated that such a mechanism may be
operative in <em>Cannabis</em>. They further ventured that since
the production of terpenes is not fully developed in very young
plants, this may explain their inability to compete successfully
with other vegetation until more mature. The observation (Latta
and Eaton 1975) of increased THC production by plants in
competition with surrounding vegetation &quot;at a time in the
growing season when moisture was not limiting&quot;, may indicate
a stimulus for cannabinoid production beyond that of simple water
stress. </p>

<h3>Bacteria and fungi</h3>

<p>The cannabinoids may serve as a protectant against
microorganisms. <em>Cannabis</em> preparations have long served
as medicines (apart from their psychoactive properties) and are
effective against a wide variety of infectious diseases (Kabelic <em>et
al.</em> 1960, Mikuriya 1969). These antibiotic properties have
been demonstrated with both <em>Cannabis</em> extracts (Ferenczy <em>et
al.</em> 1958, Kabelic <em>et al.</em> 1960, Radosevic <em>et al.</em>
1962) and a variety of isolated cannabinoids (ElSohly <em>et al.</em>
1982, Farkas and Andrassy 1976, Gal and Vajda 1970, Van Klingeren
and Ten Ham 1976). CBG has been compared (Mechoulam and Gaoni
1965) in both &quot;structure and antibacterial properties to
grifolin, an antibiotic from the basidiomycete <em>Grifolia
conflens</em>.&quot; Ferency (1956) has demonstrated the
antibiotic properties of <em>Cannabis</em> seed, a factor that
may aid its survival when overwintering. Adherent resin on the
seed surface, as well as a surrounding mulch of spent <em>Cannabis</em>
leaves, may serve in this regard. </p>

<p>Some of the many fungal pathogens that affect <em>Cannabis</em>
include <em>Alternaria alterata</em> (Haney and Kutsheid 1975), <em>Ascochyta
prasadii</em> (Shukla and Pathak 1967), <em>Botryosphaeria
marconii</em> (Charles and Jenkins 1914), <em>Cercospora
cannabina</em> and <em>C. cannabis</em> (Lentz <em>et al.</em>
1974), <em>Fusarium oxysporum</em> (McCain and Noviello 1985), <em>Phoma</em>
sp. (Srivastava and Naithani 1979) and <em>Phomopsis ganjae</em>
(McPartland 1984). </p>

<p>While <em>A. alterata</em> attacks Illinois <em>Cannabis</em>
and destroys 2.8-45.5% of the seed (Haney and Kutsheid 1975), the
balance of these species are leaf spot diseases. McPartland
(1984) has demonstrated the inhibitory effects of THC and CBD on <em>Phomopsis
ganjae</em>. However, De Meijer <em>et al.</em> (1992), in
evaluating a large collection of <em>Cannabis</em> genotypes, did
not find a correlation between cannabinoid content and the
occurence of <em>Botrytis</em>. Fungal evolution of a mechanism
for overcoming the plant's cannabinoid defenses may be
responsible for their success as pathogens. Indeed, some have
been demonstrated to metabolize THC and other cannabinoids
(Binder 1976, Binder and Popp 1980, Robertson <em>et al.</em>
1975). </p>

<h3>Ultraviolet radiation</h3>

<p>Another stress to which plants are subject results from their
daily exposure to sunlight. While necessary to sustain
photosynthesis, natural light contains biologically destructive
ultraviolet radiation. This selective pressure has apparently
affected the evolution of certain defenses, among them, a
chemical screening functionally analogous to the pigmentation of
human skin. A preliminary investigation (Pate 1983) indicated
that, in areas of high ultraviolet radiation exposure, the UV-B
(280-315 nm) absorption properties of THC may have conferred an
evolutionary advantage to <em>Cannabis</em> capable of greater
production of this compound from biogenetic precursor CBD. The
extent to which this production is also influenced by
environmental UV-B induced stress has been experimentally
determined by Lydon <em>et al.</em> (1987). Their experiments
demonstrate that under conditions of high UV-B exposure,
drug-type <em>Cannabis</em> produces significantly greater
quantities of THC. They have also demonstrated the chemical
lability of CBD upon exposure to UV-B (Lydon and Teramura 1987),
in contrast to the stability of THC and CBC. However, studies by
Brenneisen (1984) have shown only a minor difference in UV-B
absorption between THC and CBD, and the absorptive properties of
CBC proved considerably greater than either. Perhaps the
relationship between the cannabinoids and UV-B is not so direct
as first supposed. Two other explanations must now be considered.
Even if CBD absorbs on par with THC, in areas of high ambient
UV-B, the former compound may be more rapidly degraded. This
could lower the availability of CBD present or render it the less
energetically efficient compound to produce by the plant.
Alternatively, the greater UV-B absorbency of CBC compared to THC
and the relative stability of CBC compared to CBD might nominate
this compound as the protective screening substance. The presence
of large amounts of THC would then have to be explained as merely
an accumulated storage compound at the end of the enzyme-mediated
cannabinoid pathway. However, further work is required to resolve
the fact that Lydon's (1985) experiments did not show a
commensurate increase in CBC production with increased UV-B
exposure. </p>

<p>This CBC pigmentation hypothesis would imply the development
of an alternative to the accepted biochemical pathway from CBG to
THC via CBD. Until 1973 (Turner and Hadley 1973), separation of
CBD and CBC by gas chromatography was difficult to accomplish, so
that many peaks identified as CBD in the preceding literature may
in fact have been CBC. Indeed, it has been noted (De Faubert
Maunder 1970) and corroborated by GC/MS (Turner and Hadley 1973)
that some tropical drug strains of <em>Cannabis</em> do not
contain any CBD at all, yet have an abundance of THC. This
phenomenon has not been observed for northern temperate varieties
of <em>Cannabis</em>. Absence of CBD has led some authors (De
Faubert Maunder 1970, Turner and Hadley 1973) to speculate that
another biogenetic route to THC is involved. Facts scattered
through the literature do indeed indicate a possible alternative.
Holley <em>et al.</em> (1975) have shown that Mississippi-grown
plants contain a considerable content of CBC, often in excess of
the CBD present. In some examples, either CBD or CBC was absent,
but in no case were plants devoid of both. Their analysis of
material grown in Mexico and Costa Rica served to accentuate this
trend. Only one example actually grown in their respective
countries revealed the presence of any CBD, although appreciable
quantities of CBC were found. The reverse seemed true as well.
Seed from Mexican material devoid of CBD was planted in
Mississippi and produced plants containing CBD. </p>

<p>Could CBC be involved in an alternate biogenetic route to THC?
Yagen and Mechoulam (1969) have synthesized THC (albeit in low
yield) directly from CBC. The method used was similar to the acid
catalyzed cyclization of CBD to THC (Gaoni and Mechoulam 1966).
Reaction by-products included cannabicyclol, <em>delta</em>-8-THC
and <em>delta</em>-4,8-iso-THC, all products which have been
found in analyses of <em>Cannabis</em> (e.g., Novotny <em>et al.</em>
1976). Finally, radioisotope tracer studies (Shoyama <em>et al.</em>
1975) have uncovered the intriguing fact that radiolabeled CBG
fed to a very low THC-producing strain of <em>Cannabis</em> is
found as CBD, but when fed to high THC-producing plants, appeared
only as CBC and THC. Labeled CBD fed to a Mexican example of
these latter plants likewise appeared as THC. Unfortunately,
radiolabeled CBC was not fed to their plants, apparently in the
belief that CBC branched off the biogenetic pathway at CBD and
dead ended. Their research indicated that incorporation of
labeled CBG into CBD or CBC was age dependent. Vogelman <em>et
al.</em> (1988) likewise report that the developmental stage of
seedlings, as well as their exposure to light, affects the
occurrence of CBG, CBC or THC in Mexican <em>Cannabis</em>. No
CBD was reported. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Although the chemistry of <em>Cannabis</em> has come under
extensive investigation, more work is needed to probe the
relationship of its resin to biotic and abiotic factors in the
environment. Glandular trichomes are production sites for the
bulk of secondary compounds present. It is probable that the
cannabinoids and associated terpenes serve as defensive agents in
a variety of antidessication, antimicrobial, antifeedant and UV-B
pigmentation roles. UV-B selection pressures seem responsible for
the distribution of THC-rich <em>Cannabis</em> varieties in areas
of high ambient radiation, and may have influenced the evolution
of an alternate biogenetic pathway from CBG to THC in some of
these strains. Though environmental stresses appear to be a
direct stimulus for enhanced chemical production by individual
plants, it must be cautioned that such stresses may also skew
data by hastening development of the highly glandular flowering
structures. Future studies will require careful and
representative sampling to assure meaningful results. </p>

<HEAD><TITLE>Dear Membership</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000" LINK="#0000FF" VLINK="#FF0000" ALINK="#FF00FF">
<H2>Dear Membership,</H2>
It has been an exciting 6 months since
publication of our premier issue and your response has been overwhelming.
Our membership has doubled, substantially advancing us toward
the goal of 1000 dues-paying members. This goal represents a financial
break-even point, enabling the IHA to become self-sufficient!
We suggest that all our present members send us a list of people
they consider good candidates for membership, and we will contact
them. Also, please show the first two issues of the journal to
libraries, universities or other institutions that you think might
be interested in subscribing to the JIHA, on a Sustaining Member
basis. Don't forget to send us your 1995 membership renewal fee
before March 31! Remember, all operating expenses and project
funding come from annual membership dues and the private donations
of a generous few.
<P>
We have received a lot of good publicity
around the world, having been mentioned or featured in articles
from Economic Botany (US), Farmers Weekly (UK), the Amsterdam
daily newspaper Het Parool, the Dutch national newspaper Agrarisch
Dagblad and the last 3 issues of Hemp World (US). Upcoming articles
about the IHA will appear in Diversity (US) and elsewhere. We
are also seeking funding from foundations, the Italian government
and the European Union, for support of our project to save the
world&iacute;s most extensive collection of hemp varieties, located
at the Vaviliov Research Institute (VIR).
<P>
Many prospective new members ask, "What
do I get for my annual membership fee, besides the journal?".
Your dues go towards initiation and support of many projects,
worldwide. Included are the following:
<P>
1. The aforementioned VIR project, with
activities expanded in 1994 to include grow-outs in Italy and
the Ukraine, as well as Russia. (See page 68 of this issue.)
<P>
2. Although not yet fully implemented,
the IHA is developing archives of live hemp seed lots (1-50 kg)
for every developed hemp variety available and a few native land
races, too. This gives researchers and entrepreneurs quick access
and enables them to avoid having to spend many months locating
and procuring these seeds. As a result, start-up projections will
be shorter for their pilot projects. We can also aid in locating
commercial amounts of most varieties.
<P>
3. The IHA is attempting to put the
world&iacute;s <I>Cannabis</I> literature (&gt;20,000 citations)
on a computer. First to come will be a simple title/author/journal-or-book
citation. Later, they will be annotated or abstracted. Finally,
their full text and illustrations will be included. The cost of
this will be very high (&gt;US$ 200,000) and there are copyright
problems to be worked out, but a feasibility study has been done
and the initial steps have been made. Included in this project
is translation of the entire VIR bibliography from the original
Russian to English. This project will forge a tool that we feel
will eventually become an indispensible part of every serious
<I>Cannabis</I> researcher&iacute;s information-access repertoire.
<P>
4. We are entertaining the idea of having
a convention of IHA members in the Netherlands, sometime in 1996,
as our membership rolls and funding permit. We are presently involved
in the upcoming BIORESOURCE HEMP events in Frankfurt, March 2-5,
1994 (see page 64).
<P>
A computer group in Luxembourg has offered
to distribute the JIHA over the Internet (USENET ALT.HEMP). This
is being done by other scientific publications (see <I>Scientific
American</I>, December 1994, pages 72-77). The advantages of having
more information accessable to more people are obvious, and may
well result in a larger membership. However, this may alienate
present dues-paying members. For the moment, as a trial, we will
display the VIR cover story of the JIHA Vol. 1, #1, along with
our Guide for Authors and the back cover displaying a membership
application, in an effort to increase membership and donations.
A compromise has been suggested that only outdated issues of the
JIHA be put on "The Net". Please let us know what
you think about this topic. We do care about your opinion!
<P>
Speaking of computers, an apology is
due to those who may have tried to contact us at our e-mail address.
Our computer has been "down" for many weeks. For
the present, the most reliable way to contact us is by fax or
via the good ol&iacute; post office. <BR>

<H2>Congratulatory</H2>
Congratulations on a journal, well done. The Journal of the International Hemp Association is the world&Otilde;s first authoritative organ on the economic botany of hemp. A peer reviewed journal offering a balanced blend of scholarly and newsworthy information, JIHA is destined to become the main vehicle of information critical to the renewed industrializaton of hemp. I recommend it as essential reading, whether one&#146;s interest is medical, economic, agricultural or general.

<H2>Australian</H2>

Australian Hemp Recource and Manufacture (AHRM) is a business recently formed in Brisbane, Australia. The ultimate objective of this business is to pave the way for broad acre planting of fibre hemp throughout the country.
<P>

In all the states and territories of Australia, <I>Cannabis</I> is classified as an illicit drug and as a consequence, <I>Cannabis</I> <I>sativa</I> seeds, plant material and various by-products are subject to legal prosecution. Slowly, Australians are waking up to the fact that selected varieties of <I>Cannabis</I> <I>sativa</I> have a very high agricultural value with absolutely no drug value.
<P>

Past endeavours to start a hemp industry in Australia have been clouded over by the highly volatile drug debate involving the decriminalisation or legalisation of marijuana. This debate has been running for several decades and appears to be no closer to a united resolution.
<P>

In the meantime, any importation of <I>Cannabis</I> seed is illegal and subject to extensive scrutiny (as experienced in the Tasmanian experiments, see JIHA, Vol. 1, #1).
<P>
As an initial step in the development of a hemp industry in this country, AHRM aims to challenge the blanket drug status of <I>Cannabis</I> <I>sativa</I>. We are asking the governments to distinguish between the drug and fibre varieties of the plant. This is certainly not a novel approach, as both the United Nations and the E.C. have recognised <I>Cannabis</I> <I>sativa</I> as an agricultural crop for a number of years. Understandably seed would be sourced by authorised bodies from registered fibre hemp seed companies that comply with international standards.
<P>
Once the two types of <I>Cannabis</I> <I>sativa</I> have been officially distinguished and recognised  hemp industry on a major scale will be the same as introducing any other major crop into this country. Fibre hemp will finally be disentangled from the drug debate where it logically does not belong.
<P>

<H2>Serious</H2>

I have received the premier issue of the Journal, and I am pleased to note the serious approach that you are taking; we certainly need much more solid research than we now have.
<P>
It is shameful that our approach to hemp use and abuse remains so puerile, ignorant and vindictive. We do need truthful information about responsible drug use and irresponsible drug abuse, of both licit and illicit drugs. We need to change the entrenched bureaucratic policies so totally committed to zero tolerance that police state environments are created. We need to change from repressive responses (police arrest, prosecution, and prison) to positive responses (education, decriminalization, treatment and rehabilitation) - no easy task, for it entails demonstrating that existing policies are counterproductive and only exacerbate a very sad situation. We seem unable to learn from history, but perhaps the generations to come can learn. And perhaps the Journal of the International Hemp Association can play a major role in effecting needed change of national and international policies. Good luck!

<p>de Maeyer, E.A.A. and W. Huisman,</b> <b>1994.</b> <b>New
technology to harvest and store fibre hemp for paper pulp</b>.
Journal of the International Hemp Association 1: 38-41.</p>

<p> After mowing fibre hemp in September, field-drying is
weather-dependent and therefore not reliable under Dutch weather
conditions. Direct harvesting can be done by field choppers
equipped with a row-independent header. Storage and preservation
of the wet material on the farm is possible under acid and
alkaline anaerobic conditions. No losses of cellulose were
measured, but fibre strength was decreased. Bark and core can
easily be separated by water flotation of the preserved chopped
stems. Decortication of the stems in the field was less effective
and would be more expensive. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In 1990, the Dutch government initiated a four year programme
to research the technical and economic feasibility of cultivating
fibre hemp for paper pulp. Both bast and core had to be processed
and the objective was to cultivate a crop with a maximum fibre
yield. This meant that harvest could not start before September
and that traditional harvesting methods might not be suitable. </p>

<h3>Available harvesting systems for tall fibre crops</h3>

<p>Fibre hemp is usually grown for textile fibres. For this
application, the strength, colour, softness and fineness of the
bast fibres are very important and harvesting technique focuses
on these aspects (for example, a retting process is necessary).
Because of the decreased demand for bast fibres, in most areas
the mechanization of bast fibre crops is not advanced. In the
Ukraine, hemp is mown and laid down in swaths to ret (van der
Werf 1994). In the USA, an experimental machine was developed to
cut kenaf. The stems were also laid down in a swath to ret or to
dry (USDA 1988). In Australia, sugar cane harvesters and field
choppers have been used to harvest kenaf for paper pulp (Wilkes <i>et
al.</i> 1969, Wood <i>et al</i>. 1978). Both types of machines
technically functioned well, but the harvest costs of a sugar
cane harvester were found to be much higher than those of a field
chopper. In the USA and Australia, initial attempts to start a
kenaf-processing industry failed.</p>

<p> In France, 6000 ha of fibre hemp is grown for processing into
paper pulp. Two harvesting systems are used, depending on whether
the seed is to be harvested or not (FNPC 1985). For the best and
highest fibre yield, the hemp is cut with a mower conditioner for
field drying in the third week of August. In about 4 days, the
moisture content is under 15% and the hemp is baled with a round
baler. However, if the seed is also to be harvested, the stem
tops are cut and threshed with a combine in the first week of
September. Subsequently, the crop is mown and laid down in a
swath to dry. With this second harvesting system the fibre yield
is much lower (depending on the cutting height of the combine)
and because of poor weather conditions in September, the fibre
quality can be lower. </p>

<h3>Research objectives</h3>

<p>From the beginning of the Dutch Hemp Research Programme, two
specific research topics were formulated. First, a system for
preservation and storage of the harvest was needed so as to
enable supply of pulp processing plants with fibres for the whole
year. Because hemp may not be harvested dry, many experiments
were performed concerning the preservation and storage of wet
hemp. Secondly, the processing of hemp into paper pulp demands a
separation of bark and core because these fractions differ
physically (fibre length and diameter) and chemically (cellulose
and lignin content) (Zomers <i>et al</i>. 1991). The separation
may be done as a harvest operation in the field or as a
preprocessing step of the pulping. The Institute of Agricultural
and Environmental Engineering (IMAG-DLO), together with the
Department of Agricultural Engineering and Physics of the
Wageningen Agricultural University, investigated these aspects to
determine the best processing chain in which harvest,
preservation, storage and bark/core separation are integrated. </p>

<h2>Materials and methods</h2>

<h3>Harvesting technique and preservation</h3>

<p>Field tests were carried out with a cutter bar, a mower
conditioner, balers, field choppers and a decorticator. All
machines, except the decorticator, are commonly used in other
crops. When relevant and necessary, minor adaptions were made to
make them suitable for hemp. The main objective of the field
tests was to learn and solve the difficulties in handling a fibre
hemp crop utilizing different techniques.</p>

<p> We investigated the possibility of wet preservation by
anaerobic storage. The hemp stems were cut in short pieces (1 cm)
and preserved in bottles of 1.5&nbsp;l capacity. After flushing
with nitrogen, the bottles were closed air tight. To create
different environments, we used the following additives: <i>Foraform </i>(Barenbrug
Holland BV), a silage additive consisting primarily (92%) of
formic acid; kitchen salt; sodium hydroxide; and <i>Silage
inoculant 1188</i> (Pioneer Hi-bred Nederland BV), a silage
additive containing <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> and <i>Streptococcus
facium</i>. After preservation, pH was measured of a 1:10 aquatic
extract. The cellulose and hemicellulose sugars and the lignin
were determined using an analysis derived from TAPPI-249 and
TAPPI-222 (de Maeyer and Huisman 1994). Bast fibres were cooked
for 1 hour in a 2% sodium hydroxide solution and the strength was
measured in a controlled environment (23<sup>o</sup> C, relative
humidity 50%) with a stelometer according to ASTM D-1445 (ASTM
1967). </p>

<h3>Separation of bark and core</h3>

<p>We used 3 methods to separate bark and core: decortication of
green stems in the field, sieving of chopped stems, and flotation
of chopped stems. The decorticator broke the core of whole stems
and beat the core pieces from the bark. The sieving and flotation
of chopped stems were done after a 6 month wet preservation
period. The sieve dimensions were 2 x 4 cm. With flotation, the
hemp was thrown into a bath of slow moving water in which part of
the pieces floated and the rest sank. By measuring bark and core
masses, we determined the efficiency of each operation. </p>

<h2>Results and discussion</h2>

<h3>Harvesting technique and preservation</h3>

<p>For storage of dry hemp, the moisture content must be less
than 15% to avoid fibre decay by micro-organisms. In France,
field drying takes at least 4 days for the crop to reach the
necessary dry matter (dm) content of 85%. Comparing weather data
from two Dutch and two French weather stations, we estimate that
in the Netherlands, on average, 6 days of dry weather in
succession are needed to have the hemp sufficiently dried. Based
upon data of the workability of the grain harvest (Portiek 1975),
in September for 9 out of 10 years, only 3.5 days are available
to harvest winter wheat with a moisture content below 24%. If the
moisture content of wheat is higher than 23%, it is not expected
that a mown hemp crop, lying on the ground, will reach the
necessary moisture content of less than 15%. So, in September,
the field drying period would be longer than 6 days for many of
the years and the crop would start dew retting. This would
decrease bast fibre strength (Hessler 1945, Robinson 1946). If
the crop stays wet, retting can even become rotting. So, we
concluded that field drying is not reliable in the Netherlands in
September.</p>

<p> Chopping of the standing crop is less weather dependent and a
field chopper with a row independent header can mow the crop
easily. Fewer problems occurred with a drum type chopper than
with a flywheel type chopper. To avoid blockages, the crop chute
must be smooth and without any augers or blind areas. The knives
must be sharp and the chopping length set short (6&nbsp;mm). To
handle hemp, great attention has to be paid to avoid bark
wrapping around rotating machine parts.</p>

<p> After chopping, the hemp has a dm content of 33%. Artificial
drying is too expensive, so we tried to preserve the hemp by
ensiling (wet anaerobic preservation). In corn or grass silages,
lactic acid bacteria consume available sugars and produce lactic
acid to yield a pH of 4.2. Then the product is preserved and no
further losses occur (McDonald <i>et al</i>. 1991). In hemp
silage, the pH did not drop to 4.2, even after addition of lactic
acid bacteria. The reason for this was lack of the necessary
sugars. Only 4 g of sugars per kg of stem dm were available and
based upon grass silage, about 75 g are needed for a sufficient
fermentation (Wieringa 1961). Despite the inadequate
fermentation, no cellulose or hemicellulose was lost in silage
(Table 1). Only with the addition of sodium hydroxide did some
hemicellulose and lignin dissolve. This was also shown by de
Groot <i>et al</i>. (1994). Impregnation of hemp core, during 30
minutes with 1 M sodium hydroxide at 20<sup>o</sup> C, removed
some xylan (the main component of the hemicellulose) and some
lignin.</p>

<p> It is important to maintain fibre strength when processing
the bast for paper pulp. Paper tensile strength is positively
correlated with the quantity and the quality of the bast fibres.
The bast fibre strength was best preserved in an acidic
(pH&lt;4.5) or alkaline (pH&gt;12) environment (Table 2).
However, even under these circumstances fibre strength decreased.
Because the control fibres, after 3 and 6 months, were not the
same (dry compared to frozen fibres), no clear results can be
given on the decrease of fibre stength in time. However, the big
difference between the data after 3 and 6 months' storage
indicate that fibre strength may be slowly decreasing, even in a
stable acidic or alkaline environment. More research is necessary
to determine how much this strength decreases and whether this
decrease can be stopped. </p>

<h3>Separation of bark and core</h3>

<pre>Figure 1 presents the results of decortication in the field and the separation of bark and core after chopping and ensiling, by sieving or by flotation. With decortication, the bark could not be cleaned well enough and still contained more than 40% of the core. About two thirds of this core was not attached to the bark. Bark and loose core should be easily separable by sieving since the size of the bark and of the loose core pieces greatly differ. The length of the core pieces ranged from 1 to 8 cm and the length of the bark from 0.5 to 2.5 m. The quantity of the remaining fixed core would be very difficult to reduce. It was clear that the quantity of fixed core mainly depended on stem diameter: the smaller the diameter, the higher the quantity of fixed core.</pre>

<p> With field chopping, the bark was not cut as short as the
core. The bark was very tough and the knives stripped some of the
bark from the core. So after chopping, about 90% of the mixture
consisted of clean bark and core pieces. This made it possible to
separate bark and core by sieving or flotation. Sieving of
chopped hemp resulted in a 'contamination rate' of both bark and
core of about 25%, since the size difference between the chopped
bark and core was not big enough to separate them by sieving.
With flotation, very clean bast could be collected, although some
bark floated because it stuck to a piece of core, resulting in
its collection with the core.</p>

<p> A disadvantage of decortication is the low processing
capacity. The costs would be high, approximately 110 Dfl per ton
of dm, especially because the machine only can be used in hemp.
Flotation seems most satisfactory and would cost approximately 5
Dfl per ton of dm. It is expected that a simple chopping
operation of the floating material can reduce the mass of bark in
the core. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<pre>Field choppers equipped with a row-independent header can harvest fibre hemp, but the sharpness of the knives and the throughput of the chopped fibres need special attention to prevent wrapping or blocking. The chopping operation loosens about 90% of the bark and core. Because the bark sinks in water and the core floats, flotation is an easy and effective separation method. This operation perfectly fits into a harvesting system with chopping and ensiling. In a system of cultivation, harvest and storage of fibre hemp, wet anaerobic preservation is the most uncertain factor for the supply of consistent good-quality fibres throughout the year. Acidic and alkaline preservation techniques seem to be the best methods, but more research is needed on these processes, with special attention paid to the observed decrease in fibre strength.

<p>McPartland, J.M., 1994. Microbiological contaminants of
marijuana</b>. Journal of the International Hemp Association 1:
41-44.</p>

<p> Use of marijuana as a medicament is on the rise. Many medical
marijuana users have a suppressed immune system, owing to their
disease or treatment. Herbal marijuana, whether field grown or
hydroponically cultivated, contains many microorganisms. Many of
these organisms may pose a threat to immunosuppressed
individuals. The microflora of marijuana is well described in the
literature. Similarly, the microflora that cause opportunistic
infections in AIDS patients is well documented. These separate
literatures are correlated with commentary, and methods for
detecting and eliminating microbial contaminants are discussed. </p>

<hr size="1" noshade>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug &quot;having no
medical use, with a high potential for abuse&quot; by the US Drug
Enforcement Administration. Nevertheless, a handful of US
citizens are permitted use of government-supplied &quot;medical
marijuana&quot; for a variety of ailments (Bowersox 1992).
Additionally, a large clinical trial utilizing marijuana in AIDS
patients has been approved in San Francisco (Doblin 1994).</p>

<p> Doblin and Kleiman (1991) document the widespread illicit use
of marijuana for medical purposes. Nearly half of the oncologists
polled by Doblin and Kleiman recommended that their patients
experiment with marijuana as a medicine. Many of these patients,
however, are immuno-suppressed, making them very susceptible to
opportunistic bacteria and fungi. Since hundreds of bacteria and
fungi are associated with the cultivation of marijuana
(McPartland 1991), possible microbiological hazards need to be
assessed.</p>

<p> A majority of the organisms associated with marijuana are
strictly plant pathogens. They cannot infect healthy humans. But
a subset of opportunistic plant pathogens are associated with
&quot;post-harvest&quot; or &quot;storage&quot; decay of
marijuana. These organisms may infect immuno-compromised
individuals and become opportunistic human pathogens.
Additionally, many opportunist organisms on plants produce
dangerous toxins and/or elicit allergenic reactions when inhaled.</p>

<p> Lastly, a handful of strictly human pathogens have been
isolated from marijuana, as contaminants. These agents are highly
infectious, and some also exude toxins. </p>

<h2>AIDS and opportunistic infections</h2>

<p>People with AIDS are immunosuppressed, and very susceptible to
infections. According to Bossche <i>et al.</i> (1990), the most
common infectious agents include viruses (cytomegalovirus,
hepatitis A &amp; B, herpes simplex), bacteria (<i>Mycobacterium</i>
spp., <i>Salmonella</i> spp.), fungi (<i>Cryptococcus neoformans,
Coccidiodies immitis, Histoplasma capsu-atum, Candida</i> spp.),
and protozoans (<i>Pneumocystis carinii, Toxoplasma gondii,
Cryptosporidium</i> sp.).</p>

<p> Bossche <i>et al.</i> (1990) also describe rare infections in
AIDS patients caused by opportunistic fungi &#151; <i>Aspergillus
fumigatus, Penicillium marneffei, Fusarium proliferatum,
Alternaria alternata, Mucor</i> sp., <i>Rhizopus</i> sp., <i>Curvularia</i>
sp., and <i>Bipolaris</i> sp.</p>

<p> Most of these organisms infect people <i>via</i> the
respiratory tract, or by oral-mucosal contact with contaminated
material. Inhaling a marijuana cigarette contaminated with any of
these organisms poses a risk. </p>

<h2>Microflora of marijuana</h2>

<h3>Viruses and protozoans</h3>

<p>Cates &amp; Warren (1975) associated marijuana use with an
epidemic of hepatitis B in Germany, but did not isolate the virus
from plant material. An outbreak of Hepatitis A in Washington
state was linked to consumption of Mexican marijuana, fertilized
with human excrement (Alexander 1987). No protozoans are reported
from marijuana in the literature. </p>

<h3>Bacteria</h3>

<p>Several bacteria species cited as present on marijuana are
human pathogens, and produce toxins: Taylor <i>et al.</i> (1982)
isolated <i>Salmonella muenchen </i>from illicit marijuana.
Ungerlerder <i>et al.</i> (1982) cultivated <i>Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae,</i> <i>E. agglomerans,</i>
group D <i>Streptococcus, </i> and <i>Bacillus</i> sp. from
marijuana supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA). Kurup <i>et al.</i> (1983) isolated several thermophilic
actinomycetes from marijuana cigarettes, including <i>Thermoactinomyces
candidus, T. vulgaris, </i> and <i>Micropolyspora faeni.</i>
These organisms, while not infectious, cause allergic pneumonitis
in hypersensitive individuals. </p>

<hr size="4">

<h3>Fungi</h3>

<p>In the popular press, Margolis and Clorfene (1975) and DuToit
(1980) describe molds colonizing marijuana in the United States
and South Africa, respectively. Surprisingly, both accounts
report the mold enhancing psychotropic effects of marijuana.
These publications initiated a fad among marijuana users, who
exposed their marijuana to molds in the hope of increasing the
potency of their crop.</p>

<p> The &quot;black weblike fungus&quot; described by Margolis
&amp; Clorfene (1975) suggests an <i>Aspergillus</i> species.
Chusid <i>et al.</i> (1975) cite <i>A. fumigatus</i> causing
pneumonitis in a patient who buried his marijuana in the ground
for &quot;aging.&quot; <i> </i>Llamas <i>et al.</i> (1978)
recovered <i>A. fumigatus </i> from marijuana owned by a patient
suffering allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Kagen (1981)
isolated several <i>Aspergillus</i> species from moldy marijuana,
including <i>A. fumigatus, A. niger </i>and <i>A. flavus. </i>Babu <i>et
al.</i> (1977) cultured <i>A. niger, A. flavus, A. tamarii, A.
sulphureus,</i> and <i>A. repens</i> from seeds in marijuana.
Schwartz (1985) isolated <i>A. niger</i> from the sinuses of a
marijuana smoker who suffered severe headaches. Llewellyn &amp;
O'Rear (1977) demonstrated aflatoxin production in marijuana
contaminated with <i>A. flavus</i> and <i>A. parasiticus.</i></p>

<p> <i>Penicillium</i> species have been isolated from marijuana
cigarettes by Kagen <i>et al. </i>(1983) and Kurup <i>et al. </i>
(1983). Babu <i>et al.</i> (1977) cultured <i>P. chrysogenum</i>
from <i>Cannabis</i> seeds. Bush Doctor (1993) reports isolating <i>P.
italicum</i> from marijuana stored with an orange peel at 0<font
size="1">o </font>C.</p>

<p> <i>Mucor</i> species have been recovered from marijuana by
Kagen <i>et al. </i>(1983) and Kurup <i>et al. </i> (1983). A
related zygomycete, <i>Rhizopus stolonifer,</i> was isolated from
damp marijuana by Bush Doctor (1993).</p>

<p> Babu <i>et al.</i> (1977) cultured several other fungi from <i>Cannabis</i>
seeds that, according to Bossche <i>et al.</i> (1990), may cause
opportunistic infections in AIDS patients. These include <i>Alternaria
alternata </i>and <i>Curvularia lunata.</i> McPartland (1983,
1991, 1992) recovered these fungi from <i>Cannabis</i> in the
field, plus a <i>Fusarium</i> spp. All these fungi produce
toxins. Ramrez (1990) reports four policeman contracting
histoplasmosis, caused by <i>Histoplasma capsulatum,</i> after
destroying a <i>Cannabis</i> field in Puerto Rico. </p>

<h2>Detecting contaminants in marijuana</h2>

<p>Cultivators and consumers of illicit marijuana identify
microbiological contaminants by several crude, but seemingly
effective, screening techniques (Bush Doctor 1993). Their methods
mimic those used by tobacco growers (Lucas 1975). </p>

<h3>Visual screen</h3>

<p>Contaminated marijuana often darkens in color and exhibits
changes in surface texture. Strands of white to pale-gray fungal
hyphae become visible in moldy material. Exposed to light, the
fungi sporulate, providing a &quot;fuzzy&quot; appearance.
Generally, <i>Rhizopus</i> and <i>Mucor</i> species produce
grey-black spores, <i>Penicillium</i> conidia are light
blue-green, and <i>Aspergillus</i> conidia are dark green-black. </p>

<h3>Olfactory screen</h3>

<p>Uncontaminated marijuana produces a minty or aromatic odor.
Once infested, the smell changes to a &quot;stale&quot; or
&quot;musty&quot; odor. Bush Doctor (1993) reports <i>P. italicum </i>producing
a lavender or lilac odor, and <i>A. flavus</i> &quot;smells like
a locker room.&quot; </p>

<h3>Temperature screen</h3>

<p>Contaminated marijuana undergoing rapid decay may feel warm to
touch. </p>

<h3>Fluorescence screen</h3>

<p>Bush Doctor (1993) screened marijuana for aflatoxin-producing <i>A.
flavus</i> with a UV-A lamp. Contaminated material fluoresces a
light green color. This screening method has not been tested by
other researchers (Llewellyn &amp; O'Rear 1977). </p>

<h3>Identification</h3>

<p>If any of the above screening tests is positive, the suspect
marijuana is discarded, without identifying the contaminant. If
identification is desired, the marijuana is either cultured or
bioassayed. Kurup <i>et al. </i>(1983) and Kagen<i> et al.</i>
(1983) provide the description of culture methods used to
identify microbiological contaminants.</p>

<p> Marijuana can also be tested with bioassay kits, to detect
specific organisms. These assays utilize ELISA (enzyme linked
immunoabsorbent assay) biotechnology. They are more sensitive
than cultures and much quicker, but also much more expensive.
Positive identification of microbiological toxins may require gas
chromatography (Rood <i>et al</i>. 1988) </p>

<h2>Eliminating contaminants</h2>

<p>Kurup <i>et al. </i>(1983) demonstrated that spores of <i>Aspergillus
fumigatus</i> and <i>Mucor</i> species survive in smoke drawn
from pyrolyzed marijuana cigarettes. Also, some microbiological
toxins are not degraded by combustion (Llewellyn &amp; O'Rear
1977).</p>

<p> Moody <i>et al. </i>(1982) evaluated waterpipes for smoking <i>Aspergillus-</i>
contaminated marijuana. They found only a 15% reduction in
transmission of fungal spores.</p>

<p> Levitz and Diamond (1991) suggested baking marijuana in home
ovens at 150<font size="1">o </font>C, for five minutes before
smoking. Oven treatment killed conidia of <i>A. fumigatus, A.
flavus</i> and <i>A. niger, </i>and did not degrade the active
component of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).</p>

<p> Ungerlerder <i>et al. </i>(1982) gas-sterilized marijuana
with a mix of 12% ethylene oxide and 88% dichlorodifluoromethane,
at 8.5-10 psi, for 4.5-5 hours. They report no loss of THC from
fumigation. But residues remain in air pockets of fumigated
material, posing another health hazard. They also sterilized
marijuana with high-dose Cobalt 60 irradiation (20,000 Gray Units
or less), again without THC reduction.</p>

<p> None of these methods, however, degrade microbial antigens.
Sensitized patients may still develop bronchospasm after smoking
treated material. Nor do these methods decompose microbial
toxins.</p>

<p> The best method of eliminating microbial antigens and toxins
is by exclusion. This requires careful attention by both
cultivators and consumers. Proper cultivation techniques should
eliminate human pathogens. Careful cultivation also excludes most
opportunistic plant pathogens. Particular attention is required
at harvest, to avoid damaging marijuana before it completely
dries. Flue-cured marijuana contains fewer opportunistic fungi
than air or sweat-cured crops. Sweat-cured <i>Cannabis </i>
(common in illicit marijuana from Colombia) maintains a
&quot;tradition&quot; of <i>Aspergillus</i> contamination (Bush
Doctor 1993).</p>

<p> Bush Doctor (1975) states that infestation by opportunistic
fungi cannot occur in plant material below 15% moisture content
(MC). Properly dried marijuana contains about 10% MC (material
below 10% MC becomes excessively brittle). The dried, unmanicured
marijuana, in small aliquots, can then be vacuum-sealed in
plastic pouches. This packaging differs from the marijuana
currently supplied by NIDA. NIDA supplies marijuana as manicured,
pre-rolled cigarettes, in tin cans (Chait and Pierri 1989).</p>

<p> Opening sealed pouches of marijuana reexposes the material to
contamination. Consumers must prevent marijuana from resorbing
moisture above 15% MC. Storage at freezer temperatures will not
protect marijuana above 15% MC. Placing a lemon or orange peel in
stored marijuana (to impart a &quot;pleasant bouquet,&quot;
according to Frank and Rosenthal, 1978) is discouraged, because
the peel may introduce <i>Penicillium</i> or <i>Aspergillus</i>
spp. into the stored marijuana. Contaminated material should be
discarded. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Many publications have described a variety of microorganisms
resident on marijuana. Nevertheless, most researchers remain
unaware of these hazards. Schwartz (1987) wonders if the source
of a young patient's <i>Curvularia lunata</i> sinusitis could be
from contaminated marijuana. Brummund <i>et al.</i> (1987) reply
that this is possible, but no <i>Curvularia </i>species have been
cited in the <i>Cannabis </i>literature. However, this was indeed
reported by Babu <i>et al.</i> (1977). More recently, another
Schwartz (1992) states, &quot;I am unaware of any report of non-<i>Aspergillus </i>fungal
contamination of marijuana cigarettes.&quot; The publications
cited herein, provide such reports.</p>

<p> Carefully cultivated and harvested marijuana harbors a
minimum of hazardous microorganisms. For added protection,
material must be screened for contamination before it is packaged
for use as medical marijuana. Since opportunistic infections pose
the greatest danger to immunosuppressed consumers, marijuana
should be sterilized, preferably by gamma irradiation. Lastly,
consumers must be given careful instructions to ensure their
marijuana does not become contaminated prior to use. </p>

This article concerns the effects of marijuana smoking on actual driving performance. It presents the major results of one laboratory and three on-road driving studies. The latter were conducted on a closed section of a primary highway, on a highway in the presence of other traffic and in urban traffic, respectively. This program of research has shown that marijuana produces only a moderate degree of driving impairment which is related to the consumed THC dose. The impairment manifests itself mainly in the ability to maintain a steady lateral position on the road, but its magnitude is not exceptional in comparison with changes produced by many medicinal drugs and alcohol. Drivers under the influence of marijuana retain insight into their performance and will compensate where they can (<I>e.g</I>., by increasing distance between vehicles or increasing effort). As a consequence, THC's adverse effects on driving performance appeared relatively small in the tests employed in this program.
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

After alcohol, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), marijuana's major psychoactive constituent,  is the drug which is found most often in the blood of drivers involved in road accidents. With some exceptions, epidemiological studies indicate the presence of THC in roughly 4-12% of drivers injured or killed in traffic accidents: for example, 10% in New York (Terhune 1982), 7% in New South Wales (Chesher and Starmer 1983), 8% in North Carolina (Mason and McBay 1984), 11% in D&#159;sseldorf (Daldrup <I>et al</I>. 1987), 10% in Tasmania (McLean 1987) and 11% in Ontario (Cimbura <I>et al</I>. 1990). The most recent data regarding the incidence of drugs in fatally injured drivers in the United States are available from a nationwide study conducted in 1990 and 1991 (Terhune <I>et al.</I> 1992): THC was found in only 4% of the drivers. This relatively low percentage may indicate a declining trend in the incidence rate of THC in fatally injured drivers in the United States, explainable by the declining prevalence of marijuana use throughout the 1980s (Johnston <I>et al</I>. 1992).<P>
These numbers are, however, inconclusive regarding THC's contribution to accidents because alcohol has been a severe confounding factor in all surveys of injured or killed drivers: generally 60-80% of drivers who were found positive for THC also showed the presence of alcohol. Another problem of these surveys is the common lack of sound control groups. To determine whether drivers under the influence of THC are overrepresented in accidents, the THC incidence in accident victims should be compared to the THC incidence in randomly selected drivers passing the same accident site at the same times and days of the week. This has been done for alcohol (Borkenstein <I>et al</I>. 1974), but not for THC.<P>
The lack of separate control groups has been circumvented by the use of a 'culpability index'. This index is the ratio of the percentage of drivers with detectable drug levels and deemed responsible for a traffic accident to that of drug-free drivers from the same sample who were likewise culpable. But results from this approach have not been consistent: three studies yielded a culpability index of about 1.7 (Warren <I>et al</I>. 1981, Terhune 1982, Donelson <I>et al</I>. 1985), two other studies failed to find a significantly elevated culpability index for marijuana users (Williams <I>et al</I>. 1985, Terhune <I>et al</I>. 1992). For this and other reasons given above, the independent contribution of THC to accidents remains exceedingly obscure. Several literature reviews, the most recent by Robbe (1994), have shown that the results from driving simulator and closed-course tests indicate that THC in inhaled doses up to 250&#160;&#181;g/kg has relatively minor effects on driving performance, certainly less than blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) in the range 0.08-0.10&#160;g%. In contrast to this, laboratory studies have repeatedly shown performance impairment occurring after inhaled doses as low as about 40 &#181;g/kg. These became large and persistent after 100-200 &#181;g/kg doses. Tracking, divided attention and vigilance test performance were particularly vulnerable to THC's effects. Assuming that both sets of results are valid for the particular circumstances under which they were obtained, they demonstrate that performance decrements obtained under the artificial and non-life threatening conditions in the laboratory do not automatically predict similar decrements in driving simulations that are closer to real-world driving. These conflicting results led, however, to opposing opinions regarding marijuana's effects on driving performance. Real-world driving studies were therefore warranted.<P>
Only one study (Klonoff 1974) had been conducted in actual traffic before the present research program started. In a city driving study, Klonoff assessed the effects of two THC doses, 4.9 and 8.4 mg, which are equivalent to 70 and 120&#160;&#181;g/kg for a 70 kg person. Aspects of subjects' driving performance were scored by a professional examiner. The results showed that subjects performed less competently when under the influence of the highest, but not the lowest dose. In particular, they scored lower on judgment and concentration scales. Several investigators, however, criticized the method used by Klonoff for measuring driving performance on the grounds that the examiners' reliability was never determined and that the scoring instrument had never been shown to provide measures related to driving safety (Moskowitz 1985, Smiley 1986). Furthermore, Klonoff administered relatively low THC doses to his subjects. The effects of high doses of THC on driving in real traffic still needed to be determined.<P>
The studies reported in this article were conducted to escape these limitations. First, the effects of low, moderate and high THC doses on highway driving were determined, both in the absence and presence of other traffic. Second, Klonoff's city driving study was replicated, with some modifications with regards to the employed procedures and with the addition of another group of subjects who undertook the same driving test but then under the influence of a low dose of alcohol.<P>
An important practical objective of the program was to determine whether degrees of driving impairment can be accurately predicted from either measured concentrations of THC in plasma or performance measured in potential roadside 'sobriety' tests of tracking ability or hand and posture stability. The results (Robbe 1994), like many reported before, indicate that none of these measures accurately predicts changes in actual driving performance under the influence of THC. 


<H2>General procedures</H2>
Subjects in all studies were recreational users of marijuana or hashish, <I>i.e.</I>, smoking the drug more than once a month, but not daily. They were all healthy, between 21 and 40 years of age, had normal weight and binocular acuity, and were licensed to drive an automobile. Furthermore, law enforcement authorities were contacted, with the volunteers' consent, to verify that they had no previous arrests or convictions for drunken driving or drug trafficking.<P>
Each subject was required to submit a urine sample immediately upon arrival at the test site. Samples were assayed qualitatively for the following common 'street drugs' (or metabolites): cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines and barbiturates. In addition, a breath sample was analyzed for the presence of alcohol using a Lion-SD3 breath-analyzer.<P>
	Subjects were accompanied during every driving test by an licensed driving instructor. A redundant control system in the test vehicle was available for controlling the car, should emergency situations arise.<P>
Marijuana and placebo marijuana cigarettes were supplied by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse. The lowest and highest THC concentrations in the marijuana cigarettes used in the studies were 1.75% and 3.57%, respectively.


<H2>Pilot study</H2>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The pilot study was conducted in a hospital under strict medical supervision to identify THC doses that recreational marijuana users were likely to consume before driving. Twenty-four subjects, twelve males and twelve females, participated. They were allowed to smoke part or all of the THC content in three cigarettes until achieving the desired psychological effect. Cigarettes were smoked through a plastic holder in a manner determined by the subjects. The only requirement was to smoke for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. When subjects voluntarily stopped smoking, cigarettes were carefully extinguished and retained for subsequent gravimetric estimation of the amount of THC consumed.

<H3>Results</H3>
	Six subjects consumed one cigarette, thirteen smoked two and four smoked three. The average amount of THC consumed was 20.8&#160;mg, after adjustment for body weight, 308&#160;&#181;g/kg. It should be noted that the amounts of THC consumed represent both the inhaled dose and the portion that was lost through pyrolysis and side-stream smoke during the smoking process. There were no significant differences between males and females, nor between frequent and infrequent users, with respect to the weight adjusted preferred dose. It was decided that the maximum dose for subsequent driving studies would be 300&#160;&#181;g/kg. This is considerably higher than doses that have usually been administered to subjects in experimental studies (typically, 100&#173;200&#160;&#181;g/kg THC).

<H2>Study 1: Driving on a restricted highway</H2>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The first driving study was conducted on a highway closed to other traffic. One objective of this study was to determine whether it would be safe to repeat the study on a normal highway in the presence of other traffic. The second objective was to define the dose-effect relationship between inhaled THC dose and driving performance. The same twelve men and twelve women who participated in the laboratory study served again as the subjects. They were treated on separate occasions with marijuana cigarettes containing THC doses of 0 (placebo), 100, 200, and 300&#160;&#181;g/kg. Treatments were administered double-blind and in a counterbalanced order. On each occasion, subjects performed a road-tracking test beginning 40 minutes after initiation of smoking and repeated one hour later. The test, developed and standardized by O'Hanlon <I>et al.</I> (1982, 1986), involved maintaining a constant speed at 90&#160;km/h and a steady lateral position between the delineated boundaries of the traffic lane. Subjects drove 22&#160;km on a primary highway and were accompanied by a licensed driving instructor. The primary dependent variable was the standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP), which has been shown to be both highly reliable and very sensitive to the influence of sedative drugs and alcohol. Other dependent variables were mean speed, and standard deviation of speed and steering wheel angle.

<H3>Results</H3>
	All subjects were willing and able to finish the driving tests without great difficulty. The study demonstrated that marijuana impairs driving performance as measured by an increase in SDLP; all three THC doses significantly affected SDLP relative to placebo. The driving performance decrement after smoking marijuana persisted almost undiminished for two hours after smoking. Marijuana's effects on SDLP were compared to those of alcohol obtained in a very similar study by Louwerens <I>et al.</I> (1985, 1987). It appeared that the effects of the various administered doses of THC (100&#173;300&#160;&#181;g/kg) on SDLP were equivalent to those associated with BACs in the range of 0.03-0.07&#160;g%. Other driving performance measures were not significantly affected by THC. Both the observed degree of driving impairment, and what subjects said and did, indicated that normal safeguards would be sufficient for ensuring safety in further testing. Hence, the final conclusion was to repeat this study on a normal highway in the presence of other traffic.


<H2>Study 2: Driving on a normal highway in traffic</H2>

<H3>Methods</H3>
	The second driving study was conducted on a highway in the presence of other traffic and involved both a road-tracking and a car-following test. A new group of sixteen subjects, equally comprised of men and women, participated in this study. A conservative approach was chosen in designing the present study in order to satisfy the strictest safety requirements. That is, the study was conducted according to an ascending dose series design where both active drug and placebo conditions were administered, double-blind, at each of three THC dose levels. THC doses were the same as those used in the previous study, namely 100, 200, and 300&#160;&#181;g/kg. Cigarettes appeared identical at each level of treatment conditions. If any subject had reacted in an unacceptable manner to a lower dose, he/she would not have been permitted to receive a higher dose.<P>
	The subjects began the car-following test 45 minutes after smoking. The test was performed on a 16&Ecirc;km stretch of the highway and lasted about 15 minutes. After the conclusion of this test, subjects performed a 64-km road-tracking test on the same highway which lasted about 50 minutes. At the conclusion of this test, they participated again in the car-following test.<P>
	The road-tracking test was the same as in the previous study except for its duration and the presence of other traffic. Subjects were instructed to maintain a constant speed of 95&Ecirc;km/h and a steady lateral position between lane boundaries in the right traffic lane. They were allowed to deviate from this only if it became necessary to pass a slower vehicle in the same lane. Data from the standard test were analyzed to yield the same performance measures as in the previous study.<P>
	The car-following test involved attempting to match velocity with, and maintain a constant distance from a preceding vehicle as it executed a series of deceleration/acceleration maneuvers. The preceding vehicle's speed would vary between 80 and 100 km/h and the subject was instructed to maintain a 50 m distance however the preceding vehicle's speed might vary. The duration of one deceleration and acceleration maneuver was approximately 50 seconds and six to eight of these maneuvers were executed during one test, depending upon traffic density. The subject's average reaction time to the movements of the preceding vehicle, mean distance and coefficient of variation of distance during maneuvers were taken as the dependent variables from this.

<H3>Results</H3>
	All subjects were able to complete the series without suffering any untoward reaction while driving. Road-tracking performance in the standard test was impaired in a dose-related manner by THC and confirmed the results obtained in the previous closed highway study. The 100&#160;&#181;g/kg dose produced a slight elevation in mean SDLP, albeit not statistically significant. The 200&#160;&#181;g/kg dose produced a significant elevation, of dubious practical relevance. The 300&#160;&#181;g/kg dose produced a highly significant elevation which may be viewed as practically relevant but unexceptional in comparison with similarly measured effects of many medicinal drugs. After marijuana smoking, subjects drove with an average speed that was only slightly lower than after a placebo and very close to the prescribed level.<P>
	In the car-following test, subjects maintained a distance of 45&#173;50&#160;m while driving in the successive placebo conditions. They lengthened mean distance by 8, 6 and 2&#160;m in the corresponding THC conditions after 100, 200 and 300&#160;&#181;g/kg, respectively. The initially large drug-placebo difference and its subsequent decline is a surprising result. Our explanation for this observation is that the subjects' caution was greatest the first time they undertook the test under the influence of THC and progressively less thereafter. The reaction time of the subjects to changes in the preceding vehicle's speed increased following THC treatment, relative to placebo. The administered THC dose was inversely related to the change in reaction time, as it was to distance. However, increased reaction times were partly due to longer distance. Statistical adjustment for this confounding variable resulted in smaller and non-significant increases in reaction time following marijuana treatment, the greatest impairment (0.32 s) being observed in the first test following the lowest THC dose. Distance variability followed a similar pattern as mean distance and reaction time; the greatest impairment was found following the lowest dose.


<H2>Study 3: Driving in urban traffic</H2>

<H3>Methods</H3>
	The program proceeded to the third driving study, which involved tests conducted in high-density urban traffic. There were logical and safety reasons for restricting the THC dose to 100&#160;&#181;g/kg. It was given to a group of regular marijuana (or hashish) users, along with a placebo. For comparative purposes, another group of regular alcohol users was treated with a modest dose of its members' preferred recreational drug, ethanol, or a placebo, before undertaking the same city driving test. Two groups participated, each composed of sixteen new subjects comprising equal numbers of men and women. Subjects in the alcohol group were regular users of alcohol, but not marijuana. Both groups were treated on separate occasions with the active drug and a placebo. Marijuana was administered to deliver 100&Ecirc;&#181;g/kg THC. The driving test commenced 30 minutes after smoking. The alcohol dose was chosen to yield a BAC approaching 0.05&#160;g% when the driving test commenced 45 minutes after onset of drinking. Active drug and placebo conditions were administered double-blind and in a counterbalanced order in each group.<P>
	Driving tests were conducted in daylight over a constant 17.5 km route within the city limits of Maastricht. Subjects drove their placebo and active-drug rides through heavy, medium and low density traffic on the same day of the week, and at the same time of day. Two scoring methods were employed in the present study. The first, a 'molar' approach, required the driving instructor acting as the safety controller during the tests to rate the driver's performance retrospectively using a standard scale. The second, a more 'molecular' approach, involved the employment of a specially trained observer who applied simple and strict criteria for recording when the driver made or failed to make each in a series of observable responses at predetermined points along a chosen route.

<H3>Results</H3>
	The study showed that a modest dose of alcohol (BAC = 0.034&#160;g%) produced a significant impairment in city driving, as measured by the molar approach, relative to a placebo. More specifically, alcohol impaired both vehicle handling and traffic maneuvers. Marijuana, administered in a dose of 100&Ecirc;&#181;g/kg THC, on the other hand, did not significantly change mean driving performance as measured by this approach. Neither alcohol nor marijuana significantly affected driving performance measures obtained by the molecular approach, indicating that it may be relatively insensitive to drug-induced changes.<P>
	Driving quality, as rated by the subjects, contrasted with observer ratings. Alcohol impaired driving performance according to the driving instructor, but subjects did not perceive it; marijuana did not impair driving performance, but the subjects themselves perceived their driving performance as such. Both groups reported about the same amount of effort in accomplishing the driving test following a placebo. Yet only subjects in the marijuana group reported significantly higher levels of invested effort following the active drug. Thus there is evidence that subjects in the marijuana group were not only aware of their intoxicated condition, but were also attempting to compensate for it. These seem to be important findings. They support both the common belief that drivers become overconfident after drinking alcohol and investigators' suspicions that they become more cautious and self-critical after consuming low doses of THC, as smoked marijuana.


<H2>Discussion</H2>

The results of the studies corroborate those of previous driving simulator and closed-course tests by indicating that THC in inhaled doses up to 300&#160;&#181;g/kg has significant, yet not dramatic, dose-related impairing effects on driving performance. Standard deviation of lateral position in the road-tracking test was the most sensitive measure for revealing THC's adverse effects. This is because road-tracking is primarily controlled by an automatic information processing system which operates outside of conscious control. The process is relatively impervious to environmental changes, but highly vulnerable to internal factors that retard the flow of information through the system. THC and many other drugs are among these factors. When they interfere with the process that restricts SDLP, there is little the afflicted individual can do by way of compensation to restore the situation. Car-following and, to a greater extent, city driving performance depend more on controlled information processing and are therefore more accessible for compensatory mechanisms that reduce the decrements or abolish them entirely.<P>
	THC's effects after doses up to 300&#160;&#181;g/kg never exceeded alcohol's at BACs of 0.08&#160;g% and were in no way unusual compared to many medicinal drugs (Robbe 1994). Yet THC's effects differ qualitatively from many other drugs, especially alcohol. Evidence from the present and previous studies strongly suggests that alcohol encourages risky driving whereas THC encourages greater caution, at least in experiments. Another way THC seems to differ qualitatively from many other drugs is that the former's users seem better able to compensate for its adverse effects while driving under the influence.<P>
	Although THC's adverse effects on driving performance appeared relatively small in the tests employed in this program, one can still easily imagine situations where the influence of marijuana smoking might have a dangerous effect; i.e., emergency situations which put high demands on the driver's information processing capacity, prolonged monotonous driving, and after THC has been taken with other drugs, especially alcohol. Because these possibilities are real, the results of the present studies should not be considered as the final word. They should, however, serve as the point of departure for subsequent studies that will ultimately complete the picture of THC's effects on driving performance.

In the course of the last 30 years, the amount of land used in hemp production area in the former USSR as well as present-day Russia has been incessantly decreasing. Prior to the disintegration of the USSR, hemp was produced on 50-60 thousand hectares. However, the reduction in crop acreage was basically due to a mistaken government economic strategy, in which they preferred to purchase hemp fibre abroad, spending the equivalent of over US $200 million per year instead of developing domestic production. This policy resulted in the absence of complex harvest and post-harvest mechanized procedures and in insufficient funding of hemp breeding programmes.<P>
Despite these constraints, a number of regions (Poltava, Oryol, Krasnodar, etc.) produced good yields of fibre (1.0-1.2 tons/hectare) and seed (0.6-0.8 tons/hectare).


<H2>Fiber varieties</H2>
Breeding also progressed. Conventional breeding techniques were applied: hybridization, followed by continuous family/group selection. In later stages of seed production, mass selection methods were used.<P> 
The unceasing 20 year systematic selection for higher fiber content, performed at the All-Union Research Institute of Bast Crops (in Glukhov, Ukraine), increased this parameter by 13.8%, achieving a total plant fiber content of 35-37% in a number of varieties.<P>
These breeding programmes were based on the accessions of the plant genetic resources collection of the Vavilov Institute (VIR). For instance, cv. Yuzhnosozrevayushchaya Odnodomnaya 14 (YUSO-14) produced by the Institute was bred by family/group selection methods on progeny from crosses of female YUSO-1 (VIR Cat. no. 429*) and pollen from the monoecious Bernburg hemp of the former East Germany. This resulting cultivar now covers nearly half of the present hemp production area of Russia and is fairly uniform in its sexual expression, monoecious pistillate hemp accounting for up to 90% of the plants. Agricultural production of this strain yielded 1.0-1.2 tons of fiber and 1.3-1.5 tons of seed per hectare.<P> 
Cv. YUSO-16 has been bred from the French monoecious hemp cultivar Fibrimon 56 (VIR 537*). This cultivar is notable for a low cannabinoid content and a long vegetative period. Average fibre yield is 2.0 tons/hectare and seed yield is 1.0-1.2 tons/hectare.<P>
Cv. Dneprovskaya Odnodomnaya 6, a southern hemp cultivar, has been obtained by hybridization of the Hungarian cultivar Szegedy 9 (VIR 437) with Fibrimon 56 (VIR 537*), followed by family/group selection. This cultivar has high fibre yield (31.5%) and a seed yield of 0.55 ton/hectare. Plant height is up to 2.5 meters. 


<H2>Low-THC varieties</H2>

One of the priorities for the next few years of hemp breeding may be to obtain cultivars without active drug substances. In the initial breeding phase, the recommended cultivars with low cannabinoid content will be YUSO-14, YUSO-16 and Dnepropetrovskaya Odnodomnaya 6. The next phase will be marked by developing the cultivar Yuzhnosozrevayushchaya Odnodomnaya (YUSO-31), which contains half the THC content and ripens 5-6 days earlier than YUSO-14, but gives the same yields. An even lower cannabinoid content has been noticed in cv. Zolotonozhskaya YUSO-11.<P>
In recent years, the Krasnodar Research Institute of Agriculture has accomplished a series of experiments on breeding southern hemp with an absence of active cannabinoids. Selection of southern hemp without cannabinoids has been closely linked to breeding for higher fibre content and yield. This breeding was based on the families identified by means of multiphase family/group selection in the hybrid Szegedy 9 (VIR 437) X Krasnodarskaya 56 with individual analysis of each plant for its seed weight, stem fibre content and flower cannabinoid content, followed by testing of the identified families. Ten phases of selection resulted in a dioecious cultivar of southern hemp, Kuban, having a vegetative period of 160 days, only 20% of the THC content of the Krasnodarskaya 35 standard, a fibre content of 28.3%, a seed yield of 0.35 ton/hectare and a plant height of 260 cm. This cultivar is being produced commercialy on an area of 3,000 hectares.<P> 
Hemp breeders mastered a method which made it possible to identify cannabinoid content by thin-layer chromatography of selected leaves from each crop during the period from budding to flowering. This led to the establishment of the Transpollination Direction Nurseries (TDN) where plants were discarded or selected in accordance with precise data on their THC contents. In 1990, application of this method resulted in such new cultivars as YUSO-42 and YUSO-45, with THC contents of 0.004 and 0.007%, respectively.<P> 
Recently, a rapid method for plant cannabinoid content analysis has been developed on the basis of a qualitative reaction, and this has now been introduced into practice. It takes just 10-13 seconds to analyze each plant in the field before budding. Thus it is now possible to discard cannabinoid-containing plants before budding, greatly increasing the efficiency of selection against this trait and allowing a wider range of initial breeding stock. It should be noted that breeding for the absence of cannabinoids is accompanied by strict control over commercially valuable traits, despite the fact that practically no interrelationship between yield and cannabinoid content has been established.

<H2>Seed varieties</H2>

Hemp is cultivated primarily for fibre production, but hemp seed is also important. Seeds contain approximately 30-35% oil, which is used widely for industrial purposes and in food production. Optimum ratios of the fatty acids depend on the purpose of the oil. Industrial utilization requires a quick-drying oil with a high content of polyunsaturated linoleic and linolenic fatty acids. These fatty acids are also highly desirable for human nutrition, but their chemical lability causes them to spoil easily in the presence of air and light. This imparts an unpleasant flavor to mishandled oils and requires special precautions to preserve oil freshness.<P> 
The Department of Industrial Crops of the VIR in cooperation with the Biochemistry Laboratory have analyzed 100 hemp accessions of different origins, including 48 domestic and 52 foreign varieties acquired by the VIR which are characterized by good fibre quality and low drug content. Plantings were performed in the fields of the Ustimovka Experimental Station of the VIR (Poltava Province, 1983-1985). In spite of the plant varieties being from widely diverse origins, the variability in their seed fatty acid content was not large. Average data reported for three years revealed that palmitic content varied from 5.8 to 7.4%, stearic acid from 1.6 to 3.0%, oleic acid from 10.6 to 15.3%, linoleic acid from 55.6 to 59.5%, and linolenic acid from 16.2-24.3%.<P> 
Relatively high in linoleic acid (over 22%) were the accessions from Uzbekistan (VIR 455*), Armenia (VIR 482), Hungary (VIR 548*), and the cultivars Maikopskaya 1 (VIR 491*), Dneprovskaya 4 (VIR 510), Dneprovskaya 5 (VIR 511). High oil content (over 35%) was identified in the accessions from Daghestan (VIR 524), Karachaevo-Cherkessia (VIR 525), Hungary (VIR 481, VIR 535), Yugoslavia (VIR 479*) and cv. Maikopskaya 1 (VIR 491*).


<H2>Conclusions</H2>

Hemp breeding faces a series of complex problems which may be solved by wide utilisation of the global hemp germplasm collection stored at VIR. For this purpose, it would be necessary to perform in depth and complex studies of the accessions in this collection, especially of the monoecious drug-free varieties identified for their earliness. Research should aim to identify sources of flexibility, firmness and other fibre quality traits, including disease and pest resistance, and sources of variation in oil yield and quality. It is necessary to create varieties with more economically valuable traits by individual selection, applying the express method of cannabinoid content evaluation, and to perform hybridization with the purpose of uniting all required parameters in a single genotype. This would result in obtaining early ripening monoecious materials for breeding, which would also possess high productivity and high quality of fiber and oil.<P>
It is necessary to conduct research on the genetics of sexual, technological and biochemical characteristics, lack of which impedes the efficiency of hemp breeding.<P> 

* = Accessions no longer maintained in the VIR collection. The remainder of the accessions noted in this article are threatened with extinction. A concerted effort must be made to preserve these valuable accessions for future breeders.

Houses have always been built out of what was around &#151; mostly stones and lumber. But where stones and trees were scarce, chopped straw mixed with a soil, rich in clay, was a common material. Modern building with hemp is very different from this old technique, yet it too allows for building with what grows around you. (At least in a country like France, where hemp is a legal crop).<P>
Hemp, when grown for fiber, is sown very densely, so as to grow into branchless slender stalks that so resemble straw that French farmers call them hemp straw (&quot;paille de chanvre&quot;). After harvest, the long fibers that make up to about 25% of the hemp stalks are removed. In some parts of the world, like China, these fibers are still spun and woven into cloth. In France, the machinery presently used to remove the fibers from the stalk does not allow processing of the fibers into a thread strong enough to be woven into cloth.<P>
Hemp is still grown for its fiber but today, in France, these are entirely bought by paper making companies (mostly by de Mauduy, a French company now belonging to Kimberley Clarke). Added to ordinary wood pulp, hemp fibers make &quot;specialty paper&quot; particularly pliable and resistant, for banknotes or cigarette paper.

<H2>For cats and horses, too</H2>

The strong fibers are what hemp has always been grown for. Yet
after the fibers have been removed from the stalk, there remains
about 75% of the plant. This bulky by-product, known as hurd (&quot;ch&egrave;nevotte&quot;
in French) looks like fine wood chips, only much lighter. Hemp
hurds are extremely absorbent: they will soak up about five times
their own weight in moisture. They are commercialised in France
by the hemp growers co-op &quot;La Chanvri&#143;re de l'Aube&quot;,
as bedding for livestock under the brand name &quot;Aubiose&quot;.
Aubiose is used, in particular, for race horses, who will have
nothing but the best. The most minute hurd particles are molded
into pellets and commercialized as cat litter. These were first
made by La Chanvri&#143;re de l'Aube, who commercializes them
as &quot;Biochat&quot; in France, or &quot;All Hugro&quot; in
Germany. Since hemp growing became legal in England in 1993, cats
there can enjoy the same product, made out of British hemp, known
as &quot;Posh Paws&quot;. Hemp hurds are not only very absorbent,
they are also uncommonly rich in silica, a chemical compound naturally
occurring as sand or flint. The high mineral content of hemp hurds
brings us naturally to one of their most interesting applications:
building. Hemp hurds mixed with lime undergo a process of mineralisation,
sometimes referred to as &quot;petrification&quot; (changing into
stone).

<H2>Midway between mineral and vegetable kingdoms</H2>

In France, where houses have been built with hemp hurds as the
main material (apart from the wooden structure), there are slight
differences in technique. But the basic process is the same: hemp
hurds are mixed with natural lime (not cement !) and water. Sometimes
plaster of Paris (pure gypsum) or sand is added. The mixing can
be done in a cement mixer and at this stage the resulting mix
does look a bit like cement. It can be poured like cement, likewise
it hardens and becomes mold and insect resistant. And yet it retains
some of the virtues proper to plant matter: the resulting material,
which becomes a lighter, tawny color when dry, has a texture vaguely
reminiscent of cork. It is many times lighter than cement (which
workers fully appreciate) and it offers both thermal and sonic
insulation. The mixture sets in a matter of hours, while the process
of &quot;petrification&quot; continues.<P>
The mix can be poured as a floor, or between sheets of plywood
(which will be removed a few hours later) for walls. Here one
material replaces several layers of conventional building materials:
bricks or cement, vapor barrier, insulation, and plaster board.
All that is needed, inside as well as outside, is a whitewash
finish (with or without pigments added). Alternatively, for interior
use, the look of the material can be preserved with a simple waxing
or varnishing, which brings out the cork-like structure of the
material.

<H2>Different schools of thought</H2>

Can the basic process of petrification of hemp hurds be improved?
This is where people working in this field disagree. The hemp
farmers co-op that initially perfected this technique (La Chanvri&#143;re
de l'Aube) registered a patent for a process that coats the hurds
with silica. The prepared hurds, meant for building, are commercialized
under the brand name &quot;Canobiote&quot;. &quot;Isochanvre&quot;
is another brand name for a similar product, prepared in another
hemp-growing area (near Le Mans). Canobiote and Isochanvre look
identical, though the latter is almost twice as expensive. Isochanvre
costs about 800 FF per cubic meter, Canobiote about 500 FF. France
P&eacute;rier, the woman who developed Isochanvre, initially worked
for La Chanvri&egrave;re de l'Aube, promoting Canobiote (and then
left to start her own business). She insists that Isochanvre is
a better product, though it is not clear exactly in what way.<P>
Finally there are those like Yves Kh&uuml;n who think that regular
hemp hurds, untreated, just as nature made them, are as perfect
as can be for the petrification process to best take place &#151;
provided the right kind of lime or plaster of Paris, is used.
He calls this technique &quot;Canosmose&quot;.<P>
This former solo dancer with the prestigious B&#142;jart company,
now an entrepreneur who works with his architect wife, maintains
that coating the hurds with silica makes them less absorbent,
which in turn interferes with the petrification process. He therefore
prefers to use the hurds as they are, and points out that they
are also much cheaper that way (only 270 FF per cubic meter).<P>
Whatever form of hurd is used, it certainly provides a very attractive
building material, one that is both healthy for people to live
in and environmentally friendly.<P>

<h2>Historical overview</h2>

<p>The cultivation and use of hemp in Germany has a long history
(Krber-Grohne 1988). The earliest findings of hemp-based ropes
and fabrics in Europe were made in the Stuttgart area and can be
dated back to the pre-Roman period (800-400 BC). Fabrics were not
yet made from processed hemp fibers, but from the bast stripped
from the plant's stem. During the early Middle Ages, retting, a
biological process for the separation of plant fibers which had
been used for flax, was transferred to hemp. The nutritious hemp
seeds have been used as a food staple since the Middle Ages and
early descriptions of the plant's medical applications date back
to the 16th century. To this day, traditional hemp dishes are
prepared in some of the former German provinces, such as the
Silesian hemp soup made from hemp seeds and millet (Pelz and
Kretschmer 1977).</p>

<p> In the 14th century, the traditional Chinese art of making
paper arrived in Germany <i>via</i> Italy. Exclusively used as
raw material were rags from flax and hemp textiles. Wood based
paper came into use only after mechanical and chemical pulping
was developed in the mid eighteen hundreds in Germany and
England, respectively. Because of the significantly lower costs
of wood, often obtained by clear-cutting, flax and hemp as
resources for the pulping industry were rapidly displaced.</p>

<p> Hemp experienced its heyday in Germany in the 17th century.
Because of the high tensile strength of its fibers and their
tolerance of moisture, essentially all sails, tows, nets, flags,
and uniforms for the growing fleet of sailing ships were made
from hemp. Within the boundaries of what later became Germany,
hemp was grown on an area of approximately 150,000 hectares (ha).</p>

<p> The decline of hemp in Germany began in the 18th century,
when technical improvements simplified the processing of cotton.
This subsequently displaced flax and hemp from the textile market
because their processing remained labor intensive. The concurrent
decline in sailing caused the loss of yet another important
market for hemp fibers.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr size="4">

Germany), BRD = Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). </p>

<hr size="4">

<p>In the 19th century, jute and sisal, novel fiber plants from
the colonies, were introduced to Germany. Jute in particular
competed with hemp in its traditional domains at only half the
price because of the pittance paid to workers in the colonies. At
the same time, German hemp came under pressure from cheaper hemp
imports from Russia. The already mentioned displacement by wood
in the pulping sector resulted in the loss of yet another market
for hemp fibers. Figure 1 demonstrates the steady decrease in
acreage used for hemp cultivation in Germany during the 19th and
20th century, before it essentially ceased in 1915. </p>

<h2>During the world wars</h2>

<p>Hemp became a war profiteer during the two world wars. Cut off
from its overseas supplies of cotton, jute, sisal and ramie, the
German governments reconsidered hemp and supported improvements
to cultivation, harvesting and processing technologies. For
example, the development of the so-called cottonization process
allowed production of a short-fiber, high-quality cotton
substitute from hemp fiber. During the 1920s, the substitution of
all cotton imports by cottonized domestic hemp was seriously
discussed. It would have required an area of approximately one
million hectares (Gminder 1924). While these considerations were
driven mainly by a desire for self-sufficiency, they still
demonstrate the potential which was attributed to hemp fiber.
Towards the end of World War II, hemp was grown in Germany on
about 21,000 ha, which supplied approximately 20% of the demand
for hemp fiber. Most of the balance was imported from Italy.</p>

<p> Of high relevance today are the various fiber separation and
processing technologies, which were intensively developed and
tested in Germany after the turn of the century in order to
expand the range of applications for hemp fiber and to lower
production costs. A comprehensive summary of these developments
can be found in the book <i>Hemp and Hard Fiber</i> by Herzog <i>et
al.</i> (1927). </p>

<h2>Post war developments</h2>

<p>After World War II, the cultivation of hemp in Germany rapidly
shrank to insignificant levels, mainly due to the competition
from imported natural fibers and the newly developed synthetic
fibers. In the former GDR (East Germany) the cultivation of hemp
survived through the late 1960s. Despite the concurrent decline
of German hemp research, researchers were able to breed several
varieties which combined a high fiber yield with a low content of <i>delta</i>-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), the main psychoactive ingredient of hemp (Bredemann 1952,
Bredemann <i>et al.</i> 1961). These varieties are now considered
lost in Germany, but their existence elsewhere (e.g., Russian
gene banks) is conceivable.</p>

<p> The final blow to the cultivation of fiber hemp in West
Germany was dealt by the 1982 amendments to the federal narcotics
act (BtMG) which outlawed the cultivation of hemp, regardless of
its THC content. Exemptions may only be granted for scientific
purposes or in the case of public interest. To this day, these
amendments effectively ban the commercial cultivation of hemp in
Germany. In 1981, they also forced the last West German hemp
farmer, Martin Butter, to give up his production (Karus <i>et al.</i>
1994). At the time, he employed 15 persons involved in the
cultivation of hemp on 150 ha of land. Fibers were sold to
manufacturers of ropes, textiles and cigarette paper. The woody
core (shives or hurds) of the stems was used locally to produce
building materials, such as particle board and pellets for
thermal insulation. The leaves were used as litter in stables.
Instead of taking his case to the European Court (the European
Community had already permitted the cultivation of low-THC
varieties at that time) Butter accepted a DM 800,000 settlement
from the German government.</p>

<p> Subsequently, agricultural research on hemp essentially
ceased. One of the few exceptions is the work of Prof. Megnet who
investigated, in the early 1980s, whether hemp could be grown on
soils contaminated with heavy metals. Initial results indicated
that the fibers remain virtually free of heavy metals. However,
Megnet soon had to abandon his work because of governmental
requirements he could not comply with.</p>

<p> When renewable bioresources, such as flax, were rediscovered
in Germany in the 1980s, hemp was simply ignored. The knowledge
of its potential uses had largely been lost within just a few
decades. Younger agricultural scientists and engineers knew hemp
merely as an exotic drug plant, not as a traditional, domestic
fiber resource.</p>

<p> At this point, only one agricultural use of hemp in Germany
has been exempted from this general prohibition: as a pollen
insulator in the commercial breeding of beets. No other plant
forms such impermeable hedges and minimizes undesirable outside
pollination. </p>

<h2>Current research</h2>

<p>In the early 1990s, even this remaining application came under
attack from a Bavarian politician. In this context, the late
Prof. Dambroth at the Agricultural Research Laboratory (FAL) in
Braunschweig was asked to investigate the variability in the THC
content of low- THC varieties and the development of the THC
content during the plant's growth period. Hemp has been grown at
the FAL for research purposes since 1992. Dambroth added to this
program the investigation of the impact of chemical (nitrogen)
fertilizer and plant density on fiber quality, and fiber and seed
yield. Delayed by his death in 1993, the results are now
scheduled for publication in early 1995. Preliminary findings
indicate hemp's comparatively low nitrogen demand and the high
fiber yield of the Hungarian Kompolt variety. </p>

<h2>Rediscovery of the &quot;new &quot; bioresource, hemp</h2>

<p>The rediscovery of hemp in Germany as a promising,
ecologically benign resource was largely triggered by the
publication of <i>The Rediscovery of the Resource Hemp Cannabis
Marihuana</i> in September 1993 (Herer, Brckers, KATALYSE
1993). The book became an immediate bestseller. It contains, in
addition to the German translation of Jack Herer's popular book <i>The
Emperor Wears no Clothes</i>, a historical review of the use of
hemp in Europe by Mathias Brckers and a current scientific
evaluation of the industrial crop hemp by the KATALYSE Institute,
Cologne (Karus <i>et al.</i> 1993, 1994a).</p>

<p> The book was well received by the German media and general
public and caused a downright hemp &quot;avalanche&quot;.
Following a decade-long period of neglect, numerous dissertations
covering a broad range of subjects in the areas of cultivation,
processing and use of hemp are now under way or have already been
published. At the same time, numerous domestic firms are
developing technologies and product lines based on imported hemp.
A number of professionally manufactured products entered the
market in 1994 with good initial success. Total sales in 1994 of
these products are estimated at DM 20-40 million, up from
essentially zero in 1993. Much of the enthusiasm of these firms
is due to hemp's positive marketing image. It results from the
ecological advantages of the bioresource hemp, as well as from
its modern, fresh image caused by the association with its sister
plant, marihuana.</p>

<p> In January 1994, &quot;Die Hanfgesellschaft&quot; (The Hemp
Society) was founded in Berlin as an association of hemp
protagonists in the areas of agriculture, processing, industry
and marketing. Its goal is to promote the reintegration of hemp
into the economic cycle by creating a network of major players,
providing public education and supporting specific projects. The
society's most visible venture is the &quot;Hanfhaus&quot; (Hemp
House) chain. In addition to its Berlin headquarters, it operates
retail outlets in six major German cities which market, under
considerable attention by the media, a wide range of hemp-based
products.</p>

<p> This rapid development in the areas of research, development
and marketing had to manage essentially without public funding.
The federal agencies in charge, the Ministry of Agriculture (BML)
and the Agency for Renewable Bioresources (FNR) are not willing
to fund hemp projects for the time being. Their main objections
are that the cultivation of hemp is still illegal in Germany and
that they do not want to sponsor a plant which would compete with
flax, the promotion of which has received DM 60 million of public
funding to date, without the hoped-for breakthrough.</p>

<p> Meanwhile, the general ban on the cultivation of hemp and its
main supporter, the newly created federal drug administration,
Bundesinstitut f&#159;r Arzneimittel und Medizin-produkte (BAM),
have come under intense public criticism. The debate centers
around the question of whether even low-THC varieties may somehow
be used for the production of marihuana and can therefore not be
tolerated. In this context, the validity of the EU-wide accepted
limit of 0.3% THC content in the upper one third of the leaves is
questioned by BAM. A publication which demonstrates the
irrelevance of the arguments used by the supporters of the ban is
being prepared by the nova-Institute. Results from another recent
study (Karus <i>et al.</i>, 1994b) also suggest that low-THC
varieties cannot be misused as a drug and that the EU limit of
0.3% is sufficient.</p>

<p> Prior to presenting potential solutions for this somewhat
muddled situation, the major ongoing R&amp;D activities in
Germany in the various sectors will be summarized in the
following. </p>

<h2>Cultivation tests</h2>

<p>In addition to the already mentioned tests at the FAL
Braunschweig, several cultivation tests have been approved in
1994 by the authorities as scientifically useful, and are now
being carried out at various universities. Worth mentioning are
tests at the Humboldt University, Berlin aimed at the cultivation
of low-THC varieties, and an investigation of the suitability of
hemp as boiler fuel at the Gesamthochschule Kassel. </p>

<h2>Harvesting and fiber separation</h2>

<p>Innovative harvesting and fiber separation processes for flax
plants have been researched and developed on a laboratory scale
in Germany for the last decade. Various public and private
institutions were involved in this program, supported by
considerable amounts of public funding (approximately DM 60
million). The primary goal of this program is the development of
ecologically benign processes which produce fiber material with
high yields and standardized quality, particularly for industrial
fiber use, at a competitive price. A detailed understanding of
the product characteristics demanded by industry, and the
identification and quantification of their respective fiber
parameters are essential for the achievement of this goal. This
approach was based on the desire to eliminate the dependence of
flax sales on short-lived trends in textile fashion and to create
stable markets in the industrial sector. Studies carried out
under this program suggest that market potentials for short flax
fibers exist, particularly as substitute for glass and mineral
fibers and in the production of press-molded parts.</p>

<p> Various fiber separation processes, based on the use of steam
explosion, detergents, or ultrasound have now been developed on
the laboratory scale. While the quality of the produced fibers
has been met with keen interest from industry, these technologies
still lack demonstration on the pilot and production scales. Most
advanced at this point are purely mechanical methods which
combine harvest and separation. They provide a limited range of
product qualities or serve as preprocessing step for the already
mentioned biochemical or physical processes.</p>

<p> Despite this favorable starting position, the implementation
of innovative flax technologies has been slowed down considerably
due to the virtual elimination of public funding.</p>

<p> These initial results from the R&amp;D program for flax are
highly relevant for the use of hemp as well. For a fraction of
the funds spent to date on flax, the results could also be
applied to the use of hemp fiber. These favorable starting
conditions raise the hope that hemp, with its players being fresh
and not yet involved in quarrels, and its modern marketing image,
may bring about the breakthrough for both domestic fiber
resources, flax and hemp. Consequently, major players in the flax
domain, most notably the Institute for Applied Research (IAF) at
the Fachhochschule Reutlingen, have begun in 1994 to apply these
newly developed technologies to hemp. This includes a detailed
analysis of the fiber's characteristics. However, to get off the
ground at a pace that could satisfy the rapidly growing demand,
demonstration projects are essential. Obtaining adequate public
or private funding of such projects is difficult as a result of
the recent funding priorities in post-reunification Germany. The
implementation of a modern facility for the separation and
processing of hemp and flax fibers should be the natural focus of
these efforts. </p>

<h2>Pulp and paper</h2>

<p>In 1993, Schneidershne, Germany's largest paper
manufacturer, introduced its first hemp-based paper products, and
presently markets a complete line of hemp paper. The collection
includes basic paper for the production of books, as well as four
different varieties of graphical papers under the names
Sativaprint (stationery) and Luxosativa (art paper). The papers
are based on mixtures of bleached hemp pulp and de-inked recycled
paper, most commonly 50/50 blends. Since the fall of 1994, paper
based on 100% hemp pulp is also available. Sales of 500 (metric)
tons are anticipated for 1994, corresponding to revenues of DM
4-5.5 million.</p>

<p> The hemp pulp is provided by the Spanish firm Celesa,
currently the sole supplier in Western Europe. The comparatively
high prices for hemp pulp, approximately DM 4,000/ton, are due in
part to its monopoly position. However, ongoing developments in
the pulp supply will soon break this monopoly, resulting in lower
prices and improving the cost competitiveness of hemp pulp.</p>

<p> A remodeled pulp mill is scheduled for startup near Dresden
in early 1995. It will be capable of producing 6,000 tons per
year of pulp based on hemp, flax and linseed. Both unbleached and
hydrogen peroxide bleached pulp will be offered. Hemp tow,
initially imported from Eastern Europe, will be the raw material
for the hemp pulp. Prior to pulping it will be cut to a fiber
length of 2-6 millimeters. Schneiders&#154;hne will not remain
the sole buyer of hemp pulp produced in Germany. Several German
firms are also interested in the use of hemp pulp for
manufacturing technical and household filters. Their main
motivation is the development of product lines which provide
ecological benefits compared to wood pulp based products. For
example, hemp-based filter papers are more resistant to moisture
and can meet quality requirements without the addition of
synthetic resins. The first of these products will likely be
introduced in early 1995.</p>

<p> The major German producer of cigarette paper, EFKA-Werke,
introduced 100% hemp based paper for the first time in the summer
of 1994. These Cauma hemp papers were introduced successfully
by a smart marketing campaign. The paper is manufactured in
France where all of the hemp pulp produced is converted
domestically to paper. </p>

<h2>Textiles</h2>

<p>The market for hemp-based textiles has grown much faster than
was expected based on the results from previous studies. Since
early 1994, the Hemp House chain has successfully marketed
various kinds of hemp textiles, such as denim-type jackets and
pants. The textiles are predominantly manufactured in Hungary.
Over the last several months, ecologically minded textile
companies have shown an increased interest in the bioresource
hemp. It can be expected that fabrics and garments, some of them
probably produced in Germany, will soon be available on the
market, sold not only by outlets specializing in hemp products
but also by ecologically oriented mail-order businesses and
boutiques.</p>

<p> Apparently, the German market is particularly open for
natural hemp fiber because the ecological aspects are taken more
seriously in the textile sector there, and because natural
fiber-based textiles, well suited for a strict eco-labeling, are
rare and expensive. The positive marketing image of hemp will
further contribute to the development of markets which are not as
accessible to flax.</p>

<p> A frequently heard argument is that hemp fiber is not well
suited for the production of soft and easy-care textiles, which
provide the familiar cotton comfort. However, initial tests in
the textile industry have shown that certain environmentally
friendly, predominantly mechanical processes allow improvements
in the everyday-wear characteristics of hemp textiles. Additional
processes are currently being developed. The already mentioned
use of cottonized short fibers, instead of the traditional long
fiber, will create further opportunities for hemp, once the
process is established on the full-scale level. This may allow
hemp to make inroads into the market now held by cotton-based
textiles in the not too distant future. </p>

<h2>Building materials</h2>

<p>Following publication of the &quot;Hanf&quot; book in Germany,
the already strong domestic ecologically-oriented building
movement developed a high level of interest in the use of hemp
shives as a material for construction. Most popular to date has
been the French product ISOCHANVRE which is used as a building
and thermal insulation material. In 1994, ISOCHANVRE was first
used in Germany, in combination with lime, as an insulating
plaster in the remodeling of older buildings. A German company
has been using hemp shives for the construction of floors since
1957. Current efforts to use shives in the production of
ecological particle boards and building blocks are also
promising.</p>

<p> In the long-term, the use of hemp fiber may become more
important for the building industry. Potential products include
light-weight construction boards, fiber-cement boards and
fiber-reinforced plaster. Earlier this year, a German firm
introduced flax fiber-based insulating mats which substitute for
rock wool mats and provide the same level of thermal insulation.
The company is also developing hemp tow based mats but will
suspend their release until domestic hemp is available, since
they deem the necessary long-distance transport of the tow
ecologically unacceptable. </p>

<h2>Hemp oil</h2>

<p>The characteristics and potential uses of hemp seed oil are
the subject of several ongoing studies in academia and industry.
Initial results show that hemp oil is one of the most valuable
vegetable oils, both for food and technical applications. The
research focuses on various aspects which had been investigated
previously for oil seeds other than hemp. This includes, for
example, the composition of the fatty acid spectrum of hemp oil
from various sources, shifts in this spectrum during plant
growth, the biodegradability of hemp oil based detergents, and
taste and durability of hemp oil.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>It can be expected that the application for registration of
hemp oil as an edible oil will be initiated in early 1995. In
1994, an Austrian firm surprised the public with the presentation
of a complete line of hemp oil-based personal care products, such
as soap, shampoo, bubble bath etc. A German firm recently
introduced a hemp oil perfume which is based on a 19th century
recipe. </p>

<h2>Medical uses</h2>

<p>The potential medical applications of hemp, or rather
cannabinoids, have been under a taboo in Germany for a long time
and cannabinoid research is virtually non-existent. This
situation is now changing, due in part to the translation of the
well-known book &quot;Marihuana - the forbidden medicine&quot; by
Grinspoon and Bakalar (1993), which was complemented by a review
of the results from recent medical research and a summary of the
legal and medical situation in Germany (Grotenhermen and Karus
1994). This and a concurrent modification of the federal
narcotics act (BtMG) which simplified clinical tests with <i>delta</i>-9-THC
are likely to result in an increase in the research of
cannabinoids in the near future. </p>

<h2>Forecast</h2>

<p>At this point, it can only be speculated how the current
German prohibition on the cultivation of low-THC hemp will
eventually be overcome. Ongoing legal activities include a law
suit filed by the agricultural association GAIA against BAM with
a Berlin court. The subject is permission to cultivate hemp on a
110 ha plot near Berlin. While filing a suit with the European
Court is another promising strategy, this route has not been
taken because of the costs and time involved. Administratively
the easiest way to eliminate the prohibition is a modification of
the BtMG to EU guidelines as part of its routine adjustment, a
process which is carried out almost annually without much
publicity. The fact that a majority of political players in the
agricultural and environmental arenas, such as the German
Association of Farmers, have already come out in support of the
re-admission of hemp for cultivation suggests that such a change
will probably occur once the cultivation and use of fiber hemp
become more established in other European countries.</p>

<p> Until such time, it is advisable to press forward with the
development of hemp technologies and products and to benefit from
the current favorable technological and marketing conditions in
Germany. Such a strategy would allow hemp to be processed by
modern and ecologically sound technologies and turned into
innovative products as soon as the prohibition on cultivation is
ended. This would effectively close the value-adding chain
between cultivation and marketable product. Thus, the primary
tasks ahead are to overcome the existing lack of funding for hemp
R&amp;D through the use of scientifically founded arguments, and
then to integrate the numerous ongoing activities, undertaken
with much enthusiasm and little financial support, into
professionally coordinated, interdisciplinary projects.</p>

<p> The first steps in this direction are currently being taken.
Only a few examples can be mentioned here. The Hanfgesellschaft
is currently in the planning stages for a large scale
German-Polish hemp cultivation and processing project. Co-funding
from the EU's Eastern Europe Incentive program will be applied
for. The nova-Institute, Cologne, is coordinating the planning
for a major technology project which would focus on research,
development and pilot-scale implementation of innovative,
ecological product lines based on hemp. Finally, the BIOROHSTOFF
HANF (Bioresource Hemp) trade fair and conference will be held in
March 1995 in Frankfurt. BIOROHSTOFF HANF combines the first
international product and technology exhibit with the first
technological-scientific symposium on the subject of hemp as a
bioresource. Scientists, farmers, and developers and vendors of
technology and products from around the world will present the
status of their research, concepts and products. For more
information on this event refer to the announcement on page 64. </p>

<H3>The Dutch hemp-for-paper project</H3>
In February 1994, the final report of the Dutch hemp research programme was presented. It took Dfl 17 million to evaluate several alternatives for a hemp paper production sequence from seed to final product. The most viable sequence was transformed into a business concept (Van Berlo 1993). The developed methods should have provoked a major breakthrough in large-scale hemp processing in the Netherlands. However, the paper industry was not interested in risking an investment in a pilot plant. 
<H3>Hemp-Flax, a new initiative</H3>
Contrary to the paper industry, some people believe that the time is ripe for reintroduction of hemp for fibre. In early 1994, one of the authors (E.D.) founded Hemp-Flax B.V. for the production and processing of hemp and flax. These annual fibre crops may provide a solution to problems in agriculture and industry (and thus the economy). A modern flax processing factory in Nagele, the Netherlands, was purchased and in this facility a new hemp processing line is being installed next to the existing one for flax, which will remain operational. 
<H3>Hemp cultivation</H3>
Several farmers were contracted to cultivate 140 hectares (ha) of hemp in the Veenkoloni&euml;n (N.E. Netherlands) during the summer of 1994. This was the largest hemp cultivation area in the Netherlands in sixty years. The objective of this first season was to explore the agronomy, the logistics, and Dutch markets for hemp. Paper-based products and textile markets were not primary targets for strategic reasons.<P>
The farmers did the soil preparation and sowing according to their own views. Seed from the French monoecious hemp varieties F&#142;dora, F&#142;lina, Fibrimon, and F&#142;drina were supplied by Hemp-Flax. The crop was harvested by Hemp-Flax in cooperation with the farmers. This way, the farmers gained experience and developed various practical methods. The influence of soil structure and water regime on hemp growth were surveyed. Furthermore, liquid manure was demonstrated to be a good fertilizer. The farmers applied for a larger hemp growing area for 1995 because they were enthusiastic about hemp's effect on the soil structure, its cultivation, and its performance. Local youths, who had taken some plants, were probably less enthusiastic about its performance.
<H3>Hemp harvesting</H3>
Although fungicides or pesticides were not used, the losses from <I>Botrytis cinerea</I> and other pathogens were insignificant. Self-thinning, as described by van der Werf (1994), was observed, but the level was unclear. Plant numbers of 50-200 per m<FONT SIZE=1>2 </FONT>have been counted with a sowing density of 30-90 kg/ha. The harvested yield was 6-9 tonnes/ha of air-dried matter. The yield was not expected to be optimal, since farmers had no previous experience with hemp cultivation and harvesting. Several harvesting methods were tested and the most practical method proved to be swath mowing, followed by dew retting and turning of the swath. The air-dried crop was pressed in large bales and transported to a storage place. This harvesting method resulted in clean fibre during the dry period in August and a nicely retted fibre after the wet periods in September, 1994. 
<H3>Hemp processing</H3>
In the factory, hemp bast fibres are separated from the core by a special process developed by Hemp-Flax. Several applications of the bast and core have been optimized. These products include a planting substrate, a building material, non-wovens, bio-filters and adsorbants. Industries that want to explore applications with hemp are welcome to contact Hemp-Flax for consultation and sample material.
<H3>Future developments</H3>
Hemp is a strong natural fibre with great endurance.
The agronomic advantages of hemp over other fibre crops include:
a high yield, reduction of agro-chemical requirements, soil improvement
and weed control. Hemp fibre can replace other natural fibres,
wood, asbestos, glass fibre, steel, polypropylene and polyethylene
(Brouwer 1991). Prices of current artificial and mineral fibres
have increased, which makes substitution by natural fibres possible.
So, sooner or later, hemp will become more attractive as a sustainable
source of fibre produced in the western world. Governmental and
agricultural organizations can help to bring about regulations
which will make it easier for farmers to grow this crop. Regulations
and public acceptance will determine the rate of introduction.
Hemp-Flax B.V. will encourage all parties to grow more hemp, which
will contribute to a more healthy, natural environment.

<H1><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>Hemp facts and hemp fiction</H1>
Hayo M.G. van der Werf<P>
International Hemp Association, Postbus 75007, 1070 AA Amsterdam, the Netherlands</CENTER><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
Jack Herer's book, <I>The Emperor Wears No Clothes</I>, edited by Chris Conrad, Lynn Osburn and Judy Osburn, provides fascinating reading. It was one of the major causes of the enormous increase in interest in fibre hemp in recent years. Although most of the information contained in the book is valid, some of its claims are clearly incorrect.<P>
Like Jack Herer and his editorial team, I am convinced that hemp has real potential as a 'new' crop and that it deserves more attention from farmers and agronomists. We are currently witnessing the renaissance of fibre hemp, but I think this renaissance is not well served by making unrealistic claims regarding the potential of hemp.<P>
Some quotes from <I>The Emperor Wears No Clothes</I> :<P>
&quot;Hemp [...] uses the sun more efficiently than virtually any other plant on our planet&quot; (page 2).<P>
&quot;Depending on which U.S. agricultural report is correct, an acre of full grown hemp plants can sustainably provide from four to 50 or even 100 times the cellulose found in cornstalks, kenaf or sugar cane - the planet's next highest annual cellulose plants&quot; (page 44).<P>
&quot;Hemp hurds are 77 % cellulose&quot; (page 44).<P>
Herer and his editorial team claim that hemp produces higher yields than other crops and that hemp hurds, which make up 60 to 80 % of the stem dry weight, contain 77 % cellulose. These claims are repeated in other books: <I>Energy Farming in America</I> (by Osburn), <I>Hemp, Lifeline to the Future</I> (by Conrad). Both claims are simply wrong.<P>
For a start, cellulose content of hemp hurds has been found to vary between 32 and 38 % (Bedetti and Ciaralli 1976, van der Werf 1994). Possibly, Herer confuses the hurds, which form the woody core of the hemp stem, with the bark, which forms the outer layer of the hemp stem. The bark contains the long bast fibres which are used in textile manufacturing. The cellulose content of the bark is much higher than that of the core. It has been found to lie between 53 and 74 % (Bedetti and Ciaralli 1976, van der Werf 1994).<P>
One of the objectives of the research I conducted over the last four years was to investigate the yield of hemp relative to that of other crops.<P>
Essentially, all agricultural crops do the same thing: they intercept light with their canopy and, in the leaves, sugars are formed as a result of photosynthesis. Most of the sugars move out of the leaves to other parts of the plant and are transformed into other organic substances, e.g., cellulose and lignin in the stem, and starch, protein and oil in the seed.<P>
When growing conditions are optimal, that is, in the absence of limitations due to lack of water or nutrients, or due to pests, diseases, or other stresses the yield of any crop will depend on:<P>
a) the total amount of light (L) intercepted by the crop canopy during the growing season;<P>
b) the radiation use efficiency (RUE): the amount of dry plant material produced per unit of light intercepted by the canopy;<P>
c) the harvest index (HI): the fraction of the plant parts of economic value in the total plant dry matter produced.<P>
This can be summarized in a simple formula:<P>
<H4>Yield = L x RUE x HI</H4>
Grown side by side under favourable growing conditions, different crops may have different yields. Relative to most other crops grown in the Netherlands, fibre hemp intercepts quite a lot of light (L is high) because the crop can be sown early and it grows well at low temperatures, so the canopy is established rapidly. The radiation use efficiency of fibre hemp is relatively low, probably as the result of the structure of the canopy and the relatively high lignin content in the stem. As with other annual fibre crops, such as flax or kenaf, the harvest index of fibre hemp is relatively high.<P>
In the most favourable growing conditions, we obtained yields of up to 15,000 kg of stem dry matter per hectare (6,070 kg per acre). Under simular conditions, other crops such as maize, sugar beet or potato produced similar dry matter yields. All results indicate that as far its yield is concerned, fibre hemp is in no way exceptional.<P>
These results have been detailed in my thesis, <I>Crop Physiology of Fibre Hemp</I> (<I>Cannabis sativa </I>L.). From these results I cannot help but conclude that the claim that hemp produces higher yields than other crops, simply is not true. This, of course, does not necessarily mean that hemp is not an interesting crop for farmers. I think that hemp is an excellent candidate to fill the niche for an annual fibre crop in temperate climates. Hemp seems to be an attractive crop for a sustainable agricultural system, as it has moderate fertilizer requirements, needs little or no pesticides and suppresses weeds and some major soil-borne pathogens.<P>
<I>Cannabis</I> is certainly a valuable crop plant, and its future succes will depend in part on the responsible dissemination of accurate information concerning its benefits.<P>

<FONT SIZE=4>Re-discovery of the Crop Plant <I>Cannabis</I> Marihuana Hemp<BR> 
(Die Wiederentdeckung der Nutzplanze <I>Cannabis</I> Marihuana Hanf).</FONT></CENTER><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
By Jack Herer, Mathias Br&ouml;ckers  and Katalyse. Zweitausend-eins, Frankfurt am main, Germany. Nineteenth printing, 463 pp.<P>

Judging by its length and the broad spectrum covered, this book could be regarded as a monograph if the style, contents and presentation were not of such a popular nature. It will still fill a definite need, however, since over the past 40-50 years not only has the production and processing of this crop been discontinued in Western Europe, but the plant itself has almost faded into oblivion. One reason for this was the craze for synthetic fiber materials in the late fifties and early sixties (e.g., nylon) which supplanted not only hemp, but flax as well, though they were also unable to compete with cotton. The other reason was the hysterical attitude towards drugs, which started in the USA and had such an influence on other governments. They were poorly informed on this subject, but committed to this campaign for other reasons and even fibre hemp, which is not classified as a drug, was banned from cultivation (as in Germany, for instance). The only exceptions to this were France, where 4,000-5,000 hectares of hemp have always been grown for paper manufacturing purposes, and Holland, with its liberal drug policy, where the sale and consumption of hashish was tolerated in the justified hope that this would distract the attention of the population from harder drugs (e.g. heroin, cocaine etc.). This concept has been a success.<P>
Returning to a criticism of the book itself, it is a pity that the title includes the word marihuana, which is compromised throughout the world. This is hardly the way to popularise hemp. To date, only specialists are aware of the medical effects of THC, while marihuana still has a disreputable sound for society in general.<P>
The book is characterised throughout by an enthusiasm and bias in favour of a good cause that sometimes goes to extremes, leading to material errors and illusory lines of argument. Nevertheless, the book does good service towards the enlightenment of the relevant authorities, organisations and governments in the hope that this propaganda on behalf of hemp will be a success.<P>
The book is a &quot;hybrid&quot;: chapters II and III were written by Germans on the European and specifically German aspects of the plant. While the first chapter, written by the American author Herer, deals mainly with the many-sided practical utilisation of hemp, the German sections attempt to give a certain amount of scientific background: botany, ecological requirements, production technology, etc. Of particular interest are the detailed discussion of the process which finally led, in 1937, to the prohibition of hemp production in the USA and to the banning of research into THC, again in the USA, in 1978, and the description of the road which led to synthetic THC. The struggle being wrought in the USA by marihuana lobbyists at all levels right up to the president also makes fascinating reading, while the arguments and factual information presented on the medicinal action of THC are convincing, as are references to the collusion between the pharmaceutics industry and the government, aimed at maintaining the ban on THC.<P>
Finally, there is a unique summary of the history of hemp cultivation, the like of which, as regards both the extent and richness of data, has never previously been published.<P>
The Americans have every right to complain about the prohibition of hemp production and to lobby for its reauthorisation since the ban was actually lifted for a few years during the war (&quot;Hemp for Victory&quot;), but Western Europeans have no cause to complain about the disappearance of hemp, because they have undeservedly forgotten about it over the last 40 years.<P>
In Western Europe, nobody banned the cultivation of hemp. It was simply ousted by artificial fibres. The largest hemp producing state was Italy, where cultivation also ceased in the sixties, so the statement that hemp is still grown commercially in Italy (p. 269) is incorrect. On the other hand, French hemp production is mentioned as if it had begun again in 1990, although it was never abandoned there, an area of 4,000 - 5,000 hectares having been constantly sown to hemp for paper manufacturing purposes. It was also the French who produced the first low THC monoecious varieties. In Eastern Europe, the production of hemp was never discontinued, though the situation differed considerably from one country to the other. Large-scale production was only carried out in the Soviet Union, Romania, and Hungary, which is not mentioned at all in the book, but where the highest yield averages were produced (9 t stems/ha on 6,000 ha in 1989). Hungary was also the biggest exporter of hemp cloth to the Soviet Union (5 million m<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>/year), since it provided the best quality. I do not know where the author found his data on the highly developed hemp production of Romania, because the average yields in this country were actually extremely low. Regarding the Bulgarian hemp production, it was never of great importance and there has been no breeding for the last 30 years.<P>
It is true that no books on hemp have been published in Germany over the last 40 years, but there was no call for such books, as nobody was interested in the subject. It is only now that the time is ripe for this venture. It is also true, however, that in 1961 Prof. Hoffmann devoted a full chapter to hemp breeding in the monumental work by Roemer and Rudorf <I>Handbuch der Pflanzen-z&uuml;chtung</I> in which he made frequent references to the author of this review. A decade later, the book by Hoffmann, Mudra and Plarre, <I>Lehrbuch der Z&uuml;chtung landw. Kulturpflanzen,</I> also discussed hemp breeding at far greater length than was justified by its importance in Germany, and this was repeated in the 2nd edition published in 1980. Finally, in 1988, Prof. Geisler included a brief but correct chapter on hemp production in his book entitled <I>Pflanzenbau</I>. So there was no shortage of literature, just a lack of interest.<P>
It is disappointing to note that both the American and the German authors betray a great deficiency in knowledge on hemp production and research in Eastern Europe, though a book of this calibre deserves to have been supported by more accurate data. Instead,  the authors plead the difficulty of not understanding the language (though the publications always have a German or English summary). I myself, for example, have written four articles in German, published in various German journals, reporting on the results of Hungarian hemp breeding. If the authors had read these articles they would not have written the erroneous statement that monoecious hemp varieties have a 50% higher fibre content than dioecious varieties. The variety with the highest fibre content in the world is, in fact, the Hungarian dioecious variety KOMPOLTI, which was used to improve the fibre content of French varieties and which has a considerably greater stem yield than any monoecious variety. It was also in Hungary that the first hybrid varieties were produced and the first unisexual forms consisting solely of females. Dutch researchers from Wageningen set up the experiments needed for their paper project (p. 344) using the Hungarian variety Kompolti hybrid TC, which proved to have the greatest stem yield.<P>
Romania is often mentioned in the book, though it has only two varieties with moderate yield potential (Fibramulta and Secueni 1). A number of dioecious varieties are available in Italy, but these are not cultivated now. Many monoecious varieties are available at Gluchov in the Ukraine, and many types of harvesters have been developed in Gluchov, but yield averages are very low. It is strange that the book makes no mention of French monoecious hemp varieties (Futura, F&eacute;drina, F&eacute;lina, etc.), although these are grown on the greatest area in EU countries at present.<P>
As already indicated above, over- enthusiasm, sometimes without good groundings, often leads the authors into the dead-end of objective errors and illusory lines of argument. For instance, it is a great exaggeration to calculate that hemp could be grown on 6 million hectares in the EU countries. This would require an enormous infrastructure, for which the funds are simply not available. Several dozen hemp factories, oil plants, spinning and weaving mills and panel-making factories would be needed within the production area, since it is not worth transporting hemp more than 40-50 km even in bales. It is a great error to expect an oil yield of 24 million tons: this is obviously based on the data in Table 12 (p. 452), which have been incorrectly understood from Romanian literature, suggesting that hemp gives a seed yield of 4000 kg/ha (pp. 314, 347, 349). This is a biological absurdity. Present knowledge puts the yield potential of the best seed-producing varieties (mid-Russian) as 1000 kg/ha, which is far lower than that of sunflower, and on average only 600-800 kg can be expected. It follows from this that in Germany rapeseed far surpasses hemp in seed-yielding ability and thus in oil yield. It can thus be seen that hemp is not, and never will be, a mass oil-producing plant, as it produces few seeds. For this reason, its excellent but expensive oil will remain the foodstuff of the rich. Herer's speculation on the conversion of hemp into methanol is equally illusory (p. 105). If even 10% of the many hundreds of millions of tonnes of oil used in the USA each year were to be replaced by hemp methanol, hemp would have to be sown on 5-10 million hectares: the cost of infrastructure and technology would exceed even the capital potential of the USA. In addition, due to transportation problems, thousands of decentralised methanol plants would be required. This belongs to the world of fantasy.<P>
I think it is also unrealistic to expect a dry stem yield of 10-12 t/ha in Germany. This can only be achieved in more southern-lying countries and only with southern (late) varieties.<P>
It is an exaggeration to suggest that hemp fibre could be used without mixing with other fibres to weave the finest cloths (shirts), since it is common knowledge that with the present technology, threads of at most Nm 10-12 can be spun from hemp, compared to Nm 40-50 for flax. The difference in fineness between the two plants requires no explanation. We do know that very fine hemp yarn is made in China using various half-manual technologies. However these processes can not be directly applied in Europe.<P>
In summary, the publication of this book was very timely and provides interesting, convincing and useful reading for all those who wish to work with or perhaps invest in this crop, or who have to teach or study it. Although it is a popular account rather than a scientific work, it will nevertheless prove informative for researchers, since it contains many data which are only otherwise available after long searching in libraries.<P>
The errors and exaggerations listed above do not detract from the usefulness of the book or from the burning desire of the authors to see hemp reinstated to its rightful place among the valuable crops, for the good of humanity. The criticism is not intended to deter the authors, but to encourage them to eliminate the exaggerations and errors from later editions of the book.<P>

<FONT SIZE=4>Professor Dr. Iv&aacute;n B&oacute;csa, the breeder of Kompolti hemp</FONT></CENTER><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
Iv&aacute;n B&oacute;csa is the eldest and one of the most successful active hemp breeders of Europe. For 40 years, he improved eight state-registered fibre hemp varieties, four of which are still cultivated. The improvement of the first unisex hybrids (pure female F1 originating from a monoecious x dioecious crossing) and the development of Bredemann's idea and method are linked with his name.<P>
During his career he bred only dioecious and unisex hybrids. He used monoecious varieties only as crossing partners because he was convinced (later proven by experimental evidence) that the monoecious varieties produce lower yields than the dioecious ones due to a 20 % inbreeding depression. He also improved the chlorophyll-deficient yellow-stemmed and the spherical ornamental varieties that characterise the extensiveness of his breeding work.<P>
We introduce here a part of this multifarious and rich life-work via interview (12 October 1994).<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Journal of the IHA:</STRONG> When was hemp introduced to Hungary?<P>
<STRONG>Iv&aacute;n B&oacute;csa:</STRONG> We don't know exactly. The Slavic people, who inhabited what is now Hungary up 'till about 900 AD, probably cultivated hemp. The first written reference to hemp is found in a royal customs bill of Esztergom from 1198 AD (At the time Esztergom was the capital of Hungary, where the kings of the first dynasty ruled). In this 800-year old customs document written in Latin, hemp was mentioned together with flax. At the time, hemp was not imported into Hungary but was an age-old native crop. Until 1860-1870 hemp was grown and processed solely by peasants. After that time, Italian hemp cultivars, which were grown and processed on an industrial scale, were introduced into Hungary. Until 1960, peasant and industrial hemp production coexisted. The forced collectivisation of agriculture in 1960 caused the disappearance of hemp production by peasants.<P> 
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> How did you get interested in hemp breeding?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> In 1949, at the beginning of my career, I was appointed as the assistant of Dr. Rudolf Fleischmann, who founded the Kompolt Research Institute in 1918 and who started working with hemp in 1920. His cultivar &quot;Fleischmann&quot; was very famous in all of Eastern and Central Europe. It replaced the Italian cultivars Carmagnola and Bolognese which were grown until then. Our cultivar &quot;Kompolti&quot; initially originated from &quot;Fleischmann&quot;. After Fleischmann's death in 1951 his 'inheritance' was divided between the three breeders working at Kompolt. As I was the youngest of the three, I got the two crops the others did not want: hemp and alfalfa. Hemp was not an easy crop to do breeding work on, as there was not much literature available. At that time only German and Russian literature was available.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> Why have you bred dioecious cultivars while many other hemp breeders have developed monoecious cultivars?

<HR SIZE=4>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> The natural state in which hemp appears was and is dioecious. Monoeciousness is artificial in hemp, it can only exist with the help of man, and without selection, the dioecious state will return in two or three generations. It is therefore very hard and demanding to keep 90 to 95 % monoeciousness during seed multiplications. Apart from that, however, monoecious hemp is appropriate only when the crop is grown for so-called double use, i.e. when both stem and seed are harvested. This is the case in France and in the former Soviet Union, where most crops are grown for double use. In a dioecious crop, the male plants will be strongly deteriorated when the crop is harvested at seed ripeness, so in this case one needs monoecious cultivars. In Hungary and its neighbouring countries, like formerly in Italy, this double use is unknown. Here fibre hemp is grown as a dense crop which is harvested at the time of male flowering (&quot;green hemp&quot;), while seed production takes place in crops grown at a low plant density and with completely different growing techniques. For this 'classic' use monoecious cultivars are of no use, so we never bred a monoecious cultivar.<P>
Furthermore, monoeciousness has two large disadvantages. In the first place, all monoecious cultivars which I tested over the last 20 to 25 years yielded 10 to 20 % less than dioecious cultivars. This is caused by the possibility of self-pollination and the resulting inbreeding. With model experiments and with biometric determinations we have established that 20-25 % of self-pollination takes place in monoecious hemp, and this is the cause of the lower stem yield. In the second place, in monoecious hemp, the genetic progress for fibre content is slow, because the so-called Bredemann principle can not be used. The Bredemann principle consists of the rapid determination of fibre content in male plants before they flower, so that only the males with the highest fibre content are allowed to pollinate the female plants. In a breeding garden (nursery) of one hectare, I have 15,000 to 20,000 plants and I need only the very best 50 to 100 males for the pollination. (This can be compared to breeding of dairy cows, where a few hundred extremely good bulls inseminate all the cows of an entire country.) In monoecious hemp this approach can not be used, so the rate of genetic progress is only 50 % or less of that in dioecious hemp. In spite of these disadvantages, we use a monoecious hemp cultivar in breeding, but only as a parent for unisexual hemp.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> Which brings up the next question: why did you develop a unisex cultivar?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> After the collectivization of agriculture in Hungary in the early sixties, the farmers were no longer interested in producing hemp seed, an activity which has not been mechanized until the present day. As a result of this, seed for sowing became scarce and the hemp industry had to import poor-quality land races from Turkey. From the research conducted by McPhee, von Sengbusch and Hoffmann we know that when a monoecious hemp plant pollinates a dioecious female the offspring (F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT>) consists for over 90 % of females, for 3-5 % of monoecious plants bearing mainly female flowers and for only 2-3 % of true males. This small number of males however is sufficient to ensure adequate pollination of the crop. As the stand consists mainly of seed-bearing (female + monoecious) plants, with the same habit, we called it unisexual hemp. Such a stand yields 60 - 80 % more seed than a dioecious cultivar. The seed produced on this stand (F<FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT>) is used as sowing seed for fibre production. We called this cultivar &quot;UNIKO-B&quot;. It is, in fact, a &quot;single-cross&quot; between Kompolti and Fibrimon, but it is the F<FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT> generation which is commercialized. Von Sengbusch and Hoffmann described the phenomenon, but they did not think of its practical use. In Kompolt we make the cross between Kompolti and Fibrimon on a surface of 5 hectare (ha), this yields 2,500 kg of F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT> seed. The F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT> seed is sown on a surface of 500 ha, yielding 400,000 kg of F<FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT> seed, which is used to sow 3,000-3,500 ha of fibre hemp.<P>
Unisexuality also can be used to exploit the effect of heterosis which occurs when Chinese and European (Kompolti) cultivars are crossed. This heterosis can increase stem yield by 8-15 %. To be able to cross two cultivars we have to construct a female parent which is &quot;male sterile&quot;, a unisexual F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT> can be used as such. In order to obtain a unisexual chinese line we used Fibrimon as the donor, which was backcrossed many times until we obtained a monoecious line with a Chinese habit. We crossed this line with the original dioecious Chinese cultivar to obtain a unisexual Chinese F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT>. This F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT> was crossed with Kompolti hemp to obtain Kompolti Hybrid TC. The stem yield of Kompolti Hybrid TC  is 5-8 % higher than that of Kompolti. The unisexual Chinese F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT> has an unsurpassed seed yield potential of up to 1,500-1,600 kg per ha.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> You made Kompolti Hybrid TC by crossing populations. Do you think much can be gained by using inbred lines to make hybrids?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> I can not answer this question because I never made inbred lines. It takes too long to make inbred lines and it is technically very difficult.<P> 
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> What techniques did you use to develop your cultivars which have the highest fibre content of all existing hemp cultivars?<P> 
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> As I explained in response to an earlier question, I used the Bredemann principle, which consists of the rapid determination of fibre content in male plants before they flower, so that only the males with the highest fibre content are allowed to pollinate the female plants. In some of my cultivars bark content is 38 - 40 %, this corresponds to a bast fibre content of 32 - 34 %. If the bark content is higher than 40 % the crop may lodge.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> How important is fibre quality relative to fibre content?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> Fibre quality is negatively related to fibre content. As we continue to select for fibre content we unwillingly increase the proportion of secondary fibre, which has a negative effect on fibre quality.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> Do cultivars differ in fibre fineness?
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> In a study comparing several cultivars on a number of locations, we found that the differences in fibre fineness between the locations were bigger than the differences between the cultivars.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> How did you develop Panorama, the world's only ornamental hemp cultivar?<P>  
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> In a grow out of hemp from Lebanon we found two or three short and strongly branched plants. This character was lost in the F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT>, it reappeared in the F<FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT>. Through breeding I obtained a pure variety. We also made a monoecious version, because for an ornamental cultivar it is preferable if there are no male plants which die early. Panorama was commercialized in Hungary in the 1980s, but it was not much sold.<P> 
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> How did you develop Kompolti S&aacute;rgasz&aacute;r&uacute;, the yellow stem hemp cultivar?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> Yellow stem was a mutation from professor Hoffmann, it was very early and very short. I crossed and backcrossed it often with the normal Kompolti to improve its stem yield and fibre content. In the end, we reached a very high fibre content, but its stem yield remained 15 % inferior to that of Kompolti. The textile factory liked the yellow stem very much, because in poor weather conditions the yellow stems can be dried in sheafs instead of being dried on the field. If this is done with normal hemp it causes problems because the stems in the middle of the sheaf do not lose their green colour, which eventually has a negative effect on the fibre colour.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> Current hemp cultivars were developed for textile fibre production. Do you think it will be feasible to develop special cultivars for seed production or for paper production?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> For textile production, new cultivars are not needed, because we have maximum stem yield and maximum fibre content. For paper production the high-fibre cultivars are very suitable, the presence of secondary bast fibre is no problem in this case. For seed production we have unisex, the single cross mother of Hybrid TC. It can yield up to 1,600 kg/ha of seed.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> What is the present status of your hemp cultivars, which can be bought in commercial quantities and through whom?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> Currently available are Kompolti, UNIKO-B, Kompolti Hybrid TC (but this cultivar contains too much THC for growing it in the EU) and Fibriko, which is like Kompolti Hybrid TC but with Kompolti  S&aacute;rgasz&aacute;r&uacute; instead of Kompolti as the father. Fibriko is not yellow but its fibre quality is better than that of Kompolti Hybrid TC. The cultivars belong to the GATE Agricultural Research Institute, but the institute is not allowed to do business, so a company called Fibroseed was founded. Fibroseed sells seed and pays the royalties to the GATE Institute.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> What was the most important discovery or technique in the history of hemp breeding?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> The use of the Bredemann principle was the most important innovation, the second most important  contribution to hemp breeding was the development of monoecious hemp and in the third place I would list the making of unisexual hemp.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> What would be the most important developments to help make hemp a main-stream agricultural crop?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> First the laws which forbid hemp growing in a large number of countries will have to be changed. In the second place technical innovation is needed, we need better machines for harvesting and for the entire processing chain.

<CENTER>63<H1><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>The 1994 TAPPI pulping conference</H1>
<FONT SIZE=4>Ir. Gertjan van Roekel, Jr.</FONT><P>
ATO-DLO Agrotechnology, P.O. Box 17,  6700 AA Wageningen, The Netherlands.<BR>

The scenic San Diego (California, USA) bay was this year's setting for the annual pulping conference of the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry of the USA.<P> 
Eleven hundred engineers, managers, consultants, equipment manufacturers, suppliers and researchers presented and discussed almost 150 papers on various aspects of pulping wood and non-wood fibre sources. Papers covered the whole range of raw material supply, up to the quality of pulps for papermaking, with a clear emphasis on raw material supply and on advances in bleaching technology.<P> 
A number of countries are experiencing shortages in wood supply: western Canada, northwest USA, Japan, China, and India. The US and Canada import trees from, for instance, Chile to keep a major economic activity (pulping) going, and Japan is importing Eucalypts from Australia. Especially for Asia, the importance of nonwood fibres to meet the rapidly increasing demand for paper was widely recognised.<P>
Bleaching operations and research for advanced bleaching technology were widely discussed, since the industry is in the process of changing from open bleaching systems using chlorine to closed systems using peroxide, oxygen and ozone with reduced emissions to the environment. Also, the recently developed use of microbial enzymes in the so-called biobleaching process has actually been implemented in large scale pulpmills.
<H3>Non-wood pulp</H3>
In the non-wood sessions, papers were presented on cultivation, harvest, storage, preprocessing, pulping and papermaking properties of kenaf, bagasse, bamboo, reed canary grass, wheat straw, seedflax and hemp. The heavily crowded &#147;non-wood room&#148; gave the impression that non-wood fibres have gained increased interest.  
<H3>New technologies</H3>
Several research institutions had come up with new systems and ideas for more efficient pulping methods, with higher yields and less environmental impact.<P> 
The process of treating hemp and kenaf fibre with fungi prior to mechanical pulping showed that such a method can prove useful in reducing energy consumption without losing pulp quality. The fungal treatment may be combined with the storage between harvest and processing.<P>
A paper by J.E. Harsveld van der Veen from ATO-DLO in the Netherlands disputed one of the most firm beliefs in fibre pulping: the idea that fibres are held together only by lignin. The paper suggests that not only lignin, but also pectin plays an active role in fibre bonding in plants and trees. Therefore, pulping methods designed for removing lignin are inefficient, and should be modified to remove the complex of both lignin and pectin.
<H3>Hemp</H3>
The use of hemp as a papermaking fibre was mentioned a few times in  relation to very special and technical applications. Delegates tended to opt for kenaf and seedflax for bulk non-wood papermaking in the US. Seedflax is a fibre very much comparable to hemp, and actually in use as a specific cigarette paper. It is available in huge quantities in Canada, virtually for free, since it is a byproduct of linseed oil production. Kenaf is grown in the southern US states, and seems to do very well. It is preferred over hemp for non-wood &#147;tree-free&#148; paper production in the US, because of the prohibition of hemp cultivation.
<H3>General impression</H3>
The pulping industry is running short of trees. As a result, woodpulp prices have gone sky-high (+130% in one year). Even with this in mind, the majority of delegates still feel that it will take another thirty years before fibre crops will be grown on a large scale in the western world. The reason is the low cost of bulk transport, and the often government-supported exploitation of wood plantations all over the world. It is still cheaper to ship wood from Chile to Canada than to grow hemp there (although the situation is changing rapidly). When the cost of bulk transportation increases,  certain areas will be better off growing their own fibre crops.<P>
Until then, the use of agricultural wastes such as seedflax straw and cereal straw will be encouraged. These materials are available free, and will probably attain a negative cost as they become more and more difficult to dispose of by incineration.<P>
Asian countries like China and India will see continued and increased use of non-wood fibre, but with improved and environmentally cleaner technology. It may well be that the technologies developed in the West will be applied and fine-tuned in the East, until the West starts using nonwood fibre. The only exception in the western world is the market where consumers insist on paper made without cutting trees. The tree-free paper market is expected to grow further, since cutting of primary forests is still going on, even for papermaking, and many consumers are not willing to support deforestation.<P>

<CENTER>64<H1><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>Bioresource Hemp</H1>
Product and Technology Exhibition  &amp; Technological-Scientific
Symposium<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>March 2-5, 1995, Frankfurt, Germany, as part of the BIO FACH '95</FONT></CENTER><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
The nova-Institute for Political and Ecological Innovation
in Cologne and the marketing firm TriTec, Bochum, have organized
the first international product and technology exhibition on hemp
as a bioresource, to be held from March 2-5, 1995.in Frankfurt.
The first international scientific-technological symposium on
the subject of hemp will be held concurrently.
<H3>Product and Technology Exhibition</H3>
The aim of the BIORESOURCE HEMP  is to support the realization
of innovative ecological products based on hemp; to bring together
scientists, companies and institutions involved in hemp technology
and hemp product development. Further synergistic effects result
from its proximity to BIO FACH '95, which is the largest trade
fair of ecological consumer goods world-wide. In March 1994, more
than 675 BIO FACH exhibitors displayed their products. At the
same time, the BIO FACH Congress also takes place. There, experts
report on current topics relevant to the eco-industry.<P>
Owing to the proximity to BIO FACH,  the exhibitors of BIORESOURCE
HEMP  have the opportunity to present their new product lines
and innovative technologies to a great number of ecologically
interested visitors. Approximately 30 companies and institutes
from various countries will present their technologies and products
in a projected exhibition area of 1,000 square meters.
<H3>Technological-Scientific Symposium</H3>
A four-day hemp symposium will also be held. Conference languages
are German and English and the admission fee for 4 days is DM
600 (students DM 300). For one day it is DM 250 (students DM 125).
For IHA members, a 20% reduction applies if the registration fee
is paid before February 28.<P>
The symposium will cover the entire spectrum of current international hemp research and technology development. The scientific level of the symposium is intended to allow a realistic assessment of the unquestionably attractive biological resource, hemp.<P>
Preliminary program:<P>
First day, March 2:
<UL>
<LI>Introduction 
<LI>The rediscovery of hemp: status reports from selected countries.
</UL>
Second day, March 3:
<UL>
<LI>The hemp plant, breeding, cultivation and harvesting.
</UL>
Third day, March 4: 
<UL>

<CENTER>65<H1><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>Guide for authors</H1><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE></CENTER>The Journal of the International Hemp Association publishes original research, literature reviews and news items on hemp. Contributions concern fibre, seed and resin, and can come from a wide range of disciplines such as agronomy, chemistry, ecology, economy and markets, genetic resources and breeding, history, medicine, physiology, phytopathology, products and applications, and technology. Since the readership of the IHA Journal is much broader than for a single-discipline journal, highly specialized terminology should be defined or avoided. The significance of a statement, or the reasoning behind a conclusion, may have to be more fully explained than in a more specialized journal.<P>
Contributions should be written in English and not exceed 10 double-spaced typed pages (ca. 4000 words), longer contributions may be accepted if they can be serialized in two consecutive issues. Authors not fluent in English must have their paper reviewed and checked by a colleague who is fluent.<P>
Manuscripts can be submitted to: IHA Journal, Editorial Office, Postbus 75007, 1070 AA Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The preferred medium of submission is on disk with accompanying manuscript in triplicate.<P> 
<B>Units</B>. Research papers and literature reviews should use the International (SI, or metric) system throughout.<P> 
<B>Title page</B>. The title page should give the following information: 1) title of the paper; 2) names and addresses of the authors.<P>
<B>Abstract</B>. The abstract should be 100 to 250 words suitable for readers from a broad range of disciplines. The abstract should summarize the aim of the work, the methods used, and give the main results and conclusions.<P>
<B>Structure</B>. Research papers should be subdivided into four main sections: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results and Discussion. The last three sections may be subdivided to improve clarity; a Conclusions section may be added if appropriate. The section on Materials and Methods should be succinct, but should contain sufficient detail to enable the reader to deduce what exactly was done. All abreviations and acronyms must be fully defined when first used. Numerical results should be shown in tables or figures.<P>
<B>References. </B>Publications are cited in the text by author(s) and date e.g. (Smith 1980). For publications by more than two authors use (first author et al. date). Under references, papers should be cited as follows:<P>

</UL>
<H3>Manuscript preparation.</H3> 
The entire manuscript, including abstract and references, should be typed on one side of standard-size paper, double spaced with all margins 2.5 cm. Starting with the title page, label all pages in the upper righthand corner with the first author's last name and the page number. Do not use hyphens unless the hyphen is part of the word. Tables should fit on one page, be numbered consecutively, and each table should be on a separate sheet. Every figure and table should have an explanatory title, so that it can be understood without reference to the text. For both tables and figures, authors should indicate on the manuscript the preferred position of insertion in the text of the paper. Every table and figure should be mentioned at least once in the text.
<H3>Manuscript submission.</H3>
Manuscripts should be submitted in triplicate to: Editorial Office, IHA Journal, Postbus 75007, 1070 AA Amsterdam, The Netherlands. All research papers and literature reviews will be carefully refereed for international relevance and quality. Submission of an article is understood to imply that the article is an original contribution that has not been published elsewhere in substantially the same form, and that it is not being considered for publication elsewhere. 
<H3>Electronic manuscripts.</H3>
Once a paper is accepted, the preferred medium of submission is on 3.5 inch disk (Macintosh or MS-DOS format), preferably MS word 5.0 or later, with accompanying manuscript. It is important that the file on disk and the printout are identical. Do not allow the word processor to introduce word splits and do not use a 'justified' layout. It is very important that files are saved in the word processor format. If the word processor features the option to save files &quot;in flat ASCII&quot;, please do not use it. Please ensure that only the relevant file (one complete article) is on the disk. Also, specify the type of computer and word processing package used and label the disk with the first author's name and the name of the file on the disk.

<H1>VIR germplasm preservation project</H1>

In 1994, the Vavilov Research Institute/International Hemp Association <I>Cannabis</I> Germplasm Preservation Project had its second successful year of growing out endangered seed accessions. The project was expanded in 1994 to include facilities in the Ukraine and Italy. However, additional grow out locations must be arranged for 1995 and 1996. A progress report will be presented by the IHA at the Bioresource Hemp symposium to be held in Frankfurt, Germany, March 2-5, 1995 and will also be published in the third issue of the Journal of the International Hemp Association.<P> 
The most important obstacle the VIR/IHA project faces is funding for the 1995 grow outs. A concerted effort will be made to canvas the symposium participants for both IHA membership and public/private grants to support the <I>Cannabis</I> Germplasm Preservation Project.<P>
The IHA will also present several other talks at Bioresource Hemp concerning various aspects of <I>Cannabis, </I>its production and utilization. We anticipate that this symposium will bring together many interesting members of the <I>Cannabis</I> community and it should be very worthwhile for those interested in the advancement of <I>Cannabis</I> as an environmentally friendly crop (see announcement on pg. 64).

<H1>Diversity in <I>Cannabis</I></H1>

The PhD thesis, &quot;<B>Diversity in <I>Cannabis</I></B>&quot; (available through the IHA), which  Etienne de Meijer defended on 22 December 1994, reports on the evaluation of a collection of <I>Cannabis</I> germplasm at the Centre for Plant Breeding and Reproduction Research, at Wageningen, in the Netherlands.  About 160 accessions were evaluated for traits related to stem production, stem quality, psychoactive potency and resistance to soil pathogens. Prospects for the breeding of improved cultivars for paper pulp production were based on the diversity for these traits, their stability, and mutual relations.<P>
Variation in stem production could be attributed largely to differences in phenological development, which again was related to the latitude of origin of the accessions. Large variation was found for the fraction of bark tissue, woody core and primary and secondary bark fibre in the stem. Since woody core fibres of <I>Cannabis</I> are on average too short to produce high quality paper, the evaluation was directed at variation for core fibre dimensions as well. This variation proved to be very limited and breeding for improved core quality was not considered promising. Accessions were classified into the phenotypes 'drug', 'intermediate' and 'non-drug' on the basis of their contents of the cannabinoids <I>delta</I>-9-tetra-hydrocannabinol and cannabidiol. There were no strict relationships between the cannabinoid profiles and other traits. Significant variation was further revealed in host reactions to the root-knot nematode <I>Meloidogyne</I> <I>hapla</I>.<P>
The study indicated that many combinations of character states can be established through breeding. An <I>a</I> <I>priori</I> grouping of accessions based on the purpose and status of domestication (fibre cultivars, fibre landraces, drug strains, and wild or naturalized populations) was validated by the experimental observations. Contents of bark fibre and cannabinoids discriminated most between groups. A genetic characterization on the basis of electrophoretic patterns of seed proteins was unsatisfactory as it neither reflected common ancestry, nor showed a relation with groupings based on origin or agronomic and morphological traits.

<p><font size="6" face="Arial"><strong>LETTERS TO THE GAZETTE</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Strong families will help cope with
drug gangs</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">The trend is for crack and meth gangs to come
to our city to distribute their drugs and violence.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Juveniles join gangs to gain a sense of family,
community and security. The break-down of the marriage-based
family has allowed gangs to flourish.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">To reverse this trend the State Legislature
needs to:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="4">Stop the assault on the marriage-based
        two-parent family.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">Strengthen our communities.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">Require our judiciary system to respond
        quicker and keep violent and juvenile criminals off our
        streets.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="4">To stop the assault on the marriage-based
two-parent family, the Legislature should give the material
foundation back to family through lower levels of taxation,
review Iowa's no-fault divorce laws and restore parental rights, authority
and control over children.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Fostering a sense of pride in community,
encouraging home ownership and actually having police officers
live in at-risk neighborhoods would strengthen our inner city.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Cedar Rapids area is fortunate to have
vibrant neighborhood associations that nuture a sense of
community.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Pride in the community rises in direct
proportion to home ownership. Balanced budgets combined with
lower levels of taxation do more to encourage home ownership than
any government program.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Down payment grants to police officers who
purchase a home in a high-risk area would make these communities
safer.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Quicker arrests and prosecution of suspects by
the county district attorney would go a long way to keep violent
and juvenile criminals off our streets.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In football, every defensive team has a front
line, a linebacking core and a secondary. If one part of the team
can't do the job, the whole team suffers. So it is with our
families, community and judiciary system.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">With stronger families, we will have safer
communities and less need for prisons.</font></p>

<br>
We are a country without hope. We can see the effects of
hopelessness in our families, our schools, and our communities. I
am a firm believer that we as a people need to return to our
moral and ethical roots.<br>
<br>
We would all like to live in a country where we care about one
another. Not just saying so, but once again doing so. Our current
government has grown to mammoth proportions and has virtually rendered
the neighborhood, the school, and the church ineffective and
without authority.<br>
<br>
It is my belief and hope that our country's government will come
to see the error of its ways and reduce its size in short order.
Government programs are not always the answer to our social problems.<br>
<br>
We, as individuals, hold the key to social healing. When I, as a
Sunday School teacher, see a child who is wandering from the
path, I have a moral and ethical obligation to take that child by
the hand and direct them back to their rightful place in society.
When a teacher sees a student in need of love and guidance,
he/she has a moral and ethical obligation to get involved in that
child's life to make a difference. When the pastor of a church
sees a family without food, he/she has a moral and ethical
obligation to feed them.<br>
<br>
We have spent the past forty years or more abdicating our moral
and ethical obligations to the Federal Government. Those
obligations do not belong on the Federal Government's shoulders, they
belong on the citizen's shoulders, both collectively and
individually.<br>
<br>
I conclude by recommending a 're-teaching' of American minds.
Teaching, once again, from the American classrooms and the
American pulpits, the glory of personal responsibility. The fact
that there are moral and ethical absolutes which dare not be
violated because the consequences are dire. Until our hearts and
minds change, we cannot hire enough policemen to keep the
lawlessness in check. We cannot build enough prisons to house the
criminals in a licentious society.</p>

<h3>OMER C. STEWART CRUSADES FOR<br>
INDIAN RELIGIOUS FREEDOM</h3>

<h3>Omer C. Stewart</h3>

<p> from <i>Colorado Heritage, </i>The Journal of the Colorado
Historical Society, 1982, issue 1.</center></p>

<hr>

<p> <center>&quot;Strange as the religion of Peyote may seem to
some people,<br>
it is, nevertheless, their form of worship, and it should not be
banned.&quot;</center> </p>

<p> OMER C. STEWART, distinguished professor emeritus of
anthropology at the university of Colorado at Boulder, is a
recognized authority on Native American cultures. Since receiving
his Ph.D. in 1939, he has devoted much of his professional career
to furthering the understanding of Ute customs, including
practice of the peyote religion.</p>

<hr>

<p> WHILE STILL A GRADUATE STUDENT in anthropology at the
University of California at Berkeley in January 1938, I was
invited to be a participant-observer in an all-night peyote
meeting, held near Towaoc on the Ute Mountain Ute reservation in
southwestern Colorado. This was my third experience with the Ute
peyote religion in a few months, experiences that were to have a
profound effect on the course of my career. Since that time my
continuing research on the Ute and on the peyote religion has
uncovered a great deal of information about this
little-understood Native American religion. Over the years I have
recorded the similarities in the ceremonies and rituals of the
peyote religion in more than twenty-seven tribes from Oklahoma to
Canada and from Wisconsin to California. Especially have I fought
to protect the religious freedom of those who practice the peyote
religion as formalized in the Native American Church. </p>

<p> Those early experiences in 1937-38 made me acutely aware of
the vast public misunderstanding over peyote and its use. This
prompted me to do a radio broadcast later in 1938 for a
University of California radio program over NBC in San Francisco.
I then wrote an article about the ceremony in Colorado and Utah,
which was published in a local newspaper. These were my initial
efforts at applying my discipline of anthropology to further
general public education. In the meantime I continued with my
scholarly research, writing my Ph.D. dissertation on
Washo-Northern Paiute peyotism in 1939. </p>

<p> Following my discharge from the army in 1945, I returned to
academic work with an appointment to the University of Colorado
in Boulder. As a professor there, I worked to inform the general
public as well as my students and fellow anthropologists about
peyote and the peyote religion. Late in 1946 I began lecturing,
and it seems like I lectured on the peyote religion in at least
twenty towns, demonstrating the ritual objects&#151;drum, fan,
staff, and rattle&#151;and singing several peyote songs in the
American Indian style that I had learned. The questions and
discussions that followed my demonstrations revealed that the old
prejudices against the word &quot;peyote&quot; remained. I became
well aware that a single lecture would probably change none of
these long-held opinions. </p>

<p> Throughout my professional career as an anthropologist, I
have published a number of works on the subject of the peyote
religion. In 1948 the first volume in the University of Colorado
Studies Series in Anthropology was my &quot;Ute Peyotism: A Study
of a Cultural Complex,&quot; completed in 1938, but its
publication was delayed by World War II. Over the years I have
published extensively in the <i>American Anthropologist,
Southwestern Lore,</i> the <i>Delphian Quarterly,</i> and other
scholarly journals. My book-length, definitive study,
&quot;History of the Peyote Religion,&quot; is being published by
the University of Utah Press. </p>

<p> Although my research has uncovered many documented facts on
the early use of peyote, much of what I have learned comes from
oral tradition. While it is most inexact at fixing dates and is
also limited in accuracy, I have received information from old
Southern Ute informants that supplements the early written
documents and also serves as a corrective to some of the written
reports. </p>

<p> Peyotism has been practiced by the two southwestern Colorado
Ute tribes&#151;the Southern Ute and the Ute Mountain
Ute&#151;since the turn of the century. Yet peyote and its use
are not native to Colorado. The peyote cactus grows in a limited
area near Laredo in Texas and in Mexico from the Rio Grande to
the region of San Luis Potosi. While it can be documented that
peyote was widely used in ceremonies in Mexico in the sixteenth
century, the development of the rituals associated with its use
in the United States occurred near Laredo, Texas, and came from
the Lipan Apache. They invented new Apache-style ritual songs and
music and may have added some ritual elements to the Carrizo
Indian peyote ceremony they learned. The peyote ceremonies
contain Christian features and qualities. Since the religion
indigenous to the Ute contained none of these concepts or ritual
elements, the peyote religion spread to them as a cultural
complex. </p>

<p> The documents establish that both the Lipan and the Mescalero
Apache knew about peyote and Christianity by 1770&#151;nearly a
century before the earliest documented evidence of peyotism in
the United States. The transmission of the peyote ceremonies were
direct from Laredo by known Lipan Apache, who were named as the
first teachers of peyotism to the Kiowa and the Comanche on their
reservation in Oklahoma in the late 1870s and early 1880s. </p>

<p> Buckskin Charlie, a Southern Ute chief, was one of the first
to become acquainted with the use of peyote. Oral tradition
states that he was introduced to the peyote ceremony while
visiting the Cheyenne and Arapaho Indian agency in Oklahoma in
1896.<sup>1</sup> The Kiowa and Comanche then introduced the
peyote ceremony to their neighbors, the Arapaho and Cheyenne. </p>

<p> The accounts differ as to when the Ute first learned the
peyote ceremony; all of them document its introduction by the
Cheyenne and Arapaho into southern Colorado. Over the years the
Southern Ute have been questioned on the early history of
peyotism. In 1948 Tony Buck, Buckskin Charlie's son, stated that
in 1900 an Arapaho came to Ignacio two or three times and stayed
for extended periods, bringing peyote and teaching the ritual.
Tony also said that he had attended ceremonies for forty-eight
years and that his father was an early leader. In 1949 it was
again stated that peyotism began among the Southern Ute in the
Ignacio area and spread to the Ute Mountain Ute at Towaoc,
reiterating that the first leader was Buckskin Charlie, who had
been visited by Cheyenne Indians who taught him its use. </p>

<p> In 1948 Isaac Cloud was recognized as the leader of the
peyote religion among the Southern Ute. In an interview he stated
that he commenced directing services in 1915, having learned the
ritual from Buckskin Charlie and his wife Emma Buck. Emma had
obtained a supply of peyote from Sam Lone Bear, the notorious
Sioux peyote supplier and missionary who had settled among the
Uncompaghre Ute at Dragon, Utah, in early 1914. </p>

<p> During these early years of peyote use, the Ute must have
been very secretive or the officials of the Bureau of Indian
Affairs (BIA) were very nonobservant In 1916, and again in 1919,
the Bureau of Indian Affairs agents of both the Southern Ute and
the Ute Mountain Ute denied its existence on these reservations.<sup>2</sup>
</p>

<p> It is indeed surprising, then, that in 1917 the Colorado
state legislature would pass the Crowley Bill, prohibiting the
use of peyote in the state. This law, of course, did not effect
peyote use on the reservation, where the Ute were subject only to
federal laws, but did prohibit its transfer through the United
States mails and use outside reservation boundaries. Colorado
became the first state to pass an antipeyote law. The year
before, federal legislation in the form of the Gandy Bill had
failed to pass the United States Congress. The campaign against
peyote in Colorado was led by women's organizations such as the
Parent Teacher Associations and the Women's Christian Temperance
Union. The precipitating force for the final passage of the
Crowley Bill, however. was Gertrude Bonnin, a Yankton Sioux who
had worked for fourteen years as a social worker among the Ute of
Utah. While in Utah, she became an opponent of the Sioux peyote
proselytizer, Sam Lone Bear, who appears to have been a peyote
supplier also to the Southern Ute. Bonnin lobbied to have the
Gandy Bill passed in Washington, D.C., in 1916, and following its
defeat, transferred her efforts to Colorado, where she met with
success. </p>

<p> The passage of the law did not, however, prevent the practice
of the peyote religion among the Ute. In fact, in a 1926 letter
to the BIA, Mrs. C.W. Wiegel, who was chairman of the committee
on Indian welfare of the Colorado Federation of Women's Clubs in
Denver, stated that &quot;it has been reported to me that during
the past winter the practice of using Piota (sic) medicine and
the form of worship that goes with it has been introduced to the
Ute Indian Reservation at Ignacio and is spreading rapidly among
them. The better class of Indians are filled with consternation
and are appealing for help to stamp it out before it ruins all
the young people.&quot;<sup>3</sup> In answering the accusations
to the BIA, E. E. McKean, the superintendent at Ignacio, defended
peyotism, stating that &quot;it is very clear that her
information is indefinite and exaggerated. It is true that there
has been a small amount of peyote coming at different times to a
few of the Indians on this reservation. I would also add that
these Indians are among the better class, both from the point of
industry and abiding by the law.... There is small grounds for
alarm of its spreading among these Indians . &quot;<sup>4</sup> </p>

<p> Many years later, while testifying in 1953, Isaac Cloud used
the period of 1919 to 1928 when E. E. McKean was in charge of the
BIA in Ignacio, as a time marker. Isaac said that about that time
Sam Lone Bear brought peyote and ran meetings three times in
Ignacio, but he knew that Sam had been convicted and had spent
time in prison. Isaac also named men from Oklahoma who came to
Ignacio for meetings: Sam Buffalo, Claude Hill, George Hill,
Albert Hofman, Brown Flocko, and John Peak Heart. In addition to
being the first important and continuous peyote proselytizer to
the Ute Mountain Ute, John Peak Heart had attended the well-known
Indian school at Carlisle in 1886-87 and was a peyote leader
among the Cheyenne. Although Sam Lone Bear had visited the Ute at
Ignacio and at Towaoc about 1915 or 1916, it was Heart who,
repeatedly each summer, brought peyote to the Ute Mountain Ute
and remained with them for weeks to teach them how to conduct the
peyote ritual. </p>

<p> The first local peyote leader at Towaoc appears to have been
James Mills, a twenty- seven-year-old Ute Mountain Ute. He had
impressed Heart sufficiently to be invited to return to Oklahoma
with him and to be an apprentice in peyotism. Beginning in 1918,
Mills was Heart's assistant in Colorado each summer and remained
as the resident peyote leader between his visits, which continued
until the early 1950s.<sup>5</sup> </p>

<p> While peyote ceremonies continued to be held, subsequently
formalized in the incorporation in various states as the Native
American Church, such rituals, dependent upon the use of peyote,
were illegal in Colorado and in several other states. In 1962 the
antipeyote law was challenged in California, and although my
testimony was stricken from the record, it was restored by the
California Supreme Court in 1964 and was used when that court
ruled that the state had an obligation to protect the religious
freedom of the Native American. The 1917 law in Colorado was then
challenged in 1967 following the arrest of Mana Pardeahtan for
possession of peyote. I also testified in this case. Citing the
precedent of the California case along with the other evidence
and documents provided, the Colorado court declared the 1917 law
unconstitutional.<sup>6</sup> </p>

<p> Bringing the First Amendment fight to an end, this 1967
ruling greatly influenced the Colorado state legislature to amend
its narcotic law in 1969 to permit the use of peyote in the
religious services of the Native American Church. After fifty
years, the right of a people to practice their religion in
freedom had been upheld. The struggle to educate and to inform
people about cultural practices that are different from their
own, however, continues. </p>

<h3>A Peyote Ceremony</h3>

<p> (Text is excerpted and edited from Stewart, &quot;Ute
Peyotism,&quot; pp 8-18.)</center> </p>

<p> The meeting place is a tipi with its entrance to the east. A
crescent-shaped altar and fire are prepared according to custom.
A drum, feather fan, eagle humerus whistle, gourd rattle, Bull
Durham tobacco, and sagebrush complete the necessary ritual
equipment. The chief or leader usually supplies the peyote for
the meeting. Members bathe before the meeting, and about
nightfall they gather in small groups outside the tipi&#151;first
the chief, then the chief-drummer, the cedarman, next the men,
then the women and children with the fire-chief last&#151;all
making their way into the tipi. </p>

<p> The leader places the &quot;chief peyote&quot; upon some
sagebrush leaves on the top of the altar and prays. Everyone is
invited to speak of their ills and struggles, so that prayers may
be voiced in their behalf. The Bull Durham tobacco is passed and
cigarettes are made and lit from the glowing firestick. Each
person blows the first four puffs of smoke toward the &quot;chief
peyote&quot; on the altar and prays. The cigarette butts are then
placed at the base of the altar. </p>

<p> Next sprigs of sagebrush are passed and the leaves are rubbed
between the hands, sniffed rubbed over the limbs, and beaten four
times against the chest to purify the body. A sack of peyote
follows the sage, and each adult takes four buttons. Since the
peyote is extremely bitter and nauseous, coughing and spitting
often succeed the arduous swallowing. Everyone sits as still as
possible until all have finished eating the medicine, because the
partaking of the divine plant during meetings is a sacred
procedure and supposed to be accompanied by silent prayer. </p>

<p> After the eating, the chief holds the staff and fan, shakes
the rattle, and sings the Opening Song, accompanied by the
chief-drummer's rapid drum beats. Only four songs have to be sung
at fixed times: the Opening Song, the Midnight Water Call, the
Morning Water Call, and the Closing Song. During the remainder of
the ritual each man sings any song he wishes when it is his turn
to lead, holding the staff and fan in one hand and shaking the
rattle with the other. Women neither hold the staff to lead the
singing nor beat the drum. </p>

<p> With midnight and the Midnight Water Call, the fire-chief
replenishes the fire, the Midnight Song is sung, and prayers are
offered through four puffs of smoke. All drink water. Singing
then continues with renewed vigor each using their own equipment.
Personal supplies of peyote may be consumed after midnight, and
prayers continue to be offered. </p>

<p> A special morning ritual duplicates some features of the
Midnight Water Call; the fire is refueled and the central altar
area cleaned. The chief then sings the Morning Water Call, and
following the four blasts on the whistle, a woman, usually the
chiefs wife, brings in the water and kneels. After ceremonial
duties, the water is again spilled on the ground, a breakfast
follows, and the Closing Song is sung, followed by more lengthy
prayers and blessings. All equipment is dismantled and put away,
and then the fire-chief leads the exit, followed by the chief.
Once the ritual is over, the women leave to prepare the noon
feast and the men to rest, relating their spiritual experiences
and visions. </p>

<h1>The Lincoln Quote </h1>

<h2>Is This Quote for Real? </h2>

<hr>

<p> <center><img align="left" border="0" img src="linc4.gif"
align="TOP">&quot;Prohibition will work great injury to the cause
of temperance. It is a species of intemperance within itself, for
it goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to
control a man's appetite by legislation, and makes a crime out of
things that are not crimes. A Prohibition law strikes a blow at
the very principles upon which our government was founded.&quot;</center>
</p>

<p> <center><b>-Abraham Lincoln (1809-65) U.S. President. </b></center>
</p>

<p> <center><b>Speech, 18 Dec. 1840, to Illinois House of
Representatives</b></center> </p>

<hr>

<h2>The Story </h2>

<p> The above quote, widely attributed to Abraham Lincoln, has
been quoted and referred to by a number of sources over the
decades, since the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, at
least. I featured it on my web page because it is a succinct and
persuasive statement about prohibition. But, the question
remains: Did Lincoln really say it? So far, based on the
evidence, it is my opinion he probably did not - that it was made
up after he died and wrongly attributed to him. The evidence is
not conclusive either way at this point, but the opinions and
information listed below might interest you. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>From my good friend, Bob Ramsey:</b> </p>

<p> It appears on page 544 of the Congressional Record-House for
December 22, 1914. Linclon was quoted by Rep. Robert L. Henry of
Texas. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>Another friend, Brian Huff, found it in the Columbia
Dictionary of Quotations:</b> </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>Dr. Mark Kleiman, a professor at Harvard University,
contributed the following:</b> </p>

<p> I tried to verify the purported Lincoln anti-prohibition
quote. Yes, we have no bananas. </p>

<p> The standard reference is The Collected Works of Abraham
Lincoln, (8 vols.) Roy P. Basler, Ed., Rutgers University Press,
1953. It gives reports (though not verbatim texts) of several of
Lincoln's speeches in the legislature, including remarks on
December 14 1840 on &quot;Payment of Interest on the Public
Debt&quot; and on December 19 &quot;Concerning Expenditures for
Public Printing,&quot; but nothing on December 18, and nothing at
all about alcohol or temperance (according to the index) during
Lincoln's entire period of service in the legislature except the
great and unduly neglected speech to the Washington Temperance
Society of Springfield on February 22 1942. The index also gives
no reference to the Maine Liquor Law of 1846, the first
prohibition act, or to the word &quot;prohibition.&quot; </p>

<p> A more recent source is Abraham Lincoln: Speeches and
Writings, (2 vols.) Library of America, 1989. Again, nothing on
that date, and nothing on &quot;alcohol&quot;
&quot;temperence&quot; &quot;prohibition&quot; or &quot;Maine
Liquor Law&quot; in the entire period, except for the Washington
Temperance address (which I hope someone with a scanner will post
here). </p>

<p> While it's impossible to be sure that Lincoln didn't say
something, I will give fifty to one that there is no authentic
record of any such speech anytime in Lincoln's career. That's
based on the results of my search, but also on three other
observations: </p>

<p> 1. The term &quot;prohibition&quot; does not appear to have
been in the contemporary political vocabulary with respect to
alcohol control laws. </p>

<p> 2. Lincoln stood well enough with the temperance movement to
be invited to give the Washington's Birthday address to the
Washington Temperance Society of Springfield in 1842. It's hard
to believe that this would have been true if prohibition had been
a live issue and Lincoln on the pro-liquor side of it. </p>

<p> 3. Temperance, along with abolition, nativism, the protective
tariff, and women's rights, was among the movements that
constituted the original Republican party. Lincoln was bold in
attacking the nativist (American or &quot;Know-nothing&quot;)
wing, but if he had picked a quarrel with the temperance faction
there would surely be some record of it. In his campaign against
Douglass in 1858, he was forced to deny Douglass's charge that in
his youth he had kept a &quot;grocery&quot; (package-goods store
and tavern), but his supposed anti-prohibition views never became
an issue. </p>

<p> After a little more research (to his credit) Dr. Kleiman came
back with the following: </p>

<p> I have to take back what I said about there being no evidence
of Lincoln's supporting a prohibition law in Illinois. </p>

<p> The Basler collection has a letter from Lincoln to Henry
Whitney on June 7, 1855, lamenting the electoral defeat of
Lincoln's friend Logan -- &quot;worse beaten than any man ever
was since elections were invented&quot; -- and adding &quot;It is
conceded on all hands that the prohibitory law is also
beaten.&quot; The &quot;also&quot; suggests that Lincoln was a
supporter of the law.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p> <b>From Dale Gieringer, head of California NORML:</b> </p>

<p> I believe Mark K. is right that the Lincoln quote is
apocryphal. </p>

<p> It was investigated by a Lincoln scholar at the request of
Ollie Steinberg of the Minnesota Grassroots party. Like Mark, he
found no record of any speech by Lincoln on the alleged date (Dec
18, 1840). </p>

<p> I've been told that according to the Home Book of Quotations
(16<sup>th</sup> edition), it was fabricated in the 1880s -
apparently by anti-Prohibitionists in Atlanta courting the Negro
vote. Lincoln was well-known for his temperance sympathies.
According to Herbert Asbury's &quot;The Great Illusion,&quot; he
authored a dry law modeled on the Maine law, which was rejected
by Illinois voters in a special referendum on June 4, 1855. He
was also alleged to have authored and signed a total abstinence
pledge in 1846. According to temperance authorities, Lincoln was
reluctant to sign the 1862 whiskey tax that helped fund the Civil
War, on grounds it would condone the liquor trade. According to a
temperance leader who spoke with him on the day of his
assassination, Lincoln predicted that the next great question
after slavery would be abolition of the traffic in legalized
liquor. </p>

<p> I'm sorry to say that the Lincoln quote seems bogus, since I
had it printed on California NORML's matchbooks. It's so good, I
feel tempted to quote it as &quot;attributed to Lincoln.&quot; </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>Peter Webster contributed the following:</b> </p>

<p> From the Columbia Dictionary of Quotations: A.L. speech 22
Feb 1842, Washingtonian Temperance Society </p>

<p> &quot;Whether or not the world would be vastly benefited by a
total banishment from it of all intoxicating drinks seems not now
an open question. Three-fourths of mankind confess the
affirmative with their tongues, and I believe all the rest
acknowledge it in their hearts.&quot; </p>

<h1>Senate Joint Resolution No. 8 </h1>

<p><b>RESOLUTION CHAPTER 70</b> </p>

<p><b>Senate Joint Resolution Relative to cannabis/marijuana</b> </p>

<p><b>Filed with Secretary of State September 2, 1993.;</b> </p>

<p><b>LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST</b> </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<h2>SJR 8, Mello: Controlled substances cannabis/marijuana </h2>

<p>This measure would memorialize the President and the Congress
of the United States to enact appropriate legislation to permit
cannabis/marijuana to be prescribed by licensed physicians and to
ensure a safe and affordable supply of cannabis/marijuana for
medical use </p>

<p>WHEREAS, Scientific and medical studies by the National
Academy of Science have shown cannabis/marijuana to be a safe and
effective medicine with very low toxicity compared to most
prescription drugs and it has been shown to be effective in the
treatment of glaucoma, epilepsy, muscle spasticity, arthritis,
the nausea, vomiting, and appetite loss associated with
chemotherapies;anxiety and depression and the symptoms of
withdrawal from alcohol and narcotics and </p>

<p>WHEREAS studies show that one-third of all cancer patient
discontinue potentially life-saving chemotherapy due to the
severe and debilitating side effects and the same is true for
many AIDS patients receiving AZT or other similar therapies and </p>

<p>WHEREAS, Most physicians surveyed said that they would
prescribe cannabis/marijuana if legally available, and one-half
of all cancer specialists surveyed said that they have already
encouraged at least one of their patients to break the law and
use cannabis/marijuana to ease the violent nausea and vomiting
associated with their current treatments and </p>

<p>WHEREAS, In May of 1991, the United Nations Narcotic Control
Board voted overwhelmingly to reclassify cannabis/marijuana,
placing it back on Schedule II, and making it availabIe by
prescription, and, the United States representative to this board
voted in favor of the rescheduling and </p>

<p>WHEREAS, Despite a federal court order recognizing the
&quot;clearly established medical valuc&quot; of
cannabis/marijuana, and mandating that it be reclassified to
Schedule II and made available by prescription, the federal
government continues to deny access to this safe and effective
medicine and </p>

<p>WHEREAS, By its own admission, the federal government
continues to deny access to cannabis/marijuana for political
rather than medical reasons, and are using patients as pawns in
the ever-escalating war on drugs by following current policies
which place message before medicine, convenience before
compassion, and politics before patients now, therefore, be it </p>

<p>Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of
California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of
California respectfully memorializes the President and the
Congress of the United States to enact appropriate legislation to
permit cannabis/marijuana to be prescribed by licensed physicians
and to ensure a safe and affordable supply of cannabis/marijuana
for medical use; and be it further </p>

<p>Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies of
this resolution to the President and Vice President of the United
States, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and to
each Senator and Representative from California in the Congress
of the United States. </p>

<p>The history of our drug policy is one of the more fascinating
chapters in the development of America as we are today. This
section will continue to grow and I invite everyone to make

subject. By the way, folks, in case anyone asks, we are firmly
committed to publishing all of the historical information,
regardless of which side it may favor. </p>

<h2>HEMP FOR FUEL </h2>

<p><b>Excerpted from &quot;Energy Farming in America,&quot; by
Lynn Osburn</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>BIOMASS CONVERSION to fuel has proven economically feasible,
first in laboratory tests and by continuous operation of pilot
plants in field tests since 1973. When the energy crop is growing
it takes in C02 from the air, so when it is burned the C02 is
released, creating a balanced system. </p>

<p>Biomass is the term used to describe all biologically produced
matter. World production of biomass is estimated at 146 billion
metric tons a year, mostly wild plant growth. Some farm crops and
trees can produce up to 20 metric tons per acre of biomass a
year. </p>

<p>Types of algae and grasses may produce 50 metric tons per
year. This biomass has a heating value of 5000-8000 BTU/lb, with
virtually no ash or sulfur produced during combustion. About 6%
of contiguous United States land area put into cultivation for
biomass could supply all current demands for oil and gas. </p>

<p>The foundation upon which this will be achieved is the
emerging concept of &quot;energy farming,&quot; wherein farmers
grow and harvest crops for biomass conversion to fuels. </p>

<p>PYROLYSIS IS THE TECHNIQUE of applying high heat to organic
matter (ligno-cellulosic materials) in the absence of air or in
reduced air. The process can produce charcoal, condensable
organic liquids (pyrolytic fuel oil), non-condensable gasses,
acetic acid, acetone, and methanol. The process can be adjusted
to favor charcoal, pyrolytic oil, gas, or methanol production
with a 95.5% fuel-to-feed efficiency. </p>

<p>Pyrolysis has been used since the dawn of civilization.
Ancient Egyptians practiced wood distillation by collecting the
tars and pyroligneous acid for use in their embalming industry. </p>

<p>Methanol-powered automobiles and reduced emissions from
coal-fired power plants can be accomplished by biomass conversion
to fuel utilizing pyrolysis technology, and at the same time save
the American family farm while turning the American heartland
into a prosperous source of clean energy production. </p>

<p>Pyrolysis has the advantage of using the same technology now
used to process crude fossil fuel oil and coal. Coal and oil
conversion is more efficient in terms of fuel-to-feed ratio, but
biomass conversion by pyrolysis has many environmental and
economic advantages over coal and oil. </p>

<p>Pyrolysis facilities will run three shifts a day. Some 68% of
the energy of the raw biomass will be contained in the charcoal
and fuel oils made at the facility. This charcoal has nearly the
same heating value in BTU as coal, with virtually no sulfur. </p>

<p>Pyrolytic fuel oil has similar properties to no. 2 and no. 6
fuel oil. The charcoal can be transported economically by rail to
all urban area power plants generating electricity. The fuel oil
can be transported economically by trucking creating more jobs
for Americans. When these plants use charcoal instead of coal,
the problems of acid rain will begin to disappear. </p>

<p>When this energy system is on line producing a steady supply
of fuel for electrical power plants, it will be more feasible to
build the complex gasifying systems to produce methanol from the
cubed biomass, or make synthetic gasoline from the methanol by
the addition of the Mobil Co. process equipment to the gasifier. </p>

<p>FARMERS MUST BE ALLOWED TO GROW an energy crop capable of
producing 10 tons per acre in 90-120 days. This crop must be
woody in nature and high in lignocellulose. It must be able to
grow in all climactic zones in America. </p>

<p>And it should not compete with food crops for the most
productive land, but be grown in rotation with food crops or on
marginal land where food crop production isn't profitable. </p>

<p>When farmers can make a profit growing energy, it will not
take long to get 6% of continental American land mass into
cultivation of biomass fuel--enough to replace our economy's
dependence on fossil fuels. We will no longer be increasing the
C02 burden in the atmosphere. The threat of global greenhouse
warming and adverse climactic change will diminish. To keep costs
down, pyrolysis reactors need to be located within a 50 mile
radius of the energy farms. This necessity will bring life back
to our small towns by providing jobs locally. </p>

<p>HEMP IS THE NUMBER ONE biomass producer on planet earth: 10
tons per acre in approximately four months. It is a woody plant
containing 77% cellulose. Wood produces 60% cellulose. This
energy crop can be harvested with equipment readily available. It
can be &quot;cubed&quot; by modifying hay cubing equipment. This
method condenses the bulk, reducing trucking costs from the field
to the pyrolysis reactor. And the biomass cubes are ready for
conversion with no further treatment. </p>

<p>Hemp is drought resistant, making it an ideal crop in the dry
western regions of the country. Hemp is the only biomass resource
capable of making America energy independent. And our government
outlawed it in 1938. </p>

<p>Remember, in 10 years, by the year 2000, America will have
exhausted 80% of her petroleum reserves. Will we then go to war
with the Arabs for the privilege of driving our cars; will we
stripmine our land for coal, and poison our air so we can drive
our autos an extra 100 years; will we raze our forests for our
energy needs? </p>

<p>During World War II, our supply of hemp was cut off by the
Japanese. The federal government responded to the emergency by
suspending marijuana prohibition. Patriotic American farmers were
encouraged to apply for a license to cultivate hemp and responded
enthusiastically. Hundreds of thousands of acres of hemp were
grown. </p>

<p>The argument against hemp production does not hold up to
scrutiny: hemp grown for biomass makes very poor grade marijuana.
The 20 to 40 million Americans who smoke marijuana would loath to
smoke hemp grown for biomass, so a farmer's hemp biomass crop is
worthless as marijuana. </p>

<p>It is time the government once again respond to our economic
emergency as they did in WWII to permit our farmers to grow
American hemp so this mighty nation can once again become energy
independent and smog free. </p>

<p>[3] The device invented was named the decorticator and in the
mid 1930s it was poised to do for hemp what the cotton gin had
done for cotton: create a fast and economically feasible way of
&quot;removing the fiber- bearing cortex from the rest of the
stalk, making hemp fiber available for use without a prohibitive
amount of human labor.&quot; (&quot;Popular Mechanics,&quot;

<h1>Speech before the Colorado legislature </h1>

<p>This is a rough draft of a speech for the 1995 Agricultural
committee of the Colorado congress, which will be deciding on a
bill to re-classify industrial cannabis as legal. (below 1.3%
THC) </p>

<p>From DMartinCO@aol.comWed Feb 1 12:54:34 1995 </p>

<p>Date: Sun, 29 Jan 1995 17:24:51 -0500 </p>

<hr>

<p>Draft Testimony--1/26/94 </p>

<h2>Agronomy </h2>

<p>Hemp is an annual herbaceous plant that can grow to heights of
5-20 ft. during a 3-4 month growing cycle. It grows without
herbicides, and if grown in proper rotation, without pesticides.
Due to its fast rate of growth, hemp has very high initial
fertilizer requirements. However, up to 70% of the nutrients are
returned to the soil by falling leaves. Therefore, hemp is
overall less demanding on the soil than corn or wheat. </p>

<p>According to representatives from the CSU Ag. Dept, Colorado's
soil conditions match those preferred by hemp. Rainfall will be a
problem, especially during the first six weeks of growth, and so
it will be necessary to grow hemp under irrigation. However,
Colorado's highest yielding, most profitable crops are also grown
under irrigation, and hemp requires about the same amount of
water as corn (1-1.5 acre inches/week). </p>

<p>Hemp can be planted using current seeding equipment, and
harvested using standard hay mowing and baling equipment. In the
future, the development of specialized harvesting equipment will
be one of the many industries created by a new hemp industry. </p>

<p>After harvesting, the crop must be retted, the process by
which the glue that holds the fibers and hurds together, called
pectin, is broken down. In the near future, this can be done
using a process called dew retting. Hemp is simply left laying in
the field for 4-5 weeks while mother nature naturally decomposes
the pectin. In the future, retting facilities will be developed
to take advantage of various water retting methods that produce
better quality, more uniform fibers in less time. </p>

<p>Hemp yields approximately 3-7 tons of dry stem matter per
acre, and approximately 300-1000 lbs of seed per acre. </p>

<p>Hemp offers several benefits to the Colorado farmer. First, it
is an alternative cash crop that can earn around $400-1,200 per
acre. Hemp's natural weed suppression and resistance to pests
mean that farmers will not have to buy costly and harmful
pesticides and herbicides, a savings of $50-60/acre compared to
corn. Besides this, hemp leaves the field weed free and high in
nutrients for the next crop, further reducing costs INSERT CHART.
</p>

<p>Finally, hemp would serve as an ideal weed barrier for organic
farming. Industrial hemp plants are planted approximately 1-3
inches apart, which gives a plant density of around 150-650
plants/sq. yard. This close spacing </p>

<p>prevents branching, which means the plants grow a straight
stem about the size of a finger, with only a small canopy of
leaves at the top. To maximize fiber quality, the plants are
harvested when the male plants begin to pollinate All this means
that industrial hemp is unsuitable as a cover crop for marijuana.
Marijuana is planted with wide spacing to encourage branching. </p>

<p>The narrow spacing of industrial hemp means it is impossible
to enter a field without leaving a noticeable trail. Industrial
hemp is cut before flowering, while marijuana is harvested for
the flowers. Any marijuana plants growing in the hemp field would
be cut before they were worth anything. Male plants are
eliminated for marijuana cultivation, so pollen from male hemp
plants would destroy any nearby marijuana crop. As most police
agencies will tell you, corn is the preferred cover crop. </p>

<h2>Plant Description </h2>

<p>Industrial hemp produces three main raw materials: bast fiber,
which makes up approximately 20-25% of the stalk; hurds, the
woody core that makes up 75-80% of the stalk; and seeds. SHOW
CANADIAN STALKS </p>

<h2>Products </h2>

<p>It has been estimated that hemp could be used to produce
25-50,000 products. </p>

<p>SHOW PRODUCTS CHART. Here are a few: </p>

<p><b>Textiles:</b> Hemp fiber is one of the strongest natural
fibers on earth. These fibers can be used to make a wide range of
textile products, from fine linens to coarse canvas. In fact, the
word canvas is derived from cannabis. </p>

<p>In addition, hemp fiber is a perfect raw material for making
rope, twine and other types of cordage. </p>

<p>According to Pulp and Paper magazine, cotton is grown on
approximately 3% of the world's agricultural land, but accounts
for 11-15% of agricultural chemical use. In the US, it accounts
for 25-50% of chemical use. Hemp fibers are longer, stronger,
more absorbent and more mildew-resistant than cotton fibers. A
lightweight, more uniform hemp yarn is currently being developed,
which would allow production of hemp T-shirts. At the same time,
research is being conducted in Europe on hemp
&quot;cottonization,&quot; an organic process that converts hemp
fibers so they can be used in existing spinning and weaving
equipment. </p>

<p><b>Industrial applications</b> of hemp textiles show special
promise. Hemp fibers remain unchanged at extreme cold and warm
temperatures. According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
fabrics with at least 50% hemp block UV rays better than other
fabrics. </p>

<p>Several companies in the US currently produce textile
products, such as shirts, jeans, shorts, backpacks, wallets, etc.
from imported hemp fabric. Walt Disney Co. carries hemp products
for its Indiana Jones line. Esprit will soon begin offering hemp
clothes as part of its Ecollection. Deja Shoe, a company that
produces footwear made from recycled and earth-friendly
materials, will soon be offering hemp shoes, and 100% hemp
Converse All Stars are already available. </p>

<p>Currently, there is a shortage of wood fiber on the world
market. Prices for wood chips have more than doubled in the past
few years, and paper prices have increased significantly. At the
same time, demand for paper is also on the rise. These trends
will put increasing pressure on world forests. Many woods
products producers are beginning to search for alternative fiber
sources. Hemp hurds are an excellent wood substitute. </p>

<p><b>Paper:</b> In 1916, the USDA reported that hemp hurds could
produce four times as much paper per acre as trees. With
increased yields and improved technology, it may now be as high
as ten times as much per acre. Research is currently being
conducted on incorporating the whole stalk in the pulping
process, which would further increase hemp's advantages over
trees. Hurds contain only 10-20% lignin, the substance that binds
cells together. This is much lower than the lignin content of
trees. This makes hemp much easier to pulp than trees, resulting
in lower energy consumption and lower or no use of harmful
chemicals. It can also be pulped using hydrogen peroxide, which
eliminates the use of chlorine and the resulting release of
dioxin into our streams and rivers. </p>

<p>Since hemp paper is stronger, it can be recycled many more
times that tree paper. It will last hundreds or thousands of
years, while tree paper turns yellow and begins to disintegrate
in as little as 20 years. In other countries, hemp is often
blended into recycled paper or papers made from other plant
fibers to add strength. </p>

<p>Currently, all hemp paper sold in the US is manufactured
abroad, and must be imported, resulting in prices 2-3 times
higher than tree paper. Kimberly Clarke, an American Fortune 500
company, currently manufactures hemp paper for cigarettes and
Bibles in France, and much of the cigarette paper is sold to
American companies. Tree Free EcoPaper of Oregon imports paper
manufactured in China. They are in the process of building a mill
in Oregon that would create 400 new jobs, but without a domestic
hemp supply, raw materials will have to be imported, keeping
prices high. Germany's largest paper manufacturer has recently
converted two mills for hemp production. </p>

<p><b>Construction Materials:</b> Current research at the Washing
State Wood Composite Laboratory shows that medium density
fiberboard made from hemp are twice as strong as that made from
wood. Composites are the fastest growing sector of the
wood-products industry. C&amp;S Specialty Builders Supply is
conducting research on using hemp not only in fiberboard, but
also to make the binder for such composites. Currently, binders
are made using formaldehyde. </p>

<p>Hemp hurds could be used, either alone or blended with wood,
in existing mills with absolutely no changes to existing
equipment. Russia, Poland and other Eastern European countries
currently manufacture composite boards from hemp and other plant
materials. Gridcore International of California manufactures
structural panels made from 50% recycled paper and 50% recycled
cardboard. A 4' x 10' x 3/4&quot; Gridcore panel is not only
twice as strong as the same size sheet of plywood, but also
weighs half as much. They believe that blending in hemp would
make the panels even stronger. </p>

<p><b>Animal Bedding: </b>Hemp hurds also make an excellent
animal bedding. They are more absorbent than wood shavings, and
compost faster. </p>

<p><b>Plastics</b>: Hemp hurds are 50-77% cellulose, the basic
building block of plastics. Until the 1930's, hemp based
cellophane, celluloid and other products were common. Henry ford
used hemp to make car doors and fenders. </p>

<p>Today, hemp hurds could be used to make any type of plastic,
and can also be blended into recycled plastic. Cargill
manufactures a line of 100% plant-based plastic silverware. Plant
based plastics, such as shopping bags, are biodegradable, and
could be composted at home. </p>

<p><b>Hemp Seeds: </b>Hemp seeds are 20-25% protein, and one
handful provides an adult's daily minimum protein requirement.
Although soybeans are higher in total protein, these proteins are
complex, and are therefore difficult or impossible for some to
digest. The proteins found in hemp seed digest much easier. Hemp
seeds can be used to make non-dairy cheese, milk and ice cream,
and can be substituted for up to 1/4 of the flour in a recipe.
According to Udo Erasmus, author of Fats and Oils: The Complete
Guide to Fats and Oils in Health and Nutrition, &quot;hemp butter
puts peanut butter to shame for nutritional value.&quot; </p>

<p>Hemp seeds are also common in birdseed. Testimony by a
representative of the American Bird Seed Industry during the
hearings on the MTA resulted in the exemption for sterilized
seed. </p>

<p>Hemp seeds can be pressed for their oil, which ranges from
30-40% of the seed. Hemp oil is useful for a number of products.
Nutrition: At 81%, hemp seed oil is the richest known source of
cholesterol-fighting Essential Fatty Acids. hemp oil can be taken
alone as a dietary supplement, or used to make salad dressing or
other oil-based recipes. Flax oil, another oil sold as a dietary
supplement, is currently a $6 million/year industry. Hemp oil is
higher is EFA's, reportedly tastes better, and contains a third
EFA not found in flax oil. </p>

<p>Currently, it is legal to import sterilized seeds. However,
importing greatly increases production costs. Besides this, the
sterilization process harms the nutritional potential of the
seeds, and hastens rancidity </p>

<p><b>Personal Hygiene:</b> Hemp oils high content of EFA also
makes it ideal for making cosmetics. Today, most moisturizing
products are made from saturated oils. These oils are not
absorbed by the skin cells, but simply coat the surface and
prevent further moisture loss. Lotions that contain high EFA's
can be absorbed into the cells to help them heal. Many US
companies currently offer a wide range of hemp personal hygiene
products, including soaps, shampoos, moisturizers, salves and
massage oils. </p>

<p><b>Paints and Varnishes</b>: Until the 1930's, most paints
were made from hemp and linseed oils. Rather than simply coating
the surface, hemp oil soaks into wood to preserve it. During
testimony ate the MTA hearings, a representative of Sherwin
Williams reported that his company imported 135,000 pounds of
hemp oil, in addition to the hemp it produced on its Texas
plantation. Hemp paints could satisfy today's demand for
environmentally safe paints. </p>

<p><b>Other: </b>Seed oil can be easily combined with 15%
methanol to create a substitute for diesel fuel which burns 70%
cleaner than petroleum diesel. In fact, diesel fuel was
originally designed as a plant-based, not petroleum based, fuel.
hemp oil is also an ideal base for non-toxic printing inks. While
such inks are currently made from soybeans, hemp is higher in
both linoleic and linolenic acids, which means it requires less
processing and is a superior drying oil. Hemp seed oil also makes
a great all purpose lubricant. <br>

<p>The Honorable Don Ament, Chairman </p>

<p>Agriculture, Natural Resources &amp; Energy Committee </p>

<p>Senate Chambers </p>

<p>State Capitol Building </p>

<p>200 East Colfax Ave. </p>

<p>Denver, Colorado 80203 </p>

<p>Dear Senator Ament: </p>

<p>I am taking this opportunity to offer , for the record, the
Drug Enforcement Administration's views on Senate Bill 95-132,
&quot;Hemp Reclassification&quot; which is currently before your
Committee. </p>

<p>As the Special Agent in Charge of DEA's Rocky Mountain Field
Division, I am charged with enforcement of the Federal Controlled
Substances Act (CSA) in Colorado. In this capacity, it is
imperative that I advise you that the &quot;Hemp Reclassification
Bill&quot;, which attempts to legalize the production of the
Cannabis Sativa or Cannabis Indicia, providing the THC content is
under 1.4%, violates both the letter and the spirit of the CSA. </p>

<p>Under 21 USC 812 (c) (10), marijuana is a Schedule I
controlled substance, regardless of the percentage of THC
content. The production, distribution or dispensing of marijuana
is a felony under federal law pursuant to 21 USC 841. The
possession of marijuana is also a federal criminal offense under
21 USC 844. </p>

<p>As you are no doubt aware, in cases where Federal and state
law are in opposition, the question of which law would control is
well settled. In view of these facts, passage of the &quot;Hemp
Reclassification Bill&quot; would have the effect of leading
otherwise law abiding farmers down the road to the commission of
a felony, under the color of a seriously misguided state statute.
If even one honest farmer faces such a dilemma, it would be an
insupportable miscarriage of justice. </p>

<p>Beyond the bare facts of the matter on the legality of what
this Bill attempts to do, its passage would send a harmful and
dysfunctional message to the people of the State of Colorado. A
recent nationwide survey conducted by the University of Michigan
has shown that the use of marijuana by the nation's school
children is on the rise. Enactment of this legislation would add
the force of a Colorado statute to the perception that marijuana
is &quot;OK.&quot; </p>

<p>And let us be clear that what we are talking about in this
Bill is marijuana. Calling it &quot;hemp&quot; on the basis of an
artificial threshold level of psychoactive ingredient does not
erase the fact that it is botanically and legally the same plant.
An illegal drug by any other name is still an illegal drug. </p>

<p>The threshold level of THC content which the Bill proposes as
the imaginary dividing line between marijuana and hemp
communicates another delusional message. No less an authority
than Dr. Charles Ksir of the University of Wyoming points out
that the marijuana sold of the streets is the 1960s and 1970s was
of this strength. To think that those interested in the criminal
use and distribution of marijuana would forsake the
&quot;hemp&quot; as defined by the Bill is altogether naive. </p>

<p>The claims of the Bill's proponents that Colorado would derive
some economic benefit from the commercial production of Cannabis
are equally deceptive. In the words of Joseph E. Atchison, Ph.D.,
an international consultant to the pulp and paper industry,
&quot;...it would make far more sense for U.S. Industry to
consider returning to the use of agricultural residues which are
grown for other purposes, such as wheat straw, seed grass straw
and grain sorghum stalks, rather than attempting to grow a plant
just for its fiber content, such as kenaf and hemp.&quot; </p>

<p>Although I am not an expert in the economics of crop
production, I believe that my 31 years as a federal drug agent
make me an expert in drug law enforcement. From that standpoint I
can tell you that, in my professional opinion, this legislation
is no more than a shallow ruse being advanced by those who seek
to legalize marijuana. The people of Colorado deserve to be
protected from this sort of subterfuge. </p>

<p>The federal criminal law on this subject does provide such
protection and will be enforced with all the vigor at DEA's
command. </p>

<p>Thank you for giving consideration to my statements on this
matter. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Philip W. Perry </p>

<p>Special Agent in Charge <br>

<p>February 22, 1995 </p>

<p>Philip W. Perry </p>

<p>Special Agent in Charge </p>

<p>U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration </p>

<p>Rocky Mountain Division Field Headquarters </p>

<p>115 Inverness Dr. East </p>

<p>Englewood, CO 80112 </p>

<p>Mr. Perry: </p>

<p>This letter is in response to your fax of February 16, 1995.
Let me say at the beginning that it is, at the very least,
unfortunate that this &quot;dialog&quot; is taking place after
the Committee hearing on SB 95-132. </p>

<p>Contrary to what you may believe, I respect your organization
and can appreciate the difficulty of your position, but I do not
agree with the way you handled SB 95-132. As the author of that
Bill, I stand behind my work and take personal offense to your
letter. Your comments and concerns regarding that Bill could have
been helpful had you responded to my letter of January 12 or
returned one of my many phone calls, seeking comment from your
office. Instead you waited to respond until two hours before the
final Committee hearing. Thus making a response or amendment
impossible and effectively ambushing our efforts. Nevertheless,
your comments should not and will not go unanswered. </p>

<p>First, and perhaps most damaging, were your comments regarding
the federal law. You may be &quot;an expert in drug law
enforcement,&quot; but you are not a lawyer and it seems from
your comments that you are not an expert in the law. Your letter
represents a serious misreading of federal law and a
misunderstanding of Congressional policy. At no time, since
cannabis was first regulated in 1937, has Congress ever expressed
an intent to outlaw the legitimate hemp industry. At
Congressional hearings after the World War II &quot;Hemp for
Victory&quot; campaign, Will S. Wood, Deputy Commissioner of the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics (forerunner of your organization),
guaranteed that marijuana regulation would not have a negative
impact on the commercial hemp industry. Congress provided for
regulation of the hemp industry in all its legislation until the
early 1970s. When Congress stopped, the right to regulate
commercial hemp farmers reverted back to the states under the
tenth amendment. The federal government continues to recognize
the legitimacy of the hemp industry in international treaties and
by failing to list hemp producing nations as &quot;drug
source&quot; countries for marijuana. Finally on June 3, 1994,
President Clinton signed Executive Order 12919 which includes
hemp in a list of essential national resources. The federal law
is far from clear regarding the interplay between federal
marijuana laws and the legitimate hemp industry. At a minimum,
this is a question to be resolved by a federal court after
appropriate argument, not one that can be dictated by your
uninformed supposition. </p>

<p>Second, you candidly admit that you are not an expert in crop
economics, but only after you write that, &quot;The claims. . .
that Colorado would derive some economic benefit from the
commercial production of. . . [hemp are] deceptive.&quot; At
least thirty nations, including France, England, Australia,
Canada and China, disagree with your conclusions. Each has, or is
developing, a commercial hemp industry. The Chinese government
recently allocated thirty million dollars toward the production
of a hemp processing mill. I can only assume that &quot;some
economic benefit&quot; is the motivation. Again it is unfortunate
that you took it upon yourself to forestall Colorado's
opportunity to explore this potential industry for another year. </p>

<p>Finally, are your remarks regarding my character and that of
Senator Casey. You dismiss this legislation that we worked for
almost a year to prepare as &quot;a shallow ruse being advanced
by those to seek to legalize marijuana.&quot; Without the
professional courtesy to even respond to one of my phone calls,
you have no right to level such accusations against me or the
Senator. The hardest part about drafting SB 95-132 was creating
the legal distinction between hemp and marijuana where a
scientific and cognitive distinction already exists. This is the
part where I solicited your help. It is significant to note that
NORML and the other groups thought I did a sufficient job. They
refused to endorse the Bill because it specifically kept
marijuana laws in place. Had you contacted me, you would have
found that my motivation in writing this Bill was not to legalize
marijuana. Rather it stems from the Persian Gulf War where I sent
four of my soldiers across the world to fight for oil. It also
stems from the years I have spent trying to slow the cutting in
our nation's forests. Cutting which will be significantly
curtailed in Colorado in light of the recent block of the Long
Draw and Dudley Horsefly timber cuts. Despite your non-expert
assurances, deforestation continues to be a problem in the United
States and the World. SB 95-132 was one more attempt to slow it
down. Please refrain from further attempts to publicly disparage
my reputation regarding this issue. </p>

<p>Further, and more important, at age 68, Senator Casey is
hardly what one considers an advocate of the drug culture. Lloyd
Casey is an intelligent, honorable and courageous man for
sponsoring this Bill. You, on the other hand, are none of those
things for scuttling it at the last minute. But I must admit, you
were successful, this time. Next time, your element of surprise
will be gone. Rangers generally only get ambushed once. Again it
is unfortunate that our communication must take an adversarial
tone, rather than one of cooperation. However, remember that I do
respect the work that you are doing for our nation, I thank you
and I look forward to engaging you with words. Whether in
cooperation or not, we are destined to work together. Until next
time, keep your head down and, &quot;Make the most of the hemp
seed, sow it everywhere!&quot; </p>

<p>WHEREAS, Kentucky tobacco farmers are now earning less and
less from the State's leading cash crop with the prospect of even
more severe and substantial economic losses; and WHEREAS,
Kentucky farmers have the potential to produce supplemental fiber
crops which are already used in other countries for making paper,
fuel, cooking oil, fabric and bedding for livestock; and </p>

<p>WHEREAS, there is a need to now critically examine and study
in a more positive and constructive way the possibilities of
developing viable, economically sound, and environmentally
desirable supplemental crops for Kentucky agriculture; and </p>

<p>WHEREAS, hemp and related fiber crops are indigenous to
Kentucky but, because it has been illegal to grow since 1937, no
significant research or development has been undertaken
concerning the many legal uses of fiber crops and their potential
for being a supplement to growing tobacco by Kentucky tobacco
farmers: </p>

report on the current legal use and potential legal use of hemp
and related fiber crops for commercial enterprise purposes; (b)
to provide an overview of the historical uses of hemp and related
fiber crops prior to 1937, as well as its contemporaneous legal
use in other countries and corresponding programs for
monitorization; ( c ) to identify methods of selective breeding
of hemp plants and related fiber crops for the purpose of
removing or producing low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol; (d) to
identify and report on companies in the United States which are
currently using in their manufacturing process hemp based and
related fiber crops; (e) to determine the marketability and
economic competitiveness of products which are produced from hemp
and related fiber crops and identify the technology needed for
growing and processing the plants; (t) to work with the executive
and legislative branches on legislation, policies, and programs
for promoting a concerted effort to seriously look at and examine
hemp and related fiber crops production as a supplemental crop to
tobacco And develop recommendations for research programs and
budget request for the continued study and examination of the
potential developmental uses for hemp and related fiber crops. </p>

<p>3. The Task Force shall complete its work and deliver its
recommendations to the Governor and Department of Agriculture by
October 30, 1995. </p>

<p>4. The Task Force shall be attached to the Office of the

<h1>HEMP INDUSTRY IN AUSTRALIA </h1>

<p>From: westender@peg.apc.org </p>

<hr>

<h2>THE STORY SO FAR </h2>

<p>1. ON February 15, HEMP South Australia rang to say that their
government had decided to investigate the viability of a hemp
fibre industry. They were acting swiftly, amending the relevent
laws by regulation rather than legislation, and they expected to
have over 100 farmers engaged in a hemp growing trial by April </p>

<p>2 On the 16 Feb, I put out the following press release for
Queensland HEMP. </p>

<p><b>HEMP MEDIA RELEASE</b> </p>

<p>GOSS SCORNS BILLION DOLLAR CROP! HEMP FOR FIBRE NOT WOODCHIP! </p>

<p>Yesterday the South Australian Government announced plans to
fast-track the hemp industry in that state. In April, 100 South
Australian farmers will begin growing hemp throughout the state. </p>

<p>&quot;South Australia has stolen a march on Queensland in the
development of a hemp industry due to Goss government
inaction,&quot; Brisbane HEMP spokesperson, John Jiggens,
declared. </p>

<p>&quot;The people who will pay in the long run will be the
farmers struggling in the forgotten rural areas of
Queensland.&quot; Mr Jiggens said. </p>

<p>&quot; Hemp is the glamour crop of the nineties. It has the
potential to be a billion dollar crop.&quot; </p>

<ul>
    <li>As a cloth, hemp is softer, warmer, and more water
        resistant than cotton, and commands much higher prices.
        The original Levi Jeans were made from hemp. </li>
    <li>The majority of the world's books were printed on hemp
        paper until the 20th Century. Banknotes are still printed
        on hemp paper. </li>
    <li>Hemp can produce from two to four times as much fibre per
        hectare as woodchipping. </li>
    <li>A hemp paper industry is labour intensive rather than
        being capital intensive like woodchip. This means MORE
        jobs. Woodchips sell for $60/ton. Hemp pulp sells for
        $400 per ton for low grade pulp, and up to $1500 for
        organosolv, the highest grade. </li>
    <li>200,000 hectares of hemp could replace Australia's
        woodchip exports industry - subsidised by the taxpayers
        to the rate of $300 million. </li>
    <li>Cannabis hemp makes the strongest particle board with far
        greater durability than any woodchip source. </li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Marijuana prohibition not only clogs our courts and
prisons,&quot; Mr Jiggens said. &quot; It denies our farmers the
right to grow the crop of the decade. </p>

<p>&quot;The South Australians have realised this. When will
Queensland ever learn??&quot; </p>

<p>John Jiggens for HEMP 17/2/95 </p>

<h1>THE STORY GROWS </h1>

<p>The Courier Mail reponded to my press release by ringing up
the Dept of Agriculture in Queensland, and wrote an article
called HEMP PLAN REJECTED. </p>

<p>&quot;The Queensland government has ruled out the development
of a hemp industry. . . . A spokesman for Queensland Primary
Industries Minister Ed Casey said yesterday the department was
investigating </p>

<p>several plants for the development of a fibre industry. Hemp
was less attractive in Queensland than several other plants
because it was more suited to temperate climates.&quot; </p>

<p>Both the Greens and the National parties in Queensland
criticised the government for rejecting hemp out of hand, and the
Opposition Leader Rob Borbidge said he had commissioned a study
into legalising the crop. This was duly reported in an article
called DEBATE ON LEGALISING HEMP GROWS. </p>

<h2>INFORMATION NEEDED FOR FURTHER PRESS RELEASES </h2>

<p>What I was wondering is this; the Dept of Agriculture have
dismissed hemp out of hand on the assumption it will not grow
well in Queensland's tropical and sup-tropical climate;
Queensland stretches from 29 degrees S to 11 S. I know Italy had
a superb fibre hemp industry. Where else in the world was fibre
hemp grown in tropical and sub-tropical areas??? </p>

<h3 align="center">HEMP AS WEED CONTROL </h3>

<h4 align="center">D. P. West, Ph.D. </h4>

<h3>Weed control is a recalcitrant issue in crops grown for <br>
organic certification. One approach is the prior use of a <br>
competitive crop. In his textbook, Modern Weed Control, A. S. <br>
Crafts cites as potential weed smothering crops: millet, Sudan <br>
grass, sweet clover, sunflower, rape, barley, rye, reed canary <br>
grass, crested wheatgrass, sorghums, buckwheat, soybeans, <br>
alfalfa, cowpeas, clovers, hemp, Jerusalem artichoke, and <br>
ensilage corn. Of these only one, hemp, can be taken seriously as
<br>
an adequate weed controlling mechanism. <br>
The historical testimonials to hemp's ability to control <br>
weeds are numerous. For example:</h3>

<blockquote>
    <h3><br>
    &quot;...it is certain that hemp contributes more than any
    other crop <br>
    towards repairing the damage done by its own growth through
    the <br>
    return of the leaves to the soil, besides other matters while
    it is <br>
    undergoing the process of retting. Hemp is an admirable weed <br>
    killer and in flax countries is sometimes employed as a crop
    in <br>
    rotation, to precede flax because it puts the soil in so good
    <br>
    condition.&quot;<br>
    -Charles Dodge, Director, Office of Fiber Investigation,
    1890.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There will be little trouble with weeds if the first
    crop is <br>
    well destroyed by the spring plowing, for hemp generally
    occupies <br>
    all the ground giving weeds but little chance to
    intrude....In proof of <br>
    this, a North River farmer a few years ago made the statement
    that <br>
    thistles heretofore had mastered him in a certain field, but
    after <br>
    sowing it with hemp not a thistle survived, and while ridding
    his <br>
    land of this pest the hemp yielded him nearly $60 per acre
    where <br>
    previously nothing valuable could be produced.&quot;<br>
    -C. Dodge, Hemp Culture, USDA Yearbook of Agriculture, 1895<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hemp prevents the growth of weeds and other vegetation <br>
    which would be found on such soils in most other crops or
    after <br>
    others are laid by, and its cultivation also seems to make
    the soil <br>
    more uniform in character.&quot;<br>
    -Lyster Dewey, The Hemp Industry in the United States, USDA <br>
    Yearbook of Agriculture, 1901<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Very few of the common weeds troublesome on the farm <br>
    can survive the dense shade of a good crop of hemp...In one
    4-<br>
    acre field in Vernon County, Wis., where Canada thistles were
    very <br>
    thick, fully 95 per cent of the thistles were
    killed....&quot; Lyster Dewey, <br>
    Hemp. USDA Yearbook of Agriculture, 1913.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hemp has been demonstrated to be the best smother crop <br>
    for assisting in the eradication of quack grass and Canada <br>
    thistles....At Waupon in 1911 the hemp was grown on land
    badly <br>
    infested with quack grass, and in spite of an unfavorable
    season a <br>
    yield of 2,100 pounds of fiber to the acre was obtained and
    the quack <br>
    grass was practically destroyed.&quot; -Andrew Wright,
    Wisconsin's <br>
    Hemp Industry, 1918.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hemp has been recommended as a weed control crop. Its
    dense, <br>
    tall growth helps to kill out many common weeds. The <br>
    noxious bindweed, a member of the morning glory family is
    checked <br>
    to some extent by hemp.&quot;-B. B. Robinson, Hemp, USDA
    Agric Bull <br>
    #1453, 1943<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Among the species studied, the hemp species proved
    itself to be the <br>
    best in fiber production. This plant was all the more
    interesting <br>
    owing to its low fertilization requirements, and its ability
    to grow <br>
    without being irrigated and without chemicals, whether it be
    for <br>
    weed or pest control.&quot; Barriere, et al. 19941<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hemp grows quickly, soon covers the ground and chokes
    out <br>
    the weeds. So weed control is not necessary.&quot; -Eddy A.
    A. de <br>
    Maeyer. 19941 </h3>
</blockquote>

<h3><br>
<br>
In Holland, Lotz, et al. tested hemp's superior weed <br>
suppressing ability <a href="FigWeedLotz.gif89">(Figure 1)</a>
against four other cropping <br>
situations in a controlled experimental setting. The target weed <br>
was yellow nutgrass (Cyperus esculentus), a weed also common <br>
in the US, which propagates by tubers and is difficult to
control. <br>
The authors conclude, &quot;...hemp was the most competitive crop
in <br>
this study. Selecting this crop in a rotation will cause the <br>
strongest population reduction of C. esculentus on infested <br>
farmland. This control option of hemp against harmful weeds as <br>
C. esculentus is an attendant benefit of the introduction of hemp
<br>
as a commercial crop.&quot;2<br>

<h2 align="center">INDUSTRIAL HEMP FARMING: HISTORY AND PRACTICE</h2>

<h3 align="center">Part 1</h3>

<p align="center">A HISTORICAL SKETCH OF HEMP FARMING AND
INDUSTRY</p>

<p align="center"><br>
1</p>

<p align="center">Antebellum</p>

<pre>
	Our concern here is with hemp. 
	When we use the word &quot;hemp&quot; we do so to distinguish it from 
other varieties1 of Cannabis sativa L. which are horticultural, not 
agronomic crops and which have other uses but are generally 
unsuitable for the manufacture of durable goods such as paper, 
textiles or fiberboard. Of those other varieties, we will have little 
to say in this context, except in presenting evidence to verify the 
distinction of types.

	The first historical record of utilization of the hemp plant for 
its stem fiber comes from the Chinese who described the plant they 
called <i>ma</i> as having been introduced by the Emperor Shen Nung 
in the twenty-eighth century BC. The wild <i>Cannabis</i> ancestor 
is believed to have grown somewhere in a general area between 
western China and the eastern Caucasus, north of the Hindu Kush. 
This wild ancestor is not found today.
	Jute, ramie, abaca, sisal, kenaf and cotton are fiber crops 
adapted to lower latitudes. Before cotton took over, hemp and flax 
(in spite of the latter's origin in Africa) were the principal crops 
used for fabric and cordage by temperate cultures. The fineness and 
quality characteristics of these two fibers overlap and depend on 
the growing conditions, seed variety and post-harvest handling of 
the crop. Flax, having a lower lignin content in the fiber, was for 
centuries the premier fiber for apparel in western cultures. There 
are exceptions to this general trend, however. In Hungary, for 
instance, the traditional national costume was made of hemp cloth. 
In antebellum America, hemp homespuncalled &quot;Kentucky jeans&quot;
was commonly used to clothe the slave population.

Run away, the 23rd inst. a negro fellow, named Jack, 26 years of age, 
straight well made fellow, has on an old black wool hat, coarse hemp 
linen shirt....2

	Hemp's major use was as a cordage fiber. Its natural 
resistance to rot recommended it for maritime uses, and, as 
European seafaring expanded, so did the importance of hemp. So 
critical was hemp to naval powers that laws were passed in England 
and in the American colonies requiring farmers to allot a portion of 
their acreage to the production of hemp. Were it not for hemp, 
European expansion, the Age of Exploration and the discovery of the 
New World would certainly not have occurred as they did. 
	Sailing ships carried hempseed in their stores and the crop 
was seeded in new lands to provide for the repair of marlines, 
hausers and sails. Ships were caulked with oakum made of the short 
hemp tow fibers. 
	 Hemp was growing in Chile by 1545, in New England by 1629. 
The Founding Fathers were strong promoters of hemp. For a time 
following the War of Independence, farmers could pay their taxes in 
hemp. George Washington admonished, &quot;Sow it everywhere.&quot;3 Thomas 
Jefferson, a strong proponent of hemp as a crop, invented a hemp 
brake and experimented with different genetic varieties. 
	 Hemp production during the Revolutionary period was greatest 
in Virginia where its labor requirement led to a rapid increase in 
that state's slave population.4 Hemp fabric clothed the slaves, but 
was too coarse for the gentle classes. 
	Hemp moved west with the Pioneers. It was first planted in 
Kentucky on Clarke's Creek near Danville by Archibald McNeil in 
1775. The growth and vicissitudes of the Kentucky hemp industry 
have been described in detail by James Hopkins in his History of the 
Hemp Industry in Kentucky. 5 Kentucky was the principal producer of 
hemp fiber until the Civil War. 
	The mainstay of the Kentucky industry was baling rope and 
bagging used for cotton bales. Hemp accounted for 5% of the weight 
of a cotton bale and the fortunes of the Kentucky industry rose and 
fell with the cotton market. But despite substantial efforts on the 
part of the government and private individuals to encourage the use 
of Kentucky hemp by the US Navy, it was generally rejected for 
quality in favor of imported Russian &quot;Riga Rein&quot; hemp. After the 
Civil War, jute and iron bands replaced hemp for cotton bales and the 
Kentucky industry declined. 

	Hemp fabric can be fine, strong and very durable. But great 
skill is required to produce quality fiber with retting preferably 
done in water rather than on the ground. This art was practiced in 
Europe, particularly in Italy, which was credited with having hemp 
fabric of the finest quality. The US Navy insisted on water-retted 
hemp. In an effort to promote the domestic industry, the government 
offered inducements for water-retting. In the final analysis, these 
efforts failed.

</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>The Federal Government in 1841 authorized a bounty, 
which allowed for the payment of not more than $280 per ton for 
American water-retted hemp, provided it was suitable for naval 
cordage. Many of the planters prepared large pools and water-retted 
the hemp they produced. But the work was so hard on Negroes that 
the practice was abandoned. Many Negroes died of pneumonia 
contracted from working in the hemp pools in the winter, and the 
mortality became so great among hemp hands that the increase in 
value of the hemp did not equal the loss in Negroes.6</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Another obstacle to the industry was the location of cordage 
manufacturing on the coast. Rope walks were established in 
Kentucky as early as 1814, but the major manufacturing center was 
Boston, near the shipyards. Raw fiber could reach the east coast by 
ship from the East Indies as cheaply as from the western frontier, 
so hemp had to compete with tropical cordage fibers. For a time, 
tariffs protected the domestic bast fiber industry.
	During the nineteenth century, Russia supplied most of the 
hemp fiber used internationally for naval cordage. (We are told that 
Napolean's reason for invading Russia was to cut off England's 
access to Russian hemp upon which the Royal Navy's power 
depended.) The USS Constitution had over sixty tons of hemp in its 
sails and riggings. 

	From the sixteenth through the ninteenth century, the supply of 
hemp fiber was a matter of significant military concern. The 
strategic importance of hemp would be revisited again in 1941 when 
Japan's invasion of the Philippines severed US access to Manila hemp 
(abac&#135;) leading to a brief resurrection of the domestic hemp 
industry. Hemp is still listed among agricultural products considered 
strategic necessities by the US government.7

<p align="center">Civil War to Depression</p>

<pre>

	The ages of hemp can be broadly divided at the American Civil 
War. The classical period, described above, with hemp unchallenged 
in its maritime use, began to give way in the mid-nineteenth century 
as abac&#135;,  a relative of the banana, preempted hemp for naval 
cordage. Abaca had several things going for it: it floated on water 
and did not require tarring; and it could be produced with cheap 
coolie labor on plantations in the East Indies. 
	Domestically produced hemp had difficulty competing with 
abac&#135; and other tropical fibers because of the high labor 
requirement. It had to be cut by hand and gathered into shocks to dry 
before being spread on the field for retting. When retting was 
complete, the stems were gathered up and broken using a hemp 
brake. Then it was hackled by flaying it on a pin-cushion of long 
needles to further separate the fiber from the inner woody core of 
the plant, called &quot;hurds.&quot; Prior to the Civil War, this work was done 
by slaves in the major hemp producing areas of Kentucky and 
Missouri. After the war, the black population in Kentucky continued 
to find employment in the winter months breaking hemp.8 The ready 
availability of this labor force, and its dependence on hemp 
processing for subsistence, was given as one reason Kentucky's 
transition to mechanization in the early twentieth century was 
delayed.
	The Civil War disrupted Kentucky's hemp economy because the 
primary consumer of hemp fiber was the Southern cotton industry. 
During the war, a federal commission was directed to identify 
cotton substitutes: it focused on flax and hemp as alternatives.

</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>The practice of weaving flax and hemp upon the old looms 
experienced a revival and factories began making fibers into cloth. 
From Fayette County in 1863 came a statement that high prices 
were being offered for hemp and a hopeful opinion was expressed 
that &quot;a vast source of profit will be derived by our farmers who will 
cultivate this crop, as from the present scarcity of cotton, it will 
doubtless be used to a large extent for clothing as well as for the 
many purposes for which it has entered into competition as one of 
the great staples of our country.&quot;9</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>With the end of the war, cotton agriculture revived and the 
optimistic prospects for hemp fabric went unfulfilled. Cheap 
imported fibers, particularly jutea weaker fiber with no resistance 
to rot, but suitable for common twine and cotton bagging
increasingly cut into hemp's markets. In 1872, the repeal of a tariff 
which had protected the domestic bast fiber industry, opened doors 
to unlimited importation of jute and other tropical fibers. Iron bands 
replaced vegetable cordage for binding cotton bales. The Kentucky 
hemp industry never recovered its antebellum dimensions.

	With the coming of steam-powered ships in the last half of the 
nineteenth century, hemp acreages declined internationally. The 
changes brought by abaca and steam relegated hemp to a minor naval 
function: binding the ends of ropes and caulking. Wire cables, 
required by law on inland vessels, further reduced the demand for 
hemp. 
	Under pressure from frontier legislators, the federal 
government enacted programs to encourage the hemp industry, 
including the construction of a navy yard in Memphis, Tennessee. 
Despite these efforts and several failed attempts to expand water-
retting, the Kentucky industry continued to decline. Gradually 
farmers in Kentucky shifted to more dependably profitable crops, 
principally tobacco. 

	Hemp moved west with the Pioneers: Missouri (1835); 
Minnesota (1860); Illinois (1875); Nebraska(1887); Wisconsin 
(1908); California (1912). By 1860, Missouri had replaced Kentucky 
as the major supplier of hemp. At the same time, hemp was moving 
north, being first grown in Minnesota that same year. 
	As the nation expanded, so did its government. In 1890, the 
cabinet office of Secretary of Agriculture was created. Its first 
appointee was Jeremiah Rusk, a former governor of Wisconsin. One 
of Rusk's first actions was the inauguration of the USDA's Office of 
Fiber Investigations to encourage domestic bast fiber production. Its 
first director, Charles Dodge, opined: &quot;There is no reason why hemp 
culture should not extend over a dozen States and the product used in 
manufactures which now employ thousands of tons of imported 
fibers.&quot;10 
	Much of this importation was due to the invention, circa 1880, 
of the self-binding grain harvester which needed binder twine. 

</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>The twine binder brought about the final evolution of the harvesting 
machine. John F. Appleby, Jacob Behel and Marquis L. Gorham were 
the pioneers in developing the twine binder and knotter. Imported 
Manila jute and sisal were woven into balls of binder twine and sold 
to every farmer who owned a binder. The twine binder, called a 
&quot;self-binder,&quot; more than any other single machine enabled the 
farmers to expand their wheat crops.
	In 1882, the McCormick Company, having turned from wire 
binders to twine binders, sold over fifteen thousand twine binders. 
The twine binders with their automatic knotters made possible the 
rapid extension of the wheat belt into the West and Northwest; and 
large scale farming became common practice in those areas. Schager 
cites one farm near Casselton, North Dakota, on which sixty self-
binders were employed as early as 1882.11</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Hemp's greater strength per unit weight made it ideal for this 
purpose. Writing to Charles Dodge in 1890, one binder manufacturer 
testified:
</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>There is no fiber in the world better suited to this use 
than American hemp. It is our judgment, based on nearly ten years' 
experience with large quantities of binder twine each year, that the 
entire supply of this twine should be made from American 
hemp....There are 50,000 tons of this binding twine used annually, 
every pound of which could and should be made from this home 
product.12</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Mechanization has been a feature of American agriculture from 
the time of Eli Whitney. It was the key to the agricultural conquest 
of the nation's breadbasket, the Great Plains. Mechanization 
progressed rapidly in the northern and western states' wheat and 
corn growing regions where there developed a tradition of the small 
local farm implement manufacturers, like the McCormicks and John 
Deere, with inventive notions. The resurrection of the domestic bast 
fiber industry required mechanization of the various stages of fiber 
processing: harvesting (cutting and retting), breaking, scutching, 
hackling. Lacking mechanization, there was no possibility of hemp 
competing with the cheap tropical fibers.

</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>In Nebraska, where the [hemp] industry is being established, a new 
and important step has been taken in cutting the crop with an 
ordinary mowing machine. A simple attachment which bends the 
stalks over in the direction in which the machine is going facilitates 
the cutting...The cost of cutting hemp in this manner is 50 cents per 
acre, as compared with $3 to $4 per acre, the rates paid for cutting 
by hand in Kentucky.&quot; 13</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>A machine invented in Nebraska could cut five to seven acres 
per day compared to half an acre cut by hand using the traditional 
Kentucky practice. But it was not in the traditional hemp growing 
regions of Kentucky and Missouri that the new technologies were 
aggressively applied. Kentucky would remain the source of seed, but 
the fiber crop moved north. 
	With the promotion from the USDA's Office of Fiber 
Investigations, hemp was first planted at three sites in Wisconsin in 
1908.14 It did well. Hemp caught the interest of local farmers near 
Waupon, on the eastern side of the state, who noticed that it cleaned 
the fields of quackgrass. The success of the hemp experiments in 
Wisconsin led to the appointment of Dr. Andrew Wright, of the 
University of Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station, as industry 
steward.
	Andrew Wright recognized the necessity of, one, mechanization 
and, two, locating mills with railway access. Fortunately, by the 
early twentieth century, Wisconsin was crisscrossed with rail lines. 
The industry established itself on rail spurs in the east-central part 
of the state, near Lake Winnebago. With the new mechanical 
processing and rail spurs coming directly into the mills, the 
Wisconsin hemp industry prospered and grew. On October 17, 1917, 
the Wisconsin Hemp Order was inaugurated at Ripon &quot;to promote the 
general welfare of the hemp industry in the state.&quot;15 

</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>When the work with hemp was begun in Wisconsin, there were no 
satisfactory machines for harvesting, spreading, binding, or 
breaking. All of these processes were performed by hand. Due to such 
methods, the hemp industry in the United States had all but 
disappeared. As it was realized from the very beginning of the work 
in Wisconsin that no permanent progress could be made so long as it 
was necessary to depend upon hand labor, immediate attention was 
given to solving the problem of power machinery. Nearly every kind 
of hemp machine was studied and tested. The obstacles were great, 
but through the cooperation of experienced hemp men and one large 
harvesting machinery company, this problem has been nearly solved.  
The hemp crop can now be handled entirely by 
machinery.16</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Andrew Wright was working with Lyster Dewey of the USDA's 
Office of Fiber Investigations. Dewey is unarguably the most 
significant individual in US hemp history. He joined the Office of 
Fiber Investigations just before the turn of the century and set 
about evaluating hemp germplasm collected from around the world. 
His monographs on hemp, published in the USDA Yearbooks of 
Agriculture, 1901 and 191317, remain the most informative 
writings on hemp in America. 
	In the 1901 piece, Dewey describes the status of hemp 
germplasm at that time in the US:
</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>Until comparatively recent times hemp seed of European origin was 
used in Kentucky, and its effects are still plainly seen in the mixed 
character of plants too often found in the hemp fields. These plants 
are so prolific in seed that the growers hesitate to throw them out 
when harvesting their hemp seed.
An ideal hemp plant should be 10 to 12 feet in height, one-fourth to 
three-eighths inch in diameter near the base, with internodes 10 
inches or more in length, and stems prominently fluted, with 
comparatively large hollows, making them thin-shelled and more 
easily broken. The fiber is generally tougher on the thin-shelled 
stalks. The Chinese and best Japanese varieties approach most 
nearly this ideal. Starting with these as a foundation and practicing 
a rigid seed selection for a half dozen generations or longer would 
undoubtedly result in improved varieties of uniform plants adapted 
to cultivation in this country.18</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Dewey explained that beginning in the mid-nineteenth century 
a shift toward Chinese varieties had taken place. Seed was obtained 
through the agency of American missionaries in China and was grown 
for a few generations to increase the seed supply before being 
planted for fiber.19
	Foreign hemp strains required a period of natural selection to 
adjust to the new North American growing environment. Chinese 
hemp appeared better suited to North America than European 
varieties. In a later writing, Dewey remarked that introduced foreign 
strains had to be grown &quot;for at least three generations (three 
successive years) in the country where it is to be grown for fiber&quot;20 
to achieve satisfactory adaptation to the local growing environment.
	Out of the Chinese introductions a unique hemp variety was 
developed which came to be known as &quot;Kentucky hemp.&quot; It conformed 
to Dewey's ideal type and the hollowness of the stem was 
particularly noted. All hemp has hollow stem (<a href="hllwstem.gif"> hemp stem image</a>), but that of Kentucky 
hemp was apparently superior since specific attention is drawn to 
it.21
	We should also take special note of Dewey's remark about the 
&quot;mixed character&quot; of plants in the fields. This tells us that Kentucky 
hemp may have originated as a &quot;fusion variety&quot; from the mixing of 
two previously isolated genetic pools, the Asian and the European. 
The heterosis released by hybridity would produce more vigorous and 
fecund plants which &quot;farmers hesitate to throw out.&quot; Some modern 
Hungarian hemp varieties exploit the potential from this same 
interracial cross.22 
	If this is the case, then Kentucky hemp was an evolutionary 
leap comparable to that which corn (maize) was undergoing in this 
same period from the mixing of previously isolated southern dent 
and northern flint <i>Zea mays</i> populations. If this fusion 
occurredsomething modern tools for genetic analysis could 
determinethen American Kentucky hemp was truly a unique and 
superior type of hemp. 

	Was.

<img src="freshfr.brake.gif" align="bottom">

	Dewey began actively breeding hemp in 1912. By 1917, the 
program was producing notably improved stocks. Progress was 
steady.
</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>1917: &quot;The crop of hempseed last fall, estimated at 
about 45,000 bushels, is the largest produced in the United States 
since 1859. A very large proportion of it was from improved strains 
developed by this bureau in the hempseed selection plats at 
Arlington and Yarrow Farms.&quot;23
1918: &quot;Early maturing varieties, chiefly of Italian origin, are being 
grown at Madison, Wisconsin, in cooperation with the Wisconsin 
Agricultural Experiment Station. This is the third year of selection 
for some varieties, and the results give promise of the successful 
production in that State of seed of hemp fully equal to the Ferrara of 
northern Italy. &quot;24
1919: &quot;The second-generation hybrid Ferramington, combining the 
height and long internodes of Kymington with the earliness and 
heavy seed yield of Ferrara, gives promise of a good fiber type of 
hemp that may ripen seed as far north as Wisconsin.&quot;25
1920: &quot;The work of breeding improved strains of hemp is being 
continued at Arlington Farm, Va., and all previous records were 
broken in the selection plats of 1919.  The three best strains, 
Kymington, Chington and Tochimington, averaged, respectively, 14 
feet 11 inches, 15 feet 5 inches, and 15 feet 9 inches, while the 
tallest individual plant was 19 feet. The improvement by selection 
is shown not alone in increased height but also in longer internodes, 
yielding fiber of better quality and increased quantity.&quot;26 
</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Recently discovered correspondence between Lyster Dewey and 
the Woodford-Spears Seed Company of Paris, Kentucky, indicates 
that the improved seed from the USDA breeding program was 
entering the commercial stream. But despite the earliness of 
varieties like Ferramington and Kymington, no hempseed industry 
ever developed in the north. Kentucky continued to supply seed for 
the Wisconsin industry. 
	The geographic scale of the US solved a problem which the 
small nations of Europe could not: the dioecious flowering character 
of the hemp plant. Because male plants flower first, they are more 
mature and more lignified when the female plants are ready for 
harvest. Ideally, for fiber, plants are harvested before they flower. 
In some primitive systems, the males were removed by hand as soon 
as they could be recognized and before lignification. Flowering in 
hemp is controlled by length of the night. If the daylength is long, 
flowering is delayed. In the US, by growing Kentucky seed in 
Wisconsin, flowering was avoided and the sexual dimorphism of 
hemp was circumvented. In China, hemp is harvested at this stage.
	Maximum fiber yields are obtained if the plants remain in the 
vegetative state throughout the growing season, hence the area of 
hempseed production is best located south of the optimum area for 
fiber production.27 This was the symbiosis which evolved between 
the seed producers in Kentuckylike Woodford-Spears in Paris, and 
another in Versaillesand companies like the Rock River Mills  and 
Rens Hemp Company of Wisconsin. 
	In the Twenties, hemp mills were operating on both the east 
and west sides of Wisconsin. Wright was able to boast that 
Wisconsin had more hemp mills than all other states combined. 

	Dewey's program continued to produce new varieties through 
the Twenties. In the 1927 USDA Yearbook, he described the  breeding 
technique used to develop the varieties Kymington (Kentucky by 
Minnesota 8); Chington (from a plant introduction from Hankow, 
China, able to attain heights of 20 feet); Ferramington (Chinese by 
northern Italian) and Arlington (Kymington by Chington). Seed of 
these varieties was supplied to hempseed producers. 
	By 1929, a variety named &quot;Chinamington&quot; was breaking all 
records for fiber yields. Dewey reported:
</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>&quot;In 1929 three selected varieties of hempMichigan 
Early, Chinamington and Simple Leafwere grown in comparison 
with unselected common Kentucky seed near Juneau, Wis. Each of the 
varieties had been developed by 10 years or more of selection from 
the progeny of individual plants. The yields of fiber per acre were as 
follows: Simple Leaf, 360 pounds; Michigan Early, 694 pounds; 
Chinamington, 1054 pounds; common Kentucky, 680 
pounds.&quot;28</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>In spite of this progress, by 1930, as the nation struggled 
under Depression, hemp acreage was again in decline. The uses to 
which hemp was being put were enumerated by Dewey in a 1931 
article titled &quot;Hemp fiber losing ground, despite its valuable 
qualities:&quot;
</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>&quot;Wrapping twines for heavy packages; mattress twine 
for sewing mattresses; spring twines for tying springs in 
overstuffed furniture and in box springs; sacking twine for sewing 
sacks containing sugar, wool peanuts, stock fed, or fertilizer; baling 
twine, similar to sacking twine, for sewing burlap covering on bales 
and packages; broom twine for sewing brooms; sewing twine for 
sewing cheesecloth for shade grown tobacco; hop twine for holding 
up hop vines in hop yards; ham strings for hanging up hams; tag 
twines for shipping twines; meter cord for tying diapharams in gas 
meters; blocking cord used in blocking men's hats; webbing yarns 
which are woven into strong webbing; belting yarns to be woven into 
belts; marlines for binding the ends of ropes, cables and hawsers to 
keep them from fraying; hemp packing or coarse yarn used in packing 
valve pumps; plumber's oakum, usually tarred, for packing the joints 
of pipes; marine oakum, also tarred for calking the seams of ships 
and other water craft.&quot;29</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>It was largely variations on the same theme: twine. 

	Fiber is a fungible commodity. Fibers move in international 
markets and are purchased in huge volumes where small price 
fluctuations are highly significant. In rough times, quality loses to 
price. Hemp lost to sisal and jute, as natural fibers in general lost 
out to the new, exciting synthetics.
</pre>

<h3 align="center">3 The Thirties</h3>

<p>As has been the general trend with agricultural products, many
of hemp's markets were being displaced by synthetic materials
from the growing organic chemical industry. What was lacking was
a determined effort to develop new uses and new markets for hemp.
Why was this? The interplay of political and economic forces in
the increasing political power of the South and cotton over
agricultural policy, and its effect on allocations for fiber
research at the USDA, has been described elsewhere. (<a
href="FW.ascii2.htm">Fiber Wars:The Extinction of Kentucky Hemp</a>
Hemp was not alone in the erosion of its markets. The production
of flax for fiber had virtually disappeared. Flax was grown
primarily as an oilseed crop. It commanded greater influence than
hemp due to the importance of linseed oil for paints and
varnishes and linoleum.31 By 1930, the country had less than 1500
acres of hemp, principally in Wisconsin. In 1933, with the
country deep in Depression, the USDA was undergoing radical
changes including the first subsidy payments to farmers to limit
production of surplus crops. The South depended on cotton.32 So
it was that the Office of Fiber Investigations was restructured
as the USDA Division of Cotton and Other Fibers and Lyster
Dewey's breeding program was terminated. He retired two years
later. His last report summarized the success of the program: </p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>The hemp breeding work, carried on by the Bureau for 
more than 20 years, was discontinued in 1933, but practical results 
are still evident in commercial fields. A hemp grower in Kentucky 
reported a yield of 1750 pounds per acre of clean, dew-retted fiber 
from 100 acres of the pedigreed variety Chinamington grown in 
1934. This is more than twice the average yield obtained from 
ordinary unselected hemp seed.33</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>How unfortunate that all this germplasm has been lost! We 
have the National Seed Storage Laboratory in Fort Collins, Colorado, 
and several regional laboratories charged with the preservation of 
valuable crop varieties. But in the phytopogrom which subsequently 
developed, Cannabis  would be shunned and with the pariah status 
and the governmental redtape, Kentucky hemp and Deweys selected 
varieties would be lost. As an agricultural variety, Kentucky hemp is 
effectively extinct. Its feral remnant today we call &quot;ditchweed.&quot; It 
is a repository of important genes, not a threat to society. The 
extermination campaign being waged against this genetic resource 
is no less than a crime, a crime against humanity and future 
generations.

<p align="center">Hemp Becomes a Drug Plant</p>

<pre>

	Its probably accurate to say the history of hemp has been, to 
this point, fairly banal. It was a useful fiber supplanted by 
technological change. By 1930, it had become an insignificant crop 
on the verge of being relegated to history's trashcan. During the 
1930s, there averaged fewer than 1500 acres of hemp in Wisconsin, 
with seed production continuing in Kentucky. Yet here we are today 
with hemp apparently elevated to the status of a plant which can 
&quot;save the planet.&quot; How is it that this minor crop has refused to go 
quietly into that good night?

	Although marijuana (or marihuana, as they wrote in the 30s) 
would seem to have been the downfall of hemp, it has probably also 
been the only reason Cannabis did not disappear from human interest. 
In countries where hemp was not subject to the legal encumberances 
imposed in the west, hemp acreage also declined percipitously after 
WWII. Cotton, followed by wool and silk, dominated natural fiber 
textiles, which lost out on the whole to synthetics. Hemps 
association with marijuana did not help, but neither was it the sole 
cause of hemps attrition. It is, however, clearly the boot which 
holds it down. The identification of fiber cannabis with herbal 
cannabis is as inappropriate as the identification of sweetcorn with 
fieldcorn. This latter example of plant variety causes little 
difficulty for most people, who would soon inform their grocer were 
a substitution attempted. 
	The identification was forced from the start and continues to 
be so today. Since our focus here is on hemp as a crop, revelations 
regarding the motivations which were operative in 1937 will be left 
to a separate venue. Hemp is a neglected and valuable agronomic 
crop. It was nearly lost, but was returned to our notice through the 
auspices of persons mostly concerned with the black sheep cousin by 
which it was shunned. These persons have alleged hanky-panky in the 
events of 1937. There certainly was. All in all, the <a href="Sept1,1939.htm">words of Auden</a> best sum
 up that &quot;low, dishonest decade.&quot;
</pre>

<h3 align="center"><br>

<p align="center">Hemp is Not Marijuana</p>

<pre>

	Since now we are suffering fiber shortages, we come back to 
hemp. And those who want to grow it find they have a problem: 
Someone says the kids are going to steal the crop and smoke it to 
get high.
	What are the facts?
	Psychoactive varieties of Cannabis originated in tropical Asia 
and probably trace to northern India where they were valued by 
certain religious sects. Medicinal uses were well known to classical 
pharmacology. The herbal of Chinese Emperor Shen Nung from 
2737BC, appears to be the first pharmacological citation. In the 
nineteenth century, recreational use was popular among an talented, 
though debauched, group of European literati known as the Club de 
Haschishins. By the early decades of the twentieth century use by 
certain minorites in the US had begun to draw attention. Its 
popularity among the artist-musician-bohemian set has been well 
documented.34 

	The cannabis used medicinally and recreationally in the US 
came from the West Indies and Mexico. Chinese and European 
varieties of fiber hemp lack the biochemistry, the enzymatic 
machinery, for efficient conversion of the cannabidiol (CBG) 
precursor into psychoactive tetrahydrocannibinol (THC).35 
Germplasm with this capability originated in tropical zones where 
THC may serve an adaptive role by protecting the plant tissue from 
intense sunlight and damaging UV radiation. 36
	As early as 1889, botanist and plant explorer George Watt had 
written of the distinction between types of Cannabis:
</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>A few plants such as the potato, tomato, poppy and 
hemp seem to have the power of growing with equal luxuriance under 
almost any climatic condition, changing or modifying some 
important function as if to adapt themselves to the altered 
circumstance. As remarked, hemp is perhaps the most notable 
example of this; hence, it produces a valuable fibre in Europe, while 
showing little or no tendency to produce the narcotic principle 
which in Asia constitutes its chief value.37</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <pre>The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 requires all growers, importers and 
processors of hemp to register and be licensed. As a result of 
growing public opposition to the cultivation of this drug plant 
[italics added], the continuation of hemp culture in the United States 
may depend upon eliminating as much as possible of the active drug 
principle from the plant. Preliminary tests indicate a possibility of 
ultimately obtaining a hemp variety with little or no active drug.  
Research on this problem is actively under way.38</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>All research on Cannabis  in the US since 1937 has been 
predicated on, and has served to reinforce, the misinformation that 
all Cannabis  is psychoactive and a threat to society requiring 
elaborate and expensive eradication and suppression efforts. Much of 
basic research funded through the National Institutes of Drug Abuse 
has been directed at elucidating the pathway of THC synthesis and 
designing synthetic analogs. There are now THC analogs reported to 
have 500 times the potency of natural THC so we can be confident 
that a new, potent, illicit drug will soon find its way to the streets, 
as occurred with the coca plant.

	The forced association of hemp with marijuana has continued 
to the present, in spite of the plethora of information to the 
contrary. Cannabis expert Robert C. Clarke has graphically depicted 
the variation for psychoactive potential within the genus using the 
ratio of THC to CBD as developed by Small, et al. (<a href="THC.CBD.gif">Figure 1</a>). The Type 2 Cannabis varieties from 
sites in Minnesota, Iowa and Germany, easily separate out as those 
with THC/CBD ratios less than 1.

</blockquote>

<pre>Clarke and Pate (1994) succinctly stated the difference 
between Type 1 and Type 2 Cannabis:
</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>It is not feasible to 'get high' on hemp, and most 
marijuana produces very little low-quality fiber. Hemp should never 
be confused with marijuana, as their roles cannot be 
reversed.40</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Canadian researcher, Ernest Small has written a two volume 
study of &quot;The Species Problem in Cannabis&quot;41 based on his extensive 
exploration of the subject. He summarizes the debate:
</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>Lamarck was apparently only vaguely aware that the 
distinction he was drawing in Cannabis reflected the fact that this 
genus, through domestication, has been subjected to intensive 
disruptive selection, which has produced two kinds of plant. On the 
one hand, plants have been domesticated for the valuable phloem 
fibres in the bast. To maximize quality and obtainability of these 
fibres, man has selected plants which are tall, relatively 
unbranched, with long internodes, and with a relatively hollow stem. 
Lamarck termed such plants C. sativa. Such domesticated plants have 
been characteristically grown in Europe, northern Asia, and North 
America. &quot;Wild&quot; plants of such northern areas of the world  tend to 
be somewhat similar, either because they have escaped back to wild 
existence from cultivated fibre strains, or because they have been 
influenced by hybridization with such domesticated strains.
In contrast, man has also selected cannabis plants for the ability to 
produce an inebriant. Cannabis synthesizes a resin in epidermal 
glands which are abundant on the leaves and flowering parts of the 
plant. This resin comprises a class of terpenoid chemicals called the 
cannabinoids. Two are of particular importance: the non-intoxicant 
cannabidiol (CBD) and the highly intoxicant 9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
(THC)....Predominance of CBD characterizes the resin of fibre strains, 
and also strains selected for the valuable oil content of the fruits 
(achenes). Predominance of THC characterizes &quot;narcotic&quot; strains of 
Cannabis. Drug strains do not exhibit features related to harvesting 
the fibre. They are often fairly short, possess short internodes, are 
highly branched, and have comparatively woody stems. It was this 
type of plant that Lamarck named C. indica. Such plants are 
characteristic of southern Asia and Africa where Cannabis has been 
used for millenia as a source of the drug. &quot;Wild&quot; plants of such 
relatively southern areas of the world tend to be similar, either 
because they have escaped back to wild existence from drug strains, 
or because they have been influenced by hybridization with such 
domesticated strains.</pre>

<p align="center">The &quot;Other&quot; Industry</p>

<pre>

	Although by 1930 the traditional hemp industry in Wisconsin 
had contracted to miniscule acreage, beginning around 1934, there 
was a marked expansion in hemp acreage elsewhere (Table 1). The 
circumstances which would make it expedient to call hemp 
&quot;marijuana&quot; can only be understood if one is cognizant of this 
development. But, again, in keeping with our immediate purpose, we 
will not undertake here to complete the picture of all the humongous 
forces at play on that historical stage and how hemp became &quot;star-
crossed&quot; in the drama.

	As we see in Table 1, there was a sudden dramatic expansion 
in hemp acreage beginning in the early thirties. (Table 1 data raise 
some questions for which we do not currently have answers. Hemp 
yields, computed from these data, were relatively constant at 
around half-a-ton per acre until the period 1914-1918. Was this a 
reflection of USDA hemp improvement activity, and why did it 
decline again? Also, why does the acreage expansion in the thirties 
not report increased fiber production?)

* These figures are from U.S. Dept. Agr. Bull. : Hemp, Its Production 
and Use as a Fiber Crop.&quot;		


	The relevance of this new industry to our discussion of hemp 
is that it was here that the <a href="../hempmenu.htm">&quot;chemurgic&quot;</a> possibilities 
of the crop were explored. It was this other, new, unorthodox 
industry which was the focus of the enforcement of the Marihuana 
Tax Act by the Treasury Departments Federal Bureau of Narcotics. 
The law was not equally enforced against all hemp producing area. 
This fact betrays a hidden agenda on someone's part. The industry in 
Wisconsin limped along until 1958. It was not bothered by the FBN in 
the thirties, and contrary to current popular opinion, the tax was not 
prohibitive. 
	The chemurgic industry had its roots in German hemp 
technology which had advanced markedly in the preceding decades. 
</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>Cut off from the overseas supplies of cotton, jute, sisal 
and ramie, the German governments reconsidered hemp and supported 
improvements to cultivation, harvesting and processing 
technologies. For example, the development of the so-called 
cottonization process allowed production of a short fiber, high 
quality substitute from the long hemp fibers. During the 1920s the 
substitution of all cotton imports by cottonized domestic hemp was 
seriously discussed.43</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>The decorticator was developed in Germany and it was there 
that the chemurgic idea of using hemp as a cellulose source was 
seriously researched in the laboratories of I. G. Farben. 

	The industry which emerged in the US starting around 1933 
were Amhempco, Inc. in Danville, Illinois; the National Cellulose 
Corporation in Mankato, Minnesota (later renamed the Hemp Chemical 
Corporation); Chempco, Inc. and Cannabis, Inc. in Winona, Minnesota.

	A picture of the new hemp industry seen from street-level 
comes to us from an article in the <a href="WinonaRepHer'37.htm">Winona (MN) Republican-Herald, 
December 31, 1937</a>. 
	The plant manager at Chempco explains their interest in the 
hurds as a source of cellulose for making plastics: cellulose acetate, 
also known as rayon acetate. Rayon, until that very year, 1937, the 
only significant synthetic fiber, was made with cellulose from 
cotton linters, the short, leftover, pure cellulose strands of cotton 
fiber. Wood was another source. Cellulose from any source can be 
used, potentially.
	Another thing you can make from cellulose is nitrocellulose, 
smokeless gunpowder. 
	This article appeared on New Year's eve 1937. It was a year 
which saw the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act and the patenting of 
nylon, the first non-cellulose synthetic fiber, made from petroleum 
hydrocarbons. It is also the year nylon's inventor, Wallace Carothers, 
committed suicide. And DuPont, Britain's ICI and Germany's IG Farben 
were negotiating the division of Argentina's La Cellulosa chemical 
company. 
	This was also the eve of the year when the new Agricultural 
Adjustment Act, which paid farmers not to produce, would establish 
four regional laboratories to explore new uses for agricultural 
produce, a concept inspired by the Chemurgy Movement. The 
proponents of Chemurgy suggested that the farm crisis could be 
alleviated by mandating the use of agricultural products in the 
production of synthetic chemical products. &quot;Cellulose,&quot; Williams 
Haynes observed44, &quot;is the great chemurgic cropthat is, a crop 
grown for industrial use, not for food.&quot; And, he suggested, &quot;The 
chemical that grows is an ideal raw material out of which to build a 
global economy of abundance for all mankind.&quot;
	It was the eve of the Second World War.

</pre>

<h3 align="center">6</h3>

<p align="center">Then What?</p>

<pre>
	It is sometimes suggested that the Marihuana Tax Act was 
prohibitive and forced the demise of the industry. In fact, it was 
minimal. People involved with scientific and medical studies paid $1 
for a license; those in agriculture and industry paid $3; seed 
handlers paid a little more and had extra paper work. Willard Rens, 
the &quot;Hemp King of Wisconsin&quot; closed the doors on that industry in 
1958. He told the author that the narcotics agents never visited his 
company. It was simply a matter of filling out the forms and sending 
off the money. 
	Recent investigations have revealed that the 1937 Marihuana 
Tax Act was used specifically against the short-lived ventures in 
Minnesota and Illinois. Dr. Edmond A. Schlesselman, son of Dr. J. T. 
Schlesselman, Mankato, MN, eye, ear, nose and throat doctor and 
President of Cannabis, Inc, was 30 years old when his father's 
company was hassled by the FBN. He tells that &quot;they had to get an 
agent for every step. It just made it unworkable.&quot;
	The reader has a right to wonder why these companies were 
made the object of FBN harassment when the industry in Wisconsin, 
as Andrew Wright said, &quot;are not concerned about this last law [The 
Marihuana Tax Act] because I believe they were given a very square 
deal in the national legislation on the matter.&quot;<a href="../taxact/1938_MHC.HTM">45</a> The myth is still perpetuated that this 
action was in some way justified because hemp can be used as a 
drug. Agencies of government still draw substantial taxpayer 
support predicated on this myth, and, to avoid having to explain that 
they have lied, the story is advanced that hemp had to be fixed. We 
are then told that new varieties have been developed which have 
fixed it so now we can grow it again. Poppycock. There is plenty of 
evidence that Kentucky hemp never had psychoactive potential. There 
was nothing to fix. 
	So the reader may well wonder what was going on then, and 
what is going on now. 
	This was not the first time hemp had stood on the verge of 
marvelous opportunities. Another &quot;lost episode&quot; in hemp's saga is 
that of George W. Schlichten. This amazing story, unearthed by <a href="../hempmenu.htm">Donald Wirtshafter</a>, reveals the invention of a machine 
called a decorticator just after WW1. Inventor Schlichten, a German 
immigrant, had perfected a process for bast fiber separation which 
handled unretted stalk and produced a superior, lustrous, white, 
hemp fiber. A witness said of it: &quot;I have seen a wonderful, yet 
simple, invention. I believe it will revolutionize many of the 
processes of feeding, clothing and supplying other wants of 
mankind.&quot;46
	In 1917, after spending $400,000 developing his decorticator, 
Schlichten was setting up in California to process hemp. Then, 
Schlichten and his machine quietly fade into history. It is said a fire 
destroyed everything. 
	Schlichtens decorticator apparently worked by the 
differential stretching of the fiber with a series of complicated 
gears and fluted rollers which broke the pectin bond between fiber 
and woody core. 
	The machine was lost, but a man named F. E. Holton, who 
appears seemingly out of nowhere, promoting hemp in Minnesota in 
the mid-thirties, also had a machine he called a decorticator. 
Together with Dr. Schlesselman, and local bank president, Harry 
Pribnow, he formed Cannabis, Inc. In the course of other comments 
at the <a href="../taxact/1938_MHC.HTM">1938 Marihuana Conference</a> 
(which was also attended by Andrew Wright), Dr. B. B. Robinson of 
the USDAs Division of Cotton and Other Fibers, made an oblique 
reference to the passing of the Minnesota companies:
</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>Another argument for the hemp industry is the 
adaptability of the hemp plant to various regions of the country and 
because of suitability for mechanical handling, and these are some 
of the reasons why the office with which I am connected in the 
Department of Agriculure is interested in seeing this small nucleus 
of hemp industry continued each year until it is capable of 
supporting itself. I am speaking more of the industry in Wisconsin 
rather than the promotional attempts to grow hemp in Minnesota 
which one might speak of as unorthodox processing. But this industry 
we have [Wisconsin] is capable at the present time of supporting 
itself if public opinion does not force it to be shut down, or 
additional restrictions hamper it....This past summer, we had 1300 
acres of hemp produced commercially in this country, and it has been 
running about that acreage with the exception that in 1934 and 1935 
this acreage appeared in Minnesota, and in 1936 and 1937 we had a 
big acreage in Illinois, but those were acreages planted, you might 
say, for other purposes than the ordinary use, for there was an idea 
of producing fibre as a substitute for wool [celanese rayon] and 
various things of that nature. Those industries that attempted to do 
that, for one reason or another, have dropped by the 
wayside...47</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>The reader may well wonder about all this. For those who do, 
read another book.

	When Japan cut off access to Phillippine abaca, only the 
Wisconsin-Kentucky operation remained. Seed supplies were short, 
but the emergency production of 1942-4 was sufficient to alleviate 
the fiber crisis. In spite of the approximate $300,000 spent setting 
up each of the 42 mills built throughout the midwest by the War 
Hemp Industries Corporation, hemp production collapsed again at the 
end of the war. The mills were sold off as government surplus 
shortly after the war ended. Many of these structures are still 
standing today, as they were built very sturdily. The mills were 
reportedly designed by Andrew Wright <a href="HEMPMILL.gif">(Figure 2)</a>. Whether in Ripon, Wisconsin, or 
Winchester, Kentucky, they all have the same concrete block 
construction with curved roof and long drying tunnel. The drying 
tunnel was heated by burning the leftover hurds. 

	The rest of the history of hemp, to the present, has little to do 
with hemp. Our attention has turned to hemp again, at <i>fin de 
siecle</i>, as the world experiences fiber shortage, for paper, 
construction material, insulation and textiles. With recognition of 
the cotton-chemical complex, consumers are shifting to &quot;green&quot; 
hempen eco-apparel. And, with rising consciousness, people have 
begun to question how the government was ever allowed to usurp the 
ancient right to plant a seed and use the natural harvest (consider 
Genesis 1:29.). They ask, &quot;Why not hemp?&quot; 
	A decent respect for the opinions of mankind requires a just 
response to the question. It was probably beyond Thomas Jefferson's 
wildest fears of government that it would someday presume 
jurisdiction over this basic freedom, or the Bill of Rights would 
surely contain eleven amendments.
</pre>

<p align="center">PART 2</p>

<p align="center">THE CULTURE OF HEMP</p>

<pre>

	The current dilemma for North American hemp is that we have 
lost the germplasm, the machinery and the know-how of raising the 
crop. But, at the same time, neither is it encumbered by antequation. 
It seems fair to expect the crop will find niches heretofore untapped 
(Figure #), since environmental impact as consideration in consumer 
choice is a relatively new phenomenon. The emergence of <a href="http://www.exit109.com/~leebee/">ISO14000</a> 
environmental standards heralds a new paradigm surpassing 
ISO9000 Quality standards in manufacturing. Powerful forces 
canalizing twentieth century society into the consumption of 
synthetic goods have, until recently, met with little resistance. 
Perhaps this is changing.

	Newly available are two classic references on hemp from 
studies in the US. Dewey's 1913 USDA Yearbook of Agriculture 
article on hemp was reproduced in Rosenthals Hemp Today. The 1944 
Iowa State Experiment Station Farm Bulletin, P63, &quot;Hemp Production 
Experiments&quot; is appended here. This latter publication is the most 
comprehensive study done in the US on hemp husbandry. Both these 
sources should be read in their entirety. 
	The farmer who wishes to grow this crop must determine what 
his/her intended use is for the harvested product. Today, the 
potential uses for hemp are more numerous than have previously 
been recognized, and, to varying degrees, each should be considered 
an individual crop with specific varieties, seeding rates and 
management. If seed is the crop, and stem is the byproduct (suitable 
for paper and composite lumber, not for textiles), the grower should 
seek a seed (monoecious) variety. But if fine textiles are the goal, 
the crop will be taken before flowering. A Hungarian kompolti 
variety is recommended. Likewise, if the market for the hemp stalk 
is replacing wood chips in fiberboard, it may well be that a high 
percentage of core (smaller hollow) is preferable and breeding 
selection will develop appropriate varieties. The feral germplasm in 
North America may be particularly valuable in this case.

	The hurdsthe leftover, broken, inner woody corehave been 
something of a nuisance historically. When stems were <a href="wrkgstacks.gif">broken in the field </a>by moving the break 
from shock to shock, the hurds quickly composted into the soil. The 
Wisconsin industry used the hurds to heat the drying tunnel through 
which the stems moved on their way to the decorticator. Hurds were 
reportedly still leftover in abundance and were given away to 
farmers for animal bedding. Today, Hemcore in Britain has found a 
market selling hurds for horse bedding: it composts faster than 
straw or wood chips, it is four times more absorbent and it does not 
tangle into the animals hair.
	Animal bedding is only one of the uses rediscovered or newly 
invented for this former byproduct. Cellulose, such as the Minnesota 
companies were intending in the 1930s, is another. In France, 
Isochanvre is a building material made by mixing hemp hurds and 
plaster. It is seven times lighter than concrete and has superior 
thermal and acoustic insulating properties. But in France, hurds are 
only available as a byproduct from the hemp industry licensed for 
fiber production, thus limiting the expansion of this usage. 

</pre>

<h3 align="center">1</h3>

<p align="center">Hemp As Organic Weed Control</p>

<pre>
	The first synthetic herbicides appeared in the 1930s. Since 
that time the chemical dependency of farms has been progressively 
secured. Non-chemical approaches have generally been relegated to 
&quot;fringe&quot; associations. Recently though, the concept of sustainability 
in agriculture has been finding greater academic support. A 
component of sustainability is responsible use of agchemicals, with 
emphasis on reduction in favor of &quot;organic&quot; methodologies. Hemp has 
an important role to play in sustainable and organic agriculture 
systems because it can clean fields of weeds.

	 In his textbook, Modern Weed Control, A. S. Crafts cites as 
potential weed smothering crops: millet, Sudan grass, sweet clover, 
sunflower, rape, barley, rye, reed canary grass, crested wheatgrass, 
sorghums, buckwheat, soybeans, alfalfa, cowpeas, clovers, hemp, 
Jerusalem artichoke, and ensilage corn. Of these only one, hemp, can 
be taken seriously as an adequate weed controlling competitive crop. 
	The testimonials to hemp-as-weed-control are legion. Some 
examples:
</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>&quot;...it is certain that hemp contributes more than any other crop 
towards repairing the damage done by its own growth through the 
return of the leaves to the soil, besides other matters while it is 
undergoing the process of retting. Hemp is an admirable weed killer 
and in flax countries is sometimes employed as a crop in rotation, to 
precede flax because it puts the soil in so good condition.&quot;
Charles Dodge, Director, Office of Fiber Investigation, 1890.

&quot;There will be little trouble with weeds if the first crop is well 
destroyed by the spring plowing, for hemp generally occupies all the 
ground giving weeds but little chance to intrude....In proof of this, a 
North River farmer a few years ago made the statement that thistles 
heretofore had mastered him in a certain field, but after sowing it 
with hemp not a thistle survived, and while ridding his land of this 
pest the hemp yielded him nearly $60 per acre where previously 
nothing valuable could be produced.&quot;
C. Dodge, Hemp Culture, USDA Yearbook of Agriculture, 1895

&quot;Hemp prevents the growth of weeds and other vegetation which 
would be found on such soils in most other crops or after others are 
laid by, and its cultivation also seems to make the soil more uniform 
in character.&quot;
Lyster Dewey, The Hemp Industry in the United States, USDA 
Yearbook of Agriculture, 1901


&quot;Very few of the common weeds troublesome on the farm can survive 
the dense shade of a good crop of hemp...In one 4-acre field in Vernon 
County, Wis., where Canada thistles were very thick, fully 95 per 
cent of the thistles were killed....&quot; Lyster Dewey, Hemp. USDA 
Yearbook of Agriculture, 1913.

&quot;Hemp has been demonstrated to be the best smother crop for 
assisting in the eradication of quack grass and Canada thistles....At 
Waupon in 1911 the hemp was grown on land badly infested with 
quack grass, and in spite of an unfavorable season a yield of 2,100 
pounds of fiber to the acre was obtained and the quack grass was 
practically destroyed.&quot; Andrew Wright, Wisconsin's Hemp Industry, 
1918.

&quot;Hemp has been recommended as a weed control crop. Its dense, tall 
growth helps to kill out many common weeds. The noxious bindweed, 
a member of the morning glory family is checked to some extent by 
hemp.&quot;B. B. Robinson, Hemp, USDA Agric Bull #1453, 1943

&quot;Among the species studied, the hemp species proved itself to be the 
best in fiber production. This plant was all the more interesting 
owing to its low fertilization requirements, and its ability to grow 
without being irrigated and without chemicals, whether it be for 
weed or pest control.&quot;  Barriere, et al. 199448

&quot;Hemp grows quickly, soon covers the ground and chokes out the 
weeds. So weed control is not necessary.&quot; Eddy A. A. de Maeyer. 
1994 54

&quot;In an age increasingly interested in sustainable agriculture and crop 
diversification, hemp offers some attractive possibilities.  It is 
exceptionally disease and herbivore-resistant, can be easily grown 
in a wide range of agricultural systems and is an excellent rotation 
crop which eliminates weeds.&quot; --Gordon Reichert, 1994.49

	In Holland, Lotz, et al. tested hemp's superior weed 
suppressing ability (Figure 1) against four other cropping situations 
in a controlled experimental setting. The target weed was yellow 
nutgrass (Cyperus esculentus), a weed also common in the US, which 
propagates by tubers and is difficult to control. The authors 
conclude, &quot;...hemp was the most competitive crop in this study. 
Selecting this crop in a rotation will cause the strongest population 
reduction ofC. esculentus on infested farmland. This control option 
of hemp against harmful weeds as C. esculentus is an attendant 
benefit of the introduction of hemp as a commercial crop.&quot;50
</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Although the historical record contains testimonials to hemp's 
rather benign impact on the land, and instances where it has been 
grown in monoculture for over twenty years, it is not recommended 
that hemp be grown repeatedly on the same plot. Two successive 
years of hemp, if properly fertilized, will not be injurious and in 
cases of recalcitrant weeds, may be required to clean the fields. A 
favorable rotation includes a nitrogen fixer alternating with hemp 
and row crops or small grains. Hemp will do well in rotation with 
alfalfa and corn. The old-timer's rule of thumb was, &quot;any land that 
grows a good crop of corn will grow good hemp.&quot;
	Kok and Coenen (1994) reported that hemp was a poor host for 
<i>Meloidogyne chitwoodii</i>, a nematode pest. Hemp grown on 
infested acreage would not support proliferation of this pest.51 In a 
similar vein, Mankowski, et al. (1994) reported growing hemp on land 
polluted with heavy metals. The metals were taken up into roots and 
stem.52

<p align="center">Agronomics</p>

<pre>
Seed Variety
	In a sophisticated, industrial society in which hemp is a 
cropping option on equal footing with all others (corn, soybean, 
cotton, etc.), varieties will be bred by commercial plant breeders for 
specific uses. Multi-purpose varieties may also be bred, although it 
is often the case that such varieties fail to optimize their primary 
economic traits. 
	At this stage, available varieties have been bred for fiber. 
Broadly classified, hemp varieties are either monoecious or 
dioecious, that is having the sexes on the same or separate plants, 
respectively. Monoecious varieties have been bred in France, 
primarily. The advantage is greater uniformity and increased yield of 
seed. Monoecious varieties are best where a dual usagefiber and 
seedis desired. Bosca, the great Hungarian hemp breeder, has 
pointed out that monoecious varieties suffer a degree of inbreeding 
(perhaps 20%) which would decrease potential.53 
	Current legal encumberances to the hemp crop tend to mitigate 
in favor of French varieties. Nonetheless, varieties from Hungary, 
Poland and the Ukraine should be considered as well. Only in Hungary 
have hybrid varieties been developed. Elsewhere, the eastern 
European hemps are dioecious, open-pollinated synthetics, rather 
like the type of corn (maize) grown prior to the advent of 
hybridization in the early decades of this century. The significance 
of this relates to the manner in which the seed supply is reproduced. 
Hybrid varieties require fairly elaborate operations to maintain the 
parent materials which are crossed to create the hybrid variety 
planted by the farmer. Considerable research goes into identifying 
specific genotypes which, when hybridized, combine genetically for 
optimum productivity. However, the farmer must depend on an 
industry which manages the seed production. This dependence, 
decried by some, seems to have served farmers in the case of corn. 
It is generally true that hybrid varieties are made if manipulation of 
pollination is practical. The corn plants morphology, for instance, 
allows easy emasculation (detassling).
	Male hemp plants can be physically removed from a dioecious 
population serving as seed parent. Certain Hungarian hemp hybrids 
are made using a technique which employs the ability to make 
unisexual (female) populations which can function in a manner 
analogous to male-sterility to facilitate crossing. Currently, hemp 
hybrids grown by the farmer are acutally the F2, or second 
generation. Higher yields result, but uniformity, such as we are 
accustomed to in F1 corn hybrids, will be lacking. So far hemp has 
been recalcitrant to inbreeding (so was corn, in the early stages). 
Hemp varieties are therefore inherently variable.  Because of genetic 
segregation, subsequent generations from that immediately 
following hybridization (F1) are even more variable. Thus, the trade-
off for performance is the need to purchase planting seed each year. 
Use of bin-run seed is inadvisable from this perspective. At 
present, this matters little, as it is probable that farmers growing 
hemp in the near future will be required to obtain their seed from 
certified seed growers to assure compliance with THC regulation. 
This hang-up will no doubt ultimately be recognized as silly, but 
while competing interests control public policy, we will be forced 
to accommodate. (These competing interests will attempt to 
entangle hemp farming in a plethora of redtape, with which it may 
be strangled. Excessive accommodation is not recommended.) One 
promising system has been suggested in Kentucky and will be 
discussed later.

	If the variety is not hybrid, the owner of the variety, such as 
the various bast fiber institutes of Eastern Europe, is likely to 
require the buyer to sign a contract promising not to reproduce it 
(save seed for replanting or sale). Germplasm is handled like 
software in these modern times, and as such it is private property. 
Right to ownership of germplasm assures the breeder that research 
costs can be recouped. Today, it is even possible to patent seed 
varieties. Like it or not, such developments can be anticipated for 
hemp as it becomes a more sophisticated crop. 

	There are many hemps which are excluded by current 
regulations, including some superior Hungarian hybrids as well as 
hemps which have not sought inclusion, such as the Chinese and 
Chilean hemps. The 0.3% THC threshold was established more on 
political than scientific grounds and is in need of serious 
reevaluation. Countries newly opening to hemp should not adapt this 
outmoded criterion without assessing the implications it has for 
germplasm options.
	Because hemp varieties adapted to North America have been 
lost, the North American farmer will, for the near-term, be required 
to import seed. This is only one of the barriers to be faced. When 
importing seed, the buyer must ensure that the seed is accompanied 
by the appropriate forms. First of these is the phytosanitary 
certificate, which the seller should provide. This certificate 
indicates that the seed has been inspected and is free of disease 
organisms which could introduce a disease to the indigenous crop 
(irony aside). There may also be a requirement for the &quot;Orange 
International Seedlot Certificate.&quot; Again, it is the responsibility of 
the seller to make sure this form accompanies the seed. It is 
important for the buyer to remind the seller of these requirements 
as some hempseed sources in Eastern Europe may be unfamiliar with 
these requirements.
	The expectant hemp farmer is advised that the rigmarole 
implicit in having to import the seed necessitates initiating the 
seed acquisition well in advance. 

	LAND PREPARATION
	Hemp is not a crop to be grown haphazardly or sloppily. Many 
reports indicate an intimate relationship between fiber quality and 
the character of the land. Bear in mind that hemp varieties do not 
have the genetic uniformity that North American farmers are 
accustomed to in their F1-hybrid corn varieties or their wheat and 
soybeans. In the case of corn, all plants of a given variety are 
genetically the same because the hybrids are created from carefully 
bred and selected inbred lines which are genetically homozygous 
(lacking variation). Soybean and wheat are self-pollinating crops 
which are themselves inbred and homozygous. A variety of a self-
pollianted crop generally traces back to a superior individual plant 
selection which was increased for commercial distribution.
	Hemp has so far been quite recalcitrant to inbreeding. The 
separation of the sexes ensures that individual plants do not mate 
with themselves. When hemp is forced to inbreed, the vigor and 
fecundity of progenies declines rapidly and the lineage is quickly 
extinguished. This then means that varieties are maintained as pools 
of genetic variation, rather like a race, or regionalism. Within a 
generally recognizable type, a wide range of variation is found from 
individual to individual.
	So?
	One consequence of the genetic variation among individual 
plants in the field is that some will have greater vigor than others 
just by the random assortment of genes each generation. Given the 
opportunity, these plants can outgrow their weaker neighbors, 
crowding them out and leading to great irregularity in the crop. 
	Preparation of the land is always highly emphasized in 
standard discussions of hemp culture. Unevenness in the field due to 
improper tillage or fertilization will contribute to undesirable plant 
to plant variation.  Plowing should be deep, followed by harrowing 
until a smooth, level bed is developed. Excessive clumping of soil, 
dead furrows, recalcitrant weed patches and uneven fertility are to 
be assiduously avoided. Care in preparation of the seed bed is 
probably the single most significant factor in the production of 
quality hemp fiber. If the field has had a bad weed infestation, it is 
important to fully disk down the weeds so that hemp will get a jump 
on them. Once hemp is established, it will generally suppress weeds, 
as we have repeatedly emphasized.
	Fertilization is a complicated issue when it comes to hemp. 
The reader is referred for details to the appended Iowa State 
Bulletin. If the hemp is being grown for fiber, quality features are as 
important as total biomass yield. Pouring on the nitrogen will 
increase yield, this has been adequately demonstrated. But too much 
nitrogen leads to coarse, rank growth. The best source of nitrogen is 
the prior growth of a nitrogen fixing legume, preferably alfalfa or 
clover and application of manure. The authors of the bulletin 
indicate that soybeans are less effective at providing nitrogen to a 
following hemp crop. (See Figures 14 &amp; 17 in the bulletin.)
	Hessler54 concurred with the effect of over-fertilization. 
Furthermore, he demonstrated that &quot;a definitely weaker fiber was 
produced where fertilizers containing nitrogen were used.&quot; Nitrogen 
was found to increase the protein content of the stem to the 
detriment of strength. The weakest samples had the highest nitrogen 
content. Van der Werf55 demonstrated that excess nitrogen 
fertilization increased interplant competition leading to greater 
self-thinning in the crop and uneven growth. 

	Dempsey, in his classic work, Fiber Crops,56 presents a table 
indicating that hemps removal of nutrients greatly exceeds that of 
maize and other grains. Since this table has been reproduced in the 
recent, popular, <a href="http://www.mbnet.mb.ca/~langtree/reichert.html">AgCanada BiWeekly Bulletin: Hemp</a>,57 Hemp, it is 
important to point out that the maize yields represented in the table 
are unrealistically low for modern farming. The general rule-of-
thumb for corn farmers is &quot;a pound of N for every bushel of expected 
yield.&quot; At such rates, and, moreover, considering that the majority 
of N hemp uses for growth can be returned to the soil, the soil 
budget for hemp is even more attractive. 
	The Iowa Bulletin indicates that inorganic fertilizer of the 
same kind commonly used for corn works well for hemp. Kozlowski, 
in Poland, recommends 80-110lbs/acre available nitrogen (N); 60-90 
phosphorus (P); 135-160 potassium (K); 14-18 calcium (CaO). This 
considerable range leaves much open to the farmer's 
experimentation. Fiber and seed crops are handled differently:
ratio N:P:K
1:0.7:1.5 (fiber)
1:0.8: 1 (seed)58

	Given its weed control function, hemp works well into 
&quot;organic&quot; agriculture. Hemp is reported to perform best on well-
manured soils with high organic matter (well-drained). Naturally, 
the soil nutrient status should be thoroughly tested and periodically 
monitored. Although hemp is reported to accept soil acidity as low 
as pH 5.5, neutral pH is recommended. Lime accordingly.
	Hemp may be drilled or broadcast. Drilling is recommended for 
uniformity. A grain drill or modified alfalfa seeder can be used. 
Planting depth is between 0.5 and 1.0 inch, although greater depths 
are occasionally recommended (up to 2 inches in Poland). Row
 spacing for fiber should be four to seven inches, 50-60lbs/acre (a bushel and a peck). (Variability in germination can be a problem 
among hemp seedlots. The grower is well advised to test a sample 
and adjust planting rate accordingly, at least until the seed industry 
takes responsibility for this crop.)
	The seed crop is planted much less densely (the seed crop is 
not a weed controller) at about twenty-inch spacing, approximately 
10lbs/acre. A bushel of Kentucky hemp seed weighed 44 pounds. 
	There are circumstances, for instance, the production of fine, 
flaxen, water-retted textile fiber, which warrant planting at much 
higher rates, hundreds of pounds of seed to the acre. There is much 
opportunity for experimentation by individual farmers to determine 
optimium practice in their specific environment.
	Hemp can be planted early. Recommended soil temperature for 
planting is 8-10C. In Wisconsin the crop was planted before corn. It 
can generally be the first crop seeded. Darsie, et al. (1914), reported 
the temperature of the emerging hemp seed to be the highest of the 
plants they surveyed.59 It generates its own heat metabolizing its 
seed oil. This early emergence character of hemp is a component of 
its weed suppression. 

	Another positive attribute of the crop is that once it is 
planted, no further husbandry is required until harvest. This &quot;plant 
it/harvest it&quot; aspect of the crop reduces energy consumption as 
well as soil compaction from passes by spraying and cultivating 
equipment. Although in damp climates, the crop can suffer from the 
<i>Botryis</i> leaf fungus, treatment is not deamed worthwhile. 
Similarly, European corn borer, a pest of corn, has been reported to 
occasionally burrow a hemp stalk. But no insects bother the crop 
sufficiently to warrant remediation. 
	Researchers in Manitoba in 1995 had some negative 
experiences both with insects and weeds. The crop was planted late 
because the permitting redtape delayed seed shipments. Furthermore 
the varieties were imported from Eastern Europe since or own 
adapted material is no longer available. This is not an uber-crop 
impervious to all the viscissitudes of environment. Properly 
managed adapted varieties throughout the world have a very positive 
track record on pest problems.
	Birds, on the other hand, can be a serious problem in the seed 
crop. Birds love hempseed. Good luck.

	HARVEST

	This is where things start getting more complicated. 

	The Kentucky Hemp Growers Co-operative Association, 
recently reincarnated from its 1942 charter, is ahead of the ball on 
the practical aspects of organizing the production of this crop. Their 
system borrows from the tobacco model, familiar to most farmers 
in the state:
	In their model, all aspects of the crop would be handled 
through the co-op. 
</pre>

<blockquote>
    <pre>Farmers plant seed provided by the co-op; this provides 
for control of genotype. 
The co-op manages issues related to hemp variety evaluation and 
certification in compliance with legalities. Just as the cannery 
specifies the pea variety to the farmer, so does the hemp co-op allot 
acreages for specific hemps. The co-op forward contracts with fiber 
end-users for the needed  production. Acreages are alloted 
accordingly among co-op member farmers.
Marketing of the fiber is handled through the co-op. The crop can 
only be grown under contract to the co-op. It cannot be grown &quot;on 
spec.&quot; Supply/demand relationships are managed to maintain 
profitability for the farmer. 
A grower must be a member of the co-op and bonded. Members found 
violating variety control regulations lose their allotment and forfeit 
their bond.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>In the Kentucky Co-op model, conceived for Kentucky 
conditions, farmers hold the fiber on-farm, probably in a baled form, 
and disperse it to the mills over the year, providing steady income. 
This intelligent system handles the objections so often raised to 
obstruct this crop: the supposed fear that hemp fields will be used 
to sequester marijuana plants. Under this system farmers have 
powerful incentive not to engage in planting of illicit varieties of 
Cannabis. (Hemp fields are not good places to grow horticultural 
varieties of Cannabis for the following reasons: 1) Hemp for fiber is 
cut before plants flower; 2) plant density is high in the agronomic 
setting; 3) if flowering occurred, abundant pollen would reduce the 
quality of the herb; herb farmers will want to keep their plants 
away from hemp fields; high test genetic strains will be degraded by 
contamination with fiber hemp pollen.60) 
	The Kentucky system provides for total integration of crop 
production and marketing. No one will be growing the crop who does 
not have a permit and the trail will be complete from seed through 
the final disposal of the fiber. Authorities can know where and by 
whom the crop is being produced.  If a person is in possession of 
Cannabis who is not in the co-op system, they will be guilty of 
illegal possession, regardless of THC assay. The co-op will police 
its membership, obviating the need for complicated and expensive 
fielding testing of farmers' crops. 
	Given a system operating in this way, the specific technical 
issues associated with harvesting and post-harvest handling of the 
crop will be determined by the co-op organization in accordance 
with the intended end use. Such specialized harvesting equipment as 
is needed will likely also be arranged through the co-op and shared. 


Seed harvest can be accomplished with a grain harvester with 
appropriately sized screens. European and Soviet manufacturers have 
designed combine harvestors for hemp which remove seed and bundle 
the stem simultaneously. The great expense of such machines 
necessitates a co-op organization of growers.
	Fiber harvest is a whole new matter. Harvest technicalities 
have nearly done-in the fiber crop at times in the foretold history. 
This topic could well occupy an entire tome; our treatment can only 
sketch the subject.
	First issue: how will the crop be retted? Dew or water; or 
unretted decortication or sonic explosion?

females. There is no evidence George smoked his crop or that the 
European fiber hemp he grew had psychoactive potential. Quite the
