<p><font size="4"><strong>Interview with Alfred McCoy</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">November 9, 1991 (2nd Book was published in
Dec. 1992)</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Alfred W. McCoy is professor of Southeast Asian
History at the University of</font> <font size="2">Wisconsin,
Madison. Educated at Columbia and Yale, he has spent the past</font>
<font size="2">twenty years writing about Southeast Asian history
and politics. Dr. McCoy</font> <font size="2">participated in
Causes and Cures: National Teleconference on the Narcotics</font>
<font size="2">Epidemic Saturday, November 9 1991, at Marble
Collegiate Church in</font> <font size="2">Manhattan.<br>
PD: How did you come to write The Politics of Heroin; CIA
Complicity In The</font> <font size="2">Global Drug Trade?<br>
AM: In 1971 I was a graduate student doing Southeast Asian
History at Yale</font> <font size="2">University. An editor at
Harper &amp; Row, Elisabeth Jakab, read some articles</font> <font
size="2">in a volume I had edited about Laos, which made some
general references to</font> <font size="2">the opium trade in
Laos. <br>
She decided this would be a great idea for a book and asked me to
do a</font> <font size="2">background book on the heroin plague
that was sweeping the forces then</font> <font size="2">fighting
in South Vietnam. We later learned that about one third of the</font>
<font size="2">United States combat forces in Vietnam,
conservatively estimated, were</font> <font size="2">heroin
addicts.<br>
I went to Paris and interviewed retired general Maurice Belleux,
the former</font> <font size="2">head of the French equivalent of
the CIA, an organization called SDECE</font> <font size="2">[Service
de Documentation Exterieure et du Contre-Espionage]. In an
amazing</font> <font size="2">interview he told me that French
military intelligence had financed all</font> <font size="2">their
covert operations from the control of the Indochina drug trade.
[The</font> <font size="2">French protected opium trafficking in
Laos and northern Vietnam during the</font> <font size="2">colonial
war that raged from 1946 to the French defeat in 1954 at Dien
Bien</font> <font size="2">Phu.]<br>
The French paratroopers fighting with hill tribes collected the
opium and</font> <font size="2">French aircraft would fly the
opium down to Saigon and the Sino-Vietnamese</font> <font
size="2">mafia that was the instrument of French intelligence
would then distribute</font> <font size="2">the opium. The
central bank accounts, the sharing of the profits, was all</font>
<font size="2">controlled by French military intelligence.<br>
He concluded the interview by telling me that it was his
information that</font> <font size="2">the CIA had taken over the
French assets and were pursuing something of the</font> <font
size="2">same policy.<br>
So I went to Southeast Asia to follow up on that lead and that's
what took</font> <font size="2">me into doing this whole book. It
was basically pulling a thread and keep</font> <font size="2">tugging
at it and a veil masking the reality began to unravel.<br>
PD: What was the CIA's role in heroin trafficking in Southeast
Asia?<br>
AM: During the 40 years of the cold war, from the late 1940's to
this year,</font> <font size="2">the CIA pursued a policy that I
call radical pragmatism . Their mission was</font> <font size="2">to
stop communism and in pursuit of that mission they would ally
with anyone</font> <font size="2">and do anything to fight
communism.<br>
Since the 1920's the League of Nations, the forerunner of the
United</font> <font size="2">Nations, and the United States have
prohibited opium and cocaine products</font> <font size="2">from
legal sale. These products had already emerged as vast global</font>
<font size="2">commodities with very substantial production zones
and large markets, large</font> <font size="2">demand for those
commodities both in the third world and the first.<br>
The historic Asia opium zone stretches across 5,000 miles of
Asian mainland</font> <font size="2">from Turkey to Laos along
the southern borders of the Soviet Union and the</font> <font
size="2">southern border of communist China. It just so happened
that one of the key</font> <font size="2">war zones in the cold
war happened to lay astride the Asian opium zone.<br>
During the long years of the cold war the CIA mounted major
covert guerilla</font> <font size="2">operations along the
Soviet-Chinese border. The CIA recruited as allies</font> <font
size="2">people we now call drug lords for their operation
against communist China in</font> <font size="2">northeastern
Burma in 1950, then from 1965 to 1975 [during the Vietnam war]</font>
<font size="2">their operation in northern Laos and throughout
the decade of the 1980's,</font> <font size="2">the Afghan
operation against Soviet forces in Afghanistan. <br>
Powerful, upland political figures control the societies and
economies in</font> <font size="2">these regions and part of that
panoply of power is the opium trade. The CIA</font> <font
size="2">extended the mantle of their alliance to these drug
lords and in every case</font> <font size="2">the drug lords used
it to expand a small local trade in opium into a major</font> <font
size="2">source of supply for the world markets and the United
States.<br>
While they were allied with the United States these drug lords
were</font> <font size="2">absolutely immune to any kind of
investigation. If you're involved in any</font> <font size="2">kind
of illicit commodity trade, organized crime activity like drug</font>
<font size="2">trafficking, there is only one requisite for
success, immunity, and the CIA</font> <font size="2">gave them
that. As long as they were allied with the CIA, the local police</font>
<font size="2">and then the DEA stayed away from the drug lords. <br>
Finally, if there were any allegations about the involvement of
their allies</font> <font size="2">in the drug trade, the CIA
would use their good offices to quash those</font> <font size="2">allegations.<br>
This meant that these drug lords, connected with the CIA, and
protected by</font> <font size="2">the CIA, were able to release
periodic heroin surges, and [in Latin America]</font> <font
size="2">periodic cocaine surges. You can trace very precisely
during the 40 years of</font> <font size="2">the cold war, the
upsurge in narcotics supply in the United States with</font> <font
size="2">covert operations.<br>
PD: How does the CIA's policies affect drug interdiction? I've
spoken for</font> <font size="2">example to former Drug
Enforcement Administration officer Michael Levine,</font> <font
size="2">who has expressed anger that he was pulled off cases
because he got too</font> <font size="2">close to someone who,
while being a big trafficker, was also an asset of the</font> <font
size="2">CIA. <br>
AM: Mike Levine speaks from personal experience. In 1971 Mike
Levine was in</font> <font size="2">Southeast Asia operating in
Thailand as an agent of the U.S. Drug</font> <font size="2">Enforcement
Administration [DEA]. At the same time I was conducting the</font>
<font size="2">investigation for the first edition of my book.<br>
Mike Levine said that he wanted to go up country to Chiangmai,
the heroin</font> <font size="2">capital of Southeast Asia at
that point, the finance and processing center</font> <font
size="2">and hub of an enterprise. He wanted to make some major
seizures. Through a</font> <font size="2">veiled series of cut
outs in the U.S. embassy in Bangkok, instructions were</font> <font
size="2">passed to his superiors in the DEA, who told him he
couldn't go up and make</font> <font size="2">the bust. He was
pulled off the case.<br>
He said it wasn't until he read my book a number of years later
that he</font> <font size="2">understood the politics of what was
going on and he realized why he had been</font> <font size="2">pulled
off. All of the upland drug lords that were producing the
narcotic,</font> <font size="2">the heroin, were in fact CIA
assets. Now he understands it.<br>
That is not just a single incident, so let's go back to basics.
What is the</font> <font size="2">institutional relationship
between the DEA an the CIA? The Federal Bureau of</font> <font
size="2">Narcotics [FBN] was established in 1930 as an instrument
of the prohibition</font> <font size="2">of narcotics, the only
United States agency that had a covert action</font> <font
size="2">capacity with agents working undercover before World War
II. During the war</font> <font size="2">when the OSS [Office of
Strategic Services] was established, which is the</font> <font
size="2">forerunner of the CIA, key personnel were transferred
from the Federal</font> <font size="2">Bureau of Narcotics to
train the OSS officers in the clandestine arts.<br>
That close institutional relationship between the DEA [direct
descendant of</font> <font size="2">the FBN] and the CIA
continues up to the present day. The long time head of</font> <font
size="2">the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, a man named Harry
Anslinger, who headed</font> <font size="2">that bureau from 1930
until his retirement in 1962, was a militant</font> <font
size="2">anti-communist who spent a lot of his time in
counter-intelligence</font> <font size="2">operations. There's a
very close relationship between the two agencies.<br>
During the cold war the main priority abroad for the United
States</font> <font size="2">government was anti-communism, and
whenever theCIA mounted an operation,</font> <font size="2">every
other U.S. agency was subordinated to the CIA's covert
operations. <br>
That meant that when the CIA was running one of its covert action
wars in</font> <font size="2">the drug zones of Asia, the DEA
would stay away. For example, during the</font> <font size="2">1950's
the CIA had this ongoing alliance with the nationalist Chinese in</font>
<font size="2">northern Burma. Initially mounting invasions of
China in 1950-51, later</font> <font size="2">mounting
surveillance along the border for a projected Chinese invasion of</font>
<font size="2">Southeast Asia. The DEA stayed out of Southeast
Asia completely during that</font> <font size="2">period and
collected no intelligence about narcotics in deference to the</font>
<font size="2">CIA's operation.<br>
Let's take two more examples that bring it right up to the
present. [First]</font> <font size="2">the Afghan operation: from
1979 to the present, the CIA's largest operation</font> <font
size="2">anywhere in the world, was to support the Afghan
resistance forces fighting</font> <font size="2">the Soviet
occupation in their country. The CIA worked through Pakistan</font>
<font size="2">military intelligence and worked with the Afghan
guerilla groups who were</font> <font size="2">close to Pakistan
military intelligence.<br>
In 1979 Pakistan had a small localized opium trade and produced
no heroin</font> <font size="2">whatsoever. Yet by 1981,
according to U.S. Attorney General William French</font> <font
size="2">Smith, Pakistan had emerged as the world's leading
supplier of heroin. It</font> <font size="2">became the supplier
of 60% of U.S. heroin supply and it captured a</font> <font
size="2">comparable section of the European market. In Pakistan
itself the results</font> <font size="2">were even more
disastrous.<br>
In 1979 Pakistan had no heroin addicts, in 1980 Pakistan had
5,000 heroin</font> <font size="2">addicts, and by 1985,
according to official Pakistan government statistics,</font> <font
size="2">Pakistan had 1.2 million heroin addicts, the largest
heroin addict</font> <font size="2">population in the world.<br>
Who were the manufacturers? They were all either military
factions connected</font> <font size="2">with Pakistan
intelligence, CIA allies, or Afghan resistance groups</font> <font
size="2">connected with the CIA and Pakistan intelligence. In May
of 1990, ten years</font> <font size="2">after this began, the
Washington Post finally ran a front page story saying</font> <font
size="2">high U.S. officials admit that Gulbuddin Hekmatyar
[leader of the Hezbi-i</font> <font size="2">Islami guerilla
group], and other leaders of the Afghan resistance are</font> <font
size="2">leading heroin manufacturers.<br>
This had been known for years, reported in the Pakistan press,
indeed in</font> <font size="2">1980 reported in McClean's
magazine. In fact in 1980 a White House narcotics</font> <font
size="2">advisor, Dr. David Musto of Yale University, went on the
record demanding</font> <font size="2">that we not ally with
Afghan guerilla groups that were involved in</font> <font
size="2">narcotics. His advice was ignored and he went public in
an op-ed in the New</font> <font size="2">York Times.<br>
Another example: Let's take the cocaine epidemic. In 1981 as
cocaine began</font> <font size="2">surging north into the United
States, the DEA assigned an agent named Tomas</font> <font
size="2">Zepeda, in June 1981, to open up an office in Honduras.
By 1983 Zepeda was</font> <font size="2">collecting very good
intelligence indicating that the Honduran military were</font> <font
size="2">taking bribes to let the aircraft through their country
to come to the</font> <font size="2">United States.<br>
Zepeda was pulled out of Honduras and that office was closed by
the DEA.</font> <font size="2">They didn't open another office in
Honduras until 1987 because Honduras was</font> <font size="2">a
frontline country in the contra war. If Zepeda's reports about
involvement</font> <font size="2">of the Honduran military had
been acted upon, the DEA would have been forced</font> <font
size="2">to take action against the Honduran military officers
who were working with</font> <font size="2">the CIA to protect
the contras.<br>
In short, there was a conflict between the drug war and the cold
war. Faced</font> <font size="2">with the choice, the United
States government chose the cold war over the</font> <font
size="2">drug war, sacrificing a key intelligence post for the
DEA in Honduras.<br>
The same thing happened in Afghanistan. During the 1980's from
the time that</font> <font size="2">heroin trade started, there
were 17 DEA agents based in Pakistan. They</font> <font size="2">neither
made nor participated in any major seizures or arrests. At a time</font>
<font size="2">when other police forces, particularly
Scandinavian forces, made some major</font> <font size="2">seizures
and brought down a very major syndicate connected with former</font>
<font size="2">president Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan.<br>
PD: What is the role of banking in the heroin trade? What, if
any, are the</font> <font size="2">connections to the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) scandal. <br>
AM: There have been three times in the past 15 years in which the
CIA's</font> <font size="2">money transfer activities have
surfaced. The first came in the late 1970's</font> <font size="2">when
the Internal Revenue Service, the IRS, investigated a Nassau bank</font>
<font size="2">called the Castle Bank. It's a very interesting
bank. It was set up by a man</font> <font size="2">named Paul
Helliwell, a very senior CIA operative who had retired from the</font>
<font size="2">agency. He set up this bank and it grew into a
Latin American network of</font> <font size="2">banks. It was
used by the CIA to launder money.<br>
In essence, what appears to emerge from the investigation of the
Castle Bank</font> <font size="2">in the late 1970's, was that
the CIA did not want to move operational funds</font> <font
size="2">for covert operations through normal banking channels,
where they could be</font> <font size="2">uncovered, either by
the United States or abroad, where they could come to</font> <font
size="2">the knowledge of opponents of the agency.<br>
They preferred to work through allied banks. Banks that were
secure, that</font> <font size="2">were a little bit loose in
their accounting procedures. When the Castle Bank</font> <font
size="2">was uncovered, the IRS announced a major investigation
of the bank's money</font> <font size="2">laundering activities.
Suddenly the IRS cancelled the investigation and the</font> <font
size="2">Wall Street Journal was told by informed sources in the
IRS that the CIA had</font> <font size="2">blocked the
investigation.<br>
As soon as Castle Bank collapsed, a small merchant bank based in
Australia,</font> <font size="2">operating offshore between
Australia and southeast Asia, suddenly mushroomed</font> <font
size="2">into a global network of banks, acquiring Latin American
and European</font> <font size="2">structures that had belonged
to Castle Bank. This bank in Australia called</font> <font
size="2">the Nugan-Hand Bank began very quickly in the late
1970's, to acquire a</font> <font size="2">board of retired U.S.
intelligence officials, either CIA or various military</font> <font
size="2">intelligence services.<br>
The most prominent example, the former Director of Central
Intelligence,</font> <font size="2">William Colby, became the
legal council of Nugan-Hand Bank. The bank was</font> <font
size="2">founded by Frank Nugan, an insecure and incompetent
Australian lawyer, and</font> <font size="2">by Michael John
Hand, a man with a high school degree who had gone to</font> <font
size="2">Vietnam with the Green Berets. He had served in Laos in
the 1960's as a</font> <font size="2">contract CIA operative,
fighting with three of the people who became very</font> <font
size="2">prominent in the CIA's privatized operations, Thomas
Clines, Theodore</font> <font size="2">Shackley and Richard
Secord, all very big names in the Iran-Contra scandal. <br>
Michael John Hand was the one who worked with William Colby as
legal</font> <font size="2">counsel. One of their big operations
was to buy a former U.S. naval base in</font> <font size="2">the
Turks and Caicos islands in the Caribbean. Australian police</font>
<font size="2">investigators who examined that contract, drawn up
by William Colby for</font> <font size="2">Michael John Hand,
concluded that the plausible explanation they could</font> <font
size="2">discover for that contract was to establish a
way-station for cocaine</font> <font size="2">smuggling between
Colombia and the United States. <br>
We do know the bank was pioneering in the smuggling of heroin
between</font> <font size="2">Southeast Asia and Australia. In
the late 1970's Australia had very strict</font> <font size="2">banking
laws, and anytime you got foreign exchange you had to account for</font>
<font size="2">it. The Nugan-Hand Bank helped Australian
organized crime figures get their</font> <font size="2">money
overseas so they could buy heroin and ship the heroin back to</font>
<font size="2">Australia.<br>
The Australian police investigators documented that Michael John
Hand worked</font> <font size="2">very closely with Australia's
top criminal drug traffickers to finance the</font> <font
size="2">first shipments, the pioneering shipments, of heroin to
Australia from</font> <font size="2">Southeast Asia.<br>
In 1980 that bank went belly-up and it collapsed, Frank Nugan
committed</font> <font size="2">suicide, and then a really
amazing event occurred. Thomas Clines, the former</font> <font
size="2">CIA chief of station from Laos, a man of great
prominence in the Iran-Contra</font> <font size="2">scandal, flew
to Sydney, Australia and exfiltrated Michael John Hand, who</font>
<font size="2">disappeared in the United States and was never
seen since.<br>
Then we come to BCCI. Although we haven't gotten to the bottom of
it by any</font> <font size="2">means, we haven't even begun to
ask the questions, much less get the</font> <font size="2">answers.
BCCI mushroomed in the 1980's and seemed to serve as a similar</font>
<font size="2">conduit as Castle Bank and Nugan-Hand Bank. The
Manchester Guardian</font> <font size="2">published an expose
saying that the CIA paid its operations in the United</font> <font
size="2">Kingdom through BCCI, and it's known that the CIA paid
the Afghan</font> <font size="2">guerrillas, who were based in
Pakistan, through BCCI. <br>
There's one rather large question that nobody is asking about
BCCI. It's a</font> <font size="2">Pakistani bank, it booms
during the 1980's, in exactly the same period that</font> <font
size="2">Pakistan emerges as the world's largest heroin center.
We know the Pakistan</font> <font size="2">military officers
involved in the drug trade had their accounts with BCCI.</font> <font
size="2">There's a three way relationship that really cries out,
screams, demands, a</font> <font size="2">congressional
investigation.<br>
The relationship between BCCI and the CIA operations in
Afghanistan and</font> <font size="2">Pakistan; how much money
was the CIA moving through those accounts?</font> <font size="2">Secondly,
the relationship between the Pakistan military connected with
that</font> <font size="2">operation and BCCI. Thirdly, the
relationship between the booming heroin</font> <font size="2">trade
of Pakistan and BCCI. I think what we'll possibly discover is
that the</font> <font size="2">CIA was shipping its funds into
Pakistan through BCCI, protecting BCCI</font> <font size="2">thereby
from serious investigations elsewhere in the world. That the</font>
<font size="2">Pakistan military were in fact banking their drug
profits, moving their drug</font> <font size="2">profits from the
consuming country back to Pakistan though BCCI. In fact the</font>
<font size="2">boom in the Pakistan drug trade was financed by
BCCI.The interrelationship</font> <font size="2">between the
Afghan resistance and the CIA and the Pakistan drug trade can</font>
<font size="2">all be seen through the medium of BCCI, the banker
to both operations, the</font> <font size="2">resistance and the
drug trade.<br>
PD: What are the alternatives to the drug war?<br>
AM: In the 1980's, indeed over the last 20 years, society has
been given two</font> <font size="2">choices in the drug war. The
escalating repression against the drug trade by</font> <font
size="2">Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush while the media gave
airtime and space to</font> <font size="2">only one sustained
critique.That critique put forth by the Drug Policy</font> <font
size="2">Foundation argues that the drug war wasn't working and
therefore we should</font> <font size="2">pursue a policy of
legalization. Simply turn the whole policy of repression</font> <font
size="2">on its head, instead of trying to wipe out the drug
trade we legalize it.<br>
Let me first of all review the drug war. Is it working? No it's
not. The</font> <font size="2">current drug war budget is $11
billion, a very large amount of money. Of</font> <font size="2">that
$11 billion, 86% is devoted to the suppression of cocaine
trafficking</font> <font size="2">between the United States and
Colombia and cocaine trafficking in the U.S.</font> <font
size="2">as well. However, while we're devoting 86% of our drug
war budget to</font> <font size="2">cocaine, use of cocaine has
gone up by 15 percent. Every single indicator</font> <font
size="2">shows cocaine addiction is rising at the same time we
are fighting this drug</font> <font size="2">war.<br>
The White House is claiming victory in the drug war, William
Bennet, the</font> <font size="2">drug czar who retired several
months ago, claimed a victory, President Bush</font> <font
size="2">has alluded to a victory in the drug war, and so has the
current drug war</font> <font size="2">czar, Mr. Bob Martinez.
What they claim as a victory is a victory over</font> <font
size="2">casual drug use. Well let's face it casual drug use
doesn't count, if some</font> <font size="2">kid tries drugs and
doesn't like it that's nice but that's not the problem.<br>
The problem is repeated use, and every single indicator says
repeated use is</font> <font size="2">up. The drug war is not
working. It's filling up our prisons. The prison</font> <font
size="2">population doubled under President Reagan, and we now
have over 400</font> <font size="2">prisoners per 100,000
population versus 35 per 100,000 in Holland. We have</font> <font
size="2">the largest prison population per capita in the world
and it's going up. At</font> <font size="2">the same time our
heroin use is going up and our cocaine use is going up.<br>
The reason why is because our effort in the drug war has been
concentrated</font> <font size="2">in interdicting the supply of
drugs in the United States and over the last</font> <font
size="2">20 years we have fought this drug war on a bilateral
basis. The United</font> <font size="2">States in 1972 went into
Turkey and said &quot;wipe out your opium trade&quot; and in</font>
<font size="2">the 1980's they went into Colombia and said
&quot;wipe out your cocaine</font> <font size="2">processing
industry&quot;. In the early 1980's the U.S. went into Bolivia
and</font> <font size="2">said &quot;wipe out coca cultivation in
the western part of your country&quot;. This</font> <font
size="2">is bilateral interdiction, where the U.S. as a sovereign
power deals with</font> <font size="2">another sovereign state
and applies pressure on that sovereign state to get</font> <font
size="2">action on drugs.<br>
There is a misperception about the nature of heroin and cocaine.
These are</font> <font size="2">not petty vices, these are
complex global commodity trades involving vast</font> <font
size="2">areas of production and enormous consumption. It's a
commodity comparable in</font> <font size="2">every respect to
coffee or tea.<br>
When you bring down the baton of law enforcement on a complex
global</font> <font size="2">commodity trade something curious
and something paradoxical, something</font> <font size="2">almost
magical happens. The genius of capitalism, its magic, its
alchemy,</font> <font size="2">transform the lead of repression
into the gold of stimulus. Every time we</font> <font size="2">apply
repression upon narcotics production on this bilateral basis we</font>
<font size="2">stimulate production, and ultimately we stimulate
consumption because of the</font> <font size="2">law of supply
and demand.<br>
In 1972 President Richard Nixon wiped out the Turkish opium crop
with his</font> <font size="2">first drug war, the grandmother of
drug wars. This grandmother of drug wars</font> <font size="2">totally
wiped out Turkish opium production, and for a while it disrupted
the</font> <font size="2">French connection between Turkey, which
had supplied French labs in</font> <font size="2">Marseille,
which in turn supplied New York.<br>
It looked like victory until you see what really happened. Turkey
only grew</font> <font size="2">7% of the worlds opium. Across
the 5,000 mile band of mountains from Turkey</font> <font
size="2">in the west to Laos in the east lay the rest of the
worlds opium production,</font> <font size="2">the other 93
percent. <br>
Turkey had a shortfall of production, that meant there was a
shortfall in</font> <font size="2">supply of illicit opium. So
the price went up as would always happen, short</font> <font
size="2">supply and the price goes up. That meant farmers
elsewhere in the opium</font> <font size="2">zone, from Iran,
Afghanistan increased their production as happens every</font> <font
size="2">single time. The repression creates a shortfall in
supply which raises price</font> <font size="2">and then
stimulates production everywhere around the world.<br>
What then is the solution to the problem? Somewhere between the
poles of</font> <font size="2">repression and legalization there
is an alternative strategy which I call</font> <font size="2">regulation.
I don't think we should really fool ourselves to consider</font> <font
size="2">legalization. It's politically impractical, it's never
going to happen.<br>
If we legalize the drug we are not going to legalize it for kids,
this is a</font> <font size="2">country that just raised the
drinking age for the socially acceptable drug,</font> <font
size="2">alcohol from 18 to 21. You give me the name right now of
one legislator who</font> <font size="2">is going to stand up and
say &quot;I favor crack for kids, vote for my bill,&quot;</font> <font
size="2">nobody will ever introduce such a bill. Even if by some
miracle you got a</font> <font size="2">legalization bill it
would exclude 21 year olds and it would mean that the</font> <font
size="2">big drug, crack cocaine would have 89% of its clientele
excluded from</font> <font size="2">legalization.<br>
I favor regulation because if cocaine and heroin are commodities
let's deal</font> <font size="2">with them as such. You don't
repress commodities, you regulate them. Accept</font> <font
size="2">the fact that there is no quick fix to this trade, it's
been around for 200</font> <font size="2">years as a major global
commodity, as an illegal commodity it's been around</font> <font
size="2">for 70 years and it's likely to be around for another
70, maybe 200 years.<br>
Recognizing that you then cancel your bilateral interdiction
efforts and</font> <font size="2">transfer your funds to the
multilateral effort being run by the United</font> <font size="2">Nations.
The multilateral effort by the United Nations actually does
reduce</font> <font size="2">production slowly, painfully over a
period of decades. <br>
Ultimately we're going to have to seek an amelioration, not a
solution, on</font> <font size="2">the streets. We're going to
have to address the complex of causes as to why</font> <font
size="2">people use drugs. That is where we have to concentrate
our money.<br>

<p><b>Detroit Organizational Needs in Treatment (DONT) is a
methadone advocacy group organized by methadone patients to
return dignity to methadone maintenance treatment and to protect
the rights of patients. Methadone Today is the official
newsletter of DONT. The idea of a methadone advocacy organization
was conceptualized in March of 1995 when the DEA raided a Detroit
methadone clinic. The groups agreed that there was a great need
for patient unity to correct the damage that had been done and to
thwart further involvement of the DEA in methadone treatment.
DONT works to correct the misconceptions about methadone
maintenance treatment and overcome the prejudice directed against
methadone patients, strives to educate communities and policy
makers about the benefits of methadone treatment, responds to the
negative and sensationalized media, advocates for treatment on

<h1>OPIUM IN CHINA (1700-1860) </h1>

<p><b>CHRONOLOGY:</b> </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>source: (Research Issues 24) Perspectives on the History of
Psychoactive Substance Use; NIDA,USDHEW 1978. pgs 134-140 </p>

<p><b>c. 1700 </b></p>

<p>Introduction Use of tobacco-opium mixtures (madak) begins in
the East Indies (probably Java) spreads to Formosa, Fukien and
the South China coast (refs). In 1689, Engelberg Kaempfer
inspects primitive dens where the mixture is dispensed
(Amoenitates Exoticae, 1712:642-5). </p>

<p><b>1729 </b></p>

<p>First Edict Reports reach Peking of the evils of opium smoking
(shrivelling up the features; early deaths) in Formosa and
Fukien; Emperor Yung Chen prohibits the sale of opium and the
operation of smoking houses. etc. etc. blah blah blah..... </p>

<p><b>c. 1750 </b></p>

<p>The British East India Company assumes control of Bengal and
Bihar, the opium growing districts of eastern India; British
shipping dominates the Bengal opium trade out of Calcutta. </p>

<p><b>1757 </b></p>

<p>Early Trade Britain annexes Bengal; the Chinese confine
foreing trade to Canton where it can be restricted and controlled
in the interests of revenue for the Chinese. Honk Kong merchants
serve as intermediaries between the foreigners and the Chinese
authorities. </p>

<p><b>1767 </b></p>

<p>Opium Imports Rise Opium from Bengal continues to enter China
despite the edict of 1729 prohibiting smoking. It increases in
frequency from 200 chests annually in 1729 to 1000 annually by
1967. However, much is for medicinal use. Tariffs are collected
on the opium. </p>

<p><b>1772 </b></p>

<p>The East India company establishes a limited monopoly over
Bengal opium; the company has general control but the operation
is in the hands of contractors, who advance company funds to the
farmers, purchase the opium produced, and sell it to the company
which then auctions it off to merchants in Calcutta. British
companies are the principal shippers. </p>

<p><b>1773-86 </b></p>

<p>Limited Monopoly Warren Hastings, the first governor general
of India, recognizes that opium is harmful and at first opposes
increasing production; later he encoiurages the the control of
opium by the company hoping that by monopolizing and limiting the
supply he will discourage its consumption. This limited monopoly
lasts throughout his administration and beyond, but when the
Chinese market is discovered, the monopoly shifts from
controlling to expanding cultivation. </p>

<p><b>1779 </b></p>

<p>Opium Imported First mention of actual trading in opium at
Canton. </p>

<p><b>1780 </b></p>

<p>Prohibition Attempted British traders establish an opium depot
at Macao. Another imperial edict prohibits consumption of opium
and reiterates prohibition of its sale. </p>

<p><b>1787 </b></p>

<p>British Trade in opium is still less important than trade
debate in commodities; directors of the East India Company, over
opium. recognizing China's objections to the importation of
opium, make offers to prohibit the export of Indian opium to
China. However, company representatives in Canton declare that
the Chinese are never sincere in their declared intentions of
suppressing illicit traffic, as long as the officials issue
prohibitory edicts with one hand and extend the other to receive
bribes from the illegal trade. </p>

<p>deletia </p>

<p><b>1796 </b></p>

<p>Prohibition Alarmed by increasing use, the emperor issues an
Attempted edict forbiding importation of opium, as well as export
of Chinese silver that is being used as a medium of exchange. Now
even legitimate trade is limited to barter. Nonetheless, illegal
purchase of opium with silver continues. </p>

<p><b>1797 </b></p>

<p>Trade Monopoly The company assumes full control of Bengal
opium. </p>

<p><b>1799 </b></p>

<p>Trade, A strong edict by authorities at Canton, cultivation
ban. supporting the emperor's decree of 1796, forbids opium trade
at that port. A concurrent drive against native poppy growing is
initiated. Opium becomes an illicit commodity. </p>

<p>Trade diverted, The 1799 edict increases traffic through
smuggling. Macao and other areas beyond government control
enabling UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH. The British declare only their
legitimate cargo, leave opium on board to be picked up by Chinese
merchants who smuggle it ashore in small, fast boats. </p>

<p><b>1800 </b></p>

<p>Anti-Opium Opium becomes identified with official policy
develops. corruption, criminals and antigovernment secret
societies. An imperial edict prohibits domestic cultivation and
repeats the prohibition against importing opium. China develops
an anti-opium policy, at least on paper. Edicts continue to be
issued reiterating prohibitions against importation, sale, and
consumption of opium. </p>

<p><b>1804 </b></p>

<p>Canton Trade Resumes Opium trading resumes at the port of
Canton. Though the 1799 edict is still in force, it has little
effect and no immediate practical change in policy ensues. </p>

<p><b>Opiates Britain 1800-1917</b> </p>

<p>&quot; Patent medicines and opium preparations such as
_Dover's Powder were readily available without restrictions.
Indeed, Laudanum (opium mixed with alcohol) was cheaper than beer
or wine and readily within the means of the lowest-paid worker.
As a result, throughout the first half of the 19th century, the
incidence of opium dependence appears to have increased steadily
in England, Europe and the United States. Working-class medicinal
use of opium-bearing nostrums as sedatives for children was
especially prominent in England. </p>

<p>However, despite some well known cases among 19th century
English literary amd creative personalities--Thomas de Quincey,
Byron, Shelley, Coleridge, and Dickens--recreational use was
limited, and there is no evidence that use was so excessive as to
be a medical or social concern.&quot; </p>

<h2>Letter From Lin Tse-hsu, to Queen Victoria, 1839. On The
Opium Trade </h2>

<p> <b>From: Civilizations Past And Present</b> </p>

<p> <b>Book: Chapter 29: South And East Asia, 1815-1914</b> </p>

<p> <b>Author: Wallbank;Taylor;Bailkey;Jewsbury;Lewis;Hackett</b>
</p>

<p> <b>Date: 1992</b> </p>

<p> <b>Courtesy of Bureau Publishing</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> Lin Tse-hsu saw that the opium trade, which gave Europe such
huge profits, undermined his country. He asked Queen Victoria to
put a stop to the trade. </p>

<p> After a long period of commercial intercourse, there appear
among the crowd of barbarians both good persons and bad,
unevenly. Consequently there are those who smuggle opium to
seduce the Chinese people and so cause the spread of the poison
to all provinces. Such persons who only care to profit
themselves, and disregard their harm to others, are not tolerated
by the laws of heaven and are unanimously hated by human beings.
His Majesty the Emperor, upon hearing of this, is in a towering
rage. He has especially sent me, his commissioner, to come to
Kwangtung, and together with the governor-general and governor
jointly to investigate and settle this matter. </p>

<p> All those people in China who sell opium or smoke opium
should receive the death penalty. If we trace the crime of those
barbarians who through the years have been selling opium, then
the deep harm they have wrought and the great profit they have
usurped should fundamentally justify their execution according to
law. We take into consideration, however, the fact that the
various barbarians have still known how to repent their crimes
and return to their allegiance to us by taking the 20,183 chests
of opium from their storeships and petitioning us, through their
consular officer [superintendent of trade], Elliot, to receive
it. It has been entirely destroyed and this has been faithfully
reported to the Throne in several memorials by this commissioner
and his colleagues. </p>

<p> Fortunately we have received a specially extended favor from
is Majesty the Emperor, who considers that for those who
voluntarily surrender there are still some circumstances to
palliate their crime, and so for the time being he has
magnanimously excused them from punishment. But as for those who
again violate the opium prohibition, it is difficult for the law
to pardon them repeatedly. Having established new regulations, we
presume that the ruler of your honorable country, who takes
delight in our culture and whose disposition is inclined towards
us, must be able to instruct the various barbarians to observe
the law with care. It is only necessary to explain to them the
advantages and disadvantages and then they will know that the
legal code of the Celestial Court must be absolutely obeyed with
awe. </p>

<p> We find that your country is sixty or seventy thousand li
[three li make one mile] from China. Yet there are barbarian
ships that strive to come here for trade for the purpose of
making a great profit. The wealth of China is used to profit the
barbarians. That is to say, the great profit made by barbarians
is all taken from the rightful share of China. By what right do
they then in return use the poisonous drug to injure the Chinese
people? Even though the barbarians may not necessarily intend to
do us harm, yet in coveting profit to an extreme, they have no
regard for injuring others. Let us ask, where is your conscience?
I have heard that the smoking of opium is very strictly forbidden
by your country; that is because the harm caused by opium is
clearly understood. Since it is not permitted to do harm to your
own country, then even less should you let it be passed on to the
harm of other countries - how much less to China! </p>

held 450 million people, up from 200 million a century earlier.
The ruling dynasty was the Ching, established by Manchus from
Manchuria, who in 1644 had superseded the Ming. These descendants
of the Tatars appreciated Chinese civilization and adopted a
conciliatory attitude toward their subjects. They refused,
however, to allow intermarriage with the Chinese, for they
realized that only their blood difference kept them from being
assimilated and conquered. By and large, however, the Manchus
gradually became Chinese in their attitudes and habits. </p>

<p> The Manchu emperors were remarkably successful. The reign of
Chien-lung (1736-1795) was a time of great expansion. The Manchus
gained Turkestan, Burma, and Tibet. By the end of the eighteenth
century Manchu power extended even into Nepal, and the territory
under the Ching control was as extensive as under any previous
dynasty. </p>

<p> . . . . . . </p>

<p> The Western Response </p>

<p> The foreigners were especially irritated by the high customs
duties the Chinese forced them to pay and by the attempts of
Chinese authorities to stop the growing import trade in opium.
The drug had long been used to stop diarrhea, but in the
seventeenth and eighteenth century people in all classes began to
use it recreationally. Most opium came from Turkey or India, and
in 1800 its import was forbidden by the imperial government.
Despite this restriction, the opium trade continued to flourish.
Privately owned vessels of many countries, including the United
States, made huge profits from the growing number of Chinese
addicts. The government in Peking noted that the foreigners
seemed intent on dragging down the Chinese through the
encouragement of opium addiction. </p>

<p> [See Opium Factory: The stacking room at an opium factory in
Patna, India. Opium smuggling upset the balance of trade and
destroyed China's economy.] </p>

<p> In the meantime, the empire faced other problems. The army
became corrupt and the tax farmers defrauded the people. The
central bureaucracy declined in efficiency, and the generally
weak emperors were unable to meet the challenges of the time. The
balance of trade turned against the Chinese in the 1830s, and the
British decided to force the issue of increased trade rights. The
point of conflict was the opium trade. By the late 1830s more
than 30,000 chests, each of which held about 150 pounds of the
extract, were being brought in annually by the various foreign
powers. Some authorities assert that the trade in opium alone
reversed China's formerly favorable balance of trade. In the
spring of 1839 Chinese authorities at Canton confiscated and
burned the opium. In response, the British occupied positions
around Canton. </p>

<p> In the war that followed, the Chinese could not match the
technological and tactical superiority of the British forces. In
1842 China agreed to the provisions of the Treaty of Nanking.
Hong Kong was ceded to Great Britain, and other ports, including
Canton, were opened to British residence and trade. It would be a
mistake to view the conflict between the two countries simply as
a matter of drug control; it was instead the acting out of deep
cultural conflicts between east and west. </p>

<p> The French and Americans approached the Chinese after the
Nanking Treaty's provisions became known, and in 1844 gained the
same trading rights as the British. The advantages granted the
three nations by the Chinese set a precedent that would dominate
China's relations with the world for the next century. The
&quot;most favored nation&quot; treatment came to be extended so
far that China's right to rule in its own territory was limited.
This began the period referred to by the Chinese as the time of
unequal treaties - a time of unprecedented degradation for China.
The humiliation the Central Kingdom suffered is still remembered
and strongly affects important aspects of its foreign policy.
Meanwhile, the opium trade continued to thrive. </p>

<p> The British and French again defeated China in a second opium
war in 1856. By the terms of the Treaty of Tientsin (1858) the
Chinese opened new ports to trading and allowed foreigners with
passports to travel in the interior. Christians gained the right
to spread their faith and hold property, thus opening up another
means of western penetration. The United States and Russia gained
the same privileges in separate treaties. </p>

MAINTENANCE AND PREGNANCY</b></a><b><br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p>In the September issue of <b><i>Methadone Today</i></b>, the
National Alliance of Methadone Advocates' (NAMA's) Methadone
Awareness question was regarding pregnant women and methadone. At
that time and as a result of the article, several questions were
raised, so I have decided to expand on the topic to try to answer
them. </p>

<p>The following information and quotes come from the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). This publication
can be obtained at no charge by calling 1-800-729-6686 and asking
them to send &quot;(SMA) 93-1988&quot; (Pregnant, Substance-Using
Women) or more simply, &quot;TIP 2.&quot; The information
contained in TIP 2 comes from a rather lengthy 90-page booklet
with a full two-page list of contributors known as the <b><i>Consensus
Panel</i></b>. There is also another full page of <b><i>Tip Field
Reviewers</i></b> who &quot;were selected to review and comment
on the draft document based on their knowledge of and concern for
the special needs of pregnant, substance-using women.&quot; </p>

<p>The consensus is that methadone maintenance &quot;is a <b><i>well-documented
approach to improve outcomes for both the woman and her fetus
[and] is strongly encouraged for all pregnant, opioid-dependent
women</i></b> [emphasis mine]. It provides the following
advantages: </p>

<ul type="disc">
    <li>Reduces illegal opioid use as well as use of other drugs.
    </li>
    <li>Helps to remove the opioid-dependent woman from the
        drug-seeking environment and eliminates the necessary
        illegal behavior. </li>
    <li>Prevents fluctuations of the maternal drug level that may
        occur throughout the day. </li>
    <li>Improves maternal nutrition, increasing the weight of the
        newborn. </li>
    <li>Improves the woman's ability to prepare for the birth of
        the infant and begin homemaking. </li>
    <li>Reduces obstetrical complications. </li>
</ul>

<p>Medical withdrawal of the pregnant, opioid-dependent woman
from methadone <b><i>is not indicated or recommended</i></b>
[emphasis mine]. Few women will have the motivation or the
psychosocial supports to accomplish and maintain total
abstinence. The goal, therefore, is to achieve the best
therapeutic dose possible with which the woman feels comfortable.
The neonatal abstinence syndrome can be treated with minimal
complications. </p>

<p>Despite the above caution, at times, medical withdrawal may
need to be considered due to logistical or geographic barriers.
In these cases, <b><i>the decision to undertake such a program
must be a joint decision between the obstetrician, the woman, and
her counselor, with the understanding that few women will be
appropriate candidates for this approach</i></b> [emphasis mine].
</p>

<p>The woman should understand that she must prove she is a
candidate for medical withdrawal by complying with prenatal and
therapy appointments and supplying clean urines. If at any time
the woman is unable to comply with these requirements, no further
decrease in dosage of methadone should be ordered. . . .<b><i>Patients
should be allowed to discontinue withdrawal at any time, for any
reason, without feelings of guilt</i></b> [emphasis mine]. They
should be then be placed into a methadone maintenance program at
a therapeutically sound dose. Clinicians need to be particularly
aware that a decrease in methadone dosage could precipitate a
relapse to drug use. Patients in continuous treatment who return
to illegal drug use should be placed back on methadone. Methadone
is preferable to the use of illegal street drugs. </p>

<p>. . . .Medical withdrawal from methadone is usually done in
decrements of 2 to 2  mg every 7 to 10 days. This procedure
should only be done in conjunction with an obstetrician who can
monitor the effects on the fetus. <b><i>Intrauterine demise
(death of the fetus in utero) has been documented as a
complication of medical withdrawal even when done under optimal
conditions, such as hospitalization and close fetal monitoring</i></b>&quot;
[emphasis mine]. </p>

<p>It is clear that the consensus is that pregnant women who are
dependent on opiates should be placed in a methadone program as
soon as possible and should not be detoxed during the pregnancy.
The dosing guidelines are the same for pregnant as well as
nonpregnant substance users. &quot;Based on current and emerging
research, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) suggests
that maintenance doses below 60 mg are not effective and hence
not appropriate. Arbitrary low-dose policies for pregnant and
nonpregnant patients is often associated with increased drug use
as well as reduced program retention. Based on current informed
consensus, the most prudent course is to rely on individually
determined methadone dosing that is measured by the absence of
subjective and objective abstinence symptoms and the reduction of
drug hunger.&quot; If you are pregnant and an opiate user, it is
crucial that you find a program that will maintain you on
methadone for your health and that of your developing fetus. </p>

<p>New Hampshire is one of the few states that does not have
methadone maintenance, but they recently passed a bill (June
1996) that would allow pregnant opiate users access to methadone.
The downside is that there is a stipulation that &quot;the length
of time for methadone use after birth shall not exceed 3
months.&quot; The months following birth of the child should not
have the added stress and complication of a methadone detox. If
these women are not ready for detox, they will most likely return
to drug use instead of using the respite from drug chasing to
enjoy their child. If they were allowed to remain on methadone
maintenance, this could be avoided. </p>

<p align="center">The good news is that a former legislator (see
story on page 2--Harm Reduction Conference) is researching
methadone and running for office again this year. Advocate Dan
Sundquist is on the job also. <b><i>Thanks for the information,
Dan</i></b>. </p>

Consumers' Meeting &amp; Harm Reduction Conference</b></a> </p>

<p align="center"><b>METHADONE CONSUMERS MEETING &amp; HARM
REDUCTION CONFERENCE<br>
<br>
</b>Methadone patients and advocates from across the United
States met in Oakland, California on September 17, 1996 to set up
a Methadone Consumers' Advocacy Agenda. These patients and
advocates are doing something to change treatment back to Dr.'s
Dole and Nyswander's caring model instead of resigning themselves
to the current prohibitive policies of methadone treatment in the
United States.<br>
<br>
&quot;At the Tuesday Consumer Meeting, we formed a Committee that
put together The Methadone Consumers Platform,&quot; said
Joycelyn Woods, Executive Vice-President of NAMA. &quot;It was
read at the Final Plenary and was the only report from groups
that got several cheers--more than several in fact. The cheers
were for statements like &#145;No Blind Dosing', &#145;No
Discharge without Due Process', and &#145;No Discharge for
displaying symptoms of our disease' (using drugs). So I think we
brought down the house.&quot;<br>
<br>
Through Joycelyn and e-mail, I met former New Hampshire State
Representative, Patricia M. O'Keefe, who was &quot;co-sponsor of
both a needle exchange bill and a bill to remove the prescription
requirements to purchase syringes and decriminalize possession of
such items.&quot; Ms. O'Keefe said of the conference, &quot;I
thought it was really well organized, and...I came away from it
with a much clearer vision of harm reduction. One area really
impressed me--some presenters that were on methadone maintenance
really blew me away and made me realize that I don't know enough
about the treatment, that I had preconceptions of methadone
maintenance that were inaccurate and distorted, probably similar
(but not so extreme) to those in the legislature that have to be
educated about the treatment. I never realized I had these
stereotypes in my head until I witnessed these highly functioning
individuals. . . .I am kind of embarrassed by my ignorance. .
.[but] I look forward to researching the subject and rectifying
the situation.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is wonderful commentary, and Ms. O'Keefe does not need to be
embarrassed about not knowing about methadone maintenance
treatment. Look at the ignorance in the medical profession
regarding substance abuse and methadone maintenance, look at the
answers to the many myths we have been publishing, and look at
some of the ignorance even in the field of methadone maintenance
put forth by counselors and doctors who should be knowledgeable
about their business. There is no shame in being unaware--the
shame is in staying unaware and the perpetuation of the negative
stereotypes of the methadone-maintained patient. </p>

Maintenance</b></a><b><br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p align="center">As with so much about methadone maintenance, I
knew nothing of this thing called Medical Maintenance when I
first started as a patient advocate in August 1995. The concept,
when I first learned of it, fascinated me. But, why should it?
Because we have been so brainwashed into thinking that we are
criminals, moral degenerates, and undeserving that it just
doesn't occur to us think of ourselves as patients. We are told,
if not implicitly then at least we are certainly given the
feeling, that we are not entitled to this life-saving
medication--that it is a privilege. To those of you who read Dr.
Payte's, &quot;Insulin Treatment in Diabetes. . .,&quot; in
September's Methadone Today, apply that last statement to his
thesis. It's absurd when applied to insulin for diabetes, but we
believe it about methadone. Well, I don't believe it anymore.<br>
<br>
D. Novick et al (1988 June 10 JAMA 259; 3299-3302) wrote in
&quot;Medical Maintenance: A New Model for Continuing Treatment
of Socially Rehabilitated Methadone Maintenance Patients&quot;
about the study of the first 40 medically maintained former
heroin addicts. These patients are seen in the atmosphere of a
doctor's office, with an appointment during regular hours, along
with other medical patients. At the visits, the patient submits a
urine, takes a dose of medication in front of the doctor or his
staff, completes a questionnaire, and is interviewed. He or she
may receive up to 28 days' medication at the doctor's discretion.
These patients do not receive the counseling that is mandatory in
the clinic setting but may be referred to counseling if needed. <br>
<br>
Some of the requirements for Medical Maintenance are:<br>
<br>
1. Five years in methadone maintenance treatment.<br>
2. Employed or other productive use of time for the past three
years and legitimate income.<br>
3. No criminal involvement for past three years.<br>
4. No drug or alcohol abuse for the past three years.<br>
5. Record of reliability in methadone maintenance, i.e. regular
attendance at counseling sessions, urine submissions, no requests
for replacement bottles of methadone, and have obeyed clinic
rules.<br>
6. Decision that long-term methadone maintenance will be
necessary, i.e. unsuccessful detox attempts, judgement of patient
and doctor.<br>
7. Emotional stability.<br>
8. No socializing with illicit drug users (to diminish
diversion).<br>
9. Recommendation from clinic with thorough knowledge of
patient's history.<br>
10. Patients must be volunteers and agree to participate in
research evaluations.<br>
<br>
This study began in June 1983; as of January 1988, &quot;in
follow-up ranging from 12 to 55 months, 33 (82.5%) of 40 had
remained in medical maintenance, yielding an annual retention
rate of 94%. Five (12.5%) patients had been discharged because of
cocaine abuse and returned to a conventional methadone
maintenance program.&quot; Three of the 33 patients had brief
incidents of substance abuse but were &quot;resolved with
counseling and increased frequency of office visits with urine
monitoring. Only four instances of lost medication occurred in
the 1381 patient-months of this study. No overdoses of methadone
were reported by patients or their families.&quot;<br>
<br>
Of an additional 37 patients who were added to Medical
Maintenance &quot;between April 1987 and May 1988, 36 have
remained stable during 1-14 months of treatment, with no
documented substance abuse. One patient was transferred back to
his previous program after having repeatedly exceeded his daily
methadone dose. Thus, of the 77 patients admitted to medical
maintenance since its inception, 69 (90%) have remained in
treatment as of this writing (June 1988).&quot;<br>
<br>
Other patients were added to Medical Maintenance in 1989 to total
100. Patients were followed in Medical Maintenance for a total of
3.5-9.25 years. As of September 1992, the number of patients in
good standing was 72. Of the other 28 patients who left Medical
Maintenance, only 15 were unfavorably discharged--11 for cocaine
use, 3 for misuse of medication, and one (1) was discharged for
repeatedly failing to keep appointments. <br>
<br>
Patients perceived the benefits to be &quot;that of being treated
in a more professional atmosphere. They have reported improved
self-esteem from being regarded as medical patients rather than
drug abusers, from being rewarded with a degree of trust after
many years of excellent performance in treatment, and from no
longer being required to receive unnecessary supportive services.
. . . Patients have also stated that the 28-day reporting
schedule markedly reduced problems in work attendance and
maintaining confidentiality. . . Medication in tablets rather
than as a liquid which required constant refrigeration also
allowed patients to take extended business trips or vacations.
Finally, the physician-patient relationship is improved, since
treatment decisions are based on clinical indications rather than
impersonal regulations.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is a great outcome when we stop to think about it. Out of
100 heroin addicts who were out on the street costing themselves
and society untold grief, 85 were salvaged and contribute to
themselves, their families and society because of methadone and
medical maintenance. Granted, most of them would probably have
remained in the clinics if they had not been accepted for medical
maintenance, but after five years of repressive clinic rules,
they had earned by their exemplary behavior the chance to be free
of some of the restrictions .<br>
<br>
We need more doctors who are knowledgeable about substance abuse
who would be willing to integrate methadone patients into their
practices. Of course, there is the problem of regulation , the
DEA and other government agencies; and believe me, as methadone
patients we know about regulations and sympathize with those
doctors who would be willing to do this. We would, however, also
be eternally grateful. <br>
<br>
Even though I have once-a-week take homes, I have a 45-minute
drive each way to the clinic in good weather and drive a car with
over 100,000 miles on it. After eight years, I am more than ready
to find a local physician who would be able to prescribe for me
on a monthly basis. Some of us just do not need weekly or twice
monthly counseling sessions, nor can we afford them. </p>

<p align="center">There may be a good reason why many have a
difficult time detoxing off methadone. According to Philip Kanof
et al, in the <b><i>American Journal of Psychiatry </i></b>(1993
March), &quot;development of an organic mood syndrome is a common
occurrence in patients undergoing slow detoxification from
methadone maintenance treatment and is associated with a poor
outcome. <br>
<br>
Even with these 24 highly-motivated patients, the failure rate
was substantial. The patients were selected for detox because
they were not using any illicit drugs, were not involved in
&quot;drug-culture-related activities&quot;, were employed and
had stable family relationships. Thirteen (over half) of the
patients involved in the study did not complete the
detoxification.. <br>
<br>
All of the patients were stabilized and maintained at a starting
dose for 2-5 weeks before start of detox, and all data obtained
at this time was referred to as the baseline. The study was
double blind which means that neither patient nor investigators
knew the patient's dose. All of the patients' daily doses were
decreased by 5mg weekly until their dose reached 15mg. At that
time, the daily dose was decreased by 3mg weekly.<br>
<br>
Using 3 different rating scales, 2 of which were subjective and
one objective scale, these patients were self- and staff-rated
for signs of opiate withdrawal on a weekly basis. &quot;Patients
who failed to complete detoxification manifested significantly
greater increases from baseline in symptoms of dysphoria as
measured by&quot; subjective and objective signs of opoid
withdrawal. &quot;The results indicate an association between the
emergence of clinically significant symptoms of dysphoria and
lack of success in therapeutic detoxification from methadone
maintenance.&quot; Symptoms including fatigue, insomnia, loss of
appetite, etc. suggest &quot;criteria for a major depressive
episode as defined in DSM-III-R. However, the prompt reduction in
symptoms of dysphoria following restabilization on methadone. .
.clearly demonstrates the organic etiology of the prominent mood
disturbance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Does this mean that all is lost and that we will be dependent
forever on methadone? These researchers feel that there may be
good evidence that anti-depressants should be started before
detox in order to prevent or treat depressive symptoms. Also, all
of these subjects were detoxed at the same rate, but we are all
individuals and need to detox at our own rate. Some of us may
need to stop the detox several times to become restabilized
before continuing. <br>
<br>
The point needs to be made, however, that methadone maintenance
is a legitimate treatment for opioid dependence, and it is not
the be all and end all of every methadone-maintained person to
detox. The world will not come to an end if we have tried to
detox and have been unable. The subjects selected seemed to be
doing just fine before they started to detox. Remember the
criterion for being selected--the subjects were not using any
illicit drugs, they were employed or going to school, were not
involved in drug-related activities, and they had improved and
stabilized family relationships. What do we define as success?
Let's not put people in impossible situations. If a person wants
to detox, that's fine--more power to them if they can do it. If
they can't, but have made all those other improvements in their
lives, why can't we leave them alone? </p>

<p align="center">With the next issue of <b><i>Methadone Today</i></b>
will come funding from the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF). Many of
you know how we have struggled to keep the newsletter in print
and mailed over the past year, and this grant comes just in time
to save it. We appreciate the opportunity that the DPF grant has
given us to keep the lines of communication open and encourage
even more patient and clinic participation. Thank you, DPF!!!<br>
<br>
The DPF puts out a pamphlet which states that it was established
in 1986 and is the &quot;leading independent forum for
alternatives to the failed drug war, including legalization,
medicalization and harm reduction. The basic premise of the
Foundation's work is that a war is not a domestic policy. . .
.The Foundation counters drug-war spawned misinformation and
hysteria through accurate research and a widespread educational
campaign. Because of [their] work, the media and the public
increasingly recognize the destruction and futility of the drug
war.&quot; <br>
<br>
Now that the funding problem is not at crisis level (we can still
use a dollar or two from our readers to defray costs), and we
will be putting out an issue every month, we are hoping that many
more of you will submit articles for publication. If you
submitted an article that did not get published, it may not have
reached me. However, mail comes directly to me now, and I will do
my best to include every person's efforts. Don't worry about
spelling--that is the function of the spell checker and the word
processor. We want your ideas, stories and concerns. This is your
newsletter. Has something happened to you at a clinic that you
feel is unfair? Have you ever been in jail and been denied
methadone treatment? How about the hospital? Do you have a
counselor or other staff member who has gone to bat for you when
no one else would? What were you like before methadone, and what
are you like now? We know you have an amazing story, and we want
it. If you prefer, we don't have to publish your name.<br>
<br>
The DPF has notified us that the only condition of funding for
the newsletter is that we do not publish any articles that could
be construed as lobbying. Although we have published some in the
past, they have been assured that we will not do so during the
next year using any of their funding, equipment or supplies.
According to Webster's Dictionary, &#145;lobbying' is defined as
&quot;a group of people trying to bring pressure to bear on
legislators to pursue policies favorable to their interests.
Please keep this in mind when submitting articles.<br>
<br>
This is an appropriate place to offer thanks to NPL and
especially Arlene Heiser for their generous support in making
sure we have had access to equipment and supplies for printing
Methadone Today. Thanks to Sterling for allowing me to interrupt
his work space (doing so with good grace) while making copies of
the newsletter, to the counselors for not saying much when
getting in their way, to Kemmer for allowing me to disrupt
Wednesday mornings, and to Dr. Burk just for being himself.<br>
Thanks to Penny for writing the rough draft of the body of the

name="The Use of Insulin in the Treatment of Diabetes:   An Analogy to Methadone Maintenance"><b>The
Use of Insulin in the Treatment of Diabetes: <br>
An Analogy to Methadone Maintenance</b></a><b><br>
by J. Thomas Payte, M.D.</b>1 </p>

<p>A five-year study was conducted on 300 insulin-dependent
diabetics. The purpose of the study was to determine if the use
of insulin resulted in any long-term benefit to diabetics. The
concept was based on two widely accepted hypotheses: (1) that a
formerly insulin-dependent diabetic could learn to live a
comfortable and responsible life without insulin, provided that
he or she wanted to badly enough; and (2) that the use of any
exogenous substance to replace or simply substitute for a
deficient endogenous substance is conceptually unacceptable to
modern scientific thinking and may be inherently evil.<br>
<br>
It is obvious that exogenous insulin, being highly suspect at the
outset, should be used in the lowest possible doses and for the
shortest time possible. In this study, treatment with insulin was
limited to two years and the daily dose was limited to a maximum
of 40 units. The posttreatment follow-up period varied from three
days to three years, depending on the duration of survival.
During the treatment phase (insulin maintenance), random urine
samples were collected under direct supervision and tested for
glucose at least weekly. A positive urine glucose resulted in a
warning to the patient. After three positive urine tests, the
dose of insulin was reduced by five units daily for each positive
urine test. This policy was intended to increase motivation on
the part of the patient to provide urine specimens negative for
glucose. If positives continued, the insulin was eventually
discontinued and the patients were placed in the follow-up group.
The authors of the study felt that patients would have a better
chance of reentry into insulin maintenance at a later date if (a)
the patients survived and (b) patients accepted full
responsibility for their insulin dependence and were willing to
go to any lengths to recover.<br>
<br>
All patients were required to endure one hour of individual or
group counseling each week, which addressed such subjects as meal
planning, hygiene for the feet, pancreatic imagery, and dietary
assertiveness. Counseling patients fell into one of three
categories: those who had no need or desire for counseling; those
who might need counseling but were entirely unwilling to
participate; and those who both wanted and needed extensive
counseling, but the counselors were so busy spending an hour a
week with the others that they were unable to meet the increased
demands and needs of this group. Avoiding this bothersome,
time-consuming, and costly process of individualized treatment
also served to reduce the risk of enabling the patients'
maladaptive behaviors by what could seem to be a reward system.
The resulting uniformity of service assured that the needs of no
one were met. It was hoped that by making the treatment
unpleasant that motivation for recovery would be enhanced.<br>
<br>
Half the participants failed to complete the two-year treatment
with insulin maintenance. Some patients simply dropped out of
treatment, but most were terminated for continued
glucose-positive urines. This was despite repeated warnings and
in absolute defiance of the reductions in insulin dosage with
each glucose-positive urine. It was concluded that this
population is poorly motivated, difficult to work with, and is
lacking the resources needed to effect the major life changes
required for recovery. Many of this group died during follow-up.
Some survived with amputations, blindness, neuropathies, and
other conditions associated with the unhealthy life-styles of the
diabetic.<br>
<br>
The remaining half did manage to complete the two-year treatment
and even appeared to experience relatively good health and
seemingly normal functioning. Of course, this illusion of
apparent good health was at the expense of continuing to maintain
the insulin-dependent status with daily insulin. Some
investigators speculated that insulin might be continued over a
longer period of time and at higher doses. This notion was
quickly rejected as being absurd because good health should not
be obtained at just any cost. As the patients approached the
two-year period, the insulin doses were tapered over the final
two months. All subjects began having positive urine tests and
again were showing active insulin-dependent diabetes. The obvious
conclusion is that insulin does not help the insulin-dependent
diabetic and is not effective in treatment. The high mortality
rate of posttreatment patients suggests that insulin may have had
some delayed, deadly toxic effects. This concept should be the
subject of future research.<br>
<br>
<b>COMMENT<br>
</b>This &quot;insulin spoof&quot; was originally written with
the idea to share it among friends and colleagues. Somewhat
surprisingly, the spoof was well received by many who urged that
it be shared with a wider audience. Initially, the intention was
to transpose rather typical and illogical clinical thought
processes about methadone maintenance to another more familiar
chronic and incurable disease.<br>
<br>
The transposition to a disease that is much more widely
understood made the line of reasoning clearly absurd in the new
context. Yet when this pseudologic is applied to chronic opiod
dependence and methadone maintenance, few people find anything
wrong or out of place. One might conclude that the vision of some
is clouded by the philosophical and ideological considerations
that erect barriers to understanding, accepting, and implementing
this lifesaving treatment modality for those chronic intractable
heroin addicts who need it.<br>
<br>
Any humor in this parody is quickly lost when one estimates the
loss of life and other costs associated with untreated heroin
addiction that can be attributed to a persistent shortage of
methadone treatment slots. This shortage is due, in part, to
persistent negative attitudes toward the methadone treatment
modality. </p>

name="Hair Testing for Drugs--A Case for Discrimination"><b>Hair
Testing for Drugs--A Case for Discrimination</b></a> </p>

<p>Our laws against certain drugs began as a result of
discrimination against minorities. The first two laws against
opiates were passed in response to discrimination of the Chinese;
they were thought of as an inferior race. In 1910, legislation
was requested regarding cocaine since its use was touted to be
the direct incentive to the crime of rape by Negroes. Thus, the
stage was set for greater and greater social control and loss of
liberty.<br>
<br>
When urine testing began in the workplace, it was for those who
had jobs such as air controller, pilot, etc.--those who had to be
aware of public safety concerns. Now, any employer can test
anyone for drugs--from the person who routes airplanes to the one
who sweeps the floor. It is bad enough that a person has to
submit to tests that allow an employer to have access to what was
done over the weekend, even when proficiency testing is available
and could properly show fitness for work. Proficiency testing
tells the employer if you are able to do the job--without
invading your privacy. <br>
<br>
Now, however, the big push is for hair analysis, which tells your
employer what you did all last year. Despite the problems
associated with urine testing (threat to personal liberties, lab
error, false positives, etc.), the time it takes the body to
break down a drug is relatively the same in all races; not so
with hair testing. This method allows whites, who used drugs at
the same time as their African-American counterparts, to escape
detection while African-Americans are either denied jobs or
fired.<br>
<br>
According to a study done by Gary Henderson, Ph.D., at the
University of California at Davis, at the same dose,
non-Caucasians had up to 12 times as much cocaine in their hair
as Caucasians. Also, the drug stays in the hair for longer
periods of time--greater than 10 months for one non-Caucasian. <br>
<br>
The reason for this may be that cocaine binds to melanin, as
reported by Robert Joseph et al at the American Academy of
Forensic Sciences in Nashville, February 19-24, 1996. Some of the
findings were: <br>
<br>
Male, African, black hair--10 times more binding for cocaine than
male Caucasian brown/black hair.<br>
<br>
Untreated, male African black hair bound cocaine almost 500 times
more than blond Caucasian hair.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Bleached</i></b> male African hair--four times that of
blond male Caucasian hair.<br>
<br>
Green et al, <b><i>Journal of Analytical Toxicology</i></b>
(March/April 1996), in an animal study, reports that the ratio of
methadone in black to white hair is 21 to 1--this despite the
fact that the melanin content in the black hair used in this
study was only 3.5 times greater than that of the white hair.<br>
These are not the only problems with hair testing. There is no
uniformity in the testing cutoff point (point at which it is
agreed that a test is negative), and there are no set testing
techniques. In other words, four different labs may use four
different ways to produce results. There is also the problem of
environmental contamination, among others.<br>
<br>
The best that can be said for hair testing is that it indicates
whether a person has used drugs or not. However, the problems far
outweigh the benefits (if any) of such a test. Why in the world
does an employer need to know whether a person took drugs 6
months ago? In fact, why do they need to know if a person took
drugs last night? If a person can pass a proficiency test
(computer testing for awareness, alertness, and ability to do the
job competently) that is all the employer needs to know.<br>
<br>
According to H. Westley Clark, M.D., J.D.,, M.P.H., University of
California, &quot;African Americans, Hispanics, and East Indians
are at greater risk. . .&quot; for detection of drug use. They
also test for a longer period of time than Caucasians. &quot;Hair
analysis is a very good technique to foster discrimination. [It]
has the aura of science, [and] it is pushed by scientist [sic]
who can use fancy terms and fancy language to reassure employers,
politicians and courts that only drug users are being identified
by the techniques involved.&quot; <br>
<br>
Dr. Clark suggests that African Americans could bleach their hair
to &quot;level the playing field.&quot; Or, we could all go one
step further and shave our heads. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="Buprenorphine vs Methadone"><b>Buprenorphine
vs Methadone</b></a> </p>

<p>Buprenorphine is an analgesic for use in the treatment of
opiate addiction. It produces less euphoria than morphine and
heroin, and &quot;some studies also suggest that withdrawal
effects are less severe with Buprenorphine than with
methadone.&quot; As with LAAM, it is released slowly so that
dosing may be every other day instead of every day as is done
with methadone.<br>
<br>
A study done by Dr. Eric Strain et al at Johns Hopkins University
found that patients who were treated with Buprenorphine stayed in
treatment as long as those who received methadone. In another
study by Dr. Rolley E. Johnson et al, done with about the same
number of patients (162), the retention rate was somewhat less
(42% as compared to Dr. Strain's 56% retention rate).<br>
<br>
Buprenorphine &quot;is administered under the tongue via a small
syringe. Patients do not swallow the medication but allow it to
be absorbed through the mucous membranes that line the inside of
the mouth.&quot; Another difference is in the dose--8 mg of
Buprenorphine seems to be equal to 50-60 mg of methadone. In Dr.
Strain's study, if a patient's urine tests showed opiates, the
dose &quot;could be increased to a maximum of 90 mg of methadone
or 16 mg of Buprenorphine.&quot;<br>
<br>
The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) &quot;officials are
quick to caution that approval of Buprenorphine would not
diminish the importance of methadone in the treatment of heroin
addiction. &#145;It's certainly not our intent to supplant
methadone,' Segal says. &#145;Rather, NIDA wants to expand the
drug treatment armamentarium and the overall number of patients
in treatment.&quot;1 </p>

IS THE PURPOSE OF DRUG LAWS?</b></a><b><br>
by John Lystad</b> </p>

<p align="center">My name is John, and I am currently in a
methadone program since I have long past the stage where I could
tolerate what I would have to do in order to support my habit of
heroin. Here is a short essay on how I view restrictive drug
laws.<br>
<br>
Let us not forget that drug addicts are human beings and as such
are guaranteed certain rights in the Constitution--the Bill of
Rights. Is this not correct? Consider for a second that modern
medical science has recently determined addiction to be genetic
in nature and not a choice. Even without that, don't we have the
right to the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hurt other
people at least in the physical sense? If so, why are we treated
worse than violent offenders when it comes to punishments handed
down by the courts? It seems absurd that a nation could actually
release a murderer from prison so as to make room for a drug
offender. As far as I can see, drug use in and of itself is a
victimless crime if there is no legal or emotional stigma
attached to it. When extreme artificial importance is attached to
something such as the propaganda supporting the &quot;drug
war,&quot; a common result is fascination, neurosis, and
irrational behavior. If an adult wishes to use a mind or body
altering substance, it should be up to that individual.<br>
<br>
No one owns your body except yourself so, therefore, shouldn't
&quot;you&quot; be the deciding factor of what goes into it? If
not, who is to decide and on what basis or whose consideration?
It seems that for all my adult years, somebody or something has
been preventing me from exercising my freedom of choice in a
fundamental way. It has been decided for me one of the most basic
of human rights--what I can or cannot put into my own body. Am I
not smart enough or important enough to decide for myself what
goes into my own body?<br>
<br>
Why was &quot;drug prohibition&quot; started in the first place?
When the Harrison Narcotic Act was passed, there was hardly any
drug problem at all. Out of all the drugs available when they
were legal, there was maybe one addict out of a thousand people,
and anyone could just go to the corner store and buy drugs
cheaply. Now, after over eighty years of this vicious drug war
Puritanism, just look at the marvelous result. Drugs, having
become profitable, are everywhere. Enough is enough; besides, I
hardly think there is anyone on the face of the planet who is
better qualified than me to decide what is right for me.<br>
<br>
Since I was born, I have never seen a day when drugs have not
been hunted down, demonized, condemned, scapegoated, and oh yes,
widely used and hugely profitable. I do not advocate drug use
but, at the same time, I do not condemn it. After all, &quot;drug
prohibition&quot; causes the very thing it is supposed to
suppress--large scale use. This widespread usage comes from the
fact that if you know you have something that people will always
want and have always wanted, then lo and behold it's suddenly
made illegal, you can practically set your price, thus producing
huge profits for any person willing to risk selling it.<br>
<br>
Many people seem to think that addicts are involved in crime so
much because they are high on drugs; nothing could be further
from the truth. In reality, it's more like this: The addict wakes
up in the morning with a terrible knowledge that he/she must come
up with an almost unreal amount of money just to sustain their
habit in order to be able to function for one more day. Since no
honest job can afford them enough money to support their habit at
prohibition prices, the addict must resort to crime if no other
legal way exists for them to continually come up with exorbitant
amounts of money. <br>
<br>
In early addiction, many people, if employed, can afford a light
indulgence on their salary alone. It is common, however, that as
the addiction grows, the job will no longer support the growing
appetite for the drug. This causes absenteeism because a person
going through withdrawal is likely to miss work in order to come
up with some quick money, legal or not, just to feel better. Of
course, this costs the employer money and often leads to
termination of the employee which in itself has a tendency in
many people to increase their desire to use.<br>
<br>
There is another problem with highly restrictive drug laws. They
are terribly expensive to maintain. Who pays? We all do in our
taxes that no longer go toward truly beneficial social programs
that improve our quality of life so as to be able to pay $30,000
per inmate per year to keep drug offenders in overcrowded jails.
Law enforcement and penal institution budgets must also be
continually increased to keep up with the unnecessary but now
abundant drug-related crime.<br>
Our ill-conceived drug policy also takes an emotional toll. Who
nowadays isn't worried about becoming the victim of crime? Could
this lead to an automatic distrust of people unknown to us? What
effect does this have? What parent isn't worried about their
child becoming a casualty of drug-selling violence or peer
pressure? Schools are infested with drug
&quot;entrepreneurs&quot; marketing their product. Why? As long
as drugs are illegal, they will be unnaturally profitable, and
wherever there is a lucrative market for something, people will
take advantage of it and cash in. So, ultimately, anti-drug laws
produce more, not less drug consumption.<br>
<br>
If you're hip to hypocrisy, look at the U.S. as regards Columbia
or Panama. America told Columbia to stop growing coca or suffer
economic consequences while, at the very same time, the U.S. is
their biggest customer for it, making it a most profitable crop.
Second, think of the Noriega incident where America actually
invaded another sovereign nation to kidnap its president,
ostensibly because he didn't do what the U.S. told him to do
regarding the coca trade. I say &quot;ostensibly&quot; because I
believe the real reason America captured Panama's president and
put him in prison is because he had somehow become a threat to
some powerful people's business interests. I wonder how America
would feel if Panama invaded America and took the president
hostage? Not too good I would imagine.<br>
<br>
Cocaine production will never decrease as long as there is a
lucrative market for it, and as long as people keep making a big
fuss about it, there will always be a lucrative market. This is
simply an aspect of the law of supply and demand that holds true
for all goods and services.<br>
<br>
It's time America stopped confusing a medical problem with a
criminal one. The damage already done is immeasurable. The
dangers of holding on to our greed-inspired drug policies include
the very real possibility of losing some of the most precious
things that this country was founded on--Life, Liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness, free from unreasonable intrusions into some
of the most private aspects of our lives under the guise of law
and order. </p>

- IN MEMORY OF IRA SOBEL</b></a><b> <br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p align="center">Ira Sobel died Sunday, July 7, 1996. He had
been hospitalized the week prior for symptoms resulting from
Hepatitis C. According to Joycelyn Woods, Executive
Vice-President of NAMA, he checked himself out of the hospital
against medical advice and started having chest pains a few days
later. He called 911 but by the time they arrived, he was dead. <br>
<br>
Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver, and it is common among
addicts due to the sharing of needles and other infected
paraphernalia. Active addicts and those who have not used in
years are susceptible to this virus. Interferon is used to treat
Hepatitis C, along with strict diet, good personal hygiene, and
abstinence from alcohol. <br>
<br>
Ira experienced a bout of Hepatitis C in March 1995. In his own
words from an article he wrote: <br>
<br>
I experienced severe pain in my legs and ankles. My legs swelled
up and became bloated. I had water retention. I was unaware that
this swelling to my legs is a tell-tale sign of something bad. I
went to a liver specialist who took my blood, and he directed me
to have a sonogram.<br>
<br>
Signs of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) are:<br>
<br>
Elevated liver enzymes<br>
Blood transfusion history<br>
Sex with an IV drug user<br>
Intravenous use history<br>
Swelling of hands or feet (Edema)<br>
Scab-like lesions over arms and legs<br>
<br>
Many of you have commented that you enjoyed reading Ira's
articles. I still have some that he sent me to publish, so you
will see his name in print periodically (In fact, the article by
Ira <b>&quot;LAAM: The Real Deal&quot;</b> was written just
before he died. He was having trouble faxing it to me, and he
decided he was only going to try one last time--fortunately for
us, it worked because he died soon after). Just out of the
hospital, he was worrying about the newsletters for which he
wrote. Ira made a great contribution to Methadone Today, and we
will miss his enthusiasm for methadone advocacy. I know I will
certainly miss his Sunday phone calls to find out how the
newsletter was going. Ira was a great support to me and <b><i>Methadone

<p align="center"><a name="LAAM:  The Real Deal"><b>LAAM: The
Real Deal</b></a><b><br>
by Ira Sobel (New York City)</b> </p>

<p>I was recently informed by my counselor that my program will
be offering Levomethadyl Acetate Hydrochloride (LAAM) in January
1997. Right up front I will say that LAAM is <b><i>not</i></b> a
long-acting methadone!!! It is a different medication altogether.
LAAM is growing due to its false claims made by the
pharmaceutical company, Roxane. The company puts out a colorful
brochure with claims that by switching to their drug, it
&quot;gives your patients time for a productive life.&quot; What
hooey!!!<br>
<br>
Believe me, it's all about diversion and how the DEA is going to
deal with it. I will try to be objective but again, I say that we
on methadone should know all about every change and proposal
taking place in the methadone treatment field. In this case, LAAM
is just another part of the big picture--just a tip of the
iceberg. There are many new changes and proposals taking place in
the methadone treatment field, such as:<br>
<br>
1. The 7 Day a week, no take-home issue.<br>
<br>
2. The conversion from one type of methadone to another type,
such as the changeover from orange diskette to cherry methadose.
There are at least 4 different types of methadone being dispensed
in methadone programs in New York city.<br>
<br>
3. LAAM, marketed under the name ORLAAM, is being offered at more
programs throughout the United States.<br>
<br>
I have written articles relating to each new development. In the
June 1996 issue of <b><i>Methadone Today</i></b>, I wrote
&quot;The Seven Day Issue: Sneak Attack!!!&quot; concerning the
DEA and their fight for <b><i>all</i></b> patients on methadone
to report to the clinic 7 days a week with no take-homes. The
basis for these proposals are directly linked to loitering and
diversion. To stop diversion, the DEA wants to stop all
take-homes.<br>
<br>
The DEA has not been successful in busting cocaine cartels. The
&quot;War on Drugs&quot; is a failure. So, the powers that be
decided to go after people on methadone throughout the country. A
Real Sneak Attack!!! <br>
<br>
In October 1995, I wrote an article for <b><i>Methadone Awareness</i></b>
called &quot;Winds of Change&quot; in which I depicted the
different types of methadone being used in New York City. In that
piece, I talked about the fears and crucial questions every
person on methadone has about the possible changeover.<br>
<br>
I spoke to many patients who expressed concern when they learned
of changes and about the new types of methadone. For years it was
felt that the orange diskette would be the only form of methadone
dispensed to all people on methadone. Currently, there are at
least four different types being used in New York City. They are:
Orange diskette, Cherry Methadose, White Diskette, and Clear
Liquid, made from powder. When a methadone program changes types
of methadone, there is a transitional period whereby the
patient's body must adjust to the new medication. So, it seems
natural for the patients to have trepidation concerning the
change from one type of methadone to another.<br>
<br>
I see a similarity between the types of methadone development and
now LAAM in that the critical questions and fears remain the
same, such as, &quot;Will I feel different or normal? Will I
experience a feeling of sickness or anxiety? <b><i>Will this new
type of medication hold me?</i></b>&quot; That's the bottom line
here. It all boils down to the fear of the unknown that makes
patients fearful of any change. And that includes me.<br>
<br>
<b>Methadone vs. LAAM <br>
</b>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LAAM, which
is the first alternative medication to treat opiate addiction in
years. It is touted to be a synthetic opiod similar to methadone
but, brothers and sisters, that is not the case. LAAM &quot;is
fundamentally a different medication because it produces a lower
level of narcotic effects than perceived by the methadone
patient.&quot; This quote was made by Walter Ling, at a symposium
in New York City, co-sponsored by The National Institute on Drug
Abuse (NIDA) to brief heroin treatment practitioners on the use
of LAAM. Mr. Ling was the principal investigator on two LAAM
studies.<br>
<br>
LAAM was developed in 1948 as a pain killer. When LAAM was tested
in 1952, it was found that the drug could prevent withdrawal
symptoms for 72 hours. That is the major selling point to LAAM.
The simple fact that the drug lasts up to 72 hours, compared to
methadone which lasts from 24-36 hours, is LAAM's ace in the
hole. LAAM has some similarities to methadone, but it is not
methadone. Yes, LAAM is a synthetic narcotic and yes, it lasts up
to 72 hours so patients can reduce the number of times they have
to report to the clinic if they choose LAAM1<br>
<br>
LAAM is fundamentally a different medication than methadone, and
more and more clinic systems are making the switch to include
this medication. Roxane, the pharmaceutical company that produces
ORLAAM, puts out a pamphlet entitled, &quot;Information for
Patients and Family Members&quot; to explain the changeover from
methadone to LAAM. <b>Peace.</b> </p>

<p align="center">1That is, unless they have earned once - or
twice - per - week take home privileges. There are no LAAM take
homes. </p>

<a name="Dangerous Precedent"><b>Dangerous Precedent</b></a><b><br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p align="center">On March 29, 1996, President Clinton signed
into effect Public Law 104-121. This law eliminates addicts from
eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social
Security Disability (SSD). The new eligibility requirements are
effective &quot;immediately for any new or pending claim for
SSI/SSDI benefits based on the disability determination for
substance abusers where alcoholism and/or drug addiction is a
contributing factor material to the eligibility
determination&quot; (AMTA News Report, May 1996). For those
already receiving benefits, they will be terminated January 1,
1997 unless they reapply by July 29, 1996 and qualify under the
redetermination for something other than alcohol or drug
addiction. <br>
<br>
This is a dangerous precedent. If drug and alcohol problems are
not included in the definition of disability, this could affect
Medicaid and insurance companies' funding of drug and alcohol
treatment. It is very unfortunate that legislators voted this in
and that our President allowed it.<br>
<br>
It is very easy to attack addicts, the poor, women, and children.
It is very easy to take away from the powerless in society, those
who have no voice. This was the easy way out. Addicts have been
so demonized that it is very easy to disallow benefits to them.
It is the old adage--penny wise, pound foolish. Yes, it may look
like a few dollars are being saved, but the fact of the matter is
that for every $1 spent on drug and alcohol treatment, there is a
$7 saving to society. <b><i>For every $1 spent on methadone
treatment, there is a saving of $12 to $14</i></b>. Does it still
look like the same good deal now?<br>

<p align="center"><a name="SAD TALES FROM NASSAU COUNTY JAIL"><b>SAD
TALES FROM NASSAU COUNTY JAIL</b></a><b><br>
</b>Reprinted from Methadone Awareness - October 1995<br>
<b>by Donna Schoen (Long Island, NY)<br>
</b></p>

<p align="center">Several months ago, a friend called me up
unusually upset. The father of her child (who was a patient at
L.I.J. MMTP) called her from Nassau County Jail. Sick with the
AIDS virus, the jail was refusing to medicate him with his
methadone. Phone calls from his program were received by the
jail, pleading with them to medicate this patient. After all, his
body was going through hell from the withdrawal from the
methadone and from being sick with the virus.<br>
<br>
After 7 days of leaving Mr. J.B. sick, crying and begging like a
dog, they finally gave him methadone - a blind 7-day detox.
Whatever the blind dose was, it was inadequate. He still
suffered. After the 7-day inadequate detox, he was given
Clonadine - which is a blood pressure medication which is also
inadequate in detoxing someone off of opiates.<br>
<br>
Being a Patient Advocate, I was outraged at hearing this. I could
feel his suffering. As chairperson of the Patient Committee at
Long Island Jewish, and a member of NAMA, I started hearing more
and more tales of the mistreatment of methadone maintenance
patients at Nassau County Jail. I've heard at least 40 stories
from people that I know were there.<br>
<br>
I was at Rikers Island back in 1992, and I know they have the
&#145;KEEP Program' there. I believe Suffolk County also makes
provisions for methadone patients. All I could think was
&quot;What's wrong with these people? How can they treat human
beings like this?&quot; They are treating us like dogs. They make
us squirm and beg like dogs for our methadone. It is done on a
case by case basis. If they decide to detox you, they will. <b><i>Hard,
fast and dangerously!!!</i></b> And they leave you hanging for <b><i>days</i></b>
while deciding this.<br>
<br>
People have likened the doctor there to someone out of the
Gestapo. The stories were outrageous. All I could think of is
that something has to be done. Any of us living here in Nassau
County could end up there and in the same situation as these
people. I started asking people for their stories about their
stays in the N.C. Jail. Aside from Mr. J.B.'s story (which I just
gave), here are excerpts from some of the stories which I
received:<br>
<br>
<b>Mr. R.C.<br>
</b>&quot;I <b><i>repeatedly</i></b> informed the detectives and
then the guards at NC Jail that I was on a Methadone Program and
on a dosage of 100 mgs. I told them that a detox from such a high
dose could be detrimental. The guards told me &quot;That's your
problem. It's not our fault that you're a drug addict.&quot;
While in lock-up, I started having heart palpitations and was
rushed to Nassau County Medical Center (NCMC), where I was
medicated. But no one would tell me what amount was being
administered.&quot;<br>
<br>
(<b>**What other person, asides from a desperate addict, would
accept being given a medication and not knowing what dose they
were receiving??!)<br>
<br>
Mr. M.G.<br>
</b>&quot;My fifth and most terrifying experience went like this:
I came down to 40 mgs. in anticipation of spending 4 months in
Nassau County Jail Hell. I received a 9-day detox. About 3 days
after the end of my detox, I got really sick and was unable to
stop vomiting. In the course of 1 month, I lost at least 40
pounds. I visited NCMC at least 2 times and was told it was a
stomach virus. I was put on a liquid diet and I stayed in the
shower all day and threw up all night. I told them I was sick and
withdrawing, but none of the doctors at the jail wanted to hear
that. To make a long story short, they gave me exploratory
surgery, and I have the 12-inch scar to prove it. The only thing
they found was a partial obstruction, which the surgeon said was
formed from vomiting for such a long time. I wouldn't wish this
treatment on an enemy! Nassau County needs a change! It's long
overdue!&quot;<br>
<br>
(<b>**Mr. M.G. had similar experiences with other detoxes at
Nassau County Jail, but none as devastating as this one.)<br>
<br>
Mr. B.D.<br>
</b>&quot;I went to Nassau County Jail on A DWI in January 1992.
I told the doctor that I was on methadone and was legally on a
prescription for Xanax (see note below). I never saw an actual
doctor, just a guy with a limp. They said, &quot;Get this guy out
of here.&quot; They sent me to NCMC. They chained me to a bed and
let me withdraw. They gave me Ipecac syrup to induce vomiting.
After 2 days, I was finally given methadone. They never gave me
anything to detox me from the pills. <b><i>I was chained to a bed
for 21 days</i></b>. Then I was returned to the jail. I hadn't
slept in 44 days. <b><i>After I got back to the jail, I had a
seizure.</i></b> Another inmate, (Mr. S.) Had full-blown AIDS. He
was on 100 mgs. of methadone. The doctor told him that the
methadone was killing him. They scared him into stopping the
methadone. He ended up in unbearable pain, had dementia and was
given dialysis. He died.&quot;<br>
<br>
(<b>**Xanax is one of the most dangerous detoxes. Anyone that is
detoxing is vomiting enough on their own without being given
something to induce vomiting. Inducing vomiting on a person that
is detoxing is cruel and dangerous. This could cause the person
to dehydrate, among other things</b>.)<br>
<br>
Something must be done. Although the right thing would be to
maintain meth patients on their present dose (like diabetics
are), the least that could be done is for the jail to institute a
&quot;KEEP&quot; program. None of these people deserve to be
treated like this. This is the 1990's - not the Dark Ages!
Methadone has been used successfully for 30 years. We should not
be thrown in a cell like animals, left without our medication and
sick like dogs. Do these people have any compassion? I guess not.
<b><i>Something has to change.<br>
<br>
Note from the editors of Methadone Today: </i></b><i>Although
these stories happened in Nassau County Jail, any city, Anywhere,
USA could be substituted. It is a sad fact that this is what we
have come to because addicts have been so demonized that people
don't care what happens to them. If an animal was treated the way
these people were treated, there would be animal rights activists
knocking down doors and screaming for resignations. But, these
are &quot;</i><b><i>just&quot;</i></b><i> addicts, and
&quot;they&quot; didn't go to jail to be fed their drugs. That's
the mentality of this country when discussing drugs, I'm sad to
say. Something certainly does have to change, and that
&quot;something&quot; is people's attitudes about a medical
problem that has been made a criminal &quot;justice&quot;
problem.</i> </p>

<p align="center"><a name="Why IV Users Deserve Clean Needles"><b>Why
IV Users Deserve Clean Needles</b></a><b><br>
by Maia Szalavitz</b> </p>

<p align="center">They hadn't seen such a crowd on Delancey
Street in years. Two weeks ago, ACT UP and Jon Parker's National
AIDS Brigade, incensed by the mayor's decision to close the
city's needle exchange program, came to hand out syringes and
bleach. The Guardian Angels came to stage a counter-protest. When
the cops moved in, the shouting reached a feverish pitch. As the
TV cameras focused on activists being handcuffed, a few addicts
took advantage of the confusion, grabbed some bleach, and fled
down a side street.<br>
<br>
Opponents of safe drug-use programs have long argued that
distributing needles and bleach only encourages addiction. They
maintain that people who use drugs are seeking death and won't
take steps to protect themselves from AIDS. They say that addicts
like to share needles. They are wrong on all three counts.<br>
<br>
I first shot drugs in 1986. A friend gave me my wings. I heard
ringing emptiness in my head and wanted the sensation to last
forever. My friend had injected me with his own works. As I went
on to shoot heroin, I continued to share--but only when there
weren't enough needles to go around. When sociologists first saw
needle sharing, they labeled it a &quot;sub-cultural
ritual.&quot; The myth was that sharing was somehow part of the
high--like passing a joint. But no one asked addicts why they
share. The media was all too willing to point out negative
attributes of drug users, but when it came to needles we were
suddenly supposed to be generous.<br>
<br>
In fact, I never saw needle sharing as a ritual and never heard
of anyone who has. Needles are not meant to be reused. The second
user gets a duller point. When you shoot someone else's blood,
you might get a highly unpleasant reaction--called a
&quot;bonecrusher&quot; on the street.<br>
<br>
The only person I've known who was eager to share was notorious
for it--because no one else liked to do it. He was the poorest of
the crowd of junkies I knew. He injected other people's blood
because he thought there might be dope left in it (He later died
of a cocaine overdose, leaving behind a pregnant, HIV-positive
girlfriend).<br>
<br>
A second myth is that addicts don't care enough about life to
protect themselves from AIDS. While I was doing heroin, I didn't
want to die; I wanted to live without pain. I told myself heroin
was keeping me from suicide. AIDS did not offer such
promise--only slow, painful, almost certain death.<br>
<br>
Two months after I started shooting up, a counselor from San
Francisco showed me how I could protect myself by cleaning my
works. From that time until I got straight, I was never without a
bottle of Clorox. I cleaned my works compulsively, just as I used
them.<br>
<br>
My experience is hardly unique. In San Francisco, before 1986,
only 12 per cent of drug users surveyed said they cleaned their
needles. But three years later, after a massive street education
campaign, the portion had jumped to almost 80 per cent. Infection
rates among IV users in San Francisco haven't risen above 15 per
cent since the campaign got underway. <br>
<br>
Some needle exchange opponents look at these figures and say
bleach alone might do the trick. But with bleach, needle sharing
still occurs, and with it the chance that HIV might be
transmitted. San Francisco's success isn't just due to bleach;
though needles are illegal there too, the city quietly tolerates
an informal exchange program.<br>
<br>
In cities where needle exchange is openly permitted--Seattle,
Portland, Tacoma, Sydney, Hong Kong, Paris, London, Glasgow,
Liverpool, and Amsterdam--HIV infection rates have stabilized at
low levels. In Edinburgh, after a police crackdown on syringes in
1987, infection rates abruptly jumped 10 per cent; six months
after needle exchange was instituted, no further increase was
seen.<br>
Meanwhile, according to a 1988 New York County Lawyers
Association study, in nine states where needles are illegal the
rate of infected IV users is six times higher than in states
where needles can be bought over the counter. The state with the
highest rate of all is New York, where as many as 150,000 addicts
are believed to be infected and each day risk spreading the virus
to other addicts, to their spouses, to their unborn children.<br>
<br>
Opponents of needle exchange are blinded by a third myth: that
distributing needles encourages drug abuse. But there has been no
increase in cities where needles are exchanged. In fact, in some
of these cities, drug abuse has declined.<br>
<br>
Some opponents, particularly in minority communities, believe
that the government purposefully tolerates drug dealing and
mistake the effort to save lives through needle distribution as a
form of genocide. They believe the only way to stop AIDS among
users is drug treatment. But those in the minority community who
work with addicts daily, like Yolanda Serrano of the Association
for Drug Abuse, Prevention, and Treatment, are vocal advocates of
needle exchange. They understand that even in the best rehab
programs only a very small fraction stay clean for life. <br>
<br>
On my last day using drugs, I weighed only 80 pounds. I had
pulled out large clumps of my hair and I was an etiolated
grayish-green. I was 23 and looked twice my age. I looked like an
AIDS patient in the final stages. I found myself begging a friend
for his heroin--pleading, groveling, humiliated. Suddenly I had a
moment of clarity. I saw that I was near death.<br>
<br>
This moment can't be artificially induced. Being around others
who are recovering helps, but the desire to quit must come up
from within. And once it's there, the sight of a needle isn't
going to remove it. That's why the Pavlovian argument against
needle exchange fails. The sight of a needle is no more likely to
make a recovering addict shoot up than the sight of a spoon.<br>
<br>
And needle exchange can be a bridge to treatment. When I went
with Jon Parker's brigade to the streets of Bushwick, where I
used to cop dope, within minutes addicts surrounded him, as if
drawn magnetically. They didn't just take the needles and run.
They listened so they could learn how to stay safe. And they
asked about getting clean.<br>
<br>
When you give addicts needles, you're giving them the right
message--that someone cares enough to want them to stay free of
AIDS even if they continue to use drugs. Dead addicts don't
recover. </p>

realities of life. It is unrealistic to demand zero tolerance,
especially when we know that addiction is a disease and
genetically passed on from one generation to the next. However,
the Drug Enforcement Agency has become a bloated, powerful
bureaucracy that does not intend to give up its power without a
fierce fight. This also applies to some other agencies who wield
their power and will not let go. This in the face of interfering
with harm reduction policies and treatment of addiction in any
other way than total abstinence. Recovery and success do not have
to mean total abstinence and, in fact, to wait for total
abstinence to deem an addict <b><i>successful </i></b>dooms most
to total failure. Addiction is a medical problem and belongs with
the medical profession--not the criminal justice system. <br>
<br>
I found a newsgroup on the Internet devoted to harm reduction,
and several disturbing items were emailed to me. The first was an
article concerning a needle exchange project in New Jersey. Two
volunteers doing needle exchange work were arrested by the
Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office. This is absolutely
intolerable in this day of AIDS. In a perfect world, no one would
be addicted, and no one would be using IV drugs, but this is not
a perfect world. To arrest people devoted to harm reduction is
imposing death sentences on addicts who are PEOPLE who happen to
have a disease. For anyone interested in contacting the DA who
ordered the arrest, his name is Robert Gluck, P.O. Box 71, New
Brunswick, NJ 08903.<br>
<br>
Another item from the San Francisco Chronicle, April 19 (UPI)
concerned &quot;Illegal Mexican black tar heroin contaminated
with an aggressive flesh-eating bacteria [which] killed two
addicts and sickened another 15.&quot; One of the ways health
officials got the word out to addicts was through the needle
exchange program. Of course, this happened in San Francisco and
the needle exchange activists who were arrested were in New
Jersey, but how many addicts contracted AIDS through needle
sharing while these activists were in jail? One is too many!<br>
<br>
Probably none of us knew John Szyler, but we all probably know
someone like him. He was an addict, the founder of the Chicago
Recovery Alliance, and his definition of recovery was &quot;any
positive change.&quot; John died Saturday, May 4th with three
bags of heroin at his side--one was used. It is unknown whether
he overdosed, had &quot;an allergic reaction, poison or
whatever--John had little control over the chemical composition
of the drug [or] its contaminates.&quot; Because addicts cannot
go to their doctors and because doctors usually want nothing to
do with addiction because they will have the Drug Enforcement
Agency breathing down their necks, addicts do not know what they
are getting when they buy a drug. Sad--this person was described
as &quot;a man who loved life and lived it to the fullest. He was
an example to all around him by his kindness and advocacy for
people with HIV and for drug users. He will be severely missed by
all who knew him.&quot; I did not know John, and you probably
don't either, but he most likely did not have to die. Had he been
able to go to a physician for his addiction, he would probably be
alive today to continue to be an example for his kindness. <b><i>Hey,
everybody out there with all this power over life and death, we
are people--we are addicts, yes, but we are people, and we do not
deserve a death sentence.<br>
<br>
</i></b>We, in methadone treatment, are in a different phase of
recovery. Most of us are not using street drugs anymore, but we
are still treated like criminals. We are looked down upon. We are
treated not as people with a medical problem, but we are treated
like a person with a moral deficiency. We do not deserve that
kind of treatment; we need to be treated as any other person who
has a medical problem, and it is about time for a wake-up call
for our politicians. We no longer (if we ever did) have a
&quot;war on drugs.&quot; What we have is a &quot;war on
addicts&quot; in this country. We have totally impossible laws
regarding drug possession--on one hand, we have the Supreme Court
saying that addiction is not a crime, but just possessing the
materials needed to relieve the addiction is a crime. <b><i>What's
goin' on here?</i></b> It is time we found out which politicians
are for us, which are against us and force them to take a stand
one way or the other. Addicts are people, not criminals. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="The Seven Day Issue:  Sneak Attack!!!"><b>The
Seven Day Issue: Sneak Attack!!!</b></a><b><br>
by Ira Sobel (New York City)</b> </p>

<p align="center">The issue at hand is in black and white. The
DEA wants all people on methadone to report to the clinic 7 days
a week. The charge: <b>DIVERSION OF METHADONE</b>. That's every
day, brothers and sisters. It won't matter if you are working and
haven't had a dirty urine in years. The DEA doesn't discriminate.
It will be across the board and that, unfortunately, means all of
us. I have to admit that if these proposals go through, we on
methadone will suffer.<br>
<br>
The basis for these proposals are directly linked to <b><i>loitering
and diversion</i></b>. That's the bottom line. The DEA does not
care to talk about &quot;good&quot; patients or &quot;good
programs!!!&quot; No, all they see is diversion. In their eyes,
every person on methadone diverts their take-home medication.
Anyone who has read one of my articles on the concept of <b><i>methaphobia
</i></b>will understand when I say that the DEA is one of the
biggest <b><i>methaphobic</i></b> organizations in the USA today.
That's fact!!!<br>
<br>
The DEA is getting their noses into the wrong arena. Every person
on methadone is in recovery. Statistics will reveal that the DEA
should stick to busting cocaine cartels and stay out of the
mental health and addictions field. In truth, the DEA has not
been successful in bringing international drug dealing operations
to their knees. The so-called &quot;<b><i>war on drugs&quot;</i></b>
is a failure. <br>
<br>
So the powers that be decided to go after people in methadone
programs throughout the United States. A real sneak attack. It
doesn't matter to them that methadone is a treatment modality.
So, they employed the same surveillance techniques and undercover
operations they regularly utilize in order to catch cocaine
barons. So, to the DEA, each person on methadone is a criminal.<br>
<br>
The DEA is fervent in their aim to have every person on methadone
report to their clinics 7 days a week. There are thousands of
people on methadone who have matured out of committing felony
crimes and drug-related activities. Methadone has been the key
factor in helping thousands upon thousands of recovering people
to change from their previous life of failure and defeat into the
new life of integrity and victory. The DEA sees diversion, and
all I see is that hidden population of methadone patients who
have stopped committing crimes, are gainfully employed, own
businesses, are going to school, getting job training, are
raising children, and haven't had a dirty urine in years. The
last contact with the &quot;<b><i>old life&quot;</i></b> is
coming to the clinic. Sometimes the program is located in the
same neighborhoods where they used to buy and use drugs. So, they
fight for phase changes. These people have simply beat drugs and
have been assimilated into the mainstream, the work force, the
straight world.<br>
<br>
Loitering is one of the most negative behaviors to affect
methadone treatment. The central problem is that <b><i>some </i></b>non-working
patients have too much time on their hands. If these patients had
a structured schedule, whether inside their methadone programs or
referred out to other agencies, programs, services, and schools,
then the authorities and people who live in the community would
begin to see less loitering and patients hanging out near the
clinics.<br>
<br>
People in programs have a lot of talent that just needs
encouragement and support. If there were programs like day care
from 9 to 5, patients could be transformed into productive
members of society. Methadone programs should adopt a plan to
give patients realistic goals to strive for. It would enable us
on methadone to excel at something constructive. This is very
important because anyone on methadone knows first hand the slurs,
chides, and put downs made by family, law enforcement groups, and
people in general who know nothing of the reality of methadone
maintenance. With a new component, patients everywhere would get
a boost in the self-esteem department!<br>
<br>
Since I walk by many programs here in New York City, it's simple
to tell whether the program has a loitering problem or not. In
its place could be a combination of program security, outreach
workers, counselors, and other staff members. I would love to see
a counselor motioning with his arms to the patients outside to
come on in because we have so many new activities! &quot;Welcome,
welcome!&quot; I would love to see that. The sooner the welcome,
the better!<br>
<br>
I believe that together we can change people's attitudes about
methadone treatment by reducing loitering and diversion and
finding new interests for the patients by: 1) Running
programs/classes inside the clinic, 2) Having GED classes so that
patients can get their high school diploma, 3) Indoctrinating
more methadone awareness meetings at every clinic, 4) Setting up
a patient committee to address the loitering issue and other
aspects of the program, and 5) Dosing patients at a dose high
enough to eliminate the need for diversion (as evidenced by
scientific instead of criminal justice guidelines). This would
entail a holistic approach for the good of the program, the
patients themselves, and the community at large.<br>
<br>
I think that a patient committee could be set up with eight
patients, two staff members, and the doctor of the clinic. This
group can help patients with problems, institute more services at
the clinic, and run methadone awareness meetings. I also feel
that having GED classes would help those who had problems in
schools or are self conscious about their shortcomings with
reading and comprehension.<br>
<br>
To require attendance at the clinic 7 days a week will hurt <b><i>all</i></b>
patients in the program, <b><i>but it will be the &quot;good
patients&quot; who have successfully demonstrated their progress
in the program who will suffer the most</i></b>. They are
invariably on a one or two-day-a-week pickup schedule and have
been for years because of their courageous fight to beat drugs
and advance themselves in the workplace.<br>
<br>
Patients who work full time will be forced to report to the
clinic daily, before work. This proposal is really unfair because
the DEA doesn't want to know that many patients are working today
due to being on methadone which has allowed them to stop drug
use. Methadone treatment works. When a patient hasn't had a dirty
urine for a specified amount of time, that patient gets a
supervised urine, and then the phase change goes through. This
translates into coming to the clinic less frequently. These are
the patients (and there are many) who work towards progressing in
the program. And by working, we patients are beating the odds
that are against us. That is why everyone on methadone, who is
employed or who is otherwise using their time constructively, is
a winner.<br>
<br>
Most clinics close before 5:00 p.m., so if we cannot come on a
certain day due to our jobs, we will suffer the consequences--NO
MEDICATION! So, the person is stuck. <b><i>Which is more
important: The job or the methadone? For most, there will be no
job without the methadone.</i></b> This is a crucial point. Many
people have made the wrong choice and are now back on drugs. The
DEA doesn't want to know what a relapse is or if the person has
bounced back and is making strides in methadone treatment.<br>
<br>
There are some providers and owners of methadone programs who are
more interested in policing their programs and making money off
patients than finding new ways to improve treatment and make
services available for you and me (State and Federal agency
regulations have to share in the blame--timewise, she sheer
enormity of the tons of paperwork that has to be dealt with
excludes this. Paperwork is more important than the patient's
life). Loitering will cease when methadone programs start
adopting goals for us to strive for, and this will only be
accomplished when medical treatment is turned back to medicine.
Despite the odds against us, the majority of patients, like
myself, do not loiter and/or divert. We are in recovery, and
there are hundreds of people who go to 12-step and other
self-help groups. <br>
<br>
<b>WE ON METHADONE MUST BE UNITED IN ORDER TO FIGHT AGAINST OUR
COMMON NEMESIS<br>
<br>
</b>In this case, that means the DEA. Diversion is ruining
everything for everybody. We patients who report to the clinic
one or two days a week are the ones who will get burned the most,
and anyone working toward that goal will lose all initiative to
do well. The DEA is pushing for this change in policy which will
affect the entire methadone system in the United States of
America. We must be aware of these proposals, and we as patients
must be united in order to change policy. Methadone advocates are
increasing. The National Alliance of Methadone Advocates (NAMA)
is expanding day by day. New chapters are forming. In essence,
these are exciting times for everyone on methadone. We have a
sole purpose: <b>PATIENTS' RIGHTS. </b>That is for you in
Marysville, California; you in Milwaukee; you in Gary, Indiana;
and you in Detroit, Michigan. <br>
<br>
<b>We are all brothers and sisters living on the same spirit! We
will make our stand together. I declare, &quot;All patients on
methadone throughout the USA must unite to fight against the
oppressors, the persecutors, the enemies, the methaphobics, the
DEA.&quot; - Peace.</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b><i>Why Am I Still on Methadone?</i></b>
After all these years on methadone, I occasionally take a
personal inventory to check to see my progress on the program
which directly affects my life. After 2 years (on this second
go-around), my reasons for remaining in methadone treatment have
basically not changed. The bottom line is that methadone works
for me. I'm no longer out of control and heavily addicted to
opiates and prescription narcotics. I no longer hurt myself in a
self-destructive death mission. What a relief. All that negative
behavior is off my shoulders. When I enrolled on a methadone
program, all that street hustling, petty arguments over petty
things, stress, frustration and insanity left me phase by phase
as I got better.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Why Aren't You on Methadone?</i></b> A major point is that
I no longer have to get high every few hours in order to stay one
shot away from being dope sick. Methadone is long lasting. Its
effects last up to 36 hours. That should be the number one reason
why so many heroin addicts should surrender and get on methadone.
By taking methadone <b><i>as prescribed</i></b>, there shouldn't
be any problems with being maintained or being sick. It's the use
of other drugs with methadone, like crack and alcohol, that makes
those on the program feel depressed, confused and unbalanced. The
unhealthy effects of all- night drinking, hangovers and crack
binges keep these people down and going nowhere. People should
know the facts that powdered drugs have killed before, and there
is no telling when and who will die next from an overdose. So, by
enrolling in a methadone program and putting down the needles and
powdered drugs, the chances for a brighter future is very
promising.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Methaphobia: Losing its Grip</i></b>. I live one day at a
time, and I do not worry myself about not being drug free or
whether if/when I'm going to detox off methadone or not. I feel
comfortable with my decision, and I don't care what others think.
I remain on this medication because it has helped me so much. I
believe that as long as I remain on methadone, things are going
to get better and better. Those methaphobics get upset because
with all of their chiding and all of their putdowns, you know
what? They are getting boring! &quot;Why can't you get off
it?&quot; &quot;You are weak.&quot; &quot;You are a loser.&quot;
I've heard that shit so many times in my life that it has become
boring!!! <b><i>Boring!!! <br>
</i></b><br>
I mean, why should I risk everything I've built up for myself on
someone else's whims and expectations. Most of the methaphobics
that take this position don't even know who I am or my fellow
patients. They really do not care about me and you. They just
like to play God, doctor and pharmacist. These methaphobics mean
nothing to me.<br>
<br>
We cannot change the nature of a methaphobic or stop their
unresponsive, close-minded, stigma-spewing tirades. I've coined
an appropriate phrase--<b><i>METHAPHOBIA</i></b>--a state of mind
in which someone, or a group, displays an intense fear, bias and
prejudice against people on methadone and methadone programs.
There are those methaphobics that would feel justified in
dismantling the whole methadone system. That's methaphobia at its
most extreme. As I said: Methaphobics are <b><i>BORING!!!</i></b>
<br>
<br>
<b><i>Methadone in the Age of AIDS</i></b>. I realize now that I
must present the bigger picture of the importance of methadone
maintenance in the age of AIDS. With all of the inappropriate
actions and all of the self-destructive behavior by active users,
methadone treatment becomes an important link in minimizing
health hazards to users. Most of all, enrolling in a methadone
program <b><i>reduces</i></b> the risk of acquiring all of these
numerous health hazards which is a keynote in harm reduction.<br>
<br>
I believe that harm reduction must take on a holistic approach in
order to <b><i>decrease</i></b> self-destructive behavior, <b><i>reduce
</i></b>the transmission of diseases and viruses, and <b><i>carry</i></b>
the message to every IV user that there is a better way to live.
That users should stop abusing themselves, get in a methadone
program to take care of their powerlessness over opiates and the
needle, and stabilize their minds and bodies in order to get
healthy because this self-abuse takes its toll on one's self
respect. Methadone enables the person time to build a firm
foundation for their lives. In this way, IV users <b><i>can</i></b>
discover harm reduction practices, and this enables them to
aspire to greater heights in taking proper care of themselves.
This translates into cleaning needles properly and getting tested
for HIV and Hepatitis C.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Health Hazards and Shooting Galleries: An Intimate Glance</i></b>.
So you say: What health hazards are you talking about? Such
hazards as: contracting hepatitis and AIDS, venereal diseases,
the possibility of death resulting from an overdose, poor health,
arrest and incarceration. Pertaining to harm reduction in the age
of AIDS, contracting viruses and diseases are at the top of the
list.<br>
<br>
Shooting galleries are the breeding ground for AIDS, Hepatitis C,
endocarditis, venereal diseases, tuberculosis, infections and
open wounds that are getting worse. Health hazards are all around
anyone who enters the premises. There are real people dying in
these dark, cold and colorless rooms. That is why we have to get
the message out there to those most in need that <b><i>getting
out of the gallery and getting on a methadone program</i></b>,
which has been successful in detoxing addicts off heroin and
maintaining addicts for 30 years, will dramatically change
people's lives and, most of all, <b><i>reduce</i></b> these
obsessive self-abuse tendencies.<br>
<br>
People living in these galleries are the ones most affected by
health hazards. There is an <b><i>urgency</i></b> for the
development of harm-reduction practices as soon as possible.
Cleaning needles properly is more important than anything to the
IV user and again, cleaning needles properly with bleach <b><i>reduces</i></b>
the exchange of viruses and diseases.<br>
<br>
Shooting galleries are filthy, and the squalor attacks your
senses as soon as you enter the room. The smell of urine is
everywhere. There is blood and feces all over, both human and
animal, broken needles and syringes, torn newspapers on the
ground, glass from broken bottles, bloody toilet tissue, bloody
water in cups, bloody rags and paper towels. The sight of rats
scurrying across the floors and walls is a natural occurrence.
People have sex in shooting galleries, babies are born, and
people overdose and die every day in shooting galleries
throughout New York City and across the USA. <b><i>We must help
these people get out of the galleries!!!<br>
</i></b><br>
<b><i>Fighting for Life</i></b>. There are many people who forgot
why they got on methadone. They forget how bad life really was in
those last months of active addiction. They get frustrated and
start &quot;stinking thinking.&quot; &quot;Why am I on
methadone?&quot; &quot;Why did I get on it?&quot; &quot;Why do I
need it?&quot; &quot;It doesn't help.&quot; &quot;It was a
mistake?&quot; For those patients who have been in the program
longer than the birth of the AIDS virus should realize now that
being on methadone keeps viruses and diseases away and, as long
as we take methadone correctly, we can live a joy-filled life.<br>
<br>
We will also overcome the methaphobics. We will stop going to
shooting galleries. The hustling ceases, the scams and schemes
leave you, you stop using powdered drugs and needles, you put
down the bottle, you get a job or begin job training, you go back
to school, do volunteer work, and if you maintain your faith in
yourself and belief in a higher power, you are on your way. It's
the fight of your life but by getting in a methadone program and
by using harm- reduction practices, you can change your life and
live respectably and healthy. <b>PEACE<br>

Dose at Clinic 7 Days a Week?</b></a><b><br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b><i>Could be!</i></b> Every Wednesday
morning, a few of us meet for the advocacy group and try to get
others involved. Some of you say you do not have time, you have
more important things to do, and others say you are just not
interested. We wonder what it will take to get you interested.
Will you be interested when the regulations are stiffer, or will
it be when we have to come into the clinic seven days a week to
dose? There is serious talk of this at the state level. Will it
be when funding is cut for methadone maintenance treatment? There
is always that threat hanging over our heads. Or, will you have
time when there are no clinics at all?<br>
<br>
According to the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug
Abuse Counselors, &quot;The Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA) is now operating under its 5th
temporary spending bill (known as a Continuting Resolution or CR)
until March 15th.&quot; The House passed an appropriations bill
for SAMHSA, but nothing has been done with it by the Senate to
date. &quot;Under the House appropriations bill drug and alcohol
treatment and prevention. . . demonstration programs are cut from
$506 million. . .to $142 million. If there is no change to the
CR, the $360 million shortfall will force the termination of many
demonstration programs. Now, this may or may not affect us
directly, but any cuts in addiction treatment are a threat to us.<br>
<br>
What we need to do is write to our Senators and Representatives
telling them that treatment and prevention in the area of
addiction are proven cost cutters. For every $1 spent on drug and
alcohol treatment, $7 is saved in costs to society, and &quot;<b><i>$12
to $14</i></b> is saved for every $1 spent on <b><i>methadone
treatment</i></b>&quot; (emphasis mine). We need to write to our
representatives in Washington <b><i>and</i></b> Lansing. Talk
about your success stories and how methadone has saved you from
prison or death. Talk about your success in any area, and compare
that to your life on the street. You can type a letter, handwrite
it, e-mail it, or snail-mail it, but just <b><i>do it</i></b>--then
come to an advocacy meeting. If we don't stand up for ourselves,
no one else is going to.<br>
<br>
If you do not mind coming into the clinic every day or if you do
not mind harsher rules and regulations, you can continue what you
are doing. However, if we want to improve the way we are treated
and have a say in that treatment, every single one of us needs to
become involved. You do not have to spend a lot of time on
advocacy, but you do need to let everyone know that you care
about what happens to you. </p>

Clinics in Trouble--Patients and Society Will Lose!</a><br>
<b>by Jon Wilson</b> </p>

<p align="center">Methadone treatment in Michigan is in serious
trouble. The most effective treatment for narcotics addiction is
in danger of being eliminated in this state. Thousands of
successfully recovering addicts will be forced back into the
streets. Some may detox successfully and do well in drug free
treatment programs, but most will not. According to studies by
Dole, Nyswander, McClellen, Payte, Joseph and others, those who
attempt to detox abruptly, or at all, are likely to return to
opiate use. Methadone's effectiveness has been proven, yet we are
in danger of losing it as a treatment alternative in Michigan.<br>
<br>
If methadone is so effective, why would Michigan eliminate it?
This question cannot be easily answered. However, some reasons
for phasing out the treatment are more apparent than others.
Substance abuse is a very unpopular issue. Medicaid and private
health insurance providers do not want to pay for substance abuse
treatment at all. Since methadone is the most controversial form
of substance abuse treatment, it is an easy target. Due to
society's stigmatization of substance abusers, people in
treatment for addictions are perceived as having little
credibility and virtually no power to fight back. Medicaid and
private insurers have already taken steps to greatly reduce or
eliminate benefits to substance abusers. Additionally, methadone
is a political hot potato. Some legislators and other elected
officials are reluctant to air their views on methadone publicly.
This is not surprising since insurance companies employ highly
paid lobbyists to promote their best interests. And the drug free
component of the substance abuse treatment industry also has an
interest in the demise of methadone.<br>
<br>
Politicians have declared a &quot;<b><i>war on drugs</i></b>.&quot;
Their answer is to build more prisons. By the same token, they
are aware that many addicts have never committed any crime aside
from possessing their drugs of choice. Another group of addicts,
those who are addicted to legally prescribed medication have
little chance of contact with the criminal justice system. Many
addicts and their families are registered voters. Families are
pleading and crying for treatment for their sons and daughters,
husbands, wives, mothers, and fathers. They are not likely to
vote for someone who wants to incarcerate their loved ones.<br>
<br>
Much to the dismay of the insurance companies, some form of
substance abuse treatment must receive political support. The
drug-free treatment industry has tailored itself to the whims of
Medicaid and other third-party billers. Insurance companies have
a powerful ally in their efforts to squash methadone. Who better
to discredit methadone than the drug free lobby? The drug-free
treatment industry is largely responsible for perpetuating the
myth that methadone is legal dope. Politicians are in bed with
insurance companies and the drug free industry while ranting
about the lack of prison beds. It is ironic that the government's
own literature on the treatment of opiate addiction is pro
methadone.<br>
<br>
One of the most powerful weapons in this battle of politics,
money, and power is the negative appearance of methadone
treatment. The erroneous point of view that methadone is nothing
more than a legal way to control addicts is at the heart of
society's negative impression of the drug. Most successful
methadone patients are aware that methadone, like other legally
prescribed drugs, is sometimes diverted to the street and sold on
the black market. Diversion is one of the government's excuses to
impose stricter controls on methadone. Many methadone clinics are
located in the inner city where police protection is scarce. It
is not difficult for those seeking black market methadone to
loiter near clinics. Methadone opponents attempt to use this fact
to validate methadone mythology. It is necessary to separate fact
from fiction so that the real issues can be resolved. The
majority of methadone patients want nothing to do with those few
who abuse or divert methadone. Recovery is a precious commodity;
no serious patient would jeopardize it.<br>
<br>
The methadone industry in Michigan has been harassed repeatedly
over the past year. Clinics have been raided, government
officials have disrupted the lives of patients by coming to their
homes to question them, and the media has blatantly lied about
methadone treatment. The latest tactic in Michigan's scheme to
dismantle methadone treatment comes from the Michigan Department
of Social Services. Without notifying the clinic involved, DSS
mailed letters to patients of Michigan's largest clinic stating
that the clinic would no longer be eligible to bill Medicaid. The
letter stated that Medicaid patients should begin to transfer to
other programs immediately and that their transfers should be
complete by March 21, 1996. The letters were mailed while the
clinic's administrators were in Washington D.C. to meet with
legislators to discuss the future of methadone in Michigan. The
state has used similar scare tactics in the past without success.
If Michigan succeeds in its efforts to close its largest clinics,
others will follow.<br>
<br>
Contrary to popular belief, recovering addicts are not powerless.
While it is true that addicts have little credibility, it is
surprising how much their credibility improves once they have
written to their legislators. Methadone patients who are not now
registered to vote have been urged to do so by methadone patient
advocacy groups. There are approximately 2,000 methadone patients
in Michigan who have proclaimed their membership in Detroit
Organizational Needs in Treatment (DONT) and The National
Alliance of Methadone Advocates (NAMA). There are also a number
of individuals in Detroit who have joined Methadone as A
Legitimate Treatment Alternative (MALTA), another NAMA affiliate.
In addition to their ongoing voter registration drive, Michigan's
methadone patients are now organizing a letter-writing campaign.
Patients are writing to their legislators to promote the positive
therapeutic aspects of methadone treatment and to voice
disapproval over government harassment of methadone programs.<br>
<br>
Patients can potentially play the most important role in this
battle. Unfortunately, most clinics and their administrative
staffs have not thought to ask their patients to voice their
opinions on the matter. This stems from the archaic,
paternalistic attitude that exists among methadone treatment
providers. But this does not mean that clinics are not concerned.
They simply haven't informed their patients of the problems in
Michigan. Their concern has manifested itself as an attempt to
form a methadone treatment providers association, tentatively
called Michigan Alliance of Methadone Providers (MAMP). The
formation of MAMP is their effort to form a political voice and
to provide a united front against the unrealistic, irrational
demands of managed care organizations. The methadone treatment
providers in this state have tried unsuccessfully to form an
alliance in the past. The attempt failed because few could agree
on anything. Now, as managed care organizations approach clinics
individually to negotiate treatment costs, there is the potential
for a &quot;free for all&quot; whereby Michigan's clinics will
stab each other's backs while competing for funding and patients.
It's the old &quot;divide and conquer&quot; strategy. Michigan's
methadone treatment providers are aware of this and are worried
about their fate. Ask anyone who attended the first two meetings
of MAMP this year. All but two of the states' clinics were
represented. Reports from the meetings indicate that those who
are long-time competitors were concerned enough about Michigan's
problems to sit down to explore possible solutions. One final
note: It is interesting that Michigan's methadone patients are
more politically organized than the state's methadone providers;
they also get along with one another much better. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="Confidentiality in Treatment"><b>Confidentiality
in Treatment</b></a><b><br>
by Penny</b> </p>

<p align="center">When one signs up as a patient in a methadone
clinic, they are told that all of their information is
confidential. Yet the true question is, &quot;What do they mean
by confidential?&quot; According to Random House Dictionary,
confidential is &quot;a secret or private matter, not to be
divulged or communicated to others.&quot; We assume that our
counselor is the one that is privy to our most personal
information and concerns. The doctor is next, knowing what is
important for our medical concerns; the nurse knows our names and
doses. The person at the front desk knows our financial concerns
and what appointments we have to keep, but how much farther than
that does it go?<br>
<br>
I have been on methadone approximately fifteen years. In those 15
years, I have been in clinics in six states. I have experienced
public clinics, private clinics, and clinics somewhere in
between. Yet, at all of them, they told me that any information
about me was confidential. They told me that also meant they
could not even give information to my husband without my
permission.<br>
<br>
Most clinics have weekly meetings where they discuss clients.
That has meaning for us because other counselors and clinic
employees learn sometimes very intimate information about us.
When we go to counseling and &quot;open up,&quot; we do not think
it should go past our counselor, yet it does. A special conflict
comes up when a married couple is in a clinic. Clinics should not
assume that all information one spouse confides is open to the
other spouse; this even includes medical information. Yet, they
often abuse this confidentiality and sometimes of great detriment
to the couple.<br>
<br>
A clinic in Tennessee that my husband and I entered several years
ago abused our confidentiality to the utmost. During the physical
(blood work) part of our intake, they discovered certain facts
about each of us. They sat my husband and I down in the doctor's
office with our counselors present, and the doctor proceeded to
tell us what they found. The doctor told me I was pregnant and
that my husband had syphilis. This had special meaning for us
because we had spent most of the prior few months apart. As can
be guessed, this caused major problems in our marriage. It turned
out, after seeking our own medical tests, that if the clinic's
lab had done their job appropriately, they would have discovered
that my husband always tests false positive. As for me being
pregnant, it was my place to tell my husband--not theirs. This
major breach of confidentiality almost destroyed my marriage. <br>
<br>
This was not the only incident where methadone clinic employees
caused rifts in our marriage. Recently, results of a breath
analysis on my husband was readily divulged to me. This time, a
formal complaint was filed. After approximately six months, my
husband still has not gotten a reply to his complaint.<br>
<br>
Counselors of married couples also pass information back and
forth about what is discussed in counseling. This information is
sometimes passed on to the other spouse; other times, this
information may be used against the other spouse in some form of
punishment by the clinic. As a general rule, I try to be somewhat
careful as to what I say about my spouse. It might come back to
haunt me.<br>
<br>
Clinic employees need to be very careful about what they say to
other employees and/or patients. After all, they have supposedly
promised &quot;complete confidentiality&quot; to the patient, and
professional ethics demand no less. </p>

Treatment</b></a><b><br>

<p align="center">Methadone is a necessary part of our overall
success in conquering the addiction that holds us firm in its
grasp. Even so, we thoroughly repulsed and disgusted some people
by the way we choose to treat our addiction. Life is a
competition and we, as patients of a methadone clinic, are
competitors. We now have the tools, skills, and support that we
need to overcome one of life's greatest evils, and we must accept
the responsibilities of treatment.<br>
<br>
We pay for each breath we take by a crushed and digested past;
life is a tough business. We have built each of our lives upon a
mountain of painful memories; each of our bodies is a living
monument that positive change can accomplish anything. We live in
a civilization where there are many appointments--some to serve
the greater good, some the greater evil. We, as substance
abusers, have seen both sides of life's appointments and have
survived! We, as addicts, have heard the sound of time beginning
to run out on us. It made us realize that life is important and
that it does matter what happens to us. We are destined to be
free; because once we enter the drug-free world, we are
responsible for everything that we do. Then we are answerable to
ourselves and to the world we cherish most highly--our own! We
can reach no higher than our arms--so do we aim for less than the
most? We have beaten an enemy that is not only our enemy but an
enemy to all people of the world--an enemy of humanity. We walked
brazenly through a kingdom that had not been worth it. We had
walked the mountains and the valleys of life--a shadowed life in
a shadowed world. <br>
<br>
But, now we walk in a free and unrestricted world. We just keep
looking to the horizon and realize that anything can happen
beyond it. All things inevitably lead to the same horizon. The
chief difference between us and the straight world is that we
better recognize the challenges that destiny gives to each
person. Do not let somebody else make a decision for you or stand
in judgement of you. If there is a battle to get through, battle
for what you believe. If someone is to be judged, we must not be
that judge as we are all brothers and sisters and must make our
own decisions.<br>
<br>
Maybe we are throwbacks to another time, of another kind, to
another ideal, but this much we should realize and etch upon our
very souls: we are alive today because of our decision to help
ourselves, and we need not be ashamed of that decision. <b>Forever
Peace!</b> </p>

<p align="center"><a name="Narcotics Anonymous NA"><b>Narcotics
Anonymous NA</b></a><b><br>
by Nancy R.</b> </p>

<p align="center">I am writing this article in response to Ira
Sobel's article, &quot;Methaphobia,&quot; in Methadone Today
(December 1995, Vol. I, No. III). I would like to comment on his
statement that they do not allow methadone patients to share at
NA meetings. Maybe the NA groups in New York (where Ira is from)
have that policy, but it is not that way at the meetings in
Detroit and the surrounding suburbs! I also read a similar
statement in Larry S.' article, &quot;12-Step Support for
Methadone Patients,&quot; in <b><i>Methadone Today</i></b>
(August 1995, Vol. I, No. I).<br>
Since the summer of 1994, I have been regularly attending NA
meetings, usually four to five meetings a week. I go to some
regular meetings but also try out new ones. I have attended
meetings in Detroit, Oakland County, Macomb County, and St. Clair
County. At all these various meetings, they have never told me I
cannot share at a table because of being a methadone patient
(and, yes, I am honest about it). <b><i>I think it is important I
let methadone patients know this, so they won't be discouraged
from trying NA meetings</i></b>. You see, there are only a few
scattered Methadone Anonymous (MA) meetings (which Larry
mentions), but there are a few hundred AA and NA meetings in the
area!<br>
<br>
If you are interested in trying an NA meeting, GO! If you happen
to attend a meeting where they will not let you share, try a
different meeting! Better yet, remind them of NA's Third
Tradition: &quot;The only requirement for membership is the
desire to stop using!&quot; Also, the Tenth Tradition states,
&quot;NA has no opinion on outside issues. . . &quot; (and
methadone is an outside issue!)<br>
<br>
In fact, I would like to quote from NA's &quot;Basic Text&quot;
(the blue book) part of the writing for Tradition Nine (4th ed.,
p. 50): &quot;Desire is our <b><i>only</i></b> requirement . .
.any addict, regardless of drugs used. . .is free to practice the
NA way of life. . . .All addicted persons are welcome <b><i>and
equal</i></b> in obtaining the relief they are seeking from their
addiction; every addict can recover in this program on an <b><i>equal</i></b>
basis. . . .Membership in NA is not automatic. . .when a newcomer
walks in the door. . .any addict who has a desire to stop using
can become a member of NA.&quot; Self explanatory, yes?<br>
<br>
An even better quotation begins on page 145, under Tradition
Three in NA's book,<b><i> It Works: How &amp; Why:</i></b>
&quot;Any addict who walks into a meeting, <b><i>even a using
addict </i></b>(emphasis mine), displays a level of willingness
that cannot be discounted. . . .<i>still-using</i> addicts are
welcomed into our meetings with special encouragement to keep
coming back . . . .these addicts are members <i>in every respec</i>t
(emphasis mine) as long as they have the desire to stop using,
and they are entitled to the same consideration and support as
any other member.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, at most NA meetings, you will probably have no hassle or
problems about being on methadone. Possibly, someone may suggest
you think about getting off methadone, but you can always tell
that person that methadone is keeping you CLEAN and you will
detox when you and your doctor feel you are ready! We need to
educate some people about methadone, as there is still much
misunderstanding about it.<br>
<br>
To live drug free (with or without methadone), we need to change
our old ways of thinking and our old, using friends. In NA, you
meet new friends--clean, recovering addicts who are learning to
live and enjoy life WITHOUT using drugs. I have even met a number
of people in NA who have successfully detoxed off methadone and
are still drug free.<br>
<br>
I think NA is a wonderful program! It is a spiritual (not
religious) program. I have come to enjoy meetings where we
&quot;share&quot; about our lives, our problems, our successes,
and how we stay clean. Besides meetings, we have NA dances,
picnics, skating parties, barbeques, etc.<br>
<br>
If you can find a Methadone Anonymous or Methadone Awareness
meeting, try that too. I hope more methadone clinics start MA
meetings. Meanwhile, TRY AN NA MEETING! It changed my life! </p>

Perspectives</b></a><b><br>

<p align="center">Many in the field of chemical dependency became
aware of the problem as it emerged from the 1960's youth culture.
Because of our training, we now know that the history of
narcotics addiction is long and complex. We are fascinated that
Poe and Freud were addicts and that Edison stayed awake for days
under the influence of cocaine wine while perfecting the
phonograph. We have heard stories of soldiers from the Civil War
to Vietnam returning from the battlefield with opioid
dependencies. We know that drug use flourished in the nineteenth
century with legal morphine, opium, and cocaine. The history of
addiction is well documented, but what about the history of
addiction treatment?<br>
<br>
Those who work with methadone patients have read of the Dole and
Nyswander studies of the 1960's. We know of the U.S. Public
Health Service Narcotic Hospital which opened in Lexington,
Kentucky in 1935. While Lexington represented the first federally
approved attempt at treatment, it did not represent the first
sincere efforts to help addicts. <br>
<br>
At the turn of the century, the treatment of narcotic addiction
was limited to quackery. Treatment was based on the personal
theories of the few physicians willing to address the problem.
Most drugs were legal, and many of the &quot;cures&quot; were
simply opium-based patent medicines. When the Harrison Act of
1914 passed, many addicts turned to the black market for drugs,
others continued to maintain on physician-prescribed heroin,
morphine, or cocaine. A 1919 Supreme Court decision placed
restrictions on physicians, which limited their ability to
prescribe drugs of abuse. This marked the beginning of the clinic
era.<br>
<br>
From 1919 to 1923, thirty-five clinics in 12 states dispensed
morphine to patients. Some of the clinics dispensed heroin and
cocaine. The most well-known clinic of this era was operated by
Dr. Willis Butler. Dr. Butler attempted to detoxify his patients
gradually. He understood that detox was not a realistic goal for
many patients and simply maintained them. This was a tremendous
display of insight more than forty years before Dole and
Nyswander's first experimental clinic. In addition to his
outpatient dispensing clinic, Dr. Butler also operated an
inpatient facility for his patients who were in the final stages
of the detoxification process. Upon completing the program, each
patient received a certificate signed by seven doctors. This may
have been the first employment of the team approach in addiction
medicine.<br>
<br>
In 1923, the government ordered the clinics closed. The study of
addictions' treatment retreated into the dark ages until the
1960's when Dole and Nyswander compiled data similar to that of
Dr. Butler. The first successful therapeutic use of methadone
revolutionized the treatment of narcotics addiction. Methadone
was found to be more effective than morphine maintenance due to
its longer duration. Unfortunately, the chemical treatment of
narcotic addiction continues to be unfairly stigmatized. </p>

Awareness: Get Up Stand Up!!!</b></a><b><br>
by Ira Sobel (New York City)</b> </p>

<p align="center">For the better part of two decades, I've been
on and off methadone maintenance programs. I've had to deal with
family, friends, co-workers, and those in recovery with their
prejudice and bias against methadone. I've been treated like a
junkie with no will power. I'm sick and tired of having to
explain myself to them. I am proud of my choice of treatment. I
am an opiate addict. My drugs of choice are synthetic narcotics.
I am not on methadone because my drug of choice is crack. I'm on
a methadone program to recover from my powerlessness over
opiates. My active years, before getting back on the program,
were just that: active and out of control.<br>
<br>
People like us on methadone have been stigmatized enough. It's
about time that we get up, stand up, and be proud of our
recovery. We have been unduly classified by some as being a
non-entity in terms of a valid treatment modality. Where have
these people been for the past thirty years? That's how long
methadone has been used to both maintain and detox addicts from
heroin. It was created by Drs. Dole and Nyswander, and Dr. Kreek
and Herman Joseph, to treat opiate addicts using a long-acting
narcotic that when taken as prescribed enables a person to be
capable of doing things like having a job, going to school,
getting job training, and traveling again because when we are
doing dope, we aren't able to do anything. Our drug habit rules
our world. You are on a fence and going nowhere but down. But
with methadone, people can build a foundation for their lives
that is so much better than they had while they were doing heroin
and other narcotics.<br>
<br>
First, people should be taught that you don't feel euphoria or
get &quot;high&quot; when you are on a maintained dose of
methadone. When it's used properly, the person does not achieve a
state of being high. Whereas heroin gives the user a feeling of
ecstasy, methadone keeps a person maintained without the feeling
of doing heroin.<br>
<br>
We have been slurred by people in recovery, those in the field of
addiction, and by people in general. They feel that the entire
methadone concept is just substituting one drug (methadone) for
another (heroin). I've heard that slur one time too many in my
life. Those people should be educated about the mind, addiction,
and what role methadone plays in the treatment of opiate
addiction.<br>
<br>
We on methadone <b><i>must</i></b> continue to fight our
oppressors together. We have to fight for our choices. We have
also been maligned by unbelievers, black-balled by 12-step
programs, and called names. Let's not hide in the closet. We are
not anonymous. We accept the fact that we are on methadone to
save our lives, and we should know all about the medication we
are taking.<br>
<br>
At Methadone Awareness (MA) meetings, we learn to dispel myths
and rumors laid at our feet by the misinformed. I believe that
the only way to share this common knowledge is by indoctrinating
&quot;methadone awareness&quot; meetings. In this setting, people
on methadone can share about their recovery, personal problems,
successes, important health issues, and facts about methadone.
The patients should know the answers to so many questions we
share.<br>
<br>
Methadone awareness is more than just a meeting. It is a learning
experience. People who attend MA meetings learn fact from fiction
and how well methadone has afforded us. Patients who continually
show up at meetings have found something that works for them.
Although Alcoholics Anonymous is 60 years old, the roots of MA
meetings are just beginning. I've gone to many 12-step programs
in my day, but going to methadone awareness meetings makes me
feel real comfortable because it seems so natural. Methadone
awareness meetings feel so freeing in the divine order of things.<br>
<br>
One of the most important things I've said in all of my articles
and stories is in &quot;The Orange Colored Cure.&quot; I wrote
(and still feel this way) that &quot;being on methadone is not
the end of your life but the beginning of your recovery from
active opiate addiction.&quot; MA meetings expand one's thinking
about methadone. We discover together that methadone is a safe
medication and we find out that there are a lot of similarities
between us. We each share many of the same fears. By attending
methadone awareness meetings, we help each other to stem the tide
of adversity and beat the odds that are against us.<br>
<br>
When I attend MA meetings, I speak from my heart and learn to be
honest with myself and people in the meetings. Another aspect is
to share my feelings and facts about methadone. At one meeting I
attended, someone said that methadone was &quot;poison.&quot;
That was that person's feeling about methadone. I shared that
there are so many good points about being in treatment that it
overrides any negativity that is being voiced.<br>
<br>
We must be &quot;aware&quot; of these issues, and this awareness
will unite us in our recovery. In MA meetings, we become positive
and learn to have self-esteem and to have pride in ourselves. We
are not anonymous, nor are we hiding in the wings and going
nowhere. The basis for MA meetings is our common fight to beat
drugs and obtain the best treatment so that together we learn how
to have gratitude and humility for our recovery!!! <b>PEACE.<br>

Managed Care &amp; Budget Cutbacks<br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p>As promised at the voter registration drive in Pontiac, I have
been looking for information regarding the effect of the new
Republican Congress' policies concerning Medicaid and managed
care and what that means for methadone patients. From what I have
been able to discover, it doesn't look good. The Republican
&quot;Contract [ON] America&quot; wants to &quot;cut federal
entitlements, and instead give block grants to the states.&quot;1<br>
<br>
Republicans say they want block grants instead of entitlements
for flexibility because they believe they &quot;would have more
discretion over the way the money is spent.&quot;2 This is not
terribly encouraging in Michigan with the governor we have, as we
all know Engler is not exactly concerned about the poor,
minorities, women, or addicts. The only reason any of these
groups have gotten any relief is because of federal
entitlements--with one of his first strokes of the pen, he did
away with many needed programs. <br>
<br>
One of the first federal cuts for addicts is from &quot;The House
Ways and Means Committee [since it] is removing substance abuse
as a disability under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
program. Just last year, Congress enacted a new law which limits
SSI payments for addicts and alcoholics to three years. Under
what the House is proposing for welfare reform, those on SSI
might be cut off altogether. Worse still, the committee has
decided that these people...would not only lose their SSI, but
would become ineligible for Medicaid&quot;3 If addicts are cut
from Medicaid, it will be suicide, especially for those who
depend upon it to pay for their methadone maintenance. <br>
<br>
We are so concerned with saving money and cutting the federal
budget that it is absolutely illogical (and downright stupid) to
cut addicts off from the one thing that keeps many of them out of
prison. It costs about $2,600 per year to maintain an addict on
methadone, and it costs ten times that much to &quot;treat&quot;
addiction by throwing the addict in prison. When addicts cannot
afford methadone treatment, there is always the threat of a
return to the streets where an addict can easily be 100 times the
drain on society when s/he has to return to larceny and burglary
to maintain their habit.<br>
<br>
The question is, &quot;How can the addict afford the price on the
street if s/he can't afford the methadone clinic?&quot; When the
addict is maintained on methadone, s/he is usually making
improvements in their life--getting an education, working to
support self and family, and improving relationships. The addict
has neither the time or inclination to engage in negative
behaviors such as larceny, burglary, or any number of other
things the addict has to do just to &quot;maintain&quot; on the
street. The addict maintained on methadone is not exposing
him/herself to AIDS on a regular basis as they were when
exchanging needles. The price of one case of AIDS in money alone
is a thousand times the cost of yearly methadone maintenance, not
to mention the human misery. In plain language, when the physical
and/or psychological addiction is taken care of, the addict is
just like any other person who wants to improve his life
conditions. As we all know, when the addict is on the street,
nothing matters except the next fix.<br>
<br>
What is <b><i>really</i></b> idiotic is the price of methadone
maintenance in the first place. It doesn't have to cost $2,600
per year; the reason it does is because of the governmental
regulations on it. According to Substance Abuse Report
Newsletter: <br>
<br>
Methadone regulations are too restrictive and should be relaxed
in favor of clinically useful guidelines, according to a report
by the Institute of Medicine [IOM]. While stopping short of
recommending abolishing the regulations altogether, the report,
released December 21, calls for making methadone easier to use
for treatment facilities and patients alike.4<br>
<br>
When regulations call for arbitrary rules and regulations from
somewhere in the great beyond that has nothing to do with real
life and real people, costs rise. The doctor, counselor, and
addict are in the best position to know how to treat the
addiction--not some senator in Washington or Lansing and not some
program director who doesn't know us and probably never will.<br>
<br>
As far as Medicaid managed care, budget cutbacks will definitely
be pushing for more of it. &quot;Managed behavioral health care
organizations contract with HMOs or states to provide Medicaid
services. They then turn to their provider panels for
cost-effective care.&quot;5 The definition of managed care is:<br>
<br>
a system used by groups (including insurance carriers and
corporations) to manage costs while maintaining quality of health
and medical services. Specific approaches used by the payer of
services include: pre-certification, utilization review, case
management and medical necessity review.6<br>
<br>
The idea behind managed care is to save money by having a primary
provider decide what type of health care you will be allowed
under the system. The primary provider decides if you need
methadone treatment, so the bottom line is, before you sign up
for anything, find out how your primary provider feels about
methadone maintenance or any other treatment you now receive on a
regular basis. </p>

Ritalin Story<br>
by Jon</b> </p>

<p align="center">On November 16 and 17, WXYZ, Channel 7 in
Detroit, aired a two-part series on Ritalin, a drug commonly
prescribed to children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD), Ritalin has long been known as one of the most
effective treatments for the disease. It has been under recent
scrutiny due to efforts to ease restrictions on the drug in
Michigan and elsewhere. Proponents of the drug's therapeutic use
believe that its current Schedule II status makes Ritalin
unnecessarily difficult for ADHD patients to obtain. Some believe
that relaxed regulation of Ritalin will encourage abuse.<br>
<br>
Ritalin has been abused for more than twenty years by adolescents
and adults. Ritalin's rise in popularity in Michigan may be due
in part to the state's strict laws which prohibit most
amphetamines. Ritalin is a stimulant but not technically an
amphetamine. When prescribed properly, Ritalin is not used as an
amphetamine substitute. There is no evidence to suggest that
Ritalin is abused any more than other drugs with abuse potential.
Yet, Channel 7's report implies that Ritalin abuse is rampant.
Reporter Shellee Smith proclaimed that &quot;Michigan is quickly
becoming one of the Ritalin Capitols of the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smith's sensationalistic rantings can do nothing to prevent
Ritalin abuse. The heavily biased report focused largely on the
negative ramifications of Ritalin abuse but said little of the
therapeutic aspects of the drug and the thousands of children and
adults who benefit from its use. Ritalin patients are stigmatized
due to the atmosphere of ignorance that surrounds mental illness
and drug therapies. Deceiving the public with overblown,
misleading information about any public health issue is
dangerous. Smith's report may potentially spread panic among the
families of Ritalin patients who have suffered the hardships of
coping with their loved one's ADHD. Shellee Smith seems to be
using sensationalistic tactics to sell her report under the guise
of protecting the public from the &quot;evils&quot; of Ritalin.
Who will protect the public from Shellee Smith's recklessness?<br>
<br>
As with any psychoactive substance, Ritalin has abuse potential.
Smith drew the focus away from more significant aspects of the
issue in order to exaggerate this point while employing scare
tactics that would appeal to any parent's worst fears. Ritalin
abuse among adolescents and adults does exist in Michigan and
elsewhere. All drug problems are serious, especially when
children and adolescents are affected. But Smith falls far short
of proving a Ritalin epidemic in Michigan. Her report provided
little hard data and instead relied on a number of adolescents
from an area treatment center who appeared to be singled out
because of their Ritalin dependencies. The appearance of an
epidemic can be easily created if one uses a sample group of
hand-picked subjects possessing only those characteristics that
support one side of the issue. This brand of yellow journalism is
nothing new to Shellee Smith. Earlier this year, she did a
similar report on methadone. The story was shamelessly slanted by
employing amateurish editing techniques and other instruments of
deception such as the use of half truths and distortion of facts.
She referred to methadone patients as addicts who &quot;line up
to get their fix&quot; at the methadone clinic. Channel 7
videotaped patients inside clinics and, in some cases, allowed
their faces to be shown. Smith ignored any positive, therapeutic
qualities of methadone treatment while implying that addicts were
supporting their habits with hard-earned tax dollars.<br>
<br>
The report seemed to imply that all methadone patients were inner
city welfare cheats getting high for free. Meanwhile, thousands
of methadone patients within Channel 7's viewing area were left
to explain to their families that they were not patrons of legal
dope houses. Targeting methadone patients is a cheap way to
revive plummeting ratings which, ironically, are the result of
the station's abandonment of its star anchorman who was at the
time receiving treatment for his own addiction. Smith obviously
did little or no research on Ritalin or methadone. Her source for
these hatchet jobs is the worst kept secret in Detroit T.V. news.
It appears that she has been relying on her federal significant
other for information instead of doing hard investigative
reporting. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="Methaphobia"><b>Methaphobia</b></a><b><br>
by Ira Sobel</b> </p>

<p align="center">We are living in a day and age when 12-step
programs are known everywhere as a successful institution for so
many people. Alcoholics Anonymous began with two individuals and
it has become the most effective tool used by people in recovery
afflicted with the disease of addiction. People are joining
12-step programs every day by the number. Lost souls are coming
into the rooms on our hands and knees defeated by our sickness.<br>
<br>
For 60 years the goal of Alcoholics Anonymous has been &quot;to
stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.&quot;
That quote is taken from the preamble that is read before most
meetings. Each 12-step program is based on that one statement. It
means that you are in these rooms to get sober for yourself and
to help others all you can to achieve sobriety. <b><i>No addict
should be turned away who asks for help</i></b>. This is an
integral part of AA and every other fellowship.<br>
<br>
In a sense, the preamble welcomes newcomers to the program, a
program where addicts think more about helping others than
satisfying their own wants and needs. It is a selfless program, a
place where an addict can feel safe. It gives the newcomer a
sense of belonging, that he or she has somewhere to go for help.
People go to meetings just to be in the company of other addicts
so that they can get better.<br>
<br>
There is an underlying tension that exists between people that
belong to the Narcotics Anonymous fellowship and people in
recovery on methadone. People that attend NA meetings regularly
consider themselves in recovery and people on methadone programs
are not. Essentially this schism exists because those that attend
NA meetings refuse to accept people on methadone because they
feel we are not drug-free, that it would be the drug speaking.
Their policy is that no one can share if they took a
mood-altering drug in the last 24 hours. So the practice has been
to not let someone on methadone share or qualify. NA is wrong. <b><i>Methadone
maintenance is not mood altering if you take methadone as
prescribed</i></b>. I think they have an extreme case of
methaphobia!!!<br>
<br>
Methaphobia is a state of mind in which someone or a group
displays an intense fear and a bias against methadone patients
and methadone programs. It is very much like people in NA have
built-in forgetters. Those who espouse on NA principles put down
methadone as an institution. Basically, these people like to play
God, doctor, lawyer and pharmacist!!!<br>
<br>
We are all addicts and as long as I have a desire to stop using
drugs, I should be able to share my experience, strength and hope
with a room full of addicts in all phases of recovery!!! That's
because I'm in my phase of recovery. A person on methadone can be
going to a specific NA group for six months without being able to
share while another person, who comes intermittently and has one
day back, is allowed to share!!! If the time of the meeting is 4
p.m. and the person was using &quot;some time yesterday&quot;
then we have to count hours. I mean shit, is there some kind of
time table they use in NA!!! It's so petty that I have to
laugh!!! I mean shit, does the NA meeting list have this time
table written on it?? Ridiculous.<br>
<br>
I have my own story about how NA didn't accept me as part of the
group and how I learned about methaphobia the hard way. When I
was discharged from my last detox in early 1986, I began going to
meetings. At the time, any meeting whether it was a beginners
meeting, or a traditions meeting, or CA or DA was important to my
recovery. Meetings, meetings and more meetings. At the very
beginning, I chased recovery like I chased an opiate. I would go
to 2-3 meetings a day all over the city. I went to Cocaine
Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous, and then I went to Narcotics
Anonymous meetings.<br>
<br>
One of the first things I learned at the beginning was to be
rigorously honest. So, I went to my first NA meeting that was
held at Water View Hospital. It was a &quot;big book&quot;
meeting. Since I felt it was my duty to come clean about my
detoxing off methadone, I told people I &quot;was down to 15
mgs.&quot; This was a mistake. I was unaware of the methadone
clause of NA. The concept of methaphobia was all new to me. To my
naive mind, I was doing the right thing. You know, it's about
being honest today, but because of NA, I found out that day that,
unfortunately, it's not about being stupid!!!<br>
<br>
Right there, that instant in time, before the meeting even
started, I was blackballed. I didn't even have a chance at
sharing. One girl said that I had a &quot;ticket in my back
pocket.&quot; I didn't find the compassion and understanding from
NA. It's too rigid. I do not go to NA meetings. If I can't share
and voice how I am doing in one fellowship, then I've gone to
other fellowships for the support I very much need.<br>
<br>
To this day, I still have a major resentment against NA. Now, I
don't propose a full boycott of NA meetings. What I do suggest is
that if people in recovery need a place to go, they should attend
other 12-step groups. I also hope that people like us on
methadone should attend MA meetings at your program and at other
programs. At MA meetings, we share so honestly about the heavy
odds against you and me. People at MA meetings display an intense
desire to get well. It's so exciting when people cheer for
someone that shares about their good fortune. There is an
intimacy that exists in MA meetings that I've never experienced
with other 12-step support groups. These meetings are so new and
refreshing. An MA meeting is not filled with aging people that
nod out. No, it's about people who want to get better. In
essence, I've let go of my resentment and I've learned not to
fight NA but to go to MA. That's where I want to be. <b>PEACE.<br>

<p align="center"><a name="Counseling and Compulsiveness"><b>Counseling
and Compulsiveness</b></a><b><br>
by Michelle</b> </p>

<p align="center">My counselor gave me an assignment last week to
make a pro and con list of an issue I was struggling over. In
doing so, I began to grasp the beneifts of list making as a
problem-solving tool. So, I made another list for why I should go
back to school now and a list for why I should wait; a list of
reasons to tell my family about methadone and a list of the
resons not to; a list of the things I still miss about drugs and
a list of the things I don't. In short, I reduced the major
dilemmas of my life into several numbered phrases that fit on
small pieces of scrap paper. When I brought the finished product
to my counselor's office, he noticed a pattern in the nature of
my &quot;self help.&quot; I had compulsively listed the pros and
cons about being compulsive about my compulsions. Everything that
I had addressed was based on overdoing something and the problems
that taking everything to the extreme had caused me, yet I had
done even this in excess, producing twenty-some lists.<br>
<br>
I remember something I heard long ago spoken by a true substance
abuser: &quot;If you can't be intense about something, why be
anything at all?&quot; I took this statement to heart because it
was exactly how I felt. I had to be the most, the worst, the
wildest, or whatever superlative fit the situation. My
competitiveness stemmed from a fear of anonymity but essentially
was part of my character makeup. I was, and still am, an
extremest, and it seems inevitible that my ultimate drug of
choice would be the superlative of them all--heroin.<br>
<br>
With a personality like mine and a hankering for intensity, I
visited the usual spots (some against my will) and landed here at
the clinic where superlative sorts line up every day. Not all the
other patients desire things in the way that I do (borderline
nutso), but we all have had at least a small taste of what it
means to be driven. Let's face it, being an addict takes
initiative and know-how. The point that my counselor made after
reading my lists and noticing my compulsiveness was that this
energy needs to be used in productivity. Was this something that
I had never heard? No, but for the first time I considered
letting myself be the best instead of the worst. The worst, the
baddest, the meanest, the wildest--that was always a sure thing.
the best is something that I'm definitely going to have to work
hard at. </p>

Policies</b></a><b><br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p align="center">Most of us who have been in treatment for any
length of time have had trouble with &quot;dirty urines&quot;--we
have either had the problem of the test picking up a substance
that should not be there or of having &quot;no methadone&quot;
detected. There are three things which can cause these instances:
<br>
<br>
1. An over-the-counter drug caused a false positive.<br>
2. The lab made a mistake.<br>
3. We have &quot;used&quot; something we should not have, or we
have not taken the methadone.<br>
<br>
There are many over-the-counter drugs which cause false
positives. Steps are being taken to see that no one is falsely
accused of something they did not do. The new lab we will be
using will be saving urine samples for a period of time. If there
are any questions, they can be re-tested. Also, I am supplying
counselors with a list of the drugs I am familiar with that can
cause false positives. <br>
<br>
These results are not engraved in gold as there is always the
possibility of human error. Again, if you feel there is a
mistake, the sample can be re-tested. Talk with your counselor
regarding procedure.<br>
<br>
Although false positives and human error are a real concern for
us, there are those who play with the program and use other drugs
to supplement their methadone. You know who you are. It does not
make you a bad person, but it does cause problems for the program
and, most importantly, for yourself. If you are using other
substances, talk with your counselor--be honest. <br>
<br>
Your counselor should have a pretty good idea if you are telling
the truth or not. If your drug of choice shows up in your urine
screen every other time you drop and re-testing shows the same
result, your protests will certainly be suspect. If, however, you
are doing what you are supposed to be doing, you should be taken
at your word. That is why it is important to let your counselor
know what is going on with you. If you have been following your
treatment plan but all of a sudden show behavior changes, and
then come up with a dirty urine, you might have some explaining
to do. An honest relationship with your counselor is essential
and beneficial to you in more ways than one. </p>

<p align="center">Before entering the methadone program, I had no
life. i could not function without a blow I believed that nothing
could help me. I always said I would never use methadone. But I
went to the clinic out of desperation. the medication helped me
to stop using heroin. I was surprised that I actually enjoyed my
counseling sessions.<br>
<br>
For two years, I did everything that I was supposed to do. I
began to like myself. My appearance improved, I gained weight,
and I felt good. My clinic's doctor and my counselor recognized
my progress and granted me take-home privileges. I was beginning
to live again.<br>
<br>
Just when I thought that things couldn't be better, a terrible
thing happened. The man whom I loved for fourteen years died. It
hadn't occurred to me that I might have to cope with being alone.
I was half crazy out of my mind and felt I had nowhere to turn. .
.I relapsed.<br>
<br>
I don't think that I believed I would find the answers I was
looking for by returning to heroin. I was running from my
problems as I had in the past. The help I needed was right under
my nose. I told my counselor the truth about my relapse and
started attending group therapy at the clinic. I had the
solutions I needed within me. The support I received from my
counselor and the group helped me to find them.<br>
<br>
I was back on the right track and doing well. I had nearly ninety
days clean again. Then I saw the clinic doctor for a routine
medical exam. The doctor asked why I suddenly had several opiate
urine reports after having a clean record. I explained the
circumstances, but she revoked my take-home privileges anyway. to
make matters worse, she said that my privileges would be restored
ninety days from that day instead of ninety days after my most
recent positive urine report.<br>
<br>
The story doesn't end here. I was feeling depressed about what
had happened to me. I didn't think there was anything left to go
wrong. Then I got the news: Another urine report was positive for
opiates! When I relapsed, I was honest with my counselor and
admitted to using heroin. But this time, I was clean! I realize
that this might arouse suspicion in some people, but I have no
reason to be dishonest. Something must have gone wrong at the
lab--maybe the samples were switched. My counselor said that
nothing could be done. I would have to wait ninety days <b><i>again</i></b>
before I would get my take-home privileges. I believe that my
clinic and the lab that they hire should work harder to eliminate
error. It's difficult enough to fight a drug problem without
being penalized for the mistakes of others. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="Principles"><b>Principles</b></a><b>
vs. Personalities<br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p align="center">Many of us are familiar with the term
&quot;Principles before Personalities&quot; from Twelve-Step
meetings we have attended in our attempts to be free from drugs
and/or alcohol. The 12th Tradition states, &quot;Anonymity is the
spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to
place principles before personalities.&quot; The definition of
principle is &quot;an essential truth upon which other truths are
based&quot;, or &quot;a rule by which a person chooses to govern
his conduct, often forming part of a code.&quot; The definition
of personality is, &quot;the totality of characteristics which
make up a person.&quot;<br>
<br>
Addicts are not the only ones guilty of breaking this tradition.
One of the most egregious expressions of putting personalities
before principles is the double-standard by which Harry
Anslinger, the first commissioner of the Bureau of Narcotics,
treated street addicts as opposed to those with good connections.
Senator McCarthy was of &quot;sufficient prominence&quot; to have
had the protection of the commissioner while he obtained his
narcotics from a Washington pharmacy without interference from
Bureau agents. However, Anslinger was opposed to any treatment
which supplied narcotics to addicts on the street, and he
rigorously enforced laws against them. He depicted those who
smoked marijuana as monsters, and his campaign against it was
liberally strewn with ads about them as wild-eyed drug fiends who
butchered whole families. If Anslinger's principles <b><i>truly</i></b>
opposed drugs instead of the people he slandered, McCarthy's
narcotic use would have been included in his opposition. This
preferential treatment is clearly a violation of &quot;Principles
before Personalities.&quot; <br>
<br>
We can all learn from this by asking ourselves in any situation,
&quot;Are my values consistent? Do I treat everyone in a
consistent manner, or do I give preferential treatment?&quot; If
you recognize yourself breaking the rules, ask yourself
&quot;Why?&quot; Do you break the rules for people you like and
apply stricter rules to those you don't? Sometimes we don't
listen to what a person has to say because we don't care for
him/her personally, and often that is the very thing we need to
hear. I would often sit in a meeting listening intently to what
each person said, then at the point that a certain
&quot;personality&quot; spoke, I would tune her/him out because I
didn't like that person. That's a red light, bell-ringing
situation for me.<br>
<br>
Finally, &quot;Principles before Personalities&quot; means that
we watch out for that intruder, the <b><i>ego</i></b>. We all
want recognition; we all need recognition, and there's nothing
wrong with that. However, when working toward our common goal of
recovery, it's not about you, and it's not about me; it's about
us. Recovery is a journey; we all have something to offer on that
journey, and none of us can do it by ourselves, contrary to what
the <b><i>ego</i></b> tells us. </p>

Meetings Held<br>
by Jon</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>DETROIT - </b>The first methadone patient
advocacy meetings took place in Detroit and Roseville last month.
Interest in patient advocacy has spread rapidly throughout the
state. Though it is largely centered in the Detroit metropolitan
area, inquiries have come from as far away as Grand Rapids and
Muskegan. Patients from Flint and Toledo, Ohio have also
expressed an interest in the movement.<br>
<br>
Back issues of <b><i>Methadone Awareness</i></b>, the newsletter
of the Philadelphia and Atlantic City chapter of the National
Alliance of Methadone Advocates (NAMA) have been circulating
around Detroit for several months. A group of Detroit patients
were already in the process of forming an advocacy group when
they became aware of NAMA through <b><i>Methadone Awareness</i></b>.
Meanwhile, a counselor at a Detroit clinic read about NAMA in <b><i>Addiction
Treatment Forum</i></b>. Soon, another newsletter, the <b><i>M.A.L.T.A.
Messenger</i></b> began circulating around clinics in Detroit.
Methadone as A Legitimate Treatment Alternative (MALTA) is a NAMA
affiliate in California.<br>
<br>
Detroit patients were infuriated this year by malicious attacks
on methadone by the local broadcast media. Two of Michigan's
largest clinics were targeted, but all of the state's methadone
programs have felt the impact of the heavily biased reports.
Patients were left to try to explain to their families and
employers that methadone is not legal dope. Some were pressured
by their spouses to detox.<br>
<br>
In Lansing, attempts are being made to limit public assistance
benefits to methadone patients. Patients have been harassed by
government officials attempting to persuade them to go into
28-day inpatient programs. These are only a few of the problems
with being a methadone patient in Michigan. These and other
issues have prompted the formation of the organization, Detroit
Organizational Needs in Treatment (DONT). The first meetings have
been successful. DONT is in the process of becoming a chapter of
NAMA. </p>

<p align="center"><b>DONT </b><a name="Ignore"><b>Ignore</b></a><b>
Patient Advocacy in Michigan<br>
by Jon</b> </p>

<p align="center">Detroit Organizational Needs in Treatment
(DONT) is the new methadone patient advocacy organization in
Michigan. there is a critical need for methadone patient advocacy
in Michigan. There is a critical need for methadone patient
advocacy in Michigan. Negative media coverage, harassment from
the government, and clinics with inhumane policies are some of
the problems we face. Together, we can form a strong voice so
that our pleas can he heard. DONT will create avenues of
communication between patients, givernment officials, and program
administrators. We must find a middle ground where we can come
together to strive for understanding of one another.<br>
<br>
We cannot continue to lay quietly in the background while
officials in Washington and Lansing make decisions about our
lives. We cannot endure policy changes without our consultation.
Many of us are registered voters. DONT members who are not
registered to vote <b><i>will</i></b><i> </i>register. Most of us
have the power to choose the clinics where we receive treatment.
As individuals, we had little impact when quitting programs to
express dissatisfaction. And, all too often, we left one program
only to find more dissatisfaction at another. As a group, we have
power and discourage members from remaining in programs with
unreasonable policies.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, some of us are beginning to lose the right to
choose. Patients with Medicaid are being ordered out of their
programs and are forced to enroll in whatever program the state
decides they should be in.<br>
<br>
It is not our intent to make irrational demands. We simply wish
to be treated with the respect and dignity afforded to patients
receiving other kinds of medical treatment. Methadone is an
effective treatment for our disease. Those of us who are
successful in methadone treatment are serious patients. We feel
that we get inadequate recognition or none at all. Thos few
patients among us who are not interested in treatment get a
disproportionately high level of attention. It is those very few
who make no attempt to seek recovery who tend to loiter near
clinics or divert their medication. Yet, these few patients are
given the spotlight when politicians need a cause to promote
their own self-serving agendas. These are also the patients whom
the media portrays as &quot;typical&quot; methadone patients.
Cancer patients have diverted medication. Yet there are no known
cases of cancer patients being refused treatment for diverting or
being portrayed as typical by the media or government.<br>
<br>
We intend to begin communication with clinics and government
officials by wiping the slate clean. We are concerned with the
present and the future. We invite the State of Michigan, CSAS,
and all methadone programs to work with us, to hear our concerns.
We know that we are not on a one-way street. What do you need
from us? We will work with you to eliminate the negative
appearance of methadone treatment. We will help to eliminate
diversion and abuse. In return, we simply ask that you hear our
pleas--we must have the respect and dignity we deserve. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Take Home Med Policies: What Is </b><a
name="Fair"><b>Fair</b></a><b>?<br>
by Nancy R.</b> </p>

<p align="center">I have been on methadone for over twenty years.
I continued using street drugs such as heroin and Dilaudid for
the first ten years of my methadone treatment (1975 to 1985). But
during the second decade, 1985 to present, I have used only
methadone. My urines have been negative for illicit drugs. I
began to use methadone as it was intended to be used and turned
my life around. I work full time and am taking college courses at
night to complete work on my bachelor's degree. I got married and
have reestablished family ties. I am involved with Narcotics
Anonymous and feel that I am growing spiritually. I credit
methadone with saving my life!<br>
<br>
So what is my complaint? My concern is with the State of
Michigan's regulations concerning take-home privileges. Under the
regulations, methadone patients who have been prescribed 100mg or
more per day must receive special permission from state and
federal authorities to have take-home privileges. One time per
week take-home medication is out of the question unless you have
a serious medical condition or travel hardship.<br>
<br>
I am most comfortable at 150mg. I have been trying to decrease my
dosage to below 100mg so that I can be eligible for once-a-week
take homes. I believe that the state should drop this arbitrary
dosage of 100mg for determining eligibility for the number of
doses a patient is allowed to take home. This decision should be
left to the clinic's physician. Dosage and take-home priviliges
should be determined on an individual basis. My clinic doctor and
counselor know my ;unique history. They know how much I have
improved my life. They also know that I lead a busy life with
work and school. Going to the clinic every day under these
circumstances seems like a punishment. Shouldn't I be able to
have take-home medication while maintaining at a dose that I am
comfortable with? Haven't I earned this privilege? <br>
<br>
I feel strongly about this. This particular regulation affects
many patients. Our advocacy group must work together to learn how
state regulations are changed in order to provide more
individualized treatment for methadone patients. </p>

by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p align="center">We are a society of drug takers. We have a pill
for everything from headache to backache, to go to sleep or stay
awake, contraceptives or fertility pills, and we want to feel
good right now. The problem is, the government has decided which
drugs are no good for us and which are okay. People can't help
but be confused--myself included. It was okay for me to take
narcotics for a long time while addicted under the care of a
doctor. There was no social stigma, they were affordable, and I
could function. When I first started buying drugs on the street,
I was taking the same drug that I got from the doctor, but it was
at that point that I became stigmatized as a weak, incompetent
person. What had changed? Not the drug certainly, and I still had
the same pain, so what had changed? My status, overnight, and the
fact that I had to buy my drug at such an inflated price that
everything I had saved and worked for became the drug dealer's
property.<br>
<br>
I was sent to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me as manic-depressive
(this was the diagnosis of the day--now it's called bi-polar),
and he prescribed Lithium and an anti-depressant. &quot;Don't
take their drugs--take mine!&quot; was the message I got. I took
his drugs, and I couldn't function. I had to hang on to the walls
to walk because I was so disoriented, and I couldn't write
because my hand jerked too badly. When I told the doctor I could
not take <b><i>his </i></b>medication, he said, &quot;Well, I'll
prescribe another drug to counteract the other drugs.&quot; That
makes a lot of sense! If I <b><i>did</i></b> take his drugs, I
would not be a social outcast, but I wouldn't be able to
function; if I <b><i>didn't</i></b> take mine, I wouldn't be able
to function. If I did take mine, I would be an outcast <b><i>and</i></b>
a criminal because possession is a crime. This is madness--the
addict, just by virtue of being an addict, is labelled as a bad
person. </p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch10 INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2><p>
In the past, amphetamines have been used to treat a number of medical conditions such as epilepsy, obesity, narcolepsy, depression and hyperkinetic children. Since amphetamines were prescribed and promoted quite readily after World War II, people assumed that these drugs were less harmful, if harmful at all. Recent studies, however, have shown amphetamines to be both potentially addictive and quite toxic. Another concern are the recent signs of increased availability and use, and the knowledge that amphetamines can be bought quite cheaply.<p>
The best known members of this group of stimulants in Australia, in decreasing order of potency, are dexamphetamine (eg dexedrine), methamphetamine (eg methedrine) and the amphetamines (eg benzedrine).<p>
Amphetamines are potent sympathomimetic amines of a simple structure with a multiplicity of biological effects that include hyperthermic, anorectic, cardiovascular and central nervous system stimulant actions. The stimulant action of amphetamines is similar to the naturally occurring hormone adrenalin and is thought to work by stimulating and exciting all areas of the nervous system, including the brain.<p>
Since a major action of amphetamines is to inhibit sleep and fatigue, a present concern is the self medication of amphetamines by truck drivers, students and businessmen, who use amphetamines to stave off normal fatigue and enable them to work for days with little sleep or food.<p>

<ul>
<LI>this is a paranoid psychosis with disorientation in some place or person<br>
<LI>amphetamine psychosis is often preceded by restlessness, irritability and increased perceptual sensitivity<br>
<LI>symptoms include delusions of persecution, ideas of reference, and often bizarre visual and auditory hallucinations<br>
<LI>amphetamine psychosis can often only be distinguished from paranoid schizophrenia by the short time it takes the symptoms to disappear, usually a few days or weeks after drug use is stopped.<br>
<PS:"bordpara-indent+"><br>
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch10 EFFECTS long">Long-term effects</h3><p>
<li>Malnutrition  since amphetamines suppress appetite, illnesses related to nutrition and vitamin deficiencies occur and there is increased susceptibility to disease
<li>Violence  intense and sudden acts of aggression can occur. Aggressive acts are often related to paranoia, feelings of persecution, and distortion of perception<br>
<li>Multiple drug use  depressant drugs such as alcohol and barbiturates may be used in combination to combat the side effects of amphetamine use, such as sleeplessness
<li>Blockage of blood vessels  impure amphetamines may contain particles which can block small blood vessels and lead to kidney damage, lung emboli or stroke<br>
<li>Depression  often a vicious cycle exists. A patient suffering from chronic depression takes amphetamine for relief, becomes dependent, tries to discontinue its use, suffers depression as a withdrawal symptom, and renews amphetamine use.

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch10 EFFECTS tolerance">Tolerance and dependence</h3><p>
Tolerance develops to many of the actions of amphetamines. These include euphoria, anorexia, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension and increased excretion of noradrenaline.<p>
Little tolerance seems to develop to the anti-sleep actions of these drugs<br>
<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch10 EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWAL FROM AMPHETAMINE USE">EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWAL FROM AMPHETAMINE USE</h2><p>
Psychostimulant withdrawal is generally described in three phases  crash, withdrawal and extinction. The characteristics of these phases are as follows:<p>
<ol>
<li>Crash  the initial period which classically follows a 'run' of use. The most common effects experienced include fatigue and exhaustion. Effects may last several hours to several days.<p>
<li>Withdrawal  this phase may last for a number of weeks or even months and is typically characterised by:<p>
<ul>
<LI>lethargy/fatigue<br>
<LI>long but disturbed sleep<br>
<LI>irritability<br>
<LI>strong hunger<br>
<LI>deep depression that may lead to attempted suicide<br>
<LI>fits of violent action<br>
<LI>anxiety attacks<br>
<LI>psychic disruption and loss of self-control which may result in aggression<br>
<LI>headaches<br>
<LI>trouble breathing<br>
<LI>sweating<br>
<LI>muscle cramps<br>
<LI>gastrointestinal cramps<br>
<LI>severe secondary reactions ie influenza, pneumonia.<p>
</ul>
<li>Extinction  normal mood and behaviour is interrupted by episodic craving often in response to conditioned cues. These cravings may last minutes or hours and may continue to occur months or years after cessation of amphetamine use. <p>
The most florid symptoms usually dissipate within a few days or weeks of cessation of use of amphetamines. Often, a significant improvement in mood, energy, and paranoid thinking occurs within days.<p>
</ol>
Other symptoms such as normal sleep patterns, memory loss, confusion and paranoid thinking and perceptual abnormalities may persist for perhaps six to twelve months.<p>
After that time, residual symptoms, if present, are generally slight and not disabling, and are noticed primarily by the user.<p>
Abstinence is probably the most important therapeutic device, however, some crises may yield to phenothiazine tranquillisers as first aid despite its risk of lowering seizure threshold. Currently there is a trend for using tricyclic antidepressants as part of the management of psychostimulant dependence.<p>

<h1>DARE Scare: Turning Children Into Informants? </h1>

<p> WP 1/29/94 9:00 PM </p>

<p> By James Bovard </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> DRUG ABUSE Resistance Education (DARE) is currently being
taught by police officers to more than 5 million children in more
than 250,000 classrooms each year. The brainchild of former Los
Angeles police chief Daryl Gates, the DARE program is directed
mostly at fifth and sixth graders, though its activities can span
kindergarten through 12th grade. Gates made headlines in 1989
with his suggestion that drug users be taken out and shot, and
his brand of philosophical moderation permeates the DARE approach
to drug abuse. </p>

<p> On its face, DARE seems unobjectionable. It seeks to maximize
youngsters' hostility to drugs by teaching them perils of drugs
and reinforcing the message with DARE frisbees, DARE wristwatches
and an official DARE song (&quot;Dare to keep a kid off dope/Dare
to give a kid some hope&quot;). Students are also able to win or
purchase DARE pencils, erasers, workbooks and certificates of
achievement. </p>

<p> But along with the anti-drug paraphernalia may come a more
ominous effect: children informing on their drug-using parents. </p>

<p> The program was created partly as a result of Gates's
frustrations with police sting operations in the schools. Until
the late 1980s, Los Angeles police officers routinely went
undercover as high school students in order to implore real
students to buy drugs from them. In 1987, the American Civil
Liberties Union complained, &quot;When other adults try to get
young people involved with drugs, we call it contributing to the
delinquency of a minor. When the LAPD does it, we call it the
school-buy program.&quot; </p>

<p> Finding young people who would buy drugs proved quite easy.
Unfortunately, it had little effect on drug use by students. As
Gates told the Los Angeles Times last September, &quot;We kept
buying more and more. It was appalling, depressing. I finally
said: `This is crazy. We've got to do something.' &quot; </p>

<p> The result was DARE. Winning the trust of youngsters is an
essential feature of DARE. Policemen sit and talk with children
during lunch hour and play games with them during recess. The
federal Bureau of Justice Assistance noted in a 1988 report that
DARE &quot;students have an opportunity to become acquainted with
the (police) officer as a trusted friend who is interested in
their happiness and welfare. Students occasionally tell the
officer about problems such as abuse, neglect, alcoholic parents,
or relatives who use drugs.&quot; </p>

<p> One of the first lessons found in DARE teaching materials
stresses the &quot;Three R's&quot;: &quot;Recognize, Resist and
Report.&quot; The official DARE Officer's Guide for Grades K-4
contains a worksheet that instructs children to &quot;Circle the
names of the people you could tell if . . . a friend finds some
pills&quot;; the &quot;Police&quot; are listed along with
&quot;Mother or Father,&quot; &quot;Teacher&quot;or
&quot;Friend.&quot; The next exercise instructs children to check
boxes for whom they should inform if they &quot;are asked to keep
a secret&quot; - the police are again listed as an option. </p>

<p> Roberta Silverman, a spokeswoman for national DARE
headquarters in Los Angeles, rejects the idea that DARE teaches
or encourages informing. &quot;When students begin the DARE
program they are specifically advised not talk about their
parents or friends. We are very clear that when DARE instructors
are in the classroom, they are there as teachers, not law
enforcement officers.&quot; </p>

<p> Silverman says that the DARE Officer's Guide for Grades K-4
is not part of the DARE core curriculum. &quot;It lays the
groundwork for what the officers do later. It's more like generic
safety instruction, teaching kids about personal safety. The part
about keeping a secret is to get kids talking about molestation.
It has nothing to do with drugs or with getting them to turn
their parents in.&quot; Silverman also says that &quot;any time a
child makes a disclosure (of parental drug use) to an officer,
the DARE officer would be required like any other teacher to
report that to the proper authorities or agencies.&quot; </p>

<p> Not surprisingly, children sometimes confide the names of
people they suspect are illegally using drugs. A mother and
father in Caroline County, Md., were jailed for 30 days after
their daughter informed a police DARE instructor that her parents
had marijuana plants in their home, according to a story in The
Washington Post in January 1993. The Wall Street Journal reported
in 1992 that &quot;In two recent cases in Boston, children who
had tipped police stepped out of their homes carrying DARE
diplomas as police arrived to arrest their parents.&quot; In
1991, 10-year-old Joaquin Herrera of Englewood, Colo., phoned
911, announced, &quot;I'm a DARE kid&quot; and summoned police to
his house to discover a couple of ounces of marijuana hidden in a
bookshelf, according to the Rocky Mountain News. The boy sat
outside his parents' home in a police patrol car while the police
searched the home and arrested the parents. The policeman
assigned to the boy's school commended the boy's action. </p>

<p> Police and DARE officials keep no statistics on how many drug
busts result from the program. And DARE officials say that
reports of kids informing on their parents cannot fairly be
attributed to DARE. </p>

<p> &quot;I think to focus on these few incidents is to do a
disservice to people who are at the forefront of prevention
efforts in this country,&quot; DARE's Silverman said. &quot;There
are 25 million kids who have been exposed to DARE and a handful
of cases of informing that may or may not be related to DARE at
all.&quot; </p>

<p> Nine-year-old Darrin Davis of Douglasville, Ga., called 911
after he found a small amount of speed hidden in his parent's
bedroom because, as he told the Dallas Morning News, &quot;At
school, they told us that if we ever see drugs, call 911 because
people who use drugs need help . . . . I thought the police would
come get the drugs and tell them that drugs are wrong. They never
said they would arrest them. . . . But in court, I heard them
tell the judge that I wanted my mom and dad arrested. That is a
lie. I did not tell them that.&quot; The arrest wrecked his
parents' lives, said the Dallas newspaper; both parents lost
their jobs, a bank threatened to foreclose on their homes and his
father was kept in jail for three months. </p>

<p> Silverman says that the details of the case prove how murky
such cases are. While Darrin Davis had been in a DARE program,
she says that he did not report his parents to the DARE officer
and that there was evidence that the parents were also involved
in drug trafficking, thus putting their child at risk. </p>

<p> &quot;It's making a mountain out of a molehill,&quot; she
says. </p>

<p> Whatever DARE's effect on families, its record at
discouraging drug use is the subject of some controversy. A study
financed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse on the effect of
DARE on Kentucky students between 1987 and 1992 reported &quot;no
statistically significant differences between experimental groups
and control groups in the percentage of new users of . . .
cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, alcohol and marijuana.&quot; </p>

<p> More recently, the National Institute of Justice hired
Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to survey and evaluate all the
published research on DARE, and RTI's preliminary conclusions
were largely negative. </p>

<p> The RTI's evaluation concluded that only eight published
studies of DARE's effectiveness were statistically valid. Susan
Ennett, one of the lead researchers on the RTI project, concluded
that these eight studies found that DARE's effects on drug use by
children ranged from &quot;limited to nonexistent.&quot; DARE
says that other experts have criticized the methodology of the
RTI study and notes that it has not yet completed the peer review
process. DARE claims that of 23 studies of DARE, 20 found the
program effective in shaping anti-drug attitudes and behavior. </p>

<p> At a March 1993 conference about drug education at the
University of California at San Diego, social science researchers
agreed that after 10 years of operation there is little evidence
that DARE actually reduces drug use among the young. William
Hanson, one of the early advisers to DARE and currently a
professor at Wake Forest University, said, &quot;I think the
program should be entirely scrapped and redeveloped anew.&quot; </p>

<p> Many Americans, numbed by politicians' harsh rhetoric
regarding drug use, may feel that policemen should be able to use
any means available to detect drug users. Many DARE instructors
have the best of intentions. But is that an excuse for government
programs that endanger the bonds between children and parents? </p>

<p> STUDIES FIND DRUG PROGRAM NOT EFFECTIVE </p>

<p> Yet high-level supporters argue &quot;it's better to have it
than not have it&quot; </p>

<p> by Dennis Cauchon </p>

<p> USA TODAY, 11 October 1993 </p>

<p> In just 10 years, D.A.R.E. has grown into the USA's No. 1
drug education program, reaching 5 million fifth-graders in 60%
of school districts. </p>

<p> The Drug Abuse Resistance Education logo -- &quot;D.A.R.E. To
Keep Kids Off Drugs&quot; -- is on bumper stickers, T-shirts,
even Kentucky Fried Chicken boxes. Police, taxpayers and business
give $700 million a year. It's also a favorite of dozens of
members of Congress. </p>

<p> But a raft of scientific studies says D.A.R.E., the 17-week
course taught by uniformed police, doesn't achieve its main
long-term goal: stopping kids from smoking pot, drinking booze or
using other drugs. </p>

<p> &quot;I've got nothing against D.A.R.E., but we need to get
some white light on this issue so we can wisely decide how to
spend our money and on what programs,&quot; says Tom Colthurst,
who recently organized a national conference on drug education at
the University of California-San Diego. But D.A.R.E. executive
director Glenn Levant calls the studies flawed and not
comprehensive: &quot;Scientists, will tell you bumble bees can't
fly, but we know they can.&quot; </p>

<p> Levant says a proper national study would cost $3 million-$5
million and take seven years to finish. </p>

<p> Studies have focused mostly on specific cities, and cost
several hundred thousand dollars each. </p>

<p> Experts agree recent research on D.A.R.E. is not perfect: It
is difficult and expensive to measure the behavior of large
numbers of children over several years. But they say the research
is better than studies on other drug programs. &quot;Almost every
researcher would agree there's enough information to judge
D.A.R.E.,&quot; says Rand Corp. researcher Phyllis Ellickson. </p>

<p> &quot;It's well-established that D.A.R.E. doesn't work,&quot;
says Gilbert Botvin of the Institute for Prevention at Cornell
University Medical Center. </p>

<p> Created in 1983 under the direction of former Los Angeles
Police chief Daryl Gates, D.A.R.E. exploded after the Bush
administration gave it heavy federal subsidies. </p>

<p> The program uses lectures, role playing and other techniques
to teach children to avoid drugs. And by all accounts, the kids
who take the course and the police who teach it think it's
terrific. D.A.R.E. &quot;does no harm and by far, nothing but
good,&quot; says Scott Mandel, a Los Angeles-area teacher.
&quot;D.A.R.E. really works,&quot; says Mike Miller, Round Rock,
Texas, police officer and D.A.R.E. teacher. &quot;Surveys from
across the nation show kids who take the D.A.R.E. course are much
less likely to use drugs later in life.&quot; </p>

<p> That's not what most studies show. </p>

<p> To investigate D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness, researchers looked
at two similar groups of children: One group takes D.A.R.E.; the
other does not. Then, researchers followed the children's
behavior for several years. Since 1987, studies -- most funded by
law enforcement agencies involved in the program -- have been
conducted at 20 North Carolina schools; 31 Kentucky schools; 11
South Carolina schools; 36 Illinois schools; and 11 Canadian
schools. The results were similar. </p>

<p> The 1991 Kentucky study, the National Institute on Drug Abuse
reported, found &quot;no statistically significant differences
between experimental groups and control groups in the percentage
of new users of ... cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, alcohol,
marijuana.&quot; </p>

<p> A 1990 study funded by the Canadian government found
&quot;D.A.R.E. had no significant effect on the students' use of
any of the substances measured.... They included: tobacco, beer,
pop, marijuana, acid, Valium, wine, aspirin, uppers, downers,
heroin, crack (cocaine), liquor, candy, glue and PCP.&quot; </p>

<p> To make sense of the various studies, the Justice Department
hired the Research Triangle Institute of Durham, N.C., to conduct
a statistical analysis of all D.A.R.E. research. </p>

<p> A preliminary report from the RTI -- analyzing eight studies
involving 9,500 children -- says D.A.R.E. has &quot;a limited to
essentially non-existent effect&quot; on drug use. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. did have a positive effect on children's knowledge
and attitudes about drugs, the report says. It also added the
social skills needed to say no to drugs. </p>

<p> But even on these measures, D.A.R.E. didn't do as well as
other drug programs, including local classes taught by teachers
and students. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America has launched a behind-the-scenes lobbying
campaign against the final RTI report, due in November. </p>

<p> &quot;We're working with D.A.R.E. to ... voice their
concerns,&quot; says Winnie Reed, the National Institute of
Justice official overseeing the study. </p>

<p> The pressure has angered some academic researchers.
&quot;It's repugnant, out of line and very unusual,&quot; says
Dennis Rosenbaum, director of the Center for Research in Law and
Justice at the University of Illinois-Chicago. </p>

<p> Rosenbaum -- a D.A.R.E. supporter -- says the group is its
own worst enemy because it has spent so much effort attacking the
evaluations, rather than learning from research. </p>

<p> Even some state and local D.A.R.E. programs are backing away
from D.A.R.E. America's fight. &quot;If we aren't getting the job
done, we ought to be man enough to try something else,&quot; says
Tim DeRosa of the Illinois state police and long-time D.A.R.E.
activist. </p>

<p> Some government officials are aware of D.A.R.E.'s
shortcomings. </p>

<p> &quot;Research shows that, no, D.A.R.E. hasn't been effective
in reducing drug use,&quot; says William Modzeleski, the top drug
official at the Department of Education. </p>

<p> The department has considered asking Congress to repeal a law
requiring states to give D.A.R.E. a total of $10 million or more
a year from federal Drug Free Schools money. </p>

<p> But D.A.R.E. continues to have high-level government support.
</p>

<p> On Sept. 9 -- National D.A.R.E. Day by congressional decree
-- D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officials and students lunched with dozens of Congress
members and met Attorney General Janet Reno. Later, they visited
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. </p>

<p> Drug czar Lee Brown, who started the program in Houston when
he was police chief, remains a booster. &quot;My experience has
been positive,&quot; Brown says. &quot;The research has pointed
in many different directions, but my conclusion is it's better to
have it than not have it. I know first-hand that young people are
impressed by it and look up to the D.A.R.E. officer as a role
model.&quot; </p>

<p> Yet many drug education experts fear that D.A.R.E.'s
political clout is siphoning drug education money from better
programs. </p>

<p> &quot;D.A.R.E. has a following and sales force that is
extremely powerful in fighting for scarce resources,&quot; says
University of Michigan researcher Lloyd Johnston, who conducts
the government's survey of teen drug use. &quot;But its growth is
totally out of scale to its effectiveness.&quot; </p>

<p> Johnston and others aren't sure why D.A.R.E. isn't working
better. </p>

<p> Some think it targets children too young; some think teachers
and older students get better results than uniformed police;
others say the program relies on psychological theories that
don't work. </p>

<p> Levant thinks critics are just jealous of D.A.R.E.'s success.
&quot;We're like apple pie,&quot; he says. &quot;But I guess you
can always find someone who doesn't like apple pie.&quot; </p>

<p> EXECUTIVE ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> COCAINE </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Purity </p>

<p> In 1992, domestic cocaine prices fluctuated as successful law
</p>

<p> enforcement operations led to a short-term (3-month) impact
on cocaine </p>

<p> trafficking from South America. During April through June
1992, </p>

<p> shortages of wholesale quantities of cocaine resulted in an
increase in </p>

<p> the kilogram price in many major U.S. metropolitan areas.
Throughout the </p>

<p> remainder of the year, however, cocaine was readily available
as </p>

<p> kilogram prices in virtually all major metropolitan areas
returned to </p>

<p> lower levels. Preliminary data for early 1993 indicate that
kilogram </p>

<p> prices remain at low levels. </p>

<p> Nationwide purity of cocaine at the kilogram, ounce, and gram
levels </p>

<p> averaged 83, 74, and 64 percent, respectively, during 1992
compared to </p>

<p> 86, 72, and 59 percent, respectively, during 1991. A
temporary decline </p>

<p> in purity at all levels of the traffic was noted during July
through </p>

<p> September 1992. However, by year's end, purity at all levels
had once </p>

<p> again increased. </p>

<p> Use </p>

<p> Regarding the use of cocaine, the National Household Survey
on Drug </p>

<p> Abuse for 1992 indicated that the number of past-year and
past-month </p>

<p> users of cocaine has decreased significantly since 1985.
Nevertheless, </p>

<p> frequent or more intense use of cocaine has not shown a
statistically </p>

<p> significant change during the past several years. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey on
Drug Abuse, </p>

<p> cocaine use continued to decline among high school seniors
and 10th </p>

<p> graders. Among 8th graders, however, survey data indicated
increased use </p>

<p> of cocaine. </p>

<p> Reporting from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) shows
that the </p>

<p> estimated number of nationwide cocaine-related emergency room
episodes, </p>

<p> which had been increasing at a fairly constant rate from the
early-to- </p>

<p> late 1980s, declined significantly from FY 1989 to FY 1990.
During the </p>

<p> latter half of FY 1991, however, the number of episodes
increased once </p>

<p> again and appears to have stabilized at high levels since
that time. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the smoking of
cocaine continues </p>

<p> to be the predominant route of administration used by
patients admitted </p>

<p> to DAWN emergency rooms for cocaine-related problems. The
percentage of </p>

<p> patients who indicated that smoking was their primary method
of </p>

<p> administration increased from 34.3 percent during FY 1989 to
41.4 </p>

<p> percent in FY 1992. </p>

<p> Rates of cocaine use detected through urinalysis testing of
recently </p>

<p> booked male and females arrestees, as reported by the Drug
Use </p>

<p> Forecasting Program (DUF), remained high in many major U.S.
cities in </p>

<p> 1992. In fact, rates of cocaine use during the past year were
</p>

<p> substantially higher than those for opiate and marijuana use.
</p>

<p> Trafficking </p>

<p> Since early 1992, DEA field divisions have increasingly cited
Central </p>

<p> American countries as transshipment points for U.S.-bound
cocaine </p>

<p> shipments. Reporting indicates cocaine is transported from
source </p>

<p> countries to Central American countries by land, air, and sea
</p>

<p> conveyances. From Central America, cocaine shipments are
transported to </p>

<p> the United States by land, sea, and air directly or </p>

<p> through Mexico. </p>

<p> Cocaine traffickers, perceiving enhanced law enforcement
activity along </p>

<p> the United States-Mexican border and in the western
Caribbean, have </p>

<p> subsequently diversified their smuggling routes into the
United States. </p>

<p> DEA field divisions report that cocaine traffickers are
increasingly </p>

<p> using routes employed four to six years ago. This
diversification </p>

<p> includes greater use of the eastern Caribbean and the eastern
Bahamas as </p>

<p> well as increased importation into the eastern United States.
</p>

<p> The use of maritime containerized cargo to smuggle bulk
quantities of </p>

<p> cocaine into the United States continues to challenge U.S.
Government </p>

<p> drug interdiction efforts. Many DEA field divisions report
the use of </p>

<p> cargo containers to conceal and transport cocaine among
legitimate </p>

<p> goods. Additionally, cocaine trafficking organizations
continue to use </p>

<p> maritime vessels such as pleasure craft and fishing vessels
to smuggle </p>

<p> cocaine from source countries into the United States.
Moreover, </p>

<p> traffickers utilize low-profile vessels designed to elude
radar </p>

<p> detection for smuggling cocaine into Puerto Rico. </p>

<p> Several DEA field divisions report cocaine trafficking
organizations </p>

<p> have increased their use of airdrop operations. Cocaine
traffickers are </p>

<p> airdropping cocaine shipments in the Caribbean and off the
coast of, as </p>

<p> well as within, Central America and Southern Mexico.
Additionally, South </p>

<p> American cocaine traffickers have acquired several large
cargo aircraft, </p>

<p> thereby increasing cargo capacity while overcoming the
limited flight </p>

<p> range of smaller aircraft. </p>

<p> U.S. law enforcement efforts along the United States-Mexican
border </p>

<p> continue to force regional cocaine traffickers to alter their
</p>

<p> operations. DEA and U.S. Border Patrol seizures since early
1992 </p>

<p> indicate that cocaine traffickers have decreased the average
size of </p>

<p> cocaine shipments and shifted transportation routes to less
trafficked </p>

<p> ports of entry. For example, in response to an enhanced law
enforcement </p>

<p> presence in southern California, traffickers are increasingly
using U.S. </p>

<p> ports of entry as far east as McAllen, Texas, to transport
cocaine to </p>

<p> California. </p>

<p> Domestic Distribution </p>

<p> The primary domestic importation points for cocaine remain
Arizona, </p>

<p> southern California, south Florida, and Texas. The principal
cities </p>

<p> utilized by Colombian cartels for distributing bulk
quantities of </p>

<p> cocaine include Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York
City. </p>

<p> Within the United States, cocaine traffickers continue to use
commercial </p>

<p> and private vehicles, trains, airlines, and the postal
service to </p>

<p> transport cocaine. Concealed compartments within vehicles are
commonly </p>

<p> cited by DEA field divisions. Moreover, cocaine traffickers
using </p>

<p> tractor-trailers frequently secrete cocaine in hidden
compartments and </p>

<p> among legitimate produce. Extensive use of commercial trucks
to </p>

<p> transport cocaine from the Los Angeles metropolitan area to
destinations </p>

<p> throughout the United States occurred during the past year. </p>

<p> The Cali Cartel's method of operation in the United States
remains </p>

<p> highly sophisticated and compartmentalized. U.S. bases of
operation are </p>

<p> comprised of multiple cells operating within major
metropolitan areas </p>

<p> including Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City,
Philadelphia, </p>

<p> and San Francisco. The operators of these cells receive
orders directly </p>

<p> from top-level cartel managers in Colombia, and operate
independently of </p>

<p> other cells within the same metropolitan area. The operators
utilize the </p>

<p> latest technology, such as computers, pagers, facsimile
machines, etc., </p>

<p> in their daily operations. Cellular telephones are often
bought in bulk </p>

<p> quantities and then discarded after being used for several
months or </p>

<p> less in order to thwart law enforcement telephone intercept
efforts. </p>

<p> In general, the Medellin Cartel's method of operation in the
United </p>

<p> States is not as compartmentalized as that of the Cali
Cartel. The drug </p>

<p> trafficking groups which comprise the Medellin Cartel employ
a group </p>

<p> decision-making process at the top level as opposed to a
hierarchical </p>

<p> decision-making process employed by the Cali Cartel. At the
lower </p>

<p> levels, Medellin-related trafficking groups are not as
restricted as </p>

<p> those associated with the Cali Cartel regarding the variety
of </p>

<p> distributors with whom they transact business. </p>

<p> Hispanic trafficking organizations, particularly Colombian
and Mexican, </p>

<p> continue to dominate wholesale cocaine trafficking and
distribution </p>

<p> within the United States. A greater diversity, however, has
become </p>

<p> involved in these activities at all levels of the domestic
traffic since </p>

<p> early 1992. </p>

<p> During 1992, four cocaine conversion laboratories were seized
within the </p>

<p> United States, two in New York City, one in California, and
one in </p>

<p> Florida. To date in 1993, one cocaine base conversion
laboratory was </p>

<p> seized within the United States in Hurleyville, New York. </p>

<p> CRACK COCAINE </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Purity </p>

<p> Crack continues to be readily available in virtually every
major city </p>

<p> and, to a somewhat lesser extent, many small towns and rural
areas in </p>

<p> the United States. Crack manufacturing and distribution have
reached a </p>

<p> saturation point in the larger metropolitan areas. </p>

<p> The national price for a rock or vial of crack ranges from as
low as $2 </p>

<p> to as high as $75, but generally sells for $10 to $50,
depending upon </p>

<p> the size, normally 1/10 to 1/2 gram. Gram prices range from
$45 to $150. </p>

<p> Ounce-quantities can be purchased for $475 to $2,500. When
available in </p>

<p> kilogram quantities, crack prices are comparable to those for
kilogram </p>

<p> quantities of cocaine hydrochloride, ranging from $17,000 to
$35,000. </p>

<p> Analysis of crack samples by DEA laboratories during the
mid-to-late </p>

<p> 1980's revealed that retail purity was consistently high,
averaging 80- </p>

<p> plus percent. Although current retail purity remains
approximately at </p>

<p> that level, sellers in some areas of the country are selling
poor- </p>

<p> quality crack. Adulterants are increasingly being added to
increase the </p>

<p> weight or size of the crack dosage unit. </p>

<p> Use </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992 showed
that the </p>

<p> number of lifetime, past-year, and past-month users of crack
declined </p>

<p> significantly from 1991 to 1992. Survey data indicate that
314,000 </p>

<p> Americans used crack during the past month and over 805,000
used it </p>

<p> during the </p>

<p> past year. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Survey on Drug
Abuse, </p>

<p> lifetime use of crack among seniors declined from 1991 to
1992; however, </p>

<p> past-year, past-month, and daily use of crack by this group
remained </p>

<p> relatively stable during that period. Nevertheless, overall
frequency of </p>

<p> crack use among high school seniors has decreased
substantially since </p>

<p> 1987. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN indicates that smoking is the predominant
route of </p>

<p> cocaine administration used by patients admitted to DAWN
emergency rooms </p>

<p> for cocaine-related problems. </p>

<p> Trafficking </p>

<p> The higher levels of crack trafficking are controlled by many
small (up </p>

<p> to 10 members) and mid-sized (10 to 40 members) trafficking </p>

<p> organizations consisting of bands of individuals from
distinct ethnic </p>

<p> groups. The main participants involved in wholesale crack
trafficking </p>

<p> are Los Angeles-based street gangs, Jamaican posses, </p>

<p> and Haitian and Dominican groups. </p>

<p> Saturated markets, low prices, violent competition, and
effective law </p>

<p> enforcement pressure in major urban areas have forced some
crack </p>

<p> trafficking organizations to develop new markets. These
organizations </p>

<p> are moving to smaller cities, towns, and rural areas across
the nation, </p>

<p> creating many problems for local law enforcement and civic
authorities. </p>

<p> The largest and more advanced organizations are crisscrossing
the nation </p>

<p> in this effort, with the Jamaican posses moving generally
westward and </p>

<p> the Crips and Bloods expanding eastward. </p>

<p> HEROIN </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Purity </p>

<p> Within the United States, heroin is readily available in all
the major </p>

<p> metropolitan areas having user populations. During 1992 and
the first </p>

<p> few months of 1993, there was an increase in purity at the
retail level, </p>

<p> and increased supplies available from Southwest Asia. (Note
that high- </p>

<p> purity heroin has been imported from Colombia in increasing
quantities </p>

<p> in the past year. This heroin from Colombia, which underwent
signature </p>

<p> analysis prior to DEA's development of a South American
heroin signature </p>

<p> in July 1993, was analyzed as having a Southwest Asian (SWA)
signature. </p>

<p> As a result, it may account in part for both the increased
purity and </p>

<p> quantity of SWA heroin available in the United States.) </p>

<p> Data from DEA's Domestic Monitor Program indicate the 1992
nationwide </p>

<p> average heroin purity at the retail (street) level was 37
percent, </p>

<p> considerably higher than the average purity of 26.6 percent
recorded in </p>

<p> 1991. Heroin purity at the street level was generally highest
in the </p>

<p> northeastern United States, where a large percentage of the
nation's </p>

<p> user population lives. </p>

<p> According to DEA's Heroin Signature Program (HSP), Southeast
Asian (SEA) </p>

<p> heroin was the predominant type of heroin available in the
United States </p>

<p> for the fifth year in a row, accounting for 44 percent of the
HSP </p>

<p> samples analyzed in FA 1992 and 58 percent of the total net
weight of </p>

<p> these samples. U.S. airports, particularly New York's JFK
International </p>

<p> Airport, are primary entry points for heroin destined for the
U.S. </p>

<p> market, based on seizures analyzed through the HSP. The
nationwide </p>

<p> average net weight of airport seizures was almost 800 grams
and the </p>

<p> average purity of heroin seized at these airports was 73
percent. </p>

<p> Use </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992
indicated a </p>

<p> decrease in the number of past-year heroin users. Survey data
show that </p>

<p> the number of Americans 12 years of age or older who have
used heroin at </p>

<p> least once in the past year declined from 381,000 in 1991 to
323,000 in </p>

<p> 1992. During that same time frame, however, the number of
past-month </p>

<p> heroin users increased from 83,000 to 107,000. (Estimates of
heroin use </p>

<p> from the Household Survey are considered very conservative
due to the </p>

<p> probable under-coverage of the population of heroin users.) </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey on
Drug Abuse, </p>

<p> heroin use increased among high school seniors. The survey
revealed that </p>

<p> 1.2 percent of the seniors in the class of 1992 had used
heroin at least </p>

<p> once in their lifetime, up from 0.9 percent in the class of
1991, yet </p>

<p> still below the peak of 1.3 percent reported in the classes
of 1989 and </p>

<p> 1990. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
nationwide </p>

<p> heroin-related emergency room episodes, which had been
fluctuating </p>

<p> somewhat during the past several years, increased
substantially from the </p>

<p> first to the second half of FY 1992. During that period, the
number of </p>

<p> heroin-related episodes rose from 18,192 to 24,593, an
increase of 35 </p>

<p> percent. Cities showing substantive increases during the
latter half of </p>

<p> FY 1992 in the number of heroin-related emergency room
episodes included </p>

<p> Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Seattle. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the injection of
heroin </p>

<p> continues to be the predominant route of administration used
by patients </p>

<p> admitted to emergency rooms for heroin-related problems.
However, the </p>

<p> percentage of patients who indicated that injection was their
primary </p>

<p> route of administration has decreased from 79.1 percent in FY
1989 to </p>

<p> 73.9 percent in FY 1992. During this same period, there was
an increase </p>

<p> in the percentage of patients who snorted heroin. Those who
snorted </p>

<p> heroin rose from 4.8 percent in FY 1989 to 8.8 percent in FY
1992. </p>

<p> Rates of opiate use (to include heroin) detected through
urinalysis </p>

<p> testing of recently booked male and female arrestees, as
reported by the </p>

<p> Drug Use Forecasting Program, remained relatively low and
stable in 1992 </p>

<p> when compared to rates for cocaine and marijuana. </p>

<p> Trafficking </p>

<p> Major SEA heroin trafficking organizations, often under the
control of </p>

<p> Sino-Thai and Chinese criminal groups, oversee the smuggling
of SEA </p>

<p> heroin into the United States, particularly New York City,
and are </p>

<p> primarily responsible for smuggling the largest bulk
shipments, </p>

<p> generally in the multihundred-kilogram range. The largest
shipments are </p>

<p> secreted in containerized freight aboard commercial maritime
vessels and </p>

<p> air freight cargo. Smaller shipments are smuggled in the
luggage of </p>

<p> airline passengers, strapped to the body, or swallowed. </p>

<p> In addition to Chinese and Sino-Thai traffickers, Nigerians
remain </p>

<p> deeply entrenched in the smuggling of SEA heroin. Nigerian
traffickers </p>

<p> rely primarily on dispatching large numbers of internal body
couriers </p>

<p> traveling aboard commercial airlines bound for the United
States. As a </p>

<p> result of enforcement pressure, Nigerians continue to recruit
other </p>

<p> ethnic groups, including other West Africans, Europeans, and
American </p>

<p> citizens, as heroin couriers. </p>

<p> Importation and distribution of SWA heroin is much less
centralized than </p>

<p> that for SEA heroin, both geographically and in regard to
trafficking </p>

<p> groups. Most SWA heroin trafficking groups in the United
States are </p>

<p> highly cohesive and difficult to penetrate because they are
based on </p>

<p> ethnic, familial, and tribal relationships. As a result, SWA
heroin </p>

<p> trafficking and distribution are generally more prevalent in
cities </p>

<p> having large populations from Afghanistan, Greece, Lebanon,
Pakistan, </p>

<p> and Turkey, such as Chicago, Detroit, and New York. </p>

<p> Mexican heroin is produced almost exclusively for the U.S.
heroin </p>

<p> market. The smuggling and distribution of Mexican heroin to
and within </p>

<p> the United States is controlled by organizations composed of
Mexican </p>

<p> nationals and Mexican Americans. Mexican trafficking
organizations are </p>

<p> often made up of family members, lifelong friends, and other
trusted </p>

<p> associates. </p>

<p> The availability of heroin from Colombia increased in the
United States </p>

<p> during the latter half of 1992 and early 1993, according to
seizure </p>

<p> analysis and investigative reporting. At present, Colombian
heroin </p>

<p> traffickers are attempting to establish distribution outlets
in the </p>

<p> United States, particularly in the metropolitan areas of the
northeast </p>

<p> and, as a result, are smuggling a heroin of very high purity,
generally </p>

<p> 80-plus percent. According to the El Paso Intelligence
Center, the </p>

<p> number of Colombian couriers who were arrested on commercial
airlines </p>

<p> carrying heroin into the United States increased from 41 in
1991 to over </p>

<p> 260 in 1992, with most of these arrests occurring at either
Miami or New </p>

<p> York's international airports. </p>

<p> CANNABIS </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Potency </p>

<p> Marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance and by-product
of the </p>

<p> Cannabis sativa L. plant, remained the most commonly used
illegal drug </p>

<p> in the United States during 1992. Both the cannabis plant and
delta-9 </p>

<p> tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant's primary psychoactive
chemical, </p>

<p> are controlled substances. </p>

<p> According to DEA reporting, 34 percent of a non-sinsemilla
plant </p>

<p> contains usable material (the leaf and bud components) and 58
percent of </p>

<p> a sinsemilla plant contains usable material. The yield of a
cannabis </p>

<p> plant is determined by its diameter and the density of the
grow area. </p>

<p> The lower the plant density of the grow area, the higher the
yield of </p>

<p> usable material. The average plant yield for mature,
domestically grown </p>

<p> sinsemilla is approximately 1.25 pounds per plant. The
average plant </p>

<p> yield for mature, domestically grown commercial grade
marijuana is </p>

<p> approximately three-quarters of one pound per plant. </p>

<p> Marijuana prices have increased substantially over the past
decade. </p>

<p> Commercial grade marijuana prices rose from $350 to $600 per
pound 10 </p>

<p> years ago to $300 to $3,000 per pound in 1992. Sinsemilla
prices rose </p>

<p> from $1,000 to $2,000 per pound 10 years ago to $650 to
$9,600 per pound </p>

<p> in 1992. Law enforcement efforts have forced some cultivators
indoors to </p>

<p> avoid detection. Indoor growers cultivate higher potency
sinsemilla </p>

<p> marijuana, which permits them to charge higher prices.
Scarcity caused </p>

<p> by law enforcement operations also has increased prices. </p>

<p> Domestic cultivation trends of significance in recent years
include </p>

<p> cultivator efforts to enhance the potency of marijuana by
using </p>

<p> advanced agronomic techniques. As a result, the average THC
content of </p>

<p> marijuana has risen considerably in the last ten years.
Furthermore, </p>

<p> record-high THC contents were reported in 1992 and 1993.
These record- </p>

<p> high THC contents are an indicator of the continuing trend by
indoor </p>

<p> growers to produce higher potency marijuana. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse, </p>

<p> approximately 67.5 million Americans have tried marijuana at
least once </p>

<p> in their lifetime compared to 61.9 million in 1985.
Nevertheless, survey </p>

<p> data indicate that the frequency of marijuana use has
declined </p>

<p> substantially from 1985 to 1992. Overall, past-year,
past-month, and </p>

<p> past-week use of the drug nave diminished by nearly 45
percent during </p>

<p> that period </p>

<p> According to the National High School Survey on Drug Abuse,
the long- </p>

<p> term decline in the use of marijuana among 12th graders
continued in </p>

<p> 1992. However, there was also a decrease in the proportion of
12th </p>

<p> graders who believed there was &quot;great risk&quot;
associated with regular </p>

<p> marijuana use, possibly presaging a reversal of the downward
use </p>

<p> pattern. In addition, among 8th graders, lifetime, past-year,
and past- </p>

<p> month use of marijuana marginally increased from 1991 to
1992. Moreover, </p>

<p> 8th graders in the class of 1992 were less likely to view
marijuana use </p>

<p> as dangerous compared to 8th graders in the class of 1991.
Also, the </p>

<p> proportion of 8th graders who personally disapproved of
marijuana use </p>

<p> declined from 1991 to 1992. These shifts in perception may
explain the </p>

<p> increased use of marijuana among 8th graders. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan area </p>

<p> marijuana-related emergency room episodes, which had declined
from FY </p>

<p> 1989 to FY 1991, increased once again during FY 1992. The
large </p>

<p> majority, approximately 80 percent, of patients treated for
cannabis- </p>

<p> related hospital emergencies use marijuana with other
substances. </p>

<p> Patients use marijuana most frequently with alcohol and
cocaine. </p>

<p> Marijuana use detected through urinalysis testing of recently
booked </p>

<p> male and female arrestees, as reported by the Drug Use
Forecasting </p>

<p> Program, increased significantly in many major U.S. cities in
1992. </p>

<p> Trafficking </p>

<p> Mexico accounted for most of the foreign marijuana available
in the </p>

<p> United States during 1992. Colombia ranked as a distant
second as a </p>

<p> foreign source of marijuana. Commencing in early 1992,
Jamaican </p>

<p> traffickers increased marijuana shipments to the United
States. </p>

<p> DEA, in conjunction with Federal and State law enforcement
agencies, </p>

<p> conducted an aggressive cannabis eradication program in 1992.
The effort </p>

<p> resulted in the eradication of millions of cannabis plants,
the arrest </p>

<p> of thousands of violators, the forfeiture of millions of
dollars in </p>

<p> assets, and the seizure of several thousand weapons.
Moreover, the </p>

<p> number of indoor growing operations seized in 1992 (3,849)
reached an </p>

<p> all-time high. The movement toward indoor production is
believed due </p>

<p> primarily to successful law enforcement efforts to curtail
outdoor </p>

<p> cultivation. </p>

<p> The five major cultivated cannabis-producing States in 1992
were </p>

<p> Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Hawaii,
respectively. These </p>

<p> five States accounted for approximately 44 percent of the
cultivated </p>

<p> cannabis eradicated during 1992. </p>

<p> METHAMPHETAMINE </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Purity </p>

<p> Methamphetamine is the most prevalent clandestinely
manufactured </p>

<p> controlled substance in the United States. Availability is
concentrated </p>

<p> primarily in the western and southwestern United States where
most </p>

<p> clandestine methamphetamine manufacture occurs. </p>

<p> The price of methamphetamine at the wholesale (pound) level
has remained </p>

<p> relatively constant during the past four years. Currently, </p>

<p> methamphetamine prices range from $5,000 to $22,000 per
pound, $300 to </p>

<p> $2,500 per ounce, and $45 to $200 per gram. </p>

<p> Nationwide purity of methamphetamine at the ounce and gram
levels </p>

<p> averaged 46 and 53 percent, respectively, during 1992,
compared to 35 </p>

<p> and 34 percent, respectively, during 1991. (Pound purity
levels are </p>

<p> unavailable due to infrequency of purchases at that level.) </p>

<p> Use </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1991 showed
that an </p>

<p> estimated 5.2 million Americans, 12 years of age and older,
have used </p>

<p> methamphetamine at least once in their lifetime. (Survey data
for prior </p>

<p> years are unavailable. Survey data for 1992 are not yet
available.) </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan area </p>

<p> methamphetamine-related emergency room episodes decreased at
a </p>

<p> relatively steady rate from the first half of FY 1989 through
the first </p>

<p> half of FY 1992. However, this downward trend reversed itself
during the </p>

<p> latter half of FY 1992. During the second half of FY 1992,
there was a </p>

<p> 52-percent increase in the number of emergency room episodes
involving </p>

<p> methamphetamine. </p>

<p> DAWN emergency room data also indicate that methamphetamine
abuse is </p>

<p> concentrated in the metropolitan areas of San Diego, San
Francisco, and </p>

<p> Los Angeles. In San Diego and Los Angeles,
methamphetamine-related </p>

<p> hospital emergencies increased sharply during the latter half
of 1992. </p>

<p> Illicit Manufacture </p>

<p> According to DEA reporting, 288 domestic methamphetamine
laboratories </p>

<p> were seized during 1992, accounting for 87 percent of all
clandestine </p>

<p> dangerous drug laboratory seizures. The 1992 figure
represents a nine- </p>

<p> percent decrease from the previous year's total of 315
laboratories </p>

<p> seized and continues the downward trend in laboratory
seizures, which </p>

<p> began in 1990. </p>

<p> The main reason for the decrease in laboratory seizures is
the ongoing </p>

<p> enforcement of Federal and State chemical-control
legislation. The 1988 </p>

<p> Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act (CDTA) became
effective in 1989, </p>

<p> and enables the Federal Government to regulate listed
essential </p>

<p> chemicals used in the clandestine synthesis of dangerous
drugs. Over the </p>

<p> past three years, most States have passed legislation similar
to the </p>

<p> CDTA. </p>

<p> Approximately 83 percent of the methamphetamine laboratory
seizures </p>

<p> during 1992 occurred in the DEA Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles,
Phoenix, </p>

<p> San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle, Field Divisions. This
clearly </p>

<p> indicates that the manufacture of methamphetamine is still
based </p>

<p> primarily in the western and southwestern United States. </p>

<p> Manufacturing/Distribution Organizations </p>

<p> Throughout the United States, numerous individuals, groups,
and </p>

<p> organizations-from independent entrepreneurs and outlaw
motorcycle gangs </p>

<p> to Mexican poly-drug trafficking organizations-currently
manufacture and </p>

<p> distribute methamphetamine. (Although late arrivals in the </p>

<p> methamphetamine arena, Mexican traffickers are capable of
using their </p>

<p> high-volume production methods and large-scale distribution
networks to </p>

<p> substantially increase the drug's availability in the United
States. For </p>

<p> this reason, domestic law enforcement considers the Mexican
poly-drug </p>

<p> traffickers involvement in methamphetamine a significant
threat.) </p>

<p> Chemical Diversion </p>

<p> Chemical control legislation enacted at the Federal and State
level has </p>

<p> made it increasingly difficult for laboratory operators to
obtain needed </p>

<p> chemicals. Consequently, trafficking organizations have been
forced to </p>

<p> seek new sources and develop ways in which to circumvent the
law. </p>

<p> LSD </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Purity </p>

<p> Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) availability has increased
in the last </p>

<p> two to three years and it is available in at least retail
quantities in </p>

<p> virtually every State in the United States. The sources of
supply for </p>

<p> most of the LSD available in the United States are located in
the </p>

<p> northern California area. </p>

<p> LSD is relatively inexpensive with an average street dosage
unit or </p>

<p> &quot;hit&quot; costing approximately five dollars, and often
as little as one or </p>

<p> two dollars. Retail-level doses are seen primarily in blotter
paper </p>

<p> form. </p>

<p> Currently, LSD potency or strength, which ranges from 20 to
80 </p>

<p> micrograms per dosage unit, is considerably below levels
reported during </p>

<p> the 1960s and early 1970s when potency ranged from 100 to 200
micrograms </p>

<p> (or higher) per dosage unit. </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1991
estimated that 11.8 </p>

<p> million Americans 12 years of age or older have used LSD at
least once </p>

<p> in their lifetime compared to 8.4 million in 1985. (Survey
data for 1992 </p>

<p> are not yet available.) </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Survey on Drug
Abuse, current </p>

<p> (monthly) use of LSD among 10th and 12th grade students
remained </p>

<p> relatively stable from 1991 to 1992. Among 8th graders,
however, current </p>

<p> use of LSD increased during that same time frame from 0.6
percent to 0.9 </p>

<p> percent. Moreover, past-year use of LSD rose in all three
grade levels </p>

<p> from 1991 to 1992. In fact, past-year use of LSD among
seniors in the </p>

<p> class of 1992 increased to the highest level since at least
1985. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
nationwide LSD- </p>

<p> related hospital emergency room episodes increased from FY
1989 to FY </p>

<p> 1990. Although abuse patterns have been somewhat erratic
since that </p>

<p> period, the current number of LSD-related episodes remain
above those </p>

<p> reported during FY 1989. </p>

<p> Illicit Manufacture </p>

<p> An increasing number of individuals are attempting to
manufacture LSD. </p>

<p> Many of these individuals are not associated with the
traditional </p>

<p> northern California groups that are believed to have produced
most of </p>

<p> the LSD available in the United States since the late 1960s. </p>

<p> Distribution </p>

<p> At the wholesale production and distribution level, LSD
remains tightly </p>

<p> controlled by California-based organizations, which have
operated with </p>

<p> relative impunity for over two decades. Mid-level
distribution networks </p>

<p> in the United States are generally comprised of young adults
who have </p>

<p> known each other through long years of association and common
interests. </p>

<p> Public and private mail systems appear to be the primary
means used for </p>

<p> the transportation and distribution of retail and wholesale
quantities </p>

<p> of LSD. </p>

<p> A total of six clandestine synthesis LSD laboratories have
been seized </p>

<p> since 1981; however, these were all seized prior to 1987. </p>

<p> PCP </p>

<p> Availability/Price </p>

<p> Phencyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, is available in
varying </p>

<p> degrees in a limited number of U.S. cities. During 1992, PCP
in liquid </p>

<p> form, the most common form available in the United States,
sold for $150 </p>

<p> to $1,000 per ounce nationally. The lowest liquid ounce
prices were </p>

<p> reported in Los Angeles, the source for most of the PCP
trafficked in </p>

<p> the United States. </p>

<p> PCP enjoyed a brief popularity in the late 1960's and again
from the </p>

<p> mid-to- late 1970's. In 1978, PCP was transferred from
Schedule III to </p>

<p> Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act, thus
classifying it as a </p>

<p> drug with a high potential for abuse. From the period 1981
through 1985, </p>

<p> abuse of the drug escalated significantly, particularly among
persons </p>

<p> under the age of 21. Around 1986, and continuing through the
late 1980's </p>

<p> and early 1990's, demand for PCP was displaced in large
measure by the </p>

<p> widespread availability and use of crack cocaine. More
recently, </p>

<p> however, there are indications that PCP abuse is increasing
once again </p>

<p> in a number of cities. </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse showed that
lifetime and </p>

<p> past-year PCP use among the U.S. household population
decreased from </p>

<p> 1985 to 1990; however, 1991 and 1992 survey data indicate an
end to this </p>

<p> downward use pattern. On the other hand, according to the
1992 National </p>

<p> High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse, PCP use among 12th
graders has </p>

<p> declined significantly during the past seven years. This
diminished use </p>

<p> is believed due in large part to a significant increase among
12th </p>

<p> graders in the perceived risk of harm associated with PCP
usage. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan-area </p>

<p> PCP-related emergency room episodes, which had been declining
at a </p>

<p> substantial rate during the past three years, rose from 1,353
during the </p>

<p> first half of FY 1992 to 2,380 during the second half of FY
1992, a more </p>

<p> than 75-percent increase. Cities having high or increased PCP
abuse </p>

<p> rates during the second half of FY 1992 included Baltimore,
Chicago, Los </p>

<p> Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and
Washington, </p>

<p> D.C. </p>

<p> Trafficking and Illicit Manufacture </p>

<p> Reporting indicates that the majority of the nation's PCP
supply is </p>

<p> manufactured and distributed by Los Angeles-based street
gangs. While </p>

<p> buses, trains, and airlines are used to transport PCP from
California </p>

<p> sources of supply, private automobiles are believed to be the
primary </p>

<p> means for transporting PCP across the country. </p>

<p> Four PCP laboratories were seized in 1992 compared to three
in 1991. No </p>

<p> PCP laboratories have been seized thus far in 1993. PCP
laboratory </p>

<p> seizures since the mid-1980's have ranged from three to 21
per year, </p>

<p> totals which are considerably less than the high of 79
reported in 1978. </p>

<p> COCAINE </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY </p>

<p> In 1992, domestic cocaine prices fluctuated due to successful
domestic </p>

<p> and international law enforcement operations, which caused a
short-term </p>

<p> (3-month) impact on cocaine trafficking from South America.
Following a </p>

<p> period of adjustment, cocaine traffickers once again found
the means to </p>

<p> facilitate the shipment of multiton quantities of cocaine to
the United </p>

<p> States. In 1992, cocaine prices ranged from $11,000 to
$42,000 per </p>

<p> kilogram nationally in comparison to 1991 prices, which
ranged from </p>

<p> $11,000 to $40,000 per kilogram nationally. During April
through June </p>

<p> 1992, shortages of wholesale quantities of cocaine resulted
in an </p>

<p> increase in the kilogram price in many major U.S.
metropolitan areas. </p>

<p> Throughout the remainder of the year, however, cocaine was
readily </p>

<p> available as kilogram prices in virtually all major
metropolitan areas </p>

<p> returned to lower levels. Preliminary data for early 1993
indicate that </p>

<p> kilogram prices remain at low levels. </p>

<p> Nationwide purity of cocaine at the kilogram, ounce, and gram
levels </p>

<p> averaged 83, 74, and 64 percent, respectively, during 1992,
compared to </p>

<p> 86, 72, and 59 percent, respectively, during 1991. A
temporary decline </p>

<p> in purity at all levels of the traffic was noted during July
through </p>

<p> September 1992; however, by year's end, purity at all levels
had </p>

<p> increased once again. </p>

<p> Nationwide purity of cocaine at the kilogram, ounce, and gram
levels </p>

<p> averaged 83, 74, and 64 percent, respectively, during 1992,
compared to </p>

<p> 86, 72, and 59 percent, respectively, during 1991. A
temporary decline </p>

<p> in purity at all levels of the traffic was noted during July
through </p>

<p> September 1992; however, by year's end, purity at all levels
had </p>

<p> increased once again. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> The 1992 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (see
appendix) showed </p>

<p> that the number of past-year and past-month users of cocaine
has </p>

<p> decreased significantly since the peak year of 1985. During
1992, five </p>

<p> million Americans 12 years of age and older had used cocaine
in the past </p>

<p> year compared to 12.2 million in 1985. In 1992, 1.3 million
had used </p>

<p> cocaine in the past month compared to 5.8 million in 1985.
Nevertheless, </p>

<p> frequent or more intense use of cocaine has not shown
statistically </p>

<p> significant change during the past several years. Among the
five million </p>

<p> people who used cocaine in the past year, 642,000 used it
once a week or </p>

<p> more in 1992 compared to 625,000 in 1991 and 662,00 in 1990. </p>

<p> The survey also showed that approximately 80 percent of
past-month </p>

<p> cocaine users were young adults ages 18 to 34 in 1992. As in
the past, </p>

<p> the rate of past-month cocaine use in 1992 was highest among
young </p>

<p> adults 18 to 25 years old (1.8 percent of the U.S.
population) and ages </p>

<p> 26 to 34 years (1.4 percent of the U.S. population). The
past-month </p>

<p> cocaine prevalence rate for the 12- to 17-year-old age group
has </p>

<p> decreased from 1.1 percent of the U.S. population in 1988 to
0.3 percent </p>

<p> in 1992. Similarly, the 18- to 25-year-old age group has
experienced </p>

<p> dramatic decreases in prevalence from 4.5 percent of the U.S.
population </p>

<p> in 1988 to 1.8 percent in 1992. For the 26- to 34-year-old
age group, </p>

<p> the rate has declined from 2.6 percent to 1.4 percent. The
rate for </p>

<p> persons aged 35 and older has shown variability, but remained
virtually </p>

<p> unchanged since 1988 (0.3 percent of the U.S. population and
0.2 percent </p>

<p> in 1992). Lastly, the prevalence rate of past-month cocaine
use among </p>

<p> the total U.S. population was estimated at 0.6 percent in
1992 compared </p>

<p> to 1.5 percent in 1988 and 0.9 percent in 1991. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey on
Drug </p>

<p> Abuse(see appendix for additional survey information),
cocaine use </p>

<p> continued to decline among high school seniors. Survey
results showed </p>

<p> 6.1 percent of seniors in the class of 1992 said they had
used cocaine </p>

<p> at least once in their lifetime, down from 7.8 percent in the
class of </p>

<p> 1991 and down from a peak of 17.3 percent in the class of
1985. Among </p>

<p> 10th graders, lifetime cocaine use decreased from 4.1 percent
in 1991 to </p>

<p> 3.3 percent in 1992. Among 8th graders, however, lifetime use
of cocaine </p>

<p> increased from 2.3 percent in 1991 to 2.9 percent in 1992,
and past-year </p>

<p> use increased from 1.1 percent to 1.5 percent. </p>

<p> Other findings from the survey indicate that fewer 8th
graders in 1992 </p>

<p> associated great risk of harm with occasional cocaine or
crack cocaine </p>

<p> use than did 8th graders in 1991. There was also a decrease
in the </p>

<p> proportion of 10th graders saying there is great risk of harm
with </p>

<p> occasional cocaine use. </p>

<p> Reporting from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) (see
appendix for </p>

<p> further information on DAWN) shows that the estimated number
of </p>

<p> nationwide cocaine-related emergency room episodes, which had
been </p>

<p> increasing at a fairly constant rate from the early-to-late
1980's, </p>

<p> declined significantly from FY 1989 to FY 1990. During the
latter half </p>

<p> of FY 1991, however, the number of episodes increased once
again and </p>

<p> appears to have stabilized at high levels since that time. A
number of </p>

<p> drug epidemiologists and treatment specialists believe a
possible </p>

<p> explanation for this trend reversal is that many hard-core
cocaine users </p>

<p> are now experiencing the consequences of long-term addiction.
As a </p>

<p> result, an increasing number of users are seeking public
medical </p>

<p> assistance. </p>

<p> Nationwide, during the fourth quarter of FY 1992,
approximately one in </p>

<p> four(28.3%) emergency room drug abuse episodes involved
cocaine. </p>

<p> Metropolitan areas having a significantly higher proportion
of drug </p>

<p> emergencies involving cocaine include: Baltimore (63.5%),
Atlanta </p>

<p> (56.3%), Philadelphia (54.1%), New Orleans (48.2%), Chicago
(46.7%), New </p>

<p> York (46.3%), Newark (44.2%), Detroit (41.4%), Miami (39.1%),
</p>

<p> Washington, D.C. (37.5%), St. Louis (36.0%), and Boston
(34.8%). </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN also indicates that smoking continues to
be the </p>

<p> predominant route of administration used by patients admitted
to DAWN </p>

<p> emergency rooms for cocaine-related problems. The percentage
of patients </p>

<p> who indicated that smoking was their primary method of
administration </p>

<p> increased from 34.3 percent during FY 1989 to 41.4 percent in
FY 1992. </p>

<p> During the same time frame, there was a decrease in the
percentage of </p>

<p> patients who injected or snorted cocaine. Those who injected
or snorted </p>

<p> cocaine decreased from 22.0 percent and 14.0 percent,
respectively, </p>

<p> during FY 1989, to 20.2 percent and 11.1 percent,
respectively, during </p>

<p> FY 1992. </p>

<p> Rates of cocaine use detected through urinalysis testing of
recently </p>

<p> booked male and female arrestees, as reported by the Drug Use
</p>

<p> Forecasting Program (DUF) (see appendix for further
information on DUF), </p>

<p> remained high in many major U.S. cities in 1992. In fact,
rates of </p>

<p> cocaine seducing the past year were substantially higher than
those for </p>

<p> opiate and marijuana use. Among the highest was Philadelphia,
where 63 </p>

<p> percent of the sampled population tested positive for cocaine
use. In </p>

<p> New York City, the figure was 62 percent; in Atlanta, 58
percent; in </p>

<p> Chicago, 56 percent; in Miami, 56 percent; in Cleveland, 53
percent; and </p>

<p> in Los Angeles, 52 percent. Cocaine use among recently booked
female </p>

<p> arrestees was also high in many cities. In New York City, 72
percent of </p>

<p> the female arrestees sampled tested positive for the use of
cocaine; in </p>

<p> Philadelphia, 67 percent; in Cleveland, 66 percent; in
Washington, D.C., </p>

<p> 64 percent; in Kansas City, 62 percent; in St. Louis, 62
percent; and in </p>

<p> Detroit, 62 percent. </p>

<p> TRAFFICKING </p>

<p> General Overview </p>

<p> The primary domestic importation points for cocaine destined
for U.S. </p>

<p> consumption remain Arizona, southern California, south
Florida, and </p>

<p> Texas. The principal cities utilized by Colombian cartels for
</p>

<p> distribution of multi-hundred or multi-thousand kilogram
quantities of </p>

<p> cocaine include Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York.
While the </p>

<p> Medellin Cartel remains a significant supplier of cocaine to
the major </p>

<p> U.S. distribution cities, the Cali Cartel continues to
control most of </p>

<p> the cocaine brought into New York City, Miami, and Los
Angeles. Staging </p>

<p> sites in the southwestern United States, where some
stockpiling occurs </p>

<p> while awaiting transportation, are supplied with cocaine by
Mexican </p>

<p> smugglers using couriers or tractor-trailers, other vehicles,
and </p>

<p> commercial cargo. Organized groups of Cubans, Dominicans,
Jamaicans, </p>

<p> Mexicans, and African-American gangs provide retail-level
distribution </p>

<p> of the drug in major U.S. cities. In addition, both the
Medellin and </p>

<p> Cali Cartels maintain operational headquarters in major U.S.
cities to </p>

<p> control wholesale distribution networks. During the last
year, as in the </p>

<p> past, traffickers shifted or diversified trafficking routes
following </p>

<p> major seizures. Traffickers appear to be only temporarily
affected by </p>

<p> the interdiction of pipelines and are taking an average of 10
to 14 days </p>

<p> to reestablish operations. This suggests continued use of
imaginative </p>

<p> concealment methods and the use or maintenance of
multiple-delivery </p>

<p> pipelines and systems to avoid law enforcement. </p>

<p> Routes </p>

<p> Cocaine traffickers perceiving enhanced law enforcement
activity along </p>

<p> the United States-Mexican border and in the western Caribbean
have </p>

<p> subsequently diversified their smuggling routes into the
United States. </p>

<p> DEA field divisions report that cocaine traffickers are
increasingly </p>

<p> using routes employed four to six years ago. This
diversification </p>

<p> includes greater use of the eastern Caribbean and the eastern
Bahamas as </p>

<p> well as increased importation into the eastern United States.
This trend </p>

<p> was highlighted by the July 1992 seizure of 5.2 metric tons
of cocaine </p>

<p> in Panama which was destined for Baltimore. Moreover, DEA
Miami reports </p>

<p> that the Medellin Cartel has established a significant
presence in The </p>

<p> Bahamas, utilizing the area as a transit point for cocaine en
route to </p>

<p> south Florida. </p>

<p> Increased cocaine trafficking through the eastern Caribbean
includes </p>

<p> greater use of Puerto Rico, which appears to be a primary
target of </p>

<p> cocaine traffickers who use it as a transshipment point for
cocaine </p>

<p> destined for the United States, Canada, and Europe. While the
smuggling </p>

<p> of cocaine by general aviation aircraft into Puerto Rico
continues, </p>

<p> maritime smuggling is the primary method of transporting
cocaine to the </p>

<p> island. The appeal of Puerto Rico as a cocaine transit point
is enhanced </p>

<p> by two factors: the first is the proximity of Puerto Rico to
South </p>

<p> America, and the second is that once cocaine is successfully
smuggled </p>

<p> into Puerto Rico, it can be shipped to the continental United
States </p>

<p> with little likelihood of U.S. Customs screening. </p>

<p> Since early 1992, DEA field divisions have increasingly cited
Central </p>

<p> American countries as transshipment points for U.S.-bound
cocaine </p>

<p> shipments. This was highlighted by the April 1992 seizure of
6.7 metric </p>

<p> tons of cocaine in Miami transshipped through Guatemala and
by the July </p>

<p> 1992 seizure in Panama noted previously. During the past
year, every </p>

<p> Central American country was cited as a transshipment point
for U.S.- </p>

<p> boundcocaine. Reporting indicates cocaine is transported from
source </p>

<p> countries to Central American countries by land, air, and sea
</p>

<p> conveyances. From Central America, cocaine shipments are
transported to </p>

<p> the United States by land, sea, and air directly or through
Mexico. </p>

<p> U.S. law enforcement efforts along the United States-Mexican
border </p>

<p> continue to force regional cocaine traffickers to alter their
</p>

<p> operations. DEA and U.S. Border Patrol seizures since early
1992 </p>

<p> indicate that cocaine traffickers are increasingly
transporting smaller </p>

<p> (10 to 50 kilograms) cocaine shipments across less trafficked
ports of </p>

<p> entry such as Calexico and Tecate, as opposed to transporting
large </p>

<p> (multihundred kilogram) cocaine shipments across more
frequently used </p>

<p> border crossing points such as San Ysidro. Additionally, in
response to </p>

<p> law enforcement in southern California, traffickers
increasingly use </p>

<p> U.S. ports of entry as far east as McAllen, Texas, to smuggle
cocaine to </p>

<p> California. Methods of Transportation and Concealment </p>

<p> Maritime Transportation </p>

<p> The use of maritime containerized cargo to smuggle bulk
quantities of </p>

<p> cocaine into the United States continues to challenge U.S.
Government </p>

<p> drug interdiction efforts. Many DEA field divisions report
the use of </p>

<p> cargo containers to conceal and transport cocaine among
legitimate </p>

<p> goods. Additionally, cocaine is sometimes hidden in the walls
and </p>

<p> support beams of cargo containers as well as in, or attached
to, the </p>

<p> vessels themselves. DEA reporting indicates an increased
demand by </p>

<p> cocaine traffickers for cargo ships in order to transport
bulk </p>

<p> quantities of U.S.-bound cocaine. Furthermore, U.S. Customs
reports the </p>

<p> large volume of cargo arriving at domestic ports, coupled
with the U.S. </p>

<p> Customs capability of inspecting only a small portion of this
cargo, </p>

<p> continue to be factors operating in favor of smuggling
organizations. </p>

<p> The use of low-profile vessels by cocaine traffickers has
made maritime </p>

<p> interdiction extremely difficult off the coast of Puerto
Rico. DEA </p>

<p> reporting indicates these vessels, fabricated of wood and/or
fiberglass </p>

<p> and measuring up to only 40 feet in length, are difficult to
visually </p>

<p> detect since their coloring blends with the ocean. Moreover,
their </p>

<p> profiles of only one to two feet above the water are not
always </p>

<p> detectable by radar. Investigative reporting indicates these
vessels </p>

<p> transport up to one metric ton of cocaine and sail directly
from </p>

<p> Colombia to Puerto Rico without being detected. </p>

<p> Cocaine trafficking organizations also rely heavily on the
use of </p>

<p> noncommercial maritime vessels. Pleasure craft and fishing
vessels are </p>

<p> used to smuggle cocaine from source countries into the United
States. </p>

<p> Pleasure craft carrying cocaine enter U.S. waters by blending
in with </p>

<p> weekend &quot;traffic &quot;along the southeastern coast
where weekend vessel </p>

<p> activity is heavy. Fishing vessels are also used to carry
cocaine </p>

<p> directly into the United States as well as to transfer
cocaine to other </p>

<p> vessels off the coast. </p>

<p> Air Transportation </p>

<p> DEA San Diego, Los Angeles, and Miami report cocaine
trafficking </p>

<p> organizations have increased their use of airdrop operations.
Cocaine </p>

<p> traffickers are airdropping cocaine shipments in the
Caribbean and off </p>

<p> the coast of, as well as within, Central America and southern
Mexico. </p>

<p> A combination of law enforcement successes, including those
of the </p>

<p> United States-Mexican Northern Border Response Force, and
conflicts </p>

<p> between trafficking organizations for control of clandestine
airstrips </p>

<p> have contributed to trafficker avoidance of landing aircraft
in northern </p>

<p> Mexico. Consequently, a number of smuggling organizations,
including </p>

<p> traffickers associated with the Cali Cartel, feel it is less
risky to </p>

<p> airdrop cocaine shipments to ground or maritime crews in
Central America </p>

<p> or the Caribbean than to land aircraft in northern Mexico. </p>

<p> South American cocaine traffickers have recently acquired
several large </p>

<p> cargo aircraft for the transport of cocaine, thereby
increasing cargo </p>

<p> capacity while overcoming the limited flight range of smaller
aircraft. </p>

<p> Moreover, cocaine traffickers within The Bahamas and
elsewhere in the </p>

<p> Caribbean continue to use smaller aircraft as decoys to
divert law </p>

<p> enforcement interdiction assets from actual smuggling
operations being </p>

<p> conducted in a different locale. </p>

<p> Land Transportation </p>

<p> Cocaine couriers employ several methods to counter trafficker
profiles </p>

<p> at or near the United States-Mexican border; these methods
include </p>

<p> traveling in family-type groups with women and children to
avoid </p>

<p> suspicion at checkpoints, hiring non-Mexicans to transport
cocaine from </p>

<p> United States-Mexican border areas into Los Angeles, and
recruiting </p>

<p> Anglo drivers and females to transport cocaine shipments. </p>

<p> Kilogram bricks continue to be the predominant form of
packaged cocaine </p>

<p> smuggled into the United States. During the past year, DEA
field </p>

<p> divisions have frequently cited rubber/waterproofed packaging
of </p>

<p> cocaine. Additionally, seizures of multihundred kilograms of
cocaine </p>

<p> concealed in U-Haul cardboard boxes and 55-gallon drums
increased. Tile- </p>

<p> shaped cocaine (2&quot;x 8&quot;x 8&quot;), vacuum-packed in
metallic-type material, </p>

<p> has also been reported. </p>

<p> DEA and the U.S. Customs Service reported traffickers smuggle
liquefied </p>

<p> cocaine into the United States concealed in water tanks of
mobile homes </p>

<p> and recreational vehicles. Traffickers also have labeled
55-gallon drums </p>

<p> of liquid cocaine to reflect the climatic conditions of the
locale where </p>

<p> the drums are shipped, i.e., a shipment to Chicago in the
winter is </p>

<p> labeled &quot;antifreeze.&quot; During May 1992, U.S. Customs
in Houston made the </p>

<p> first seizure of liquid cocaine at Houston Intercontinental
Airport from </p>

<p> an Ecuadorian national enroute to New York City. DEA Miami
reported </p>

<p> small amounts of liquid cocaine are sometimes concealed
within liquor </p>

<p> bottles. Moreover, DEA San Diego and Baltimore reported
traffickers are </p>

<p> smuggling liquid cocaine into their areas of jurisdiction. </p>

<p> Within the United States, cocaine traffickers continue to use
commercial </p>

<p> and private vehicles, trains, airlines, and the postal
service to ship </p>

<p> cocaine. The use of concealed compartments within vehicles is
commonly </p>

<p> cited by DEA field divisions. During the past year, several
cocaine </p>

<p> seizures involved multiple concealment sites within the same
vehicle, a </p>

<p> smuggling technique associated with marijuana trafficking.
Popular </p>

<p> vehicles among traffickers for transporting cocaine include
Nissan </p>

<p> vehicles and mini-vans. Additionally, some transportation
organizations </p>

<p> use rental vehicles to circumvent vehicle seizures. </p>

<p> Cocaine traffickers who use tractor-trailers employ several
methods to </p>

<p> circumvent law enforcement. There is extensive use of
elaborate hidden </p>

<p> compartments to secrete cocaine within tractor-trailers.
Additionally, </p>

<p> cocaine is often hidden among legitimate produce such as
onions and </p>

<p> watermelons. On the West Coast, tractor-trailers obtain
produce in the </p>

<p> San Joaquin Valley to conceal cocaine destined for the
Midwest and East </p>

<p> Coast cities. Concealment of cocaine in tractor-trailers also
includes </p>

<p> the use of compartments in air-conditioning units, radiators,
and </p>

<p> batteries, containers welded in tire rims, and false walls.
In the </p>

<p> Southwest, large commercial vehicles and trucks are a primary
method for </p>

<p> transporting cocaine. An increase has been noted in the use
of tractor- </p>

<p> trailers to transport bulk cocaine shipments into the Chicago
area. DEA </p>

<p> reports truckers transporting cocaine sealed in odor-reducing
wax among </p>

<p> legitimate cargo to avoid detection at checkpoints and
scales. Extensive </p>

<p> use of commercial trucks to transport cocaine from the Los
Angeles </p>

<p> metropolitan area to destinations throughout the United
States has </p>

<p> occurred during the past year. In addition, traffickers
continue to seek </p>

<p> opportunities to recruit U.S. port officials to facilitate
large cocaine </p>

<p> shipments into the United States from Mexico by
tractor-trailer. </p>

<p> Domestic Distribution </p>

<p> The Cali Cartel's method of operation in the United States
remains </p>

<p> highly sophisticated and compartmentalized. U.S. bases of
operation are </p>

<p> comprised of multiple cells operating within major
metropolitan areas to </p>

<p> include Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York,
Philadelphia, and San </p>

<p> Francisco. The operators of these cells receive orders
directly from </p>

<p> top-level cartel managers in Colombia and operate
independently of other </p>

<p> cells within the same metropolitan area. Cell operators
utilize the </p>

<p> latest technology, such as computers, pagers, and facsimile
machines, in </p>

<p> their daily operations. Cellular telephones are often bought
in bulk </p>

<p> quantities and discarded after being used for several months
or less in </p>

<p> order to thwart law enforcement telephone intercept efforts. </p>

<p> In general, the Medellin Cartel's method of operation in the
United </p>

<p> States is not as compartmentalized as that of the Cali
Cartel. The drug </p>

<p> trafficking groups, which comprise the Medellin Cartel,
employ a group </p>

<p> decision-making process at the top level as opposed to the
hierarchical </p>

<p> decision-making process employed by the Cali Cartel. At the
lower </p>

<p> levels, trafficking groups can transact business with less
restrictions </p>

<p> on their choice of business associates. </p>

<p> Peruvian traffickers reportedly ship cocaine concealed in
maritime </p>

<p> vessels and aircraft to the United States and distribute it
in the </p>

<p> Houston area independent of Colombian organizations. The use
of Peru as </p>

<p> a source area for multiton shipments of cocaine was evidenced
during </p>

<p> January 1992 by the seizure of five metric tons of cocaine
aboard a </p>

<p> maritime vessel. The vessel originated in Peru and was
reportedly </p>

<p> destined for the United States and Canada when it was
interdicted in the </p>

<p> Caribbean. </p>

<p> Hispanic organizations, particularly Colombian and Mexican,
continue to </p>

<p> dominate wholesale cocaine trafficking and distribution
within the </p>

<p> United States. However, since early 1992, diverse ethnic
groups, </p>

<p> including those of Middle Eastern, East European, Central
Asian, and </p>

<p> East Asian descent, have become involved in these activities
at all </p>

<p> levels of the domestic traffic. </p>

<p> Cocaine violators in urban areas, such as Boston and Atlanta,
have </p>

<p> expanded their distribution networks into rural areas, which
have </p>

<p> limited law enforcement resources, thereby reducing the risk
of </p>

<p> investigation and arrest. </p>

<p> MISCELLANEOUS </p>

<p> During 1992, the exchange of cocaine for heroin was reported
in Boston, </p>

<p> Calexico, New York City, and San Diego. The frequency of such
exchanges </p>

<p> appears to be increasing and involves foreign and domestic
heroin </p>

<p> traffickers seeking cocaine sources in the United States. In
addition, </p>

<p> during the past year, Southwest Asian heroin trafficking
organizations </p>

<p> sent heroin and opium via the international mail system to
affiliates in </p>

<p> the United States who then purchased cocaine for export to
Europe. </p>

<p> In 1992, four cocaine base conversion laboratories were
seized within </p>

<p> the United States; two in New York City, one in California
and one in </p>

<p> Florida. One of the laboratories seized in New York City was </p>

<p> operational. This represented the first functioning cocaine
laboratory </p>

<p> seized in that city since 1987. Additionally, the operational
New York </p>

<p> City laboratory used a vapor eliminating device. The device,
the first </p>

<p> encountered by DEA that employed dry ice, allowed the
laboratory to </p>

<p> function in a densely populated area without the strong
chemical odors </p>

<p> normally associated with clandestine cocaine conversion
laboratories. To </p>

<p> date in 1993, only one cocaine base conversion laboratory has
been </p>

<p> seized within the United States in Hurleyville, New York. </p>

<p> Drug traffickers use high-tech equipment, including
night-vision goggles </p>

<p> and radios with scramblers, as well as military hardware
including </p>

<p> assault rifles, hand grenades, and bulletproof vests.
Trafficking </p>

<p> organizations use scouts with radios to monitor law
enforcement </p>

<p> activities along the United States-Mexican border. A Texas
cocaine </p>

<p> organization recently attempted to purchase hand-held radios
for </p>

<p> surveillance and body armor for their street-level dealers.
Traffickers </p>

<p> have become more sophisticated in the use of electronics
including </p>

<p> scanners with police frequencies. </p>

<p> Countermeasures employed by cocaine traffickers against U.S.
law </p>

<p> enforcement include the use of counter-surveillance and paid
informants. </p>

<p> Some traffickers study law enforcement methods of operation
by reviewing </p>

<p> evidence documents during court proceedings. Reportedly,
defense </p>

<p> attorneys employed by traffickers obtain investigative
documents through </p>

<p> the &quot;right of the discovery process&quot; and then
transmit by facsimile </p>

<p> informational reports to Colombia. </p>

<p> CRACK COCAINE </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY </p>

<p> The simplicity of the crack conversion process allows any
person with </p>

<p> access to cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) to be a potential
source of crack. </p>

<p> Because cocaine HCl is plentiful and cheap and can be
obtained in </p>

<p> virtually every area of the country, crack is, therefore,
widely </p>

<p> available. </p>

<p> Crack is reported by drug epidemiologists and treatment
professionals to </p>

<p> be the illegal drug of choice in many U.S. cities. Notable
exceptions </p>

<p> include cities and towns along the southwest border, where
drug </p>

<p> traffickers are primarily concerned with transshipping the
large amounts </p>

<p> of cocaine HCl, marijuana, and heroin that are smuggled into
the United </p>

<p> States, and certain areas within several north-central and
northeastern </p>

<p> States that lack large ethnic minority communities,
traditional </p>

<p> strongholds for crack distribution and abuse. Nonetheless,
three Haitian </p>

<p> crack sellers were recently arrested in Portland, Maine,
indicating that </p>

<p> no region is immune to crack trafficking. </p>

<p> Crack distribution and use appear to have reached the
saturation point </p>

<p> in large urban areas throughout the country. Intensive
competition in </p>

<p> the mid-to-late 1980's inundated the largest consumer pools
with crack. </p>

<p> As a result, a number of crack trafficking groups have
relocated or </p>

<p> extended their operations to smaller cities, towns, and rural
areas; the </p>

<p> primary motivation for this is profit. Simply put, a rock or
vial of </p>

<p> crack that sells for $5 to $10 in a large, well-populated
area will </p>

<p> command a significantly higher price, usually $25 to $40 in a
smaller, </p>

<p> less populated area. </p>

<p> The national price for a rock or vial of crack ranges from as
low as $2 </p>

<p> to as high as $75 but it generally sells for $10 to $50,
depending upon </p>

<p> the size, normally 1/10 to 1/2 gram. In general, the larger
cities have </p>

<p> the lowest retail prices. Reporting from New York City
indicates a </p>

<p> dosage unit of crack sells for as low as two dollars, while a
single </p>

<p> puff on a crack pipe can be obtained for as little as 75
cents. </p>

<p> Reporting from Philadelphia and Detroit indicates that crack
can be </p>

<p> purchased for as low as $2.50 and $3.00 per dosage unit,
respectively. </p>

<p> Prices for gram quantities of crack generally range from $45
to $150 </p>

<p> nationally. At the ounce and kilogram level, crack prices are
comparable </p>

<p> to cocaine HCl prices and usually range from $475 to $2,500
per ounce </p>

<p> and from $17,000 to $35,000 per kilogram. </p>

<p> In the mid-to-late 1980's, a readily available supply of
inexpensive and </p>

<p> high quality crack at the retail level virtually eliminated
any need for </p>

<p> users to perform the crack conversion process themselves.
Indeed, </p>

<p> quality control was a major factor in marketing the drug.
Analysis of </p>

<p> crack samples by DEA laboratories revealed that purity was
consistently </p>

<p> high during that period, averaging 80-plus percent. </p>

<p> Although retail purity remains high, averaging almost 83
percent in </p>

<p> 1992, sellers in some areas of the country, such as New York,
Los </p>

<p> Angeles, and several cities in the Southeast, are selling
poor-quality </p>

<p> crack, cut with adulterants such as lidocaine and procaine.
These </p>

<p> adulterants increase the weight or the size of the crack and,
therefore, </p>

<p> the profits. Many retailers will sell recently prepared crack
that has </p>

<p> not been dried thoroughly and is still wet from the
conversion process. </p>

<p> This practice is most profitable when dealing in wholesale
quantities </p>

<p> where transactions are strictly determined by weight. At the
dosage unit </p>

<p> or retail level, where the size of the rock is of greater
concern, </p>

<p> procaine serves to increase the dimensions of the rock by
adding holes </p>

<p> or pockets of air, giving rise to the street term
&quot;blow-up.&quot; Obviously, </p>

<p> the smaller the amount of pure cocaine present in the rock,
the less </p>

<p> intense euphoric reaction the user will experience. In
addition, a </p>

<p> limited number of retailers are selling bogus or
&quot;beat&quot; crack to </p>

<p> unfamiliar customers because their regular customers consume
virtually </p>

<p> the entire supply. Substitutes include soap, chalk, plaster,
peanuts, </p>

<p> popcorn, and candle wax, which is known on the street as
&quot;perp.&quot; </p>

<p> Practices such as these are creating an increasing number of </p>

<p> dissatisfied and wary customers. An almost inexhaustible
supply of </p>

<p> cheap, high-purity cocaine HCl, combined with a relatively
simple and </p>

<p> safe production process, makes home conversion by the crack
user more </p>

<p> appealing than the risk of purchasing and smoking low-quality
or sham </p>

<p> crack. In fact, sellers in some northeastern cities sell two
qualities </p>

<p> of cocaine HCl, a high-purity powder for users who will
perform the </p>

<p> conversion to crack themselves, and a low-purity powder for
ingestion </p>

<p> through snorting only. It has also been reported that users
in Chicago </p>

<p> prefer the freebase method of conversion in the belief that
this method </p>

<p> yields a higher purity product than the crack conversion
process. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992 showed
that the </p>

<p> number of lifetime, past-year and past-month users of crack
declined </p>

<p> significantly from 1991 to 1992. The highest percentages of
crack use </p>

<p> were among those who were disproportionately represented in </p>

<p> socioeconomic groups that have historically faced increased
health </p>

<p> risks, including African-Americans, the unemployed, and
high-school </p>

<p> dropouts, as well as young adults aged 18 to 34. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Survey on Drug
Abuse, </p>

<p> lifetime use of crack among high school seniors declined from
1991 to </p>

<p> 1992; however, past-year, past-month, and daily use of crack
by this </p>

<p> group remained relatively stable during that period.
Nevertheless, </p>

<p> overall frequency of crack use among high school seniors has
decreased </p>

<p> substantially since 1987. </p>

<p> Of particular concern is the slight rise in frequency of
crack use among </p>

<p> 8th graders. From 1991 to 1992, survey data indicate that an
increasing </p>

<p> number of 8th grade students had used crack during their
lifetime as </p>

<p> well as on a yearly and monthly basis. Also, fewer 8th
graders in 1992 </p>

<p> associated great risk of harm with occasional crack use than
did 8th </p>

<p> graders in 1991. </p>

<p> TRAFFICKING </p>

<p> Trafficking/Distribution Levels </p>

<p> Crack trafficking is conducted at three broad levels, namely,
wholesale </p>

<p> trafficking, mid-level distribution, and retail selling. It
must be </p>

<p> emphasized that these classifications are not concrete and
the </p>

<p> activities of a specific violator or group may vary. For
example, as </p>

<p> will be explained later, the functions of a Jamaican posse
may encompass </p>

<p> all three levels within the same organization. </p>

<p> Wholesale Trafficking: Crack traffickers purchase cocaine HCl
in </p>

<p> kilogram or multikilogram allotments from traditional cocaine
HCl </p>

<p> sources, including Colombians and Mexicans. The wholesale
traffickers </p>

<p> will either package the cocaine HCl into ounce quantities or
convert it </p>

<p> into crack themselves and then divide it into ounces for sale
at the </p>

<p> next level. Wholesalers usually represent large groups that
are </p>

<p> responsible for the majority of the interstate transportation
of crack </p>

<p> and cocaine HCl intended for crack conversion. </p>

<p> The higher levels of crack trafficking are controlled by many
small (up </p>

<p> to 10 members) and mid-sized (10 to 40 members) trafficking </p>

<p> organizations consisting of bands of individuals from
distinct ethnic </p>

<p> groups. The main participants involved in wholesale crack
trafficking </p>

<p> are Los Angeles-based street gangs, Jamaican posses, and
Haitian and </p>

<p> Dominican groups. Without exception, each of these groups
started out as </p>

<p> poly-drug traffickers, dealing primarily in marijuana and
cocaine HCl, </p>

<p> and continue to sell these drugs. Similarly, street-level
sellers often </p>

<p> sell retail units of other drugs in addition to crack. </p>

<p> Mid-level Distribution: Distributors further divide the
ounces of crack </p>

<p> into dosage units for sale at the retail level. If they
purchase cocaine </p>

<p> HCl, they can perform the conversion process easily
themselves. These </p>

<p> distributors often operate crack houses or manage
street-corner sales </p>

<p> locations and supervise up to 20 individual sellers.
Mid-level </p>

<p> distributors can be either members of larger groups or
independent </p>

<p> operators. </p>

<p> Retail-level Sales: Sellers carry dosage units of crack
totaling no more </p>

<p> than a few grams at any one time. Workers in crack houses
will sell </p>

<p> dosage units from the one or two ounces that are delivered by
the mid- </p>

<p> level distributors. Retailers are typically young males who
are </p>

<p> unemployed or destitute and many of them are crack addicts
themselves. </p>

<p> At the retail level, crack is sold by countless individual
sellers, </p>

<p> usually in inner-city sections of large metropolitan areas.
Upon arrest, </p>

<p> these retailers are almost immediately replaced. While crack
sellers and </p>

<p> users are present in virtually every ethnic community and
economic </p>

<p> group, the majority are from low-income, urban
African-American and </p>

<p> Hispanic neighborhoods. </p>

<p> Trafficking Networks </p>

<p> Over the past few years, crack trafficking has expanded from
the large </p>

<p> urban centers to smaller cities, towns, and rural areas
across the </p>

<p> United States. Major crack trafficking groups, such as the
Crips, the </p>

<p> Bloods, and Jamaicans, are successfully extending their
networks from </p>

<p> large cities, including Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, and New
York City, </p>

<p> to street corners and dwellings in virtually every State
including </p>

<p> Alaska and Hawaii. This is occurring primarily for two
reasons. First, </p>

<p> these groups are attempting to enlarge their customer pools
and increase </p>

<p> their potential profits; second, the threat of disruption by
law </p>

<p> enforcement pressure or aggressive competition has generated
the search </p>

<p> for less hostile environments. </p>

<p> Jamaican posses are making advances away from the traditional
</p>

<p> strongholds of Miami and New York City, targeting new crack
markets. </p>

<p> Areas witnessing increased posse activity include Dallas and
Kansas </p>

<p> City; Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia; and the
Florida </p>

<p> Panhandle. Jamaican posses reportedly have been distributing
crack as </p>

<p> far westward as south-central Los Angeles. In a similar
manner, the </p>

<p> Crips and the Bloods or their affiliates have been moving
eastward into </p>

<p> cities such as Birmingham, Denver, Detroit, Las Vegas, and
Phoenix, as </p>

<p> well as into West Coast cities such as Seattle. Recent
reports in the </p>

<p> media suggest that these gangs are also moving into New York
City. In </p>

<p> effect, posses and gangs have crisscrossed the nation with
crack- </p>

<p> trafficking networks. </p>

<p> When crack first became available in New York City, it was
sold by small </p>

<p> local bands of independent street sellers. Quite soon,
however, these </p>

<p> sellers were incorporated into the lowest level of large
organized </p>

<p> networks. The most successful groups increased their
membership by </p>

<p> adopting other gangs through strong-armed persuasion or
eliminated their </p>

<p> leadership altogether. As the groups grew larger, they
attracted more </p>

<p> law enforcement attention. In the late 1980's, New York
City's two </p>

<p> largest crack distribution organizations, Lido and Based
Balls, were </p>

<p> successfully dismantled by Federal, State, and local law
enforcement </p>

<p> agencies. </p>

<p> Currently, the larger groups in the United States are trying
to insulate </p>

<p> themselves from law enforcement detection by scaling down and
</p>

<p> streamlining their crack production and sales operations. The
tedious </p>

<p> and labor-intensive process of shaving off dosage unit size
rocks of </p>

<p> crack from larger chunks and packaging them in countless tiny
plastic </p>

<p> bags or vials in cumbersome factory style operations is ill
suited to </p>

<p> the clandestine nature of drug distribution. Recent
disruption of a </p>

<p> large number of organizations by law enforcement has created
a </p>

<p> distribution and sales system composed of many small groups
operating in </p>

<p> a limited number of neighborhoods. </p>

<p> Trafficking Groups </p>

<p> The major crack trafficking organizations consist of street
gangs, such </p>

<p> as the Crips and the Bloods, and groups of Jamaicans,
Haitians, and </p>

<p> Dominicans. They all use similar trafficking and distribution
techniques </p>

<p> and are engaged in interstate and intrastate transportation
of wholesale </p>

<p> amounts of crack and cocaine HCl. They also have the
knowledge, </p>

<p> experience, drug connections, manpower, and firepower to ply
their trade </p>

<p> over long distances. </p>

<p> The majority of the information contained in this section was
obtained </p>

<p> from the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law
Enforcement </p>

<p> Network Fifth Annual Conferences on International Caribbean
Organized </p>

<p> Crime held June 15-19, 1992, and June 29 through July 2,
1993, in </p>

<p> Baltimore. </p>

<p> Jamaicans: One of the most effective crack trafficking groups
in the </p>

<p> United States is the Jamaican posse. Posses consist of gangs
of Jamaican </p>

<p> immigrants, often illegal aliens, that are involved in many
criminal </p>

<p> activities other than drug trafficking, including robbery,
fraud, and </p>

<p> money laundering. From these activities, posses receive an
estimated one </p>

<p> billion dollars annually drug proceeds. </p>

<p> The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) estimates
that, </p>

<p> currently, there are approximately 35 posses operating in the
United </p>

<p> States with total membership numbering at least 11,000. Most
posses </p>

<p> maintain some type of link to the larger, more established
groups or </p>

<p> parent posses in New York City or Miami, such as the Shower,
Spangler, </p>

<p> Dunkirk, and Jungle posses. New York City is generally
considered to be </p>

<p> the hub of Jamaican posse activity. </p>

<p> Jamaican posses are extremely violent, competitive, and
individualistic. </p>

<p> As a result, the structure of Jamaican organized crime will
remain </p>

<p> fragmented, lacking disciplined organizations and alliances
which are </p>

<p> common characteristics of traditional organized crime. Also,
successful </p>

<p> prosecution by Federal authorities over the past several
years has </p>

<p> disrupted much of the organization and control of the most
prominent </p>

<p> posses that operated nationwide. As a result of these
factors, a large </p>

<p> number of newly named splinter groups have evolved under the
direction </p>

<p> of new posse bosses. </p>

<p> Jamaican posses are attempting to insulate themselves from
law </p>

<p> enforcement pressure and violent competition by distancing
themselves </p>

<p> from the often dangerous day-to-day operation of crack houses
and by </p>

<p> distributing larger amounts of cocaine, in effect simply
supplying those </p>

<p> same crack houses and street level distribution sites.
Jamaicans are </p>

<p> also initiating alliances with members of other ethnic drug
trafficking </p>

<p> groups. For example, Jamaicans have been attempting to
establish </p>

<p> connections with Colombian and Mexican wholesale suppliers of
cocaine in </p>

<p> order to eliminate middlemen and related additional costs.
Also, </p>

<p> Jamaicans have been employing other minorities such as
Haitians because </p>

<p> they are willing to work for less in the lower levels of the </p>

<p> distribution chain. </p>

<p> Jamaicans also are distributing other illegal drugs such as
heroin and </p>

<p> marijuana; a few have been able to realize higher profits
from heroin </p>

<p> distribution. Moreover, some Jamaicans have returned to
trafficking </p>

<p> marijuana because the Federal penalties for marijuana
trafficking are </p>

<p> less severe than those for crack and cocaine HCl, yet the
profit </p>

<p> potential is almost as high. </p>

<p> A common method of operation by Jamaican posses is termed
&quot;drip&quot; </p>

<p> trafficking. In an attempt to escape law enforcement efforts
and to </p>

<p> protect against seizure, loss, or theft by competitors,
Jamaican posses </p>

<p> do not stockpile large amounts of drugs and money; rather,
they move </p>

<p> smaller quantities more often and more quickly. </p>

<p> In their efforts to expand crack sales and increase profits,
Jamaican </p>

<p> posses are branching out to other cities and rural areas to
establish </p>

<p> new drug markets where competition from rival gangs and law
enforcement </p>

<p> activity is lessened. This migration has been observed in
Dallas, </p>

<p> Denver, Kansas City, Washington, D.C., and northern Florida. </p>

<p> The Southwest border area has seen a significant influx of
Jamaican </p>

<p> traffickers during the last five years because cocaine HCl
and marijuana </p>

<p> are much cheaper to purchase in that region of the country.
As a result, </p>

<p> they have set up storefronts, usually garages, hair salons,
or music </p>

<p> stores, to mask distribution outlets and to launder proceeds.
Since </p>

<p> weapons can be purchased for less in Texas than in other
southern </p>

<p> States, Jamaicans often use females to make straw purchases
of guns </p>

<p> which are then sent to New York and other cities in the
Northeast. </p>

<p> Drugs, proceeds, and weapons are all shipped to different
locations </p>

<p> using a variety of means. Commercial airlines have proven to
be an </p>

<p> effective method of transportation. When interdiction efforts
at </p>

<p> particular airports become prohibitive, couriers drive to
airports in </p>

<p> other cities to elude law enforcement. Buses, trains, and
rental </p>

<p> vehicles are also popular methods of shipment. False
compartments are </p>

<p> frequently built into vehicles for transportation of drugs,
money, and </p>

<p> weapons. Additionally, mail services such as United Parcel
Service and </p>

<p> Federal Express are used to ship drugs and profits for the
Jamaican </p>

<p> posses. </p>

<p> Dominicans: While some official estimates of the number of
Dominicans </p>

<p> living in New York City are as low as 350,000, ATF claims the
actual </p>

<p> number, including illegal aliens, may be closer to 1,000,000.
</p>

<p> The hierarchy of Dominican gangs is slightly different than
that of the </p>

<p> Jamaicans in that the Dominican bosses usually run their
networks from </p>

<p> the Dominican Republic directly, traveling to and from the
United States </p>

<p> as needed. Dominican gangs are always armed and employ modern
equipment </p>

<p> and techniques in their daily operations, including
walkie-talkies, </p>

<p> &quot;kel&quot; transmitting devices, booby traps (to protect
drugs and money from </p>

<p> police action as well as from theft by competitors), and use
of counter- </p>

<p> surveillance, which they practiced in the Dominican Republic
in order to </p>

<p> elude the police. </p>

<p> Like the Jamaican posses, the Dominican traffickers are very
violent and </p>

<p> competitive and, as a result, do not easily form tightly
structured and </p>

<p> disciplined organizations. Although some reports suggest the
emergence </p>

<p> of a Dominican drug cartel, no evidence has been brought
forth to verify </p>

<p> the existence of an organization capable of orchestrating
large-scale </p>

<p> importation and trafficking activities. However, this
eventuality should </p>

<p> not be dismissed because, since the early 1980's, the
Dominican Republic </p>

<p> has been used by Colombians as a refueling and transshipment
point for </p>

<p> drugs destined for the United States and cooperation between
Colombian </p>

<p> and Dominican traffickers has flourished. </p>

<p> Dominicans have made gains in establishing money-laundering
operations </p>

<p> and front companies, most commonly travel agencies and check
cashing </p>

<p> businesses. At times, they purchase businesses outright or
make deals </p>

<p> with the owners or proprietors to carry out their orders. It
is not </p>

<p> known to what extent drug proceeds are sent directly to the
Dominican </p>

<p> Republic. Overall money transfers are estimated to be
approximately $800 </p>

<p> million per year. </p>

<p> Haitians: Haitian drug traffickers in the United States have
been able </p>

<p> to strengthen their status in the drug trade through two
significant </p>

<p> events. First, an influx of Haitian immigrants since the
early 1970's </p>

<p> has provided a large pool of recruits for the drug trade.
Second, by the </p>

<p> late 1980's, Haiti had become an important way station for
cocaine HCl </p>

<p> shipped into the United States by the Colombian cartels. </p>

<p> At present, Haitian crack traffickers operate in a limited
number of </p>

<p> major cities, primarily Miami and New York, and have not
extended their </p>

<p> operations as the Jamaicans have. Many Haitian sellers are
moving their </p>

<p> way up the distribution hierarchy by working at the lower
levels of </p>

<p> crack operations run by other ethnic groups. </p>

<p> Street Gangs: Street gangs, operating under the umbrella
names of the </p>

<p> Crips and the Bloods, extended their networks from the
streets of Los </p>

<p> Angeles to many major American cities in the last half of the
1980's. </p>

<p> Sales of crack and cocaine HCl brought them power and
influence during </p>

<p> that time. Gang members learned quickly that the cheap
cocaine available </p>

<p> in Los Angeles could be sold as cocaine HCl or crack at great
profit in </p>

<p> other parts of the country. </p>

<p> Los Angeles street gangs are very loosely organized in small
units or </p>

<p> &quot;sets&quot; falling under the auspices of the two
predominant gangs, the </p>

<p> Crips and the Bloods. The general street gang structure
begins with </p>

<p> diverse groups of gang members acting as street-level sellers
conducting </p>

<p> transactions in amounts up to several grams or even ounces on
the street </p>

<p> or in rock houses. A few of these sellers rise to become
mid-level </p>

<p> distributors, dealing in amounts of up to one kilogram or
more and </p>

<p> working between the street-level sellers and the major
traffickers. </p>

<p> Capable of brokering multimillion dollar deals, the major
traffickers, </p>

<p> often referred to as &quot;high rollers,&quot; are not
usually visible gang </p>

<p> members and often have direct contacts with Colombian
wholesale cocaine </p>

<p> suppliers. </p>

<p> Initially, gangs sold marijuana and PCP prior to entering
into cocaine </p>

<p> HCl and crack trafficking, distribution, and sales.
Eventually, they </p>

<p> developed a mode of operation that closely resembles the
Jamaican model. </p>

<p> Typically, gang members travel to and establish crack
operations in </p>

<p> smaller cities and towns where there is little police
pressure and </p>

<p> competition from rivals. They often gain entry into a
community by </p>

<p> visiting or living with friends or relatives. In addition to
securing </p>

<p> lodgings, these visits provide access to young people,
potential </p>

<p> recruits and customers, and help them attain legitimacy and
acceptance </p>

<p> within the community. Soon, the gang members will seek out in
many </p>

<p> instances low-income single mothers and offer them $100 a day
to use </p>

<p> their apartment or house as a crack conversion or
distribution site. A </p>

<p> common marketing technique known as &quot;double up&quot; is
used by these street </p>

<p> gangs to attract new customers and involves the sale of two
dosage units </p>

<p> of crack for the price of one. </p>

<p> Sales Locations </p>

<p> With few exceptions, crack distribution takes place either in
urban or </p>

<p> suburban dwellings of all types or at inner-city street
corner </p>

<p> locations. Virtually every large city in America has seen the
emergence </p>

<p> of both of these retail sales locations. The prevalence of
one site over </p>

<p> the other may be directly linked to two factors. </p>

<p> First, weather plays a major role in determining the chosen
method of </p>

<p> crack distribution. For example, in cities with cold winters,
sellers </p>

<p> will set up crack houses to escape the elements themselves
and to offer </p>

<p> customers more hospitable accommodations. In summer, the
operation may </p>

<p> be moved outdoors where increased pedestrian traffic provides
the </p>

<p> necessary cover for street corner sales. </p>

<p> Second, the presence of significant law enforcement activity
may force </p>

<p> street corner retailers to set up indoor crack facilities to
evade </p>

<p> detection. Conversely, if gangs are suffering substantial
losses due to </p>

<p> police raids on established crack houses, they may dispatch
sellers to </p>

<p> specific, pre-designated street corner sales locations. </p>

<p> The sale of crack at street corner locations is considered to
be ideal </p>

<p> because it provides sellers many avenues of escape when faced
with </p>

<p> police pressure. If a particular street becomes too
&quot;hot&quot; with police </p>

<p> activity, the retailers merely move a few blocks away and
continue </p>

<p> selling. Moreover, tactics can be employed to mask street
corner sales </p>

<p> of crack. In New York City, crack distributors have been
known to </p>

<p> dispatch a seller along with up to 10 people dressed exactly
alike to </p>

<p> work a street corner in an attempt to disrupt surveillance
efforts. In </p>

<p> addition, street corner operations do not require
expenditures for rent </p>

<p> and utilities, as is the case with crack houses. </p>

<p> HEROIN </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY </p>

<p> Within the United States, heroin is readily available in all
major </p>

<p> metropolitan areas having user populations. During 1992 and
the first </p>

<p> few months of 1993, there was an increase in purity
nationwide at the </p>

<p> retail level and increased supplies available from Southwest
Asia. (It </p>

<p> should be noted that high purity heroin has been imported
from Colombia </p>

<p> in increasing quantities in the past year. This heroin from
Colombia, </p>

<p> which underwent signature analysis prior to DEA's development
of a South </p>

<p> American heroin signature in July 1993, was analyzed as
having a </p>

<p> Southwest Asian (SWA) signature. As a result, it may account
in part for </p>

<p> both the increased purity and quantity of SWA heroin in the
United </p>

<p> States.) At present, street-level purity, the key indicator
of </p>

<p> availability, is at high levels, particularly in the
northeastern </p>

<p> metropolitan areas. </p>

<p> Heroin from every major source area is available in the
United States, </p>

<p> which is the most lucrative wholesale and retail level heroin
market in </p>

<p> the world. The origin of heroin smuggled into the United
States and the </p>

<p> proportion from each source area is tracked by DEA's Heroin
Signature </p>

<p> Program (HSP). Each year an in-depth chemical analysis is
performed on </p>

<p> 600 to 800 samples taken from heroin seizures and purchases
made in the </p>

<p> United States. The samples selected for signature analysis
include all </p>

<p> DEA seizures at U.S. points of entry and other
seizures/purchases </p>

<p> selected at random from DEA, in addition to Federal Bureau of
</p>

<p> Investigation, and U.S. Customs Service seizures and
purchases. As a </p>

<p> result of signature analysis, DEA chemists are able to
associate the </p>

<p> heroin sample with a heroin manufacturing process unique to a
particular </p>

<p> geographic source area. The proportion of samples associated
with each </p>

<p> geographic area is measured both in terms of the number of
samples from </p>

<p> each geographic source area and, since 1989, the net weight
of the </p>

<p> heroin samples from each area. </p>

<p> In 1991, Southeast Asia (SEA) was the prevalent source area
for heroin </p>

<p> in the United States for the fourth year in a row, accounting
for 58 </p>

<p> percent of the heroin samples analyzed through the HSP. SWA
heroin and </p>

<p> Mexican source heroin accounted for half of the remaining
samples with </p>

<p> 21 percent apiece. In 1992, the results of the HSP were
skewed by the </p>

<p> introduction of a number of samples of purported Colombian
heroin. </p>

<p> Because a specific signature for heroin from Colombia was not
available </p>

<p> then, most heroin samples of alleged Colombian origin are
analyzed as </p>

<p> having a Southwest Asian signature. With this in mind,
preliminary HSP </p>

<p> figures for 1992 reflect that 44 percent of the heroin
samples analyzed </p>

<p> were from Southeast Asia, 39 percent from Southwest Asia or
Colombia, </p>

<p> and the remaining 17 percent from Mexico. </p>

<p> Signature analysis also reveals that SEA heroin accounted for
88 percent </p>

<p> of the total net weight of the heroin samples analyzed in
1991, and 58 </p>

<p> percent in 1992. SWA heroin (including heroin from Colombia)
accounted </p>

<p> for nine and 32 percent of the total net weight of the heroin
samples </p>

<p> analyzed in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Mexican heroin
accounted for </p>

<p> three percent of the total net weight in 1991 and 10 percent
in 1992. </p>

<p> U.S. airports, particularly New York's JFK International
Airport, are </p>

<p> primary entry points for heroin shipments destined for the
U.S. market. </p>

<p> The HSP shows that 91 percent (454 out of 498) of the heroin
seizures </p>

<p> that took place at the U.S. border and points of entry during
1992 </p>

<p> occurred at airports, and that over 75 percent of the airport
seizures </p>

<p> occurred at New York's JFK International Airport. The
nationwide average </p>

<p> net weight airport seizure was almost 800 grams and the
average purity </p>

<p> of the heroin seized at these airports was 73 percent. </p>

<p> Nationally, in 1992, a kilogram of SEA heroin sold for
$90,000 to </p>

<p> $250,000. In the northeastern United States, SEA heroin is
also commonly </p>

<p> sold in units (700 grams), which sell for $90,000 to
$115,000. The price </p>

<p> for SWA heroin ranged from $80,000 to $200,000 per kilogram.
Wholesale </p>

<p> level prices for Mexican heroin were the lowest of any type
of heroin </p>

<p> and ranged from $50,000 to $150,000. The wide range in the
price of a </p>

<p> kilogram reflects several variables including buyer/seller
relationship, </p>

<p> quantity purchased, purchase frequency, purity, and
transportation </p>

<p> costs. Numerous and diverse foreign sources of supply also
account for </p>

<p> the wide variances. </p>

<p> At the mid-level of the traffic, where dealers sell
quantities ranging </p>

<p> from an ounce to multiounces, SEA heroin and SWA heroin sold
for $5,500 </p>

<p> to $12,000 per ounce. Mexican black tar heroin sold for
between $1,800 </p>

<p> and $4,000 per ounce, and Mexican brown powder heroin prices
ranged from </p>

<p> $ 1,000 to $ 1,800 per ounce. </p>

<p> Domestic prices for Colombian-source heroin are generally
compatible </p>

<p> with the prices for heroin from Southeast and Southwest Asia.
Kilogram </p>

<p> prices quoted in undercover negotiations range up to $150,000
and vary </p>

<p> depending on final point of delivery. In actual undercover
purchases of </p>

<p> smaller amounts, one-eighth of a kilogram cost $23,500,
one-fourth of a </p>

<p> kilogram cost $42,500, and one-half kilogram sold for
$62,250. </p>

<p> Heroin is sold at the retail level in the United States at
prices </p>

<p> ranging from $10 to $50 and in quantities ranging from 10 to
50 </p>

<p> milligrams. The retail price remains relatively constant at
this level </p>

<p> because retail-level purity, rather than retail-level price,
is adjusted </p>

<p> by the distributors to account for availability and to
manipulate profit </p>

<p> margins. </p>

<p> The HSP provides purity information on heroin shipments
smuggled into </p>

<p> the United States at the importation, or wholesale, level.
For all types </p>

<p> of heroin at this level, the nationwide average purity in
1992 was 64 </p>

<p> percent. SWA heroin was the purest form available at the
wholesale </p>

<p> level, averaging 72 percent. SEA heroin nationwide averaged
slightly </p>

<p> lower at 68 percent, while Mexican heroin averaged 33
percent. </p>

<p> At the retail level, purity is tracked by DEA's Domestic
Monitor Program </p>

<p> (DMP), a heroin purchase program designed to provide price,
purity, and </p>

<p> geographic source area data on heroin being distributed on
the streets </p>

<p> of U.S. cities. The program is conducted quarterly in one
city from each </p>

<p> of DEA's 19 field divisions and San Juan, Puerto Rico. </p>

<p> According to DMP data for 1992, the nationwide average purity
for retail </p>

<p> level heroin was 37 percent. This percentage was much higher
than the </p>

<p> average of 6.9 percent recorded a decade ago and also
considerably </p>

<p> higher than the average purity of 26.6 percent recorded in
1991. The </p>

<p> increase in average purity corresponded directly to an
increase in </p>

<p> availability of high purity SEA and SWA heroin. Although
Mexican heroin </p>

<p> has been traditionally of lower purity than other heroin
types in recent </p>

<p> years, it too increased in purity at the street level.
Street-level </p>

<p> purity of SWA heroin analyzed in the DMP during 1992 was the
highest for </p>

<p> all sources, averaging 55.8 percent, while Mexican heroin, at
25.6 </p>

<p> percent, almost doubled between 1991 and 1992. SEA heroin
remained </p>

<p> widely available in the northeastern United States with an
average </p>

<p> purity of 34.4 percent. </p>

<p> Heroin purity at the street level was generally highest in
the </p>

<p> northeastern United States, where a large percentage of the
nation's </p>

<p> user population lives. In New York City, one of the major
importation </p>

<p> and distribution centers for SEA and SWA heroin, the average
purity at </p>

<p> the street level for these types of heroin was, respectively,
54.3 </p>

<p> percent and 69.7 percent. Boston recorded the highest average
purity of </p>

<p> retail level heroin in all of the DMP cities with an average
of 73.7 </p>

<p> percent during 1992. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992
indicated a </p>

<p> decrease in the number of past-year heroin users. Survey data
show that </p>

<p> the number of Americans 12 years of age or older who have
used heroin at </p>

<p> least once in the past year declined from 381,000 in 1991 to
323,000 in </p>

<p> 1992. During that same time frame, however, the number of
past-month </p>

<p> heroin users increased from 83,000 to 107,000. The increase
in the </p>

<p> number of lifetime heroin users to 2,653,000 in 1991 appears
to have </p>

<p> been an anomaly, as the 1992 estimate has declined to
1,840,000. </p>

<p> (Estimates of heroin use from the Household Survey are
considered very </p>

<p> conservative due to the probable under coverage of the
population of </p>

<p> heroin users.) </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey on
Drug Abuse, </p>

<p> heroin use increased among high school seniors. Although 1.2
percent of </p>

<p> the seniors in the class of 1992 reported they had used
heroin at least </p>

<p> once in their lifetime, up from 0.9 percent in the class of
1991, it was </p>

<p> still below the peak of 1.3 percent reported in the classes
of 1989 and </p>

<p> 1990. Moreover, for the first time in recent years, there was
a </p>

<p> statistically significant decline among seniors in the
perceived risk of </p>

<p> harm associated with heroin use. </p>

<p> The National High School Survey also shows that lifetime
heroin use </p>

<p> among 8th graders increased from 1.2 percent in 1991 to 1.4
percent in </p>

<p> 1992, past year use remained steady, and past-month use
increased from a </p>

<p> 0.3 percent in 1991 to 0.4 percent in 1992. Among 10th
graders, both </p>

<p> lifetime and past-month use remained stable from 1991 to
1992, while </p>

<p> past-year heroin use increased form 0.5 percent to 0.6
percent. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
nationwide </p>

<p> heroin-related emergency room episodes, which had been
fluctuating </p>

<p> somewhat during the past several years, increased
substantially from the </p>

<p> first to second half of FY 1992. During that time frame, the
number of </p>

<p> heroin-related episodes rose from 18,192 to 24,593, an
increase of 35 </p>

<p> percent. Cities showing substantive increases during the
latter half of </p>

<p> FY 1992 in the number of heroin-related emergency room
episodes included </p>

<p> Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Seattle. </p>

<p> Possible explanations for the rising levels of heroin-related
emergency </p>

<p> room episodes have been provided by a number of drug
epidemiologists and </p>

<p> treatment specialists. Reports indicate that segments of the
crack </p>

<p> cocaine user population are using or switching to heroin as a
means to </p>

<p> mitigate the depressive effects associated with withdrawal
from crack. </p>

<p> There are additional reports of the appearance, in a limited
number of </p>

<p> areas, of new distributors attempting to establish markets as
well as </p>

<p> the growing involvement of youth gangs in the heroin traffic.
Moreover, </p>

<p> heroin is now being sold in white as well as African-American
and </p>

<p> Hispanic neighborhoods in a limited number of cities. In New
York City, </p>

<p> anecdotal information indicates that more teenagers and
females are </p>

<p> selling heroin than in the past. Lastly, there is a
perception among </p>

<p> some users that heroin is a safer drug than cocaine, while
certain </p>

<p> others consider heroin use to be &quot;cool.&quot; The latter
represents a radical </p>

<p> departure from previous attitudes toward heroin use. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the injection of
heroin </p>

<p> continues to be the predominant route of administration used
by patients </p>

<p> admitted to DAWN emergency rooms for heroin-related problems.
However, </p>

<p> the percentage of patients who indicated that injection was
their </p>

<p> primary route of administration has decreased from 79.1
percent in FY </p>

<p> 1989 to 73.9 percent in FY 1992. During this same time frame,
there was </p>

<p> an increase in the percentage of patients who snorted heroin.
Those who </p>

<p> snorted heroin rose from 4.8 percent in FY 1989 to 8.8
percent in FY </p>

<p> 1992. Increases in snorting are attributed, in part, to a
fear of </p>

<p> contracting AIDS through needle sharing and the availability
of high- </p>

<p> purity heroin on the street. </p>

<p> Opiate use (to include heroin) among recently booked
arrestees as </p>

<p> reported by the DUF Program remained relatively low and
stable in 1992 </p>

<p> when compared to rates for cocaine and marijuana. Cities
having the </p>

<p> highest percentage of positive urinalysis tests for heroin
among booked </p>

<p> male arrestees in the first half of 1992 were Chicago at 19
percent; New </p>

<p> York City at 18 percent; San Antonio at 15 percent; San Diego
at 16 </p>

<p> percent; Washington, D.C., at 11 percent; Los Angeles at 11
percent; and </p>

<p> Philadelphia at 12 percent. Female arrestees tested positive
at high </p>

<p> rates in New York City (24%), Portland (22%), Washington,
D.C., (19%), </p>

<p> San Diego (17%), Detroit (15%), Phoenix (15%), San Antonio
(14%), and </p>

<p> Los Angeles (13%). </p>

<p> TRAFFICKING </p>

<p> SEA Heroin Trafficking </p>

<p> Major SEA heroin trafficking organizations, often under the
control of </p>

<p> Sino-Thai and Chinese criminal groups, oversee the smuggling
of SEA </p>

<p> heroin into the United States. Chinese traffickers in the
United States </p>

<p> with links to these international criminal groups are the
most prolific </p>

<p> importers and distributors of heroin from Southeast Asia.
Chinese or </p>

<p> Thai nationals are often used to transport the heroin and are
generally </p>

<p> responsible for the largest bulk shipments, in the
multihundred kilogram </p>

<p> range, of SEA heroin smuggled into the United States. </p>

<p> Around 1986, these Chinese smuggling groups took over the
multibillion </p>

<p> dollar wholesale heroin trade that had been controlled for
over two </p>

<p> decades by Traditional Organized Crime groups in the United
States. Over </p>

<p> the next few years, ethnic Chinese traffickers flooded the
northeastern </p>

<p> United States, the largest heroin market in the country, with
bulk </p>

<p> shipments of high-purity SEA heroin. In recent years, these
highly </p>

<p> structured clandestine Chinese organizations have increased
the size and </p>

<p> number of heroin shipments to the United States. In the wake
of </p>

<p> increased availability, the layers of mid-level distributors
in the New </p>

<p> York City area were eliminated and Chinese wholesalers sold
directly to </p>

<p> Dominican street-level dealers, a development that resulted
in enhanced </p>

<p> heroin purity at the street level. </p>

<p> SEA heroin traffickers use a variety of transportation routes
to smuggle </p>

<p> heroin into the United States from the Far East. One of the
major routes </p>

<p> originates in Bangkok and terminates in New York City, the
largest </p>

<p> heroin importation and distribution center in the United
States. (Each </p>

<p> year since 1986, roughly half of DEA's nationwide seizures
occur in the </p>

<p> New York City metropolitan area.) Maritime cargo shipments
are the </p>

<p> primary transport method for smugglers using this route and
the </p>

<p> shipments may transit a variety of countries including Hong
Kong, Japan, </p>

<p> Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan. Many shipments
from the </p>

<p> Far East are also transshipped through Canada and then into
the </p>

<p> northeastern United States. Traffickers smuggle heroin
shipments aboard </p>

<p> commercial airlines originating in Bangkok and then transit
almost any </p>

<p> Asian city, as well as a number of cities in Europe and
Canada. In </p>

<p> addition to New York City, other U.S. cities in the
Northeast, including </p>

<p> Boston and Philadelphia, are also used as entry points.
Traffickers also </p>

<p> use West Coast cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and
Seattle as </p>

<p> entry points for heroin shipments destined for the Northeast.
</p>

<p> Chinese traffickers employ a variety of smuggling methods.
Generally, </p>

<p> the size of the heroin shipment determines the smuggling
method. The </p>

<p> largest shipments, ranging from 50- to multihundred-kilogram
quantities, </p>

<p> are secreted in containerized freight aboard commercial
marine vessels </p>

<p> and air freight cargo. Smaller shipments are concealed in the
luggage of </p>

<p> airline passengers, strapped to the body, or swallowed. SEA
heroin </p>

<p> smugglers also use the mails and delivery services to
transport </p>

<p> multigram to kilogram quantities into the country. </p>

<p> Traffickers using commercial cargo originating in source
countries </p>

<p> frequently attempt to disguise the origin of the cargo
shipment by first </p>

<p> transshipping containers through several other countries or
by </p>

<p> falsifying the container documentation. In 1992, 35 kilograms
of heroin, </p>

<p> which were shipped from Singapore concealed in ceramic tiles,
were </p>

<p> seized in Newark, New Jersey. In May 1991, the largest heroin
seizure in </p>

<p> U.S. history occurred near Oakland, California, when 494
kilograms of </p>

<p> SEA heroin were seized from a commercial cargo of plastic
bags aboard a </p>

<p> merchant vessel. The shipment originated in Thailand and was </p>

<p> transshipped through Taiwan prior to importation into the
United States. </p>

<p> In addition to the Chinese and Sino-Thai traffickers,
Nigerians remain </p>

<p> deeply entrenched in the smuggling of SEA heroin. Nigerian
traffickers </p>

<p> dispatch large numbers of internal body couriers traveling
aboard </p>

<p> commercial airlines bound for the United States. These
&quot;swallowers,&quot; </p>

<p> including Nigerians as well as other nationalities recruited
as </p>

<p> couriers, can smuggle up to two-kilogram amounts of SEA
heroin per trip. </p>

<p> Moreover, recent reporting suggests that a number of Nigerian
</p>

<p> trafficking groups are experimenting with smuggling larger </p>

<p> (multikilogram) shipments of heroin concealed in commercial
maritime </p>

<p> cargo. </p>

<p> Most Nigerian organizations are based in Lagos, Nigeria.
Since they are </p>

<p> formed along tribal lines at the senior levels, the
organizations are </p>

<p> close-knit. Drug barons who control the Nigerian
organizations remain </p>

<p> well-insulated by directing lower-level traffickers to
recruit the </p>

<p> numerous couriers, often non-Nigerians, and to organize
travel to the </p>

<p> United States. In 1992, Nigerians returned almost all profits
generated </p>

<p> in the United States to Lagos, Nigeria, or to Europe for
laundering. </p>

<p> As a result of enforcement pressure, Nigerians continue to
recruit other </p>

<p> ethnic groups, including other West Africans, Europeans, and
American </p>

<p> citizens, as heroin couriers. New York's JFK International
Airport was </p>

<p> the entry point used most frequently by Nigerian trafficking </p>

<p> organizations in 1992. However, during the past year,
Nigerian </p>

<p> traffickers diversified both the smuggling routes used to
reach the </p>

<p> United States and their points of entry into the country. For
example, </p>

<p> West Africans, in all likelihood controlled by Nigerians,
made a limited </p>

<p> number of attempts to smuggle heroin through entry points
along the </p>

<p> United States Southwest border and the Canadian border during
1992. </p>

<p> Nigerians have established heroin distribution networks in
U.S. cities </p>

<p> with well-established Nigerian populations such as Atlanta,
Baltimore, </p>

<p> Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Newark, New York, and Washington,
D.C. These </p>

<p> networks are capable of supplying heroin ranging from
100-gram to </p>

<p> multikilogram quantities on a regular basis. During 1992,
reporting from </p>

<p> a DEA investigation in Dallas indicated that Nigerian heroin
traffickers </p>

<p> collaborated with members of Jamaican posses in distributing
heroin from </p>

<p> Jamaican-controlled crack houses in Dallas and hired posse
members as </p>

<p> enforcers to protect Nigerian operations. </p>

<p> SWA Heroin Trafficking </p>

<p> SWA heroin in the United States increased in availability and
purity </p>

<p> during 1992 and the first few months of 1993. While some of
the rise in </p>

<p> purity levels for SWA heroin is in all likelihood
attributable to the </p>

<p> influx of high-purity heroin from Colombia, investigative
reporting and </p>

<p> laboratory analysis show that traditional SWA heroin
traffickers are </p>

<p> also smuggling a purer form of heroin into the United States.
</p>

<p> Importation and distribution of SWA heroin is much less
centralized than </p>

<p> that for SEA heroin, both geographically and in regard to
trafficking </p>

<p> groups. A number of ethnic groups from Southwest Asia, the
Middle East, </p>

<p> and Europe are active in smuggling SWA heroin into the United
States, </p>

<p> and its distribution; these ethnic groups include Afghans,
Greeks, </p>

<p> Iranians, Israelis, Lebanese, Pakistanis, and Turks. SWA
heroin is </p>

<p> transported to the United States directly from producing
countries, as </p>

<p> well as transshipped through Europe and Africa. Significant
quantities </p>

<p> of SWA heroin bound for the United States are also
transshipped through </p>

<p> the Canadian cities of Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver.
Although New </p>

<p> York City is a major SWA heroin importation and distribution
center, </p>

<p> heroin is also smuggled into and distributed throughout the
Northeast; </p>

<p> in Mid-Atlantic cities such as Baltimore and Washington,
D.C.; in some </p>

<p> cities on the West Coast such as Los Angeles, San Diego, and
San </p>

<p> Francisco; in some Midwestern cities including Chicago and
Detroit; and </p>

<p> in Puerto Rico. Other points of entry for SWA heroin include
Houston and </p>

<p> Miami. </p>

<p> Most SWA heroin trafficking groups in the United States are
highly </p>

<p> cohesive and difficult to penetrate because they are based on
ethnic, </p>

<p> familial, and tribal relationships. SWA heroin importers and
wholesale </p>

<p> level distributors generally are very cautious and rarely
transact with </p>

<p> outsiders. As a result, SWA heroin trafficking and
distribution are </p>

<p> generally more prevalent in cities that have large
populations from </p>

<p> Afghanistan, Greece, Lebanon, Pakistan, and Turkey, such as
Chicago, </p>

<p> Detroit, and New York City. </p>

<p> SWA heroin traffickers rely less on commercial cargo as a
smuggling </p>

<p> method than their counterparts from Southeast Asia.
Generally, SWA </p>

<p> heroin traffickers, unlike Chinese traffickers, do not
smuggle heroin on </p>

<p> a large scale, such as multiple bulk shipments. However, they
are able </p>

<p> to regularly smuggle shipments ranging from one to 20
kilograms and, on </p>

<p> occasion, larger amounts. Many SWA heroin trafficking
organizations use </p>

<p> commercial cargo and couriers aboard commercial airlines to
smuggle one </p>

<p> to five kilograms on a steady basis. However, several
organizations are </p>

<p> capable of smuggling from five- to 10 kilogram shipments
aboard maritime </p>

<p> vessels on a fairly regular basis. </p>

<p> Pakistani traffickers, who smuggle SWA heroin, control
importation </p>

<p> routes into the United States and distribution networks in
New York City </p>

<p> and other cities in the East and Midwest. This heroin is
occasionally </p>

<p> transshipped through California as well. Pakistani
traffickers are adept </p>

<p> at developing new smuggling techniques and unique concealment
methods, </p>

<p> such as specially designed vests with pockets to conceal
heroin, which </p>

<p> are worn underneath the clothes of couriers on airlines. </p>

<p> Pakistanis regularly transact business with Afghan and Indian
</p>

<p> traffickers, and other ethnic groups from Southwest and South
Asia. Some </p>

<p> Nigerians still smuggle and distribute SWA heroin but most
are now more </p>

<p> active in trafficking SEA heroin. </p>

<p> Lebanese trafficking groups appear to be increasing their
level of </p>

<p> smuggling into and distribution in the United States,
particularly in </p>

<p> Boston, Detroit, and New York, cities with large Lebanese
communities. </p>

<p> Moreover, some SWA heroin originally destined for the
European market is </p>

<p> now smuggled into the United States because Lebanese
traffickers, in an </p>

<p> effort to maximize profit margins, are exchanging SWA heroin
for cocaine </p>

<p> with Colombian cocaine organizations. (At the wholesale
level, heroin </p>

<p> prices in the United States are higher than in Europe, while
cocaine </p>

<p> prices in Europe are higher than in the United States.) </p>

<p> Mexican Heroin Trafficking </p>

<p> Mexican heroin, in brown powder form as well as the more
widely </p>

<p> available black tar form, is produced almost exclusively for
the U.S. </p>

<p> heroin market. The smuggling and distribution of Mexican
heroin to and </p>

<p> within the United States is controlled by organizations
composed of </p>

<p> Mexican nationals and Mexican-Americans. Mexican trafficking </p>

<p> organizations are often made up of family members, lifelong
friends, and </p>

<p> other trusted associates. </p>

<p> While some Mexican organizations control the entire process
from opium </p>

<p> production and heroin processing in Mexico to the management
of </p>

<p> transportation and distribution networks in the United
States, other </p>

<p> trafficking organizations operate independently on a smaller
scale. </p>

<p> Mexico's extensive land border with the United States
provides smugglers </p>

<p> numerous entry points into the country. Heroin is smuggled
across the </p>

<p> U.S. Southwest border in relatively small amounts, most often
ranging </p>

<p> from gram- to multiounce quantities, by large numbers of
illegal </p>

<p> immigrants and migrant workers. Occasionally, there are large
seizures, </p>

<p> such as the April 1993 seizure of approximately 10 kilograms
of black </p>

<p> tar heroin at Blythe, California, but such amounts are the
exception. </p>

<p> Generally, Mexican heroin seizures do not exceed one or two
kilograms. </p>

<p> The use of numerous couriers to smuggle relatively small
quantities of </p>

<p> Mexican heroin is characteristic of the smuggling methods
employed by </p>

<p> Mexican heroin traffickers. These traffickers take advantage
of their </p>

<p> close proximity to the United States by stockpiling the
larger </p>

<p> quantities of heroin in Mexico and then smuggling smaller
amounts as </p>

<p> transactions in the United States are arranged. Most
traffickers believe </p>

<p> their heroin stockpiles are less susceptible to law
enforcement in </p>

<p> Mexico, and by storing heroin there they minimize the danger
of U.S. </p>

<p> authorities seizing significant amounts of heroin. According
to </p>

<p> investigative reporting, even large poly-drug Mexican
organizations, </p>

<p> which are capable of smuggling multiton quantities of cocaine
and </p>

<p> marijuana, limit smuggling of Mexican heroin into the United
States to </p>

<p> kilogram and smaller amounts. </p>

<p> Traffickers who distribute Mexican heroin within the United
States are </p>

<p> generally Mexican immigrants, primarily from the States of
Durango, </p>

<p> Michoacan, Nuevo Leon, and Sinaloa. Mexican organizations
control </p>

<p> distribution at the wholesale level but are not generally
involved in </p>

<p> street sales which are often managed by local gangs. </p>

<p> Smuggling methods include concealment in motor vehicles,
public </p>

<p> transportation vehicles, internal and external body carry,
and </p>

<p> commercial package express services. Females are used much
more </p>

<p> frequently than males as couriers for transporting heroin and
money </p>

<p> across the border. </p>

<p> Once the heroin is smuggled into the United States,
transportation is </p>

<p> arranged to metropolitan areas in the western and
southwestern States </p>

<p> where there are sizable populations of Mexican immigrants.
Heroin is </p>

<p> also transported to the Chicago, Denver, and St. Louis
metropolitan </p>

<p> areas, primary markets for Mexican heroin. In the United
States, Mexican </p>

<p> black tar heroin is usually sold by the &quot;piece&quot; or
Mexican ounce, which </p>

<p> weighs 25 grams. </p>

<p> Colombian Heroin Trafficking </p>

<p> The availability of heroin from Colombia increased in the
United States </p>

<p> during the latter half of 1992 and early 1993, according to
seizure </p>

<p> analysis and investigative reporting. While most evidence
suggests that </p>

<p> Colombian traffickers are still operating at a fairly low
level, the </p>

<p> potential of the Colombian heroin threat is serious,
primarily because </p>

<p> of the smuggling resources controlled by the Colombian
cocaine cartels. </p>

<p> At present, Colombian heroin traffickers are attempting to
establish </p>

<p> distribution outlets in the United States, particularly in
the </p>

<p> metropolitan areas of the Northeast, and, as a result, are
smuggling a </p>

<p> heroin of very high purity, generally 80-plus percent. The
high purity </p>

<p> is essential in order for the Colombian traffickers to break
into the </p>

<p> fiercely competitive retail heroin markets in Boston, Newark,
New York </p>

<p> City, and Philadelphia, where street level purity averages
over 50 </p>

<p> percent. Colombian heroin is also available in southern New
England </p>

<p> cities, such as Hartford and Bridgeport, Connecticut, and
Providence, </p>

<p> Rhode Island, where, according to reporting from the Boston
Field </p>

<p> Division, Cali Cartel cocaine networks are operating.
Currently, </p>

<p> significant investigations of Colombian heroin trafficking
organizations </p>

<p> are underway in Miami, Newark, New York City, San Diego, and
San Juan, </p>

<p> Puerto Rico. </p>

<p> Since 1991, most of the Colombian heroin smuggled into the
United States </p>

<p> has been transported by couriers aboard commercial airlines,
a method </p>

<p> requiring numerous couriers carrying amounts ranging up to a
kilogram </p>

<p> per trip. Colombian couriers commonly transport the heroin in
false- </p>

<p> sided briefcases and luggage, inside hollowed-out shoe soles,
or by </p>

<p> internal body carry methods. Much of this activity appears to
be the </p>

<p> work of smaller, independent Colombian traffickers, according
to </p>

<p> investigative reporting from the DEA Bogota Country Office. </p>

<p> According to the El Paso Intelligence Center, the number of
Colombian </p>

<p> couriers who were arrested on commercial airlines carrying
heroin into </p>

<p> the United States increased from 41 in 1991 to over 260 in
1992; most of </p>

<p> these seizures occurred at either Miami or New York's
international </p>

<p> airports. The majority of Colombian couriers arrested in
Miami confessed </p>

<p> to being en route to New York City or possessed follow-on
tickets for </p>

<p> that destination. Individuals with an end destination of
Miami were </p>

<p> often instructed to check into a local hotel and await
further </p>

<p> instructions. </p>

<p> The primary method of smuggling (ingestion) employed by
Colombian </p>

<p> traffickers and the seizure amounts (usually less than 500
grams) </p>

<p> indicate that Colombian traffickers presently are not able to
supply </p>

<p> heroin on the same scale as Chinese, Nigerian, or Southwest
Asian </p>

<p> traffickers. To date, the largest shipment seized involved a
June 1992 </p>

<p> airdrop of just under 15 kilograms of heroin on a Puerto
Rican beach; </p>

<p> this shipment may have been tied to the Colombian cocaine
cartels. </p>

<p> However, as the cocaine cartels become more involved in
heroin smuggling </p>

<p> and distribution, the seriousness of the threat will increase
</p>

<p> significantly, given their vast resources, control over
trafficking </p>

<p> routes, and access to a stable cocaine (crack) clientele in
the United </p>

<p> States. </p>

<p> CANNABIS </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/POTENCY </p>

<p> Marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance and by-product
of the </p>

<p> Cannabis sativa L. plant, remained the most commonly used
illegal drug </p>

<p> in the United States during 1992. Both the cannabis plant and
delta-9 </p>

<p> tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant's primary psycho-active
chemical, </p>

<p> are controlled substances. The flowering tops, also known as
colas or </p>

<p> buds, are valued because of their higher THC content. The
flowering tops </p>

<p> and leaves are collected, dried, and then smoked in a pipe or
as a </p>

<p> cigarette. Hashish, which is processed from cannabis, is also
valued to </p>

<p> a limited extent by some individuals in the United States. </p>

<p> Typically, 34 percent of a non-sinsemilla (pollinated) plant
contains </p>

<p> usable material (the leaf and bud components) and 58 percent
of a </p>

<p> sinsemilla (unpollinated female) plant contains usable
material. The </p>

<p> higher the plant density of the grow area, the lower the
yield of usable </p>

<p> material. In addition, the diameter of the plant is more
important than </p>

<p> the height for yield predictions. Indoor plants are generally
smaller </p>

<p> than outdoor plants due to space limitations. The average
plant yield </p>

<p> for mature, domestically grown sinsemilla is approximately
1.25 pounds </p>

<p> per plant. The average plant yield for mature, domestically
grown </p>

<p> commercial grade marijuana is approximately three-quarters of
one pound </p>

<p> per plant. </p>

<p> Marijuana prices have increased substantially over the past
decade. </p>

<p> Prices for a pound of commercial grade marijuana during the
early 1980's </p>

<p> ranged from $350 to $600, while in 1992 the cost ranged from
$300 to </p>

<p> $3,000. Sinsemilla with its inherently higher THC content,
ranged from </p>

<p> $1,000 to $2,000 ten years ago. In 1992, the price ranged
from $650 to </p>

<p> $9,600 per pound. Successful law enforcement efforts have
forced some </p>

<p> cultivators to move indoors. Cultivators have increasingly
moved indoors </p>

<p> to avoid detection and to exploit the profit potential of
potent </p>

<p> sinsemilla marijuana. Indoor growers cultivate sinsemilla
because the </p>

<p> higher THC content of sinsemilla permits growers to charge
higher </p>

<p> prices. Scarcity created by law enforcement operations has
also </p>

<p> increased prices in some areas. </p>

<p> Domestic cultivation trends of significance in recent years
include </p>

<p> cultivator efforts to enhance the potency of marijuana by
making use of </p>

<p> advanced agronomic practices such as hydroponics and cloning.
Such </p>

<p> techniques also involve the use of special fertilizers, plant
hormones, </p>

<p> steroids, and carbon monoxide. During the late 1970's and
early 1980's, </p>

<p> the THC content of commercial grade marijuana averaged under
two </p>

<p> percent. By comparison, the average in 1992 was 3.68 percent.
The </p>

<p> average THC content of sinsemilla in 1992 was 8.34 percent
which </p>

<p> compares to an average of approximately six percent in the
late 1970's </p>

<p> and early 1980's. Moreover, in February 1993, a new U.S.
record was </p>

<p> recorded for the highest concentration of THC analyzed in a
marijuana </p>

<p> sample. The sample had a THC content of 29.86 percent which
is nearly 32 </p>

<p> percent higher than the previous record of 22.67 percent
reported during </p>

<p> 1992. The record high THC content of this sample is an
indicator of the </p>

<p> continuing trend by indoor growers to produce higher potency
marijuana </p>

<p> over recent years. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse, </p>

<p> approximately 67.5 million Americans have tried marijuana at
least once </p>

<p> in their lifetime. Of these, approximately 2.2 million were
from 12 to </p>

<p> 17 years of age, nearly 13.5 million were from 18 to 25 years
of age, </p>

<p> and almost 52 million were 26 years of age and older. Of the
17.4 </p>

<p> million people who used marijuana at least once in the past
year, nine </p>

<p> million used the drug once a month during 1992, and 5.2
million used it </p>

<p> once a week or more. Survey data also indicate that the
frequency of </p>

<p> marijuana use has declined substantially from 1985 to 1992.
Overall, </p>

<p> past-year, past-month and past-week use of the drug have
diminished by </p>

<p> nearly 45 percent during that time frame. </p>

<p> According to the National High School Senior Survey on Drug
Abuse, the </p>

<p> long-term decline in the use of marijuana among seniors
continued in </p>

<p> 1992. However, there was also a decrease in the proportion of
that </p>

<p> population who believed there was a &quot;great risk&quot; of
harm associated with </p>

<p> regular marijuana use, possibly presaging a reversal of the
downward use </p>

<p> pattern. In addition, among 8th graders, lifetime, past-year,
and past- </p>

<p> month use of marijuana marginally increased from 1991 to
1992. Moreover, </p>

<p> 8th graders in the class of 1992 were less likely to view
marijuana use </p>

<p> as dangerous compared to 8th graders in the class of 1991.
Also, the </p>

<p> proportion of 8th graders who personally disapproved of
marijuana use </p>

<p> declined from 1991 to 1992. These shifts in perception may
explain the </p>

<p> increased use of marijuana among 8th graders. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan area </p>

<p> marijuana-related emergency room episodes, which had declined
from FY </p>

<p> 1989 to FY 1991, increased once again during FY 1992. In
fact, the </p>

<p> number of marijuana-related emergency room episodes rose from
9,231 in </p>

<p> FY 1991 to 12,108 in FY 1992, an increase of more than 30
percent. DAWN </p>

<p> reporting also shows that nearly one-half of the patients
treated for </p>

<p> cannabis-related hospital emergency room episodes during the
first six </p>

<p> months of 1992 were under 26 years of age; approximately 70
percent of </p>

<p> these patients were male. The large majority, approximately
80 percent, </p>

<p> used marijuana in combination with other substances. Patients
most </p>

<p> frequently used marijuana in combination with alcohol. The
next most </p>

<p> common combination involved the use of marijuana with
cocaine. </p>

<p> Marijuana use among recently booked male arrestees as
reported by the </p>

<p> DUF Program increased in many major U.S. cities in 1992. The
highest </p>

<p> levels of marijuana use were reported in Omaha, where 38
percent of the </p>

<p> sampled population tested positive through urinalysis. In
Indianapolis, </p>

<p> the figure was 35 percent; in San Diego, 35 percent; in
Denver, 34 </p>

<p> percent; in Ft. Lauderdale, 32 percent; and in Miami, 30
percent. </p>

<p> Marijuana use among recently booked female arrestees also
increased in </p>

<p> many cities. In Indianapolis, 26 percent of the female
arrestees sampled </p>

<p> tested positive for the use of marijuana; in San Diego, 25
percent; in </p>

<p> Dallas, 24 percent; in Ft. Lauderdale, 21 percent; in Denver,
19 </p>

<p> percent; and in Kansas City, 18 percent. </p>

<p> TRAFFICKING </p>

<p> Mexico accounted for most of the foreign marijuana available
in the </p>

<p> United States during 1992. Mexican marijuana is smuggled into
the </p>

<p> southwestern United States by vehicles, private aircraft,
armed </p>

<p> backpackers, and horse or mule caravans. Colombia ranks as a
distant </p>

<p> second behind Mexico as a foreign source of marijuana.
Colombian </p>

<p> marijuana is smuggled into the United States by noncommercial
vessels </p>

<p> using traditional maritime routes. Jamaican traffickers have
increased </p>

<p> marijuana shipments since January 1992. Jamaican marijuana is
smuggled </p>

<p> into the United States by private and commercial aircraft,
and maritime </p>

<p> vessels. </p>

<p> DOMESTIC CULTIVATION/ERADICATION </p>

<p> An estimated 6,000 to 6,500 metric tons of cannabis were
cultivated in </p>

<p> the United States during 1992. During that year,
approximately 3,405 </p>

<p> metric tons, representing 7.49 million cultivated plants,
were </p>

<p> eradicated. Reporting indicates that 31 percent of the
cannabis plants </p>

<p> eradicated during 1992 was sinsemilla. </p>

<p> The five major cultivated cannabis-producing States in 1992
were </p>

<p> Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Hawaii,
respectively. These </p>

<p> States accounted for approximately 44 percent of the
cultivated cannabis </p>

<p> eradicated during 1992. Reports from Indiana and Nebraska
over the last </p>

<p> two years could signal a possible new trend in marijuana
production. The </p>

<p> two States report an increase in tended/enhanced ditchweed, a
form of </p>

<p> marijuana, which grows in the wild. Although ditchweed has
low potency, </p>

<p> it is mixed with cultivated marijuana to increase quantity. </p>

<p> There has been an increase in the cultivation of cannabis
indoors year- </p>

<p> round in elaborately supported operations that have ranged
from several </p>

<p> plants grown in closets to thousands of plants grown in
specially </p>

<p> constructed underground sites capable of producing marijuana
worth </p>

<p> millions of dollars. Growers also continued to plant cannabis
in remote </p>

<p> outdoor areas, often concealed or camouflaged by surrounding
vegetation. </p>

<p> During 1992, the 13th annual DEA-sponsored Domestic Cannabis
Eradication </p>

<p> and Suppression Program (DCE/SP) was conducted in conjunction
with other </p>

<p> Federal, State and local law enforcement authorities in 50
States. The </p>

<p> National Guard and Civil Air Patrol also participated. The
DCE/SP </p>

<p> resulted in the eradication of 7.49 million cultivated
cannabis plants, </p>

<p> 264 million low-potency ditchweed plants, the arrest of
12,369 </p>

<p> violators, and the seizure of 5,541 weapons. Moreover, the
number of </p>

<p> indoor growing operations seized in 1992 reached an all-time
high of </p>

<p> 3,849, up from 2,848 seized in 1991. Indoor cultivation
operations were </p>

<p> confiscated in all 50 States during 1992, with the greatest
number, 561, </p>

<p> seized in the State of Washington. The movement toward indoor
production </p>

<p> is believed due primarily to successful law enforcement
efforts to </p>

<p> curtail outdoor cultivation. The average indoor cultivation
operation </p>

<p> has approximately 100 plants. In addition, an average of one
weapon was </p>

<p> seized from each indoor operation. </p>

<p> In recent years, the DCE/SP has placed increasing emphasis on
the </p>

<p> investigation and prosecution of major domestic cannabis
cultivators and </p>

<p> trafficking organizations. The net result during 1992 was the
seizure of </p>

<p> assets valued at over $69.3 million, over twice the amount
seized in </p>

<p> 1989 ($29.5 million). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
National Park </p>

<p> Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs also have long-term
programs to </p>

<p> combat cannabis cultivation on public lands. </p>

<p> One of the major accomplishments of the DCE/SP continues to
be Hawaii's </p>

<p> Operation WIPEOUT. During 1991, it was estimated that the
program </p>

<p> eradicated approximately 85 percent of Hawaii's summer
cannabis crop. </p>

<p> During 1992, Operation WIPEOUT's continued success was
evidenced by </p>

<p> reports that mainland smugglers were attempting to smuggle
marijuana </p>

<p> into Hawaii in order to fill the vacuum. Operation WIPEOUT is
now </p>

<p> conducted as a maintenance program. Every 90 days, the
WIPEOUT teams </p>

<p> conduct aerial surveillance and eradicate what few cannabis
plants they </p>

<p> find before the plants reach maturity. More emphasis is also
being </p>

<p> placed on arresting cultivators. </p>

<p> Another major accomplishment of the DCE/SP was the successful
lobbying </p>

<p> efforts to convince the California State Government to
consider </p>

<p> herbicidal spraying as a means of eradication. To date, the
California </p>

<p> State Government continues to study the proposal. Previous
requests to </p>

<p> use herbicidal spraying in California were met with strong
resistance </p>

<p> based on environmental, as well as political, concerns.
Spraying will be </p>

<p> conducted in limited areas on a trial basis. Kansas, South
Dakota, and </p>

<p> Texas are also considering herbicidal spray programs. </p>

<p> DEA continues to conduct a special enforcement program
entitled </p>

<p> Operation GREEN MERCHANT that targets major indoor growing
operations. </p>

<p> To date, DEA, together with State and local authorities has
seized </p>

<p> nearly 4,000 growing operations, arrested over 1,500
violators, and </p>

<p> frozen millions of dollars in illicitly acquired profits and
assets. </p>

<p> METHAMPHETAMINE </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY </p>

<p> Methamphetamine is available in varying quantities in most
areas of the </p>

<p> United States, except for the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic
regions </p>

<p> where, for the most part, it is encountered infrequently.
Availability </p>

<p> is primarily concentrated in the western and southwestern
United States </p>

<p> where most clandestine laboratory activity occurs.
Methamphetamine is </p>

<p> also available in limited retail amounts in the Southeast and
somewhat </p>

<p> larger quantities in the Midwest. </p>

<p> The production of methamphetamine, as evidenced by the number
of </p>

<p> reported clandestine laboratory seizures to DEA, has
decreased each year </p>

<p> since 1989. During 1992, 288 methamphetamine laboratories
were seized. </p>

<p> This is in comparison to 652 laboratories seized in 1989, 429
in 1990, </p>

<p> and 315 in 1991. </p>

<p> The decrease in laboratory seizures is attributed to the
ongoing </p>

<p> enforcement of Federal and State chemical control
legislation. The 1988 </p>

<p> Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act (CDTA) became
effective in 1989, </p>

<p> and enables the Federal Government to regulate listed
precursor and </p>

<p> essential chemicals used in the clandestine synthesis of
dangerous </p>

<p> drugs. Over the last three years, most States have passed
legislation </p>

<p> similar to the CDTA. </p>

<p> The price of methamphetamine at the wholesale (pound) level
has remained </p>

<p> relatively constant during the past four years. In 1992,
methamphetamine </p>

<p> prices ranged from $5,000 to $22,000 per pound, $300 to
$2,500 per </p>

<p> ounce, and $45 to $200 per gram. </p>

<p> Nationwide purity of methamphetamine at the ounce and gram
levels </p>

<p> averaged 46 and 53 percent, respectively, during 1992,
compared to 35 </p>

<p> and 34 percent, respectively, during 1991. (Pound-purity
levels are </p>

<p> unavailable due to infrequency of purchases at that level.) </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1991 showed
that an </p>

<p> estimated 5.2 million Americans 12 years of age and older
have used </p>

<p> methamphetamine at least once in their lifetime. (Lifetime
prevalence </p>

<p> rates for 1985, 1988, and 1990 are not available. The
lifetime </p>

<p> prevalence rate for 1992 is not yet available. Data
concerning past- </p>

<p> year, past-month, weekly, and daily prevalence rates for
methamphetamine </p>

<p> are also unavailable.) </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan area </p>

<p> methamphetamine-related emergency room episodes decreased at
a </p>

<p> relatively steady rate from the first half of FY 1989 through
the first </p>

<p> half of FY 1992. However, this downward trend reversed itself
during the </p>

<p> latter half of FY 1992. During the second half of FY 1992,
there was a </p>

<p> 52-percent increase in the number of emergency room episodes
involving </p>

<p> methamphetamine. Despite this, second-half FY 1992 emergency
room </p>

<p> episodes remained below those reported in FY 1989. </p>

<p> DAWN emergency room data indicate that methamphetamine abuse
is </p>

<p> concentrated in the metropolitan areas of San Diego, San
Francisco, and </p>

<p> Los Angeles In San Diego and Los Angeles,
methamphetamine-related </p>

<p> hospital emergencies increased sharply during the latter half
of 1992. </p>

<p> Nationally, approximately 75 percent of the patients treated
for drug </p>

<p> abuse episodes involving methamphetamine were white; nearly
65 percent </p>

<p> were male; approximately 25 percent were between 18 and 25
years of age, </p>

<p> and 40 percent were between the ages of 26 and 34. </p>

<p> Approximately 45 percent of patients treated in emergency
rooms as a </p>

<p> result of methamphetamine abuse indicated that their use of </p>

<p> methamphetamine was due to dependence. Approximately 20
percent had come </p>

<p> to the emergency room because of an overdose, approximately
30 percent </p>

<p> as a result of an unexpected reaction to the drug, and more
than 20 </p>

<p> percent came due to the chronic effects associated with
methamphetamine </p>

<p> abuse. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the injection of
methamphetamine </p>

<p> continues to be the predominant route of administration used
by patients </p>

<p> admitted to DAWN emergency rooms for methamphetamine-related
problems. </p>

<p> Despite this, the percentage of patients who indicated that
injection </p>

<p> was their primary method of administration decreased slightly
during the </p>

<p> past year from 38.4 percent in FY 1991 to 34.9 percent in FY
1992. </p>

<p> Moreover, there has been an increase in the percentage of
patients who </p>

<p> smoked methamphetamine during the past several years. Those
who smoked </p>

<p> methamphetamine increased from 3.9 percent during FY 1989 to
6.8 percent </p>

<p> during FY 1992. </p>

<p> ILLICIT MANUFACTURE </p>

<p> Laboratory Seizures </p>

<p> Although clandestine methamphetamine laboratory seizures
declined during </p>

<p> 1992, methamphetamine remained the most prevalent,
clandestinely </p>

<p> manufactured controlled substance in the United States.
According to DEA </p>

<p> reporting, 288 methamphetamine laboratories were seized
during 1992, </p>

<p> which accounted for 87 percent of all clandestine dangerous
drug </p>

<p> laboratory seizures. The 1992 figure represents a nine
percent decrease </p>

<p> from the previous year's total of 315 laboratories seized and
continues </p>

<p> the downward trend in laboratory seizures that began in 1990.
</p>

<p> DEA field divisions in Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Phoenix,
San Diego, </p>

<p> San Francisco, and Seattle, seized approximately 83 percent
of all </p>

<p> methamphetamine laboratories during 1992. This clearly
indicates that </p>

<p> the clandestine manufacture of methamphetamine is still
primarily based </p>

<p> in the western and southwestern United States. </p>

<p> Methamphetamine laboratory seizures declined from 1991 to
1992 in 14 DEA </p>

<p> field divisions including the San Francisco Division which
continued to </p>

<p> report the highest number of seizures. Sixty-seven
clandestine </p>

<p> methamphetamine laboratories were seized during 1992 by the
San </p>

<p> Francisco Division compared to 81 in 1991. However, DEA's Los
Angeles, </p>

<p> San Diego, Phoenix, Dallas, and St. Louis offices reported an
increase </p>

<p> in the number of laboratories seized within their respective
areas. </p>

<p> Clandestine laboratories have been seized from every
imaginable location </p>

<p> from suburban homes, garages, apartments, mobile trailers,
urban </p>

<p> dwellings, and industrial areas to specially-designed
underground </p>

<p> vaults. The laboratories have been camouflaged,
booby-trapped, buried </p>

<p> underground, conveyed, and abandoned. </p>

<p> Laboratory Operations </p>

<p> Laboratories are usually constructed in very rural areas
across the </p>

<p> United States; however, an increasing number of small
laboratories are </p>

<p> being located in urban and suburban neighborhoods where they
pose a </p>

<p> significant threat to health and safety. Not only are
methamphetamine </p>

<p> laboratories used to produce an illegal, often deadly drug,
but they </p>

<p> have caused explosions, fires, and toxic fumes. Chemicals
associated </p>

<p> with clandestine laboratories have proven to be environmental
pollutants </p>

<p> and health hazards. </p>

<p> Clandestine laboratories are usually operated on an irregular
basis </p>

<p> rather than on a regular schedule. Operators often produce a
batch of </p>

<p> methamphetamine then disassemble the laboratory and store it
or move it </p>

<p> to another location while they acquire additional chemicals.
Storage </p>

<p> facilities are often utilized to house (safeguard) chemicals,
glassware, </p>

<p> and the finished product. An operator will often utilize
different </p>

<p> locations to manufacture methamphetamine. Therefore, it is
not uncommon </p>

<p> for an organization to have multiple laboratory sites.
Relocating the </p>

<p> laboratory affords some protection against detection by law
enforcement </p>

<p> authorities. </p>

<p> Clandestine laboratory operators are often well-armed, and
their </p>

<p> laboratories are occasionally booby-trapped as a security
precaution. </p>

<p> Numerous weapons, including explosives, are routinely
confiscated in </p>

<p> conjunction with clandestine laboratory seizures. Public
safety, and </p>

<p> environmental concerns are of little importance to illicit
drug </p>

<p> laboratory operators. Every year, a number of clandestine
laboratories </p>

<p> experience fires or explosions which lead to their discovery.
Laboratory </p>

<p> operators often waste essential chemicals as they attempt to
synthesize </p>

<p> a high-quality batch of finished product. They usually
dispose of these </p>

<p> and other hazardous chemical wastes by unsafe and illegal
methods, often </p>

<p> dumping these wastes on the ground or in nearby streams and
lakes, </p>

<p> pouring them into local sewage systems, or burying them
underground. </p>

<p> Individuals who synthesize methamphetamine are commonly
referred to as </p>

<p> &quot;chemists&quot; or &quot;cooks.&quot; This level of
education and knowledge of </p>

<p> chemistry can vary from high school dropouts with no real
chemical </p>

<p> knowledge to professional chemists with graduate degrees in
chemistry. </p>

<p> These &quot;cooks&quot; most typically have very little
formal training; rather, </p>

<p> they frequently follow a handwritten recipe or have learned
to </p>

<p> synthesize methamphetamine from underground publications, </p>

<p> apprenticeships, or during incarceration. There are, however,
a number </p>

<p> of &quot;chemists&quot; that are fairly adept or
knowledgeable with regard to </p>

<p> synthesizing methamphetamine. These individuals utilize
chemicals more </p>

<p> efficiently, thus increasing the yield ratio of chemicals to
finished </p>

<p> product. In addition, the &quot;chemist&quot; has the
proficiency to solve </p>

<p> problems which may occur during the manufacturing process.
This is in </p>

<p> contrast to operators who simply follow a recipe and who are
generally </p>

<p> unqualified to perform corrective measures. </p>

<p> MANUFACTURING METHODOLOGIES </p>

<p> Although the manufacture of methamphetamine can be
accomplished by a </p>

<p> variety of chemical synthesis methods, it is most commonly
produced </p>

<p> using the phenyl-2-propanone (P2P) or ephedrine reduction
routes of </p>

<p> synthesis. The ephedrine reduction method was once most often
used in </p>

<p> clandestine laboratories located in California, and has since
become </p>

<p> widespread throughout much of the United States. It is
preferred over </p>

<p> the P2P method of methamphetamine production for three
reasons. First, </p>

<p> it is a simpler route of synthesis; second, the effects of
the resulting </p>

<p> product are more pronounced; and, third, ephedrine is more
readily </p>

<p> available to clandestine laboratories in California and in
the </p>

<p> Southwest. </p>

<p> A relatively new and simple procedure to synthesize
methamphetamine has </p>

<p> been noted using a variation of the ephedrine reduction
method. The </p>

<p> process is being called a &quot;cold cook&quot; method on the
streets because an </p>

<p> external heat source is not required for the synthesis to
proceed. The </p>

<p> method uses commonly available material and chemicals to
manufacture </p>

<p> between one to two ounces of methamphetamine per batch. The
process is </p>

<p> commonly performed in such readily available containers as
two 32-ounce </p>

<p> sports drinking bottles, insulated coffee cups, mugs, or in
modified </p>

<p> laboratory glassware. </p>

<p> CHEMICAL DIVERSION </p>

<p> Integral to the manufacture of illicit methamphetamine are
the chemicals </p>

<p> and equipment necessary to operate a clandestine laboratory.
Whether the </p>

<p> phenyl-2-propanone, ephedrine reduction, or other method of
synthesis is </p>

<p> used, various combinations of chemicals, glassware, and
equipment are </p>

<p> required. The acquisition of chemicals is, therefore, a vital
and </p>

<p> readily identifiable component of the illicit trafficking
cycle. </p>

<p> Chemical control legislation enacted at the Federal and State
level has </p>

<p> made it increasingly difficult for operators to obtain needed
chemicals. </p>

<p> Consequently, trafficking organizations are constantly
seeking new </p>

<p> sources and developing ways in which to circumvent the law.
They </p>

<p> manufacture some of their own chemicals, utilize
&quot;runners&quot; to purchase </p>

<p> necessary chemicals under threshold amounts, and experiment
with </p>

<p> alternate, non-regulated chemicals. Laboratory operators
obtain </p>

<p> regulated chemicals, such as ephedrine, by purchasing
over-the-counter </p>

<p> products which are exempt from the provisions of the CDTA.
Chemicals are </p>

<p> also acquired from &quot;rogue&quot; chemical companies or in
States which have </p>

<p> less restrictive chemical laws or in such countries as Mexico
and </p>

<p> Canada. </p>

<p> MANUFACTURlNG/DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATIONS </p>

<p> Methamphetamine manufacturing/distribution operations vary
greatly in </p>

<p> size, structure, and degree of sophistication. Some
laboratory operators </p>

<p> act as their own chemists; others hire chemists to run the
laboratories </p>

<p> for them. Many manufacturers are independent producers who
cook for </p>

<p> various organized groups. This is particularly true of larger
</p>

<p> organizations which may hire or contract chemists to
manufacture </p>

<p> methamphetamine in return for cash, finished product, or a
combination </p>

<p> of the two. Other cooks manufacture for themselves rather
than for a </p>

<p> particular organization. Leasing storage facilities,
procuring </p>

<p> chemicals, securing the laboratory site, and setting up
glassware and </p>

<p> equipment may be the responsibility of one person or many
different </p>

<p> individuals. Several individuals may simply work together to
combine </p>

<p> their expertise, chemicals, etc., on an ad hoc basis. The
number of </p>

<p> individuals which comprise an operation and the function each
performs </p>

<p> differs from one organization to the next. </p>

<p> Throughout the United States, numerous individuals, groups,
and </p>

<p> organizations from independent entrepreneurs and outlaw
motorcycle gangs </p>

<p> to Mexican poly-drug trafficking organizations currently
manufacture and </p>

<p> distribute methamphetamine. Nationally, independent
entrepreneurs </p>

<p> represent the largest identifiable group involved in
methamphetamine- </p>

<p> related investigations. To a lesser degree, outlaw motorcycle
gangs </p>

<p> continue to play a role in the distribution aspect and
influence </p>

<p> production in certain areas. They most typically insulate
themselves by </p>

<p> financing manufacturing operations rather than becoming
directly </p>

<p> involved themselves. </p>

<p> The most noteworthy trend in recent years is currently taking
place in </p>

<p> California where Mexican traffickers dominate the large-scale
production </p>

<p> and distribution of methamphetamine in the San Diego,
Riverside, San </p>

<p> Bernadino, and Fresno areas. In fact, the high volume of
methamphetamine </p>

<p> manufactured and distributed is the distinguishing
characteristic of </p>

<p> Mexican traffickers involved in dangerous drug production. </p>

<p> Numerous 22-liter setups are frequently utilized in
laboratories </p>

<p> operated by Mexican traffickers to produce an average of 20
to 80 pounds </p>

<p> during each manufacturing process. Traffickers set up
laboratories or </p>

<p> &quot;cooks&quot; in very remote areas throughout southern
and parts of northern </p>

<p> California Organizations may purchase property or pay for the
short-term </p>

<p> use of a site in order to acquire a secure manufacturing
location. An </p>

<p> organization may utilize one location multiple times. </p>

<p> Mexican illegal aliens are most frequently encountered at
these </p>

<p> laboratory sites. In some cases, they are hired as helpers or
to </p>

<p> maintain the reaction process, while the actual chemist
visits </p>

<p> periodically to ensure the operation is functioning properly.
In other </p>

<p> cases, Mexican illegal aliens are responsible for all facets
of the </p>

<p> manufacturing process. Chemicals are generally stored in
stash houses </p>

<p> and brought to the laboratory site on a limited basis. The
amount of </p>

<p> chemicals present at the laboratory is usually restricted to
what is </p>

<p> required to complete a particular cook. </p>

<p> Chemicals are procured for these laboratories from sources in
the United </p>

<p> States and Mexico. Chemical brokers recruit runners to make
purchases at </p>

<p> rogue chemical companies. Additionally, ephedrine, a
precursor for </p>

<p> methamphetamine, is easily accessible to Mexican traffickers;
the </p>

<p> chemical is currently shipped, without restriction, from
Germany to </p>

<p> Mexico and subsequently smuggled across the United
States-Mexican border </p>

<p> in privately owned vehicles. Moreover, brokers supply
chemicals to </p>

<p> numerous manufacturing organizations. Organizations assist
each other in </p>

<p> obtaining chemicals and glassware. A certain amount of
cooperation </p>

<p> exists among many of these organizations; links between these
groups </p>

<p> were already established through their long-standing cocaine,
heroin, </p>

<p> and marijuana connections. </p>

<p> There are indications that groups which previously
manufactured </p>

<p> methamphetamine are now finding it more cost effective to
purchase it </p>

<p> from Mexican sources. In addition, there is limited evidence
to suggest </p>

<p> that Mexican traffickers may be attempting to expand their
operations to </p>

<p> other areas of the country. There are also indications that </p>

<p> methamphetamine is currently being manufactured in Mexico and
</p>

<p> subsequently smuggled into the United States. </p>

<p> SOURCE AREAS </p>

<p> California is a primary source for methamphetamine in many
areas </p>

<p> throughout the United States. However, the manner in which
manufacturing </p>

<p> operations are carried out often makes it difficult to
determine the </p>

<p> origin of the source of supply. Operators manufacturing in a
particular </p>

<p> area may distribute the finished product to associates
residing locally, </p>

<p> in neighboring States, or in other geographic areas.
Privately owned </p>

<p> vehicles are the modes of transportation used most frequently
in the </p>

<p> nationwide distribution of methamphetamine. </p>

<p> LSD </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/POTENCY </p>

<p> DEA reporting indicates that LSD (Iysergic acid diethylamide)
is </p>

<p> available in at least retail quantities in virtually every
State in the </p>

<p> United States and that availability is increasing in a number
of States. </p>

<p> Reporting also indicates that an increasing number of
individuals or </p>

<p> groups are manufacturing and distributing or attempting to
manufacture </p>

<p> and distribute LSD in the United States. In the last two
years, DEA </p>

<p> seized or purchased LSD in 33 States and Washington, D.C. LSD
</p>

<p> availability has been reported by either DEA offices or State
and local </p>

<p> police authorities in many of the remaining 17 States.
Northern </p>

<p> California appears to be the source of supply for most of the
LSD </p>

<p> available in the United States. </p>

<p> LSD is available in several forms, including blotter paper,
tablets, </p>

<p> gelatin, sugar cubes, and liquid. Tablets can be purchased in
several </p>

<p> areas, however, most of the retail doses are in the
blotter-paper form. </p>

<p> Microdots are available in California, Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, New </p>

<p> Jersey, and Vermont. Gelatin in the &quot;windowpane&quot;
variety has been </p>

<p> reported in Michigan and sugar cubes are available in
Colorado and the </p>

<p> Washington, D.C., area. Personal-use doses of liquid LSD in
vials have </p>

<p> also been reported in Colorado, Illinois, New York, and West
Virginia. </p>

<p> LSD is relatively inexpensive. The average price is
approximately five </p>

<p> dollars per retail dosage unit and costs less than one dollar
per dosage </p>

<p> unit in wholesale lots of 1,000 dosage units or more. When
compared with </p>

<p> marijuana, which sells for $40 to $450 per ounce, LSD is
perceived by </p>

<p> many drug users as a bargain, especially if one considers the
duration </p>

<p> of its effects which can persist for up to 12 hours in higher
doses. </p>

<p> Although there has been some fluctuation in the price of LSD
nationally </p>

<p> during the past several years, overall prices remain
relatively low. </p>

<p> LSD potency or strength is measured in micrograms. In the
1960's and </p>

<p> early 1970's, LSD potency generally ranged from 100 to 200
micrograms </p>

<p> per dosage unit or higher. Analysis of exhibits during the
late 1970's </p>

<p> indicated an average potency in the 30- to 50-microgram
range. From the </p>

<p> mid-1980's to the present, LSD potency has remained
considerably below </p>

<p> levels reported during the 1960's and early 1970's and has
generally </p>

<p> been in the range of 20 to 80 micrograms per dosage unit. As
a result of </p>

<p> this comparatively low dosage level, many users perceive LSD
as &quot;safe,&quot; </p>

<p> thus enhancing the drug's attractiveness. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse data for LSD are
limited to </p>

<p> estimates of lifetime use, defined as the use of LSD at least
once in a </p>

<p> person's lifetime. During 1991, 11.8 million Americans, 12
years of age </p>

<p> and older, reported having used LSD at least once compared to
8.4 </p>

<p> million in 1985, an increase of 40 percent. The data reveal
two </p>

<p> significant expansions in the number of lifetime users of
LSD; one </p>

<p> expansion occurred from 1985 to 1988 and the other from 1990
to 1991. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Survey on Drug
Abuse, past </p>

<p> year use of LSD among seniors in the class of 1992 increased
to the </p>

<p> highest level since at least 1985. Current (monthly) use of
LSD among </p>

<p> 10th and 12th grade students remained relatively stable from
1991 to </p>

<p> 1992. Among 8th graders, however, current use of LSD
increased during </p>

<p> that same time frame from 0.6 percent to 0.9 percent.
Moreover, past- </p>

<p> year use of LSD rose in all three grade levels from 1991 to
1992. </p>

<p> DAWN reports indicate that the estimated number of nationwide
LSD- </p>

<p> related hospital emergency room episodes increased from FY
1989 to FY </p>

<p> 1990. Although abuse patterns have been somewhat erratic
since that </p>

<p> period, the current number of LSD-related episodes remain
above those </p>

<p> reported during FY 1989. </p>

<p> ILLICIT MANUFACTURE AND TRAFFICKING </p>

<p> A total of six clandestine synthesis LSD laboratories have
been seized </p>

<p> since 1981; however, these were all seized prior to 1987. </p>

<p> LSD producers fall into two groups. The first is composed of
chemists, </p>

<p> manufacturers, and distributors, located in northern
California, who </p>

<p> work together in close association; they are normally major </p>

<p> manufacturers capable of distributing LSD nationwide. The
second group </p>

<p> of producers work independently. The independent producers
are </p>

<p> encountered in almost any part of the country, however, their
product is </p>

<p> intended for local consumption only. </p>

<p> Wholesale LSD trafficking patterns are not well understood;
however, </p>

<p> three theoretical models have been developed, which outline </p>

<p> organizational structures, production methods, and
trafficking patterns. </p>

<p> These theoretical models may help to explain how clandestine
LSD </p>

<p> activity occurs. Law enforcement officials call these
organizational </p>

<p> patterns: the Independent Entrepreneurial Model, the
Inner/Outer Circle </p>

<p> Group Model, and the Association Model. </p>

<p> The Independent Entrepreneurial Model: A number of law
enforcement </p>

<p> officials believe some LSD manufacturers and distributors,
who are not </p>

<p> part of the northern California group, entered the market due
to </p>

<p> increased demand and the opportunity for high returns on a
small </p>

<p> investment. Examples of this type of loosely-structured
organization </p>

<p> have been noted in cases in Austin, Texas; New Orleans,
Louisiana; </p>

<p> Hartford, Connecticut; and Denver and Boulder, Colorado. The
common </p>

<p> feature in each of these cases was an individual or a small
group of </p>

<p> individuals who manufactured LSD independently from any
California </p>

<p> source of supply. Some entrepreneurs who have manufactured or
have </p>

<p> attempted to manufacture LSD have been known to law
enforcement </p>

<p> officials for years; however, the number of independent
traffickers </p>

<p> appears to have increased recently. </p>

<p> The Inner Circle/Outer Circle or Single Group Model: This
model is </p>

<p> thought to be organized under one close-knit group, the inner
circle, </p>

<p> which controls the vast majority of LSD manufacturing and
distribution </p>

<p> in the United States. The inner circle is probably composed
of five to </p>

<p> 10 principal individuals who possess specialized functions.
These </p>

<p> specialists would include chemists, bulk storage custodians, </p>

<p> financial/transportation specialists, and executives who
manage overall </p>

<p> operations. The inner circle controls the means of
manufacture; they </p>

<p> assemble, operate, disassemble, and store laboratory
equipment; and keep </p>

<p> a reserve amount of LSD on hand for distribution. They sell
from 10- to </p>

<p> 200-gram lots to a limited number of multigram distributors.
This inner </p>

<p> circle presumably accrues multimillion-dollar profits and
only conducts </p>

<p> business with the next level of distribution referred to as
the &quot;outer </p>

<p> circle.&quot; </p>

<p> The outer circle consists of multigram distributors who
supply a number </p>

<p> of teams, groups, or individuals. They sell LSD at $1,000 to
$3,000 per </p>

<p> gram and accrue an estimated $300,000 to $600,000 per year. </p>

<p> Close Association Model (An alternative theory to the Inner
Circle/Outer </p>

<p> Circle or Single Group Model): In this model, a small group
of people </p>

<p> located in northern California, who have known each other for
over two </p>

<p> decades, control the manufacture and distribution of LSD.
However, in </p>

<p> contrast with the Inner Circle/Outer Circle theory, these
people do not </p>

<p> work in one structured organization. They come together, as
necessary, </p>

<p> to acquire chemists, chemicals, working capital, etc. They
work as </p>

<p> consultants or advisors to each other in order to meet their
common goal </p>

<p> of producing and distributing LSD. They may work together as
a unit to </p>

<p> prepare and distribute one batch of LSD, but after that is
accomplished, </p>

<p> they leave the association until another opportunity arises.
They have </p>

<p> strong loyalty to each other and are living comfortably, but
they are </p>

<p> not thought to be motivated primarily by profit. </p>

<p> DISTRIBUTION </p>

<p> Lower-level distribution of LSD usually occurs in three ways.
First, an </p>

<p> individual attends a rock concert, meets a source of supply,
and </p>

<p> exchanges telephone numbers with the source of supply.
Normally, these </p>

<p> purchases are for retail quantities of up to 100 doses.
Second, if this </p>

<p> individual decides to continue distributing, he/she would
then call the </p>

<p> source for additional amounts. Usually the source has either
continued </p>

<p> on the concert tour or has returned home, which is frequently
northern </p>

<p> California. If the source intends to stay on the tour-making
subsequent </p>

<p> communication difficult-the source provides the telephone
number of an </p>

<p> associate for future orders. After the initial purchase,
almost all </p>

<p> transactions are made via the public and private mail
systems. Payments </p>

<p> to a source of supply are usually made through legitimate
money wiring </p>

<p> services. Third, some dealers travel directly to California
to meet </p>

<p> their sources of supply. </p>

<p> Reporting indicates that shipment methods used to transport
both large </p>

<p> and small quantities of LSD are often similar. LSD is
frequently </p>

<p> concealed in greeting cards, in cassette tapes, or in
articles of </p>

<p> clothing that are mailed to a post office box established by
the </p>

<p> recipient. This post office box is usually listed under a
fictitious </p>

<p> name or business. Normally, no return address is provided on
the package </p>

<p> or envelope. Moreover, it is suspected that some multigram
distributors </p>

<p> will travel to their source in order to obtain supplies. </p>

<p> Retail or user level quantities range from one- to 10-dosage
units. Low- </p>

<p> level distributors sell 50- to 100-dosage-unit quantities.
Mid-level </p>

<p> distributors sell 1,000-dosage-unit quantities as well as
multiples of </p>

<p> 1,000 units. These distributors normally have more than one
source of </p>

<p> supply and sell to several lower-level dealers. The sources
of supply </p>

<p> for gram-distributors are in all likelihood located in
northern </p>

<p> California. These sources normally convert LSD from powder or
liquid </p>

<p> form to blotter form. Multigram distributors travel to
California to </p>

<p> obtain LSD personally and are in association with numerous
lower-level </p>

<p> dealers. </p>

<p> PCP </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE </p>

<p> Phencyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, is available in
varying </p>

<p> degrees in a limited number of U.S. cities, primarily
Baltimore, </p>

<p> Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San
Francisco, and </p>

<p> Washington, D.C. During 1992, PCP in liquid form, the most
common form </p>

<p> available in the United States, sold for $150 to $1,000 per
ounce </p>

<p> nationally. The lowest liquid-ounce prices were reported in
Los Angeles, </p>

<p> the source for most of the PCP trafficked in the United
States, where </p>

<p> such quantities sold for $150 to $300. Nationwide, the price
for PCP in </p>

<p> powdered form ranged from $400 to $2,000 per ounce. During
1992, the </p>

<p> price for a gallon of PCP ranged from $3,000 to $10,000 in
Los Angeles </p>

<p> and up to $13,000 in New York City. Individual cigarettes
saturated with </p>

<p> PCP sold for between $5 dollars and $70 nationwide. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> PCP is sold on the street under numerous names including:
Angel Dust, </p>

<p> Crystal, Supergrass, Killer Joints, Ozone, Wack, Embalming
Fluid, and </p>

<p> Rocket Fuel. These names reflect the range of its bizarre and
volatile </p>

<p> effects. The liquid form of PCP is the most commonly
encountered, but it </p>

<p> is also sold in tablets, capsules, and as a powder. PCP is
typically </p>

<p> applied to a leafy material such as mint, parsley, oregano,
or </p>

<p> marijuana, and then smoked. PCP has been used to adulterate </p>

<p> commercially-manufactured cigarettes, usually by dipping them
in liquid </p>

<p> PCP, which is PCP dissolved in ether. The most popular
commercial </p>

<p> cigarettes are dark paper-wrapped brands such as Shermans or
Tijuana </p>

<p> Smalls. PCP can also be injected hypodermically into
cigarettes. </p>

<p> In 1957, PCP was developed as a human anesthetic and later
used in </p>

<p> veterinary medicine as a powerful tranquilizer. In 1965,
medical use for </p>

<p> humans was discontinued because of adverse side effects such
as </p>

<p> confusion and delirium. In 1978, its commercial manufacture
was </p>

<p> discontinued and PCP was transferred from Schedule III to
Schedule II of </p>

<p> the Controlled Substances Act, thus classifying it as a drug
with a high </p>

<p> potential for abuse. </p>

<p> PCP enjoyed a brief popularity in the late 1960's when it was
trafficked </p>

<p> as a &quot;Magic Peace Pill.&quot; Abuse of the drug
resurfaced from the mid-to- </p>

<p> late 1970's because of low price and powerful effects. From
the period </p>

<p> 1981 through 1985, abuse of the drug escalated significantly,
</p>

<p> particularly among persons under the age of 21. Cities which
experienced </p>

<p> significant PCP availability and abuse levels in the
early-to-mid-1980's </p>

<p> included Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New
Orleans, New York </p>

<p> City, San Diego, San Francisco, St. Louis, and Washington,
D.C. </p>

<p> Around 1986, and continuing through the early 1990's, demand
for PCP was </p>

<p> displaced in large measure by the widespread availability and
use of </p>

<p> crack cocaine. More recently, however, there are indications
that PCP </p>

<p> abuse is increasing once again in a number of cities. </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse showed that
lifetime and </p>

<p> past-year PCP use among the U.S. household population
decreased from </p>

<p> 1985 to 1990; however, 1991 and 1992 survey data indicate an
end to this </p>

<p> downward use pattern. From 1990 to 1992, the number of
Americans aged 12 </p>

<p> years and older, who used PCP at least once, increased from
six million </p>

<p> to 8.2 million, while the number who had used PCP in the past
year </p>

<p> increased from 307,000 to 467,000. Nevertheless, the number
of past-year </p>

<p> users in 1992 remained significantly below the number
reported in 1985 </p>

<p> when approximately 1.2 million Americans reported using PCP
at least </p>

<p> once yearly. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey on
Drug Abuse, </p>

<p> PCP use among 12th graders has declined significantly during
the past </p>

<p> seven years. From 1985 to 1992, the percentage of seniors who
used PCP </p>

<p> at least once in their lifetime decreased from 4.9 percent to
2.4 </p>

<p> percent. Comparable declines were also reported during that
same period </p>

<p> in the percentage of seniors who used PCP during the past
year and past </p>

<p> month as well as on a daily basis. This diminished use is
believed to be </p>

<p> due in large part to a significant increase among 12th
graders in the </p>

<p> perceived risk of harm associated with PCP usage. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan-area </p>

<p> PCP-related emergency room episodes, which had been declining
at a </p>

<p> substantial rate during the past three years, rose from 1,353
during the </p>

<p> first half of FY 1992 to 2,380 during the second half of FY
1992, more </p>

<p> than a 75-percent increase. Cities having high or increased
PCP abuse </p>

<p> rates during the second half of FY 1992 included Baltimore,
Chicago, Los </p>

<p> Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and
Washington, </p>

<p> D.C. </p>

<p> TRAFFICKING AND ILLICIT MANUFACTURE </p>

<p> Reporting indicates that the majority of the nation's PCP
supply is </p>

<p> manufactured and distributed by Los Angeles-based street
gangs. While </p>

<p> buses, trains, and airlines are used to transport PCP from
California </p>

<p> sources of supply, private automobiles are believed to be the
primary </p>

<p> means for transporting PCP across the country. Female
couriers are used </p>

<p> very frequently and the amounts transported generally range
from one to </p>

<p> two quarts. PCP traffickers also use the U.S. mail system and
express </p>

<p> delivery services to transport PCP. </p>

<p> Four PCP laboratories were seized in 1992 compared to three
in 1991. Two </p>

<p> of the 1992 seizures were in northern California and one each
near </p>

<p> Chicago and Philadelphia. PCP laboratory seizures since the
mid-1980's </p>

<p> have ranged from three to 21 per year, totals which are
considerably </p>

<p> less than the high of 79 reported in 1978. No PCP
laboratories have been </p>

<p> seized thus far in 1993. </p>

<p> APPENDIX </p>

<p> The NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE, sponsored by the
Substance </p>

<p> Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), is
a series of </p>

<p> national surveys to measure the prevalence and frequency of
drug use </p>

<p> among the U.S. household population aged 12 and over. The
survey samples </p>

<p> the civilian non-institutionalized population living in
households, </p>

<p> college dormitories, and military installations and,
therefore, does not </p>

<p> include some segments of the U.S. population which may
contain a </p>

<p> substantial proportion of drug users, such as transients and
those who </p>

<p> are incarcerated. The SAMHSA publishes survey results on an
annual </p>

<p> basis. </p>

<p> The NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR SURVEY is a series of
nationwide studies </p>

<p> of drug use frequency and related attitudes among high school
seniors in </p>

<p> the United States. The survey is conducted annually by the
University of </p>

<p> Michigan's Institute for Social Research and funded by
research grants </p>

<p> from the SAMHSA. In addition to high school seniors, the
study includes </p>

<p> the recently-added national surveys of 8th and 10th grade
students. For </p>

<p> the 1992 survey, approximately 50,000 8th-, 10th-, and
12th-grade </p>

<p> students across the country were questioned. </p>

<p> The DRUG ABUSE WARNING NETWORK (DAWN) is a large-scale data
collection </p>

<p> system implemented in 1972 and designed to be an indicator of
the </p>

<p> severity, scope, and nature of the nation's substance abuse
problem. The </p>

<p> purpose of DAWN is to provide data on the incidence of drug
abuse </p>

<p> related episodes from participating hospital emergency rooms
located in </p>

<p> 21 U.S. metropolitan areas. DAWN is managed by the SAMHSA. </p>

<p> The NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE (NIJ) established the Drug
Use </p>

<p> Forecasting Program (DUF) in 1987 to identify and monitor
trends in drug </p>

<p> use among arrestees in the United States. Each quarter, at
central </p>

<p> booking facilities in 24 participating jurisdictions,
arrestees are </p>

<p> asked to participate in a voluntary, anonymous interview and
to provide </p>

<p> a urine specimen. Urine samples are analyzed to detect the
use of </p>

<p> cocaine, opiates, marijuana, PCP, methadone, benzodiazines
(such as </p>

<p> Valium), methaqualone, propoxyphene (such as Darvon),
barbiturates, and </p>

<p> amphetamines. The results of the urinalysis testing are
published by the </p>

<p> NIJ on a quarterly and annual basis. </p>

<h2>Alcohol Prohibition</h2>

<p>&quot;The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered
considerably by the prohibition law. For nothing is more
destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land
than passing laws which cannot be enforced. It is an open secret
that the dangerous increase of crime in this country is closely
connected with this&quot; </p>

        and over age group.<p>In 1990, of the estimated 25 524

that in 34% of road deaths alcohol is a contributing factor
(before 1979 the figure was over 50%) and the total number of
road deaths is falling (3730 in 1979; 1971 in 1992).</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 ROAD ACCIDENTS">Although there is no
firm epidemiological evidence linking the use of other drugs as a
causative factor in road accidents there is much anecdotal
evidence. The risk of harm is high when some drugs, either
illicit or prescribed, eg cannabis or diazepam, are combined with
alcohol. <br>

IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS <br>
</a></h2>

<h2><a
name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Tobacco</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Recent
figures from the 1991 National Campaign Against Drug Abuse
(NCADA) Household Survey indicate that tobacco was used in the
past year by 31% of males and 25% of females aged 14 and over.
Similar proportions of high school students also report using
tobacco. Although levels of smoking among teenagers have fallen
in recent years, the number of female teenagers who smoke still
exceeds that of males. In 1991, 21% of boys and 35% of girls
between 14-19 years reported smoking in the past year. (Appendix
3 provides information on use of various drugs by persons aged
14-19 years.)</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">There
has been a greater decline of smoking among males than females in
the past 15 years. The proportion of female smoking increased
from 26% in 1945 to 31% in 1976-80 but has since fallen to 27% in
1989. The proportion of males smoking has fallen since 1945 (when
it was 72%) to 30% in 1989. This represents no statistical
difference between male and female smoking rates for the first
time. </a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">In
1989 the highest smoking rate of Australian adult smokers was
found among 20-24 year olds for both males (41%) and females
(38%).</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Mortality
rates due to smoking have decreased by 5% between 1987 and 1990
(from 111.7 to 106 deaths per 100 000 population). <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a
name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Alcohol</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">The
trend since the mid-1970s has been towards a decrease in the
amount of alcohol consumed in Australia (per capita consumption
of alcohol fell from 13.2 litres in 1978 to 7.9 litres in
1990-91).</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Between
1985-86 and 1990-91 consumption of beer has decreased by 6%, wine
consumption has decreased by 19%, while overall, total alcohol
consumption (expressed as pure alcohol) decreased by 7%.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">In
1991, over 18% of all beer consumed was low alcohol beer. (Low
alcohol beer was not consumed before 1985.)</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">A
1989 survey highlighted increasing concern about heavy drinking
among young people &#150; 38% of 16 year olds and 40% of 17 year
olds consumed five or more drinks on their last drinking
occasion. It was also reported that in the 12-16 year age group,
22% of boys and 18% of girls reported weekly use of alcohol.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Alcohol
continues to play a major role in domestic violence.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Surveys
by the National Heart Foundation have shown that despite drinking
less often than older groups, young people (aged 20-24 years)
tend to drink more heavily on the occasions when they do drink.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Death
rates due to alcohol have fallen by 20% since 1979 (from 48.7
deaths per 100 000 population in 1979 to 39.0 in 1990).</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">People
are now spending less of their total budget on alcohol than
previously (5.6% in 1981-82, 4.1% in 1991). <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a
name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Pharmaceutical
products</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">There
is no reliable evidence to demonstrate authoritatively patterns
or trends in the use of pharmaceutical products such as
sedatives, minor tranquillisers and analgesics. Restrictions on
the prescription of barbiturates over the past decade have
produced a fall in their use, and deaths from overdosage have
decreased by 75%.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">The
most commonly used prescribed drugs are cardiovascular system
drugs (19%) followed by psychotropic drugs (10%). There is some
concern about the use of psychotropic drugs because of their
ability to alter a person's mood, behaviour or perception.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Minor
tranquillisers, particularly benzodiazepines, are the most
commonly used psychotropic drugs in the Australian community. The
overuse of this drug, particularly by women and the elderly, has
been an area of concern for some time.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">The
use of benzodiazepines for long or continuous therapy, in
particular for night time sedation, is an undesirable practice.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Benzodiazepines
are commonly taken in overdosage both by accident and with
suicidal intent. Approximately 1% of drug-related deaths are due
to the misuse of prescribed and unprescribed pharmaceuticals.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Minor
analgesics are easily available and, although analgesic
nephropathy has decreased, the level of this disorder among women
in Australia remains high by international standards.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Cough
mixtures and antihistamines are commonly used for their
psychotropic effects, occasionally leading to dependence. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a
name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Illegal
drugs</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">The
1991 NCADA Household Survey reported that 32% of persons over the
age of 14 years had tried cannabis and 8% had used amphetamines
(excluding ecstasy).</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Apart
from the use of cannabis, it seems that the level of use of
illegal drugs in Australia remains very low. This use has
remained at approximately the same level for the past ten years.
Appendix 4 provides a breakdown of persons using illicit drugs in
the past year.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">The
use of hallucinogens (eg LSD) seems to have remained at a minimum
level despite media reports about 'designer drugs' (ecstasy,
etc.). </a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Heroin
use may be gradually diminishing in line with trends in other
countries. </a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">The
use of amphetamines and cocaine in general remains low in the
Australian population. (Appendix 5 provides information on the
proportion of the population who have ever tried various illicit
drugs.) However, recent evidence suggests that the number of
persons trying amphetamines is increasing, particularly among
males aged 25-39 (from 12% in 1988 to 19% in 1991) and among
females aged 14-24 (4% in 1988 to 11% in 1991).</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Illegal
drug use, however, remains a major social problem.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Deaths
caused by opiates seem to be still increasing although the
numbers remain relatively small (117 in 1979 to 457 in 1991).</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Most
deaths involving illegal drugs are caused by overdosage or an
impure drug. Some of these deaths are suicides. Many injecting
drug users are infected with hepatitis B and hepatitis C and an
increasing number are infected with HIV/AIDS. Intravenous use of
amphetamines and cocaine is still causing little morbidity, but
an increasing number are presenting for treatment centres.
Needle-sharing and unsafe sexual practices continue to be a
significant problem.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Cannabis
is the most widely used illicit drug in the Australian
population, with approximately one in three persons aged 14 and
over having tried this drug. This represents a slight increase in
use since 1988.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">It
is possible that cannabis use may precipitate psychotic episodes
in those who are predisposed or have a history of psychosis.
Cannabis impairs psychomotor function but epidemiological
evidence to link cannabis with road accidents is still lacking.</a></p>

<p>Concepts and definitions are particularly important to the
subject of drug use and drug problems.<a href="alc_fn.htm#(2)">(2)</a>
This subject often evokes emotional responses because of our own
ambivalence towards drug use. The literature on this subject also
leads to much confusion. </p>

<p>Many myths have been created and perpetuated about drug use
and drug problems over the last 30 years. A consensus is now
being reached concerning the most valuable concepts, and the way
that different words should be used.</p>

<p>If drug users are to be helped to avoid problems and to
minimise their disabilities, it is important that simple terms
should be understood and used uniformly. <br>
<br>
</p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG">DRUG</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG">This term refers to any
chemical that changes the mental state and that may be used
repeatedly for that effect by a person. Some are likely to
adversely affect the health of the individual and the social
surroundings. </a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG">'Drug' now includes alcohol,
tobacco, psychoactive pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and
substances such as petrol, some fluorocarbons and anabolic
steroids. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG USE">DRUG USE </a><a
href="alc_fn.htm#(3)">(3)</a></h2>

<p>Experimental use: trying out the drug to experience its effect
and to decide whether or not to adopt an ongoing pattern of use.</p>

<p>Social and recreational use: using the drug as a means of
enhancing social interaction or the enjoyment of some leisure
activity.</p>

<p>Symptomatic use: using the drug as a means of reducing
unpleasant sensations or experiences or to avoid challenging
situations or responsibilities.</p>

<p>Dependent use: using the drug with a sense of compulsion, so
that other responsibilities are neglected and harm may result. </p>

<p>Such dependent use becomes habitual, stereotyped in pattern,
and responsive to external cues and pressures. This pattern is
quickly reinstituted after a period of abstinence. Abstinence may
be associated with the onset of withdrawal symptoms and the
discomfort of withdrawal will become a motivator for renewed drug
use.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG DEPENDENCE">DRUG DEPENDENCE</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG DEPENDENCE">Drug dependence
syndrome describes the pattern of behaviour shown by, and the
physical changes experienced by, drug-dependent users.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG DEPENDENCE">Psychological
dependence describes the behavioural aspects of drug dependence.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG DEPENDENCE">Physical dependence
exists in a tissue or intact organism when the presence of the
drug is necessary for normal functioning. It refers to the
tolerance which develops to the effects of drug use and to the
withdrawal effects experienced when drug use is stopped.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG DEPENDENCE">Neuroadaptation
describes the altered sensitivity of cells, as well as the
patterns of behavioural and auto-physiological responses which
develop with repeated drug use</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG DEPENDENCE"><br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a
name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">ADDICTION,
ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR</a></h2>

<p><a
name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">Addiction,
a term which has been in use for thousands of years, means to
give oneself to either a person or a behaviour pattern. Addiction
is a universal term and applies to those who give themselves to a
wide variety of behaviours often to the extent that their lives
become unmanageable. Addiction to alcohol and drugs is only an
example of this pattern of behaviour. However, once an addiction
is established that behaviour tends to be relied upon
increasingly.</a></p>

<p><a
name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">There
are a number of characteristics evident with an addiction:<br>
</a></p>

<ol>
    <li><a
        name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">A
        strong desire or sense of compulsion to engage in the
        particular behaviour (especially when the opportunity to
        engage in such behaviour is not available); </a></li>
    <li><a
        name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">Impaired
        capacity to control the behaviour (notably in terms of
        controlling its onset, staying off, or controlling the
        level at which the behaviour occurs); </a></li>
    <li><a
        name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">Discomfort
        and distress when the behaviour is prevented or stops;
        and </a></li>
    <li><a
        name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">Persisting
        with the behaviour despite clear evidence that it is
        leading to problems </a></li>
</ol>

<p><a
name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">While
not all of these characteristics are present in every instance of
addictive behaviour, a sense of compulsion tends to be an
essential element. Together these four features provide a good
picture of addictive behaviour with its sense of compulsion, the
difficulty of maintaining control over the behaviour, the
distress associated with withdrawal, and the persistence that
such behaviours show once they have become established (Gossop,
1989).</a></p>

<p><a
name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">People
with an addiction need to face the reality of the situation and
to have some positive experiences in order to regain self-esteem
and hope. They must attempt to acquire a new set of values or
personal orientation in order to achieve successful control and
cure. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">DRUG-RELATED
DISABILITIES</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">This term
refers to all the harm a person may experience as a result of the
use of drugs. </a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">Such
disabilities include a whole range of adverse health and social
consequences which may be experienced as either direct or
indirect consequence of drug use. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">Direct
consequences</a></h3>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">These
include:<br>
</a></p>

<ul>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">harm
        suffered through changed behaviour due to the
        intoxicating effects of the drug </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">harm
        suffered from the acute or chronic toxic effects of the
        drug<br>
        </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">harm
        suffered because of the change in priorities associated
        with dependent use of the drug. <br>
        </a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">Indirect
consequences</a></h3>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">These
include:<br>
</a></p>

<ul>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">harm
        associated with poor nutrition and poor hygiene </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">harm
        resulting from efforts made by the individual or others
        to curtail drug use<br>
        </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">harm
        associated with the impurities or contaminants in the
        drug used or the method of administration.</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">Drug-related
disabilities may occur in all types of drug users but are more
likely to occur as the frequency and quantity of drug use
increases. Accordingly it is possible to categorise drug users in
terms of the risk of their experiencing harm. In practice this
has been done only with alcohol, eg '</a><a
href="#alcohol hbk ch2 ALC low risk drinking">Low risk drinking</a>'.
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 INTOXICATION">INTOXICATION</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 INTOXICATION">Intoxication may be
defined as the intake of a quantity of a substance which exceeds
the individual's tolerance and produces behavioural or physical
abnormalities. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 OVERDOSE">OVERDOSE</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 OVERDOSE">Overdose may be defined as
the state that occurs when a person has ingested a drug quantity
higher than the recommended therapeutic dose and that also
exceeds his or her tolerance. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG ABUSE">DRUG ABUSE</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG ABUSE">This term is now not
recommended for use because it can have many meanings and is used
as a pejorative term implying a deliberate misuse of drugs
regardless of consequences. Alternative phrases may be used which
are less explicit and pejorative in nature. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 HARM REDUCTION">HARM REDUCTION</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 HARM REDUCTION">This term describes
the new approach being taken to all drug-related problems. The
aim of any intervention is not so much stopping drug use but
focusing on the reduction of specific drug-related harm.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 HARM REDUCTION"><br>
</a></p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DETOXIFICATION">DETOXIFICATION</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DETOXIFICATION">Detoxification can be
defined as the means by which the drug-dependent person may
withdraw from the effects of that drug in a supervised way in
order that withdrawal symptoms and the risks relating to
withdrawal are minimised. .i.detoxification; <br>
<br>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC binge drinking">Binge drinking</a></h3>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC binge drinking">Binge drinking
has been described as the consumption of alcohol to intoxication
in a very short period of time. Generally there are two forms of
binge drinking:<br>
</a></p>

<ol>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC binge drinking">Drinking
        heavily on a single occasion, ie the consumption of five
        or more drinks in one drinking session.</a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC binge drinking">Heavy and
        continuous drinking over a number of days or weeks. This
        form of drinking may be characteristic of people who have
        high levels of tolerance for alcohol or are susceptible
        to alcohol dependence.</a></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC binge drinking">Binge drinking is
particularly evident among young people, usually in the form of a
number of bouts of drinking in the course of a week. This form of
drinking may affect an individual's cognition, distractability,
information-processing ability, and increase the risk of
alcohol-related accidents (Pols and Hawks, 1992). <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC alcoholism">Alcoholism,
alcoholic, problem drinker </a><a href="alc_fn.htm#(5)">(5)</a></h3>

<p>These terms should be used with great caution in order to
avoid misunderstanding. </p>

<p>Alcoholism can be used to cover the whole range of
alcohol-related disabilities. However, alcoholism has acquired a
host of meanings by association with the disease concept of
alcoholism. This implies that it is a progressive and
irreversible condition that can be arrested but never cured, and
involving a special sensitivity in the sufferer who experiences
craving for alcohol and loss of control of its use.</p>

<p>This disease concept of alcoholism can be useful but it also
has many disadvantages. It certainly can lead to unreasonable
expectations and to the adoption of a passive role by the
drinker. It can promote a false sense of confidence in drinkers
who believe that alcoholics are a race apart. The idea of
alcoholism as a disease can distract drinkers and helpers from
the fact that the central issue relates to the priorities and
motivation of the drinker and the drinker's capacity to control
his habits or behaviour.</p>

<p>Alcoholic can be used as an adjective, ie alcoholic liver
disease, which indicates the problem is related to the use of
alcohol. It may also be used as a noun ('he is an alcoholic').
However, such usage is poor communication, with many emotional
overtones. It implies a simplicity of understanding which does
not reflect the complexity of human behaviour. Because of this,
it is advised that the term not be used as a noun. </p>

<p>Problem drinker and drinking problem are loose terms that are
better replaced by other more specific terms, namely hazardous,
harmful and dysfunctional drinking. <br>
<br>
</p>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC standard drinks">Standard drinks
&#150; grams of alcohol</a></h3>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC standard drinks">It is essential
in taking a history of alcohol consumption to determine the
amount of absolute alcohol (100% ethanol) consumed by the
patient. To simplify this process it is customary to estimate the
number of standard drinks consumed per day and during a typical
week. </a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC standard drinks">A standard drink
is defined as the amount of any particular alcoholic beverage
that contains approximately 10 grams (12.5 mL of ethanol) which
is generally equivalent to the usual drink served at a hotel or
restaurant (see </a><a href="#alcohol hbk fig1">figure showing
range of standard drinks</a>). </p>

<p>We need also to list the patient's intake as a number of
standard drinks per day or per week. Then by multiplying this
number by ten we can calculate the number of grams of alcohol
consumed. This will allow us to determine whether the drinking is
responsible, hazardous or harmful. Recent research indicates that
people have difficulty estimating consumption of standard drinks
using the information that is currently available on alcoholic
beverage containers. <br>
<br>
</p>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC a harmful dose">A harmful dose
of alcohol</a></h3>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC a harmful dose">Harmful dose is
an amount of alcohol likely to cause a harmful effect. In older
terminology, it would cause an alcohol-related problem.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC a harmful dose">Dose: alcohol
consumption should be expressed in grams &#150; so many grams per
drink consumed, so many grams on a single drinking occasion, so
many grams on an average daily basis over an extended period of

or more commonly mg alcohol/100 mL of blood as grams per cent eg
0.05 g%</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC blood alcohol ">The blood alcohol
concentration (BAC) is determined by two main factors: <br>
</a></p>

<ul>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC blood alcohol ">the amount

</ul>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC blood alcohol ">Many drinkers,
especially chronic drinkers, do not start on a drinking session
with a zero BAC.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC blood alcohol ">One can only
generalise in predicting the likely BAC. In a male weighing 70
kilograms, 10 grams of alcohol usually raises the BAC by 0.02
grams per 100 mL of blood. The rate of elimination is about 8
grams per hour, resulting in a fall in the BAC of about 0.015
grams per 100 mL per hour. <br>

begin to deteriorate at 0.03-0.04 grams per 100 mL.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC harm and blood">Certain cognitive

information, consciousness, vision. Significant deterioration
occurs at 0.05-0.08. A rapid decline in skills then occurs with
small increments in the BAC.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC harm and blood">The same impaired
cerebral functions affect all forms of skilled performance at
work, during leisure activities, etc.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC harm and blood">Disinhibition is
related to the BAC. Disturbed behaviour often resulting in
antisocial acts may become manifest between 0.06 and 0.10 g%.</a></p>

Fundamentally, 'alcohol dependence' is a longitudinal development, a series of events (problems) correlated with the consumption of alcohol and associated with the phenomena of tolerance, loss of control and dependency.<p>
The natural history of alcohol dependence is therefore a continuum, evolving from hazardous to harmful patterns of drinking, causing a series of alcohol-related disorders or problems, and the development of a dependency on the use of alcohol.
<br><br>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 NATURAL Progression">Progression</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>Bouts of heavy alcohol consumption - a variety of patterns may evolve.
<li>Early problems are mainly psychosocial: drink driving offences, loss of jobs, marital disharmony, civil or criminal offences.<br>
<li>Dependence can begin to develop relatively early.
<li>Physical complications tend to occur later: earliest are trauma, hypertension and gout, later ones are cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy and brain damage.<br>
<li>Alcohol-related physical disease begins to constitute a threat to life and there is a significant annual mortality rate once severe dependence has developed.
<li>Loss of control of drinking habits emerges about midway.<br>
<li>With further progression, problems multiply and dependence becomes consolidated.
<li>Social and psychological disintegration becomes manifest.<br>
<li> Progression is not inevitable.<br>
<li>Many factors may accelerate progression or alter its direction.
<li>Many heavy drinkers change course, modify their drinking or become abstinent without any professional help.<br>
<li>There are at-risk groups and contributing social factors.
</ul>
<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 NATURAL at-risk">At-risk groups and social factors</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>Family history of alcohol dependence, especially in close relatives and males
<li>peer group heavy drinking - distortion of perception of drinking norms<br>
<li>antisocial personalities
<li>anxious or depressed persons<br>
<li>significant life events causing psychological stress
<li>cultural norms of heavy drinking, eg particular occupations<br>
<li>tolerated patterns of heavy drinking and of intoxication.
</ul>
The presence of positive outcome indicators need to be considered when planning treatment programs. Examples may include: <p>
<ul>
<li>when a person begins to notice the harmful effects of his/her drinking behaviour
<li>if the person seeks help or joins support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous<br>
<li>if rewarding and sustaining relationships exist
<li>if a growth of positive personal values occur<br>
<li>if satisfying new interests and relationships are developed
<li>if social supports remain intact, such as family structure and employment.
</ul>
<p>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 NATURAL recovery">Recovery</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>Often minimal intervention is all that is required.
<li>Abstinence is not the sole criterion of recovery.
<li>Many people adopt low risk drinking patterns, especially those in controlled environments or who have not progressed far along the road of dependence.
<li>Goals of management should be realistic, individually tailored, frequently reassessed and often staged. Staging is often determined by the development of social supports and of emotional stability.
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 NATURAL pregnancy">Pregnancy</h3><p>
Any drinking is potentially deleterious to the foetus but major abnormalities are the sequel of heavy drinking (five or more drinks in a day). Women should be advised not to consume alcohol during pregnancy. Very early pregnancy (less than 6-8 weeks) and late pregnancy (third trimester) appear to be times of greatest foetal risk.
<br><br>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 NATURAL alcohol and physical">Alcohol and physical disease</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>Physical disease due to alcohol does not occur in a simple dose-response relationship.<p>
<li>Some diseases, eg Wernicke's encephalopathy, are due to nutritional deficiency states, secondary to heavy alcohol consumption. <p>
<li>The best researched physical complication is liver disease.<p>
<li>    Studies have established the concept of the aggregate dose, the product of the average daily dose and the number of years. The higher the aggregate dose, the more likely is the development of serious liver disease.<p>
<li>    The lower levels of risk for liver disease appear with sustained average daily intakes of 40 grams for women and 60 grams for men.<p>
<li>    It is unknown whether the same values apply to other physical diseases, eg pancreatitis, cardiomyopathy.<p>
<li>Cerebral dysfunction seems to occur at lower levels of alcohol intake than liver disease.<p>
<li>    Cerebral dysfunction is a clinical syndrome in which abnormalities of cerebral function can be demonstrated by psychometric testing. Function may recover in whole or in part once drinking has ceased. Maximal recovery may be delayed by weeks or months. Damage and recovery may be demonstrated by serial computerised tomography.<p>
<li>Foetal alcohol syndrome may occur in children born of drinking mothers.<p>
<li>    Changes short of foetal alcohol syndrome also occur. Measurable defects have been found in infants of mothers drinking as little as 20 g per day. The risk of full blown foetal alcohol syndrome has been shown to be very marked if the mother consumes 50 g or more per day.<p>
<li>    It is not known whether a single episode of heavy drinking can damage the foetus but animal studies have shown this to be so.<p>
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 PHYSICAL COMPLICATIONS">PHYSICAL COMPLICATIONS</h2><p>
Certain diseases and conditions may be present which are not specific or consistently diagnostic of heavy alcohol consumption. However, suspicion should be raised particularly when more than one is present. <p>
Note: They usually appear later than the social and psychological complications. <p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS">PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS
<br></h2><p>

<h3>General</h3><p>
The alcoholic personality as such does not exist. There is no difference between the mental health and pre-morbid personality of the alcohol-dependent person and the non-dependent person. Most, but not all, psychological problems in alcohol-dependent people are secondary to the effects of drinking. In some a psychiatric disorder (eg affective disorder, antisocial personality disorder) is primary and precedes the abnormal drinking behaviour.<p>
There are almost no psychological symptoms or syndromes which cannot be caused or exacerbated by alcohol and other drug misuse. These must be considered in every psychological presentation. The diagnostic possibilities cover the whole field of psychiatry and only the most common can be listed here. 
<br><br>

<h3>Common psychological presentations</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>Suicide attempts and suicide
<li>Depression<br>
<li>Loss of memory or blackout
<li>Anxiety<br>
<li>Phobic states
<li>Fugue states<br>
<li>Hyperexcitability and rage states
<li>Morbid jealousy<br>
<li>Paranoid reactions
<li>Atypical psychosis<br>
<li>Schizophrenia
<li>Insomnia<br>
<li>Antisocial behaviour.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Cognitive and memory defects</h3><p>
It is important to consider alcohol use every time a tranquilliser, antidepressant or hypnotic is prescribed.    
<br><br>

<h3>Sexual problems</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>Loss of libido
<li>Hypogonadism<br>
<li>Impotence and premature ejaculation, ejaculatory incompetence
<li>Forcing sexual relations on partner<br>
<li>Sexual deviancy, eg incest, sexual molestation of children, rape.
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 SOCIAL COMPLICATIONS">SOCIAL COMPLICATIONS</h2><p>
Social disorders are usually the earliest and most frequent complications of alcohol misuse. A complete range of these can be produced by, or associated with, alcohol misuse.
<br><br>

<h3>General</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>Isolation from family and community activities
<li>Life revolving around drinking activities<br>
<li>Increased frequency of driving accidents
<li>Increase in acts of violence and crime<br>
<li>Financial problems
<li>Legal problems.
</ul><p>

<h3>At work</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>Frequent absenteeism, especially Monday and Friday and after pay day
<li>Frequent and varied medical reasons for absence from work<br>
<li>Promotion failure, impaired job performance
<li>A history of gaps in work, frequent changes of employment and the threat of job loss<br>
<li>Industrial accidents
<li>Early retirement.
</ul><p>

<h3>Common effects of excessive alcohol consumption within the family</h3><p>
The alcohol-dependent person:<br>
<ul>
<li>denies the alcohol problem, blames others, forgets and tells stories for self defence and protection against humiliation; receives criticism from others in the family
<li>spends money needed by the family on alcohol<br>
<li>ignores bills, debts pile up
<li>is unpredictable and impulsive<br>
<li>resorts to verbal and physical abuse in place of honest, open talk
<li>loses the trust of family, relatives and friends<br>
<li>experiences increased sexual arousal but reduced function
<li>has unpredictable mood swings  Jekyll and Hyde personality<br>
<li>uses devious and manipulative behaviour to divert attention from drinking problem
<li>suffers depression, guilt, shame.<p>
</ul>
The spouse or partner:<br>
<ul>
<li>often tries to hide and deny the problem of the partner
<li>takes on the other person's responsibilities, carrying the load of two and perpetuating the spouse/partner dependence<br>
<li>takes a job to get away from the problem and/or to maintain financial security
<li>finds it difficult to be open and honest because of resentment, anger, hurt and shame<br>
<li>avoids sexual contact and may seek separation or divorce
<li>may overprotect the children, neglect and/or use them for emotional support<br>
<li>shows gradual social withdrawal and isolation
<li>may lose feelings of self-respect and self-worth<br>
<li>may use alcohol or prescription drugs in an effort to cope
<li>may present to the doctor with anxiety, depression, psychosomatic symptoms or evidence of domestic violence.<p>
</ul>
The children<p>
The children have an increased risk of developing alcohol dependency themselves. They may:<br>
<ul>
<li>be victims of birth defects (from maternal alcohol use)
<li>be torn between two parents<br>
<li>be deprived of emotional and physical support and lack trust in anyone
<li>avoid peer group activities, especially in the home, out of fear and shame<br>
<li>learn destructive and negative ways of dealing with problems and getting attention
<li>lose sight of values, standards and goals because of a lack of consistent, strong parenting<br>
<li>be a failure in school and indulge in petty crime
<li>suffer a diminishing sense of self-worth as a significant member of the family<br>
<li>present with learning difficulties, school refusal, enuresis or sleep disorders.

<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch5 INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2><p>
Since it was first suggested in 1898 that smoking may result in lung cancer, many studies have examined the effect of tobacco smoke on active and passive smokers. As the social and economic costs of tobacco-related problems are enormous, medical practitioners and health workers play an important role in educating smokers of the risks and promoting the health benefit of quitting.
<p>

<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch5 PROGRESSION">PROGRESSION</h2><p>
<ul>
<li>Although initial inhalation of cigarette smoke can produce palpitations, dizziness, sweating, nausea, and vomiting, tolerance to these symptoms develops rapidly but can take up to 3 years.
<li>Physical dependence on nicotine, and even more important, psychological dependence to cigarettes, soon develops.<br>
<li>'Smokers cough' (a manifestation of bronchitis) typically occurs early in the smoker's career.
<li>Physical problems occurring later are numerous  lung cancer, respiratory diseases and problems, cardiovascular diseases including stroke and peripheral vascular disease.<br>
<li>Fertility difficulties may occur in both males and females.
</ul>

<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch5 AT RISK GROUPS FOR TOBACCO USE">AT RISK GROUPS FOR TOBACCO USE</h2><p>
<ul>
<li>Family history of smoking  especially young children of smokers, and other first degree relatives.
<li>People (usually younger persons) susceptible to peer group pressure. Influences may include:<br>
<ul>
<LI>friends who smoke<br>
<LI>spouse/partner smokes<br>
<LI>image and social acceptability<br>
<LI>co-workers who smoke.<br>
</ul>
<li>People with extroverted personalities: impulsive, arousal-seeking, risk-taking. 
<li>People prone to the effects of stress and tension.
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch5 CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF TOBACCO SMOKE">CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF TOBACCO SMOKE</h2><p>
Tobacco smoke contains over 4000 compounds, many of which have been linked to human disease.<br>
<ul>
<li>Nicotine  a highly toxic chemical which primarily acts on the nervous system and causes :
<ul>
<LI>increases in heart rate <br>
<LI>increases in blood pressure<br>
<LI>constriction of blood vessels<br>
<LI>increased blood fatty acids and platelet stickiness.<br>
</ul>
<li>Carbon monoxide  as it avidly displaces oxygen from haemoglobin it produces a relative hypoxia that is particularly dangerous to those with precarious tissue oxygenation: eg in IHD (ischaemic heart disease) and PVD (peripheral vascular disease), especially in diabetics. It also has psychomotor performance effects.
<li>Tar  a carcinogenic substance containing more than a dozen cancer producing chemicals.<br>
<li>Glycoprotein  acts as an allergen.
<li>Nitrosamines  carcinogenic in animals and suspected to be so in humans.<br>
<li>Benzo(a)pyrene and phenols  known human carcinogens.
<li>Oxides of nitrogen  may induce and worsen emphysema.<br>
<li>Hydrogen cyanide  a particularly toxic agent in cigarette smoke which can impair cardiac function.

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch5 PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS">PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS</h2><p>
Most psychological and behavioural difficulties occur with the cessation of smoking and in the ambivalent phase leading up to the decision to quit. However, most withdrawal phenomena are short lived, and with continual abstinence, ex-smokers enjoy many positive psychological effects.<p>
Common psychological presentations of nicotine withdrawal:<br>
<ul>
<li>anxiety and tension
<li>irritability<br>
<li>frustration
<li>anger<br>
<li>difficulties with concentration and restlessness

<li>With increasing community disapproval of smoking, many workers report being ostracised at social events, restaurants, relatives and even at home especially where there are children.
<li>At work  impaired job performance secondary to illness, increased absenteeism and sick leave, psychological consequences of restlessness and impaired concentration as nicotine levels fall before cigarette breaks.
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch5 THE ADVANTAGES OF STOPPING SMOKING">THE ADVANTAGES OF STOPPING SMOKING</h2><p>
Ex-smokers live longer than those who continue to smoke. The extent to which life span improves depends on the length of time since quitting, number of cigarettes smoked over how many years and the health status of the ex-smoker.<p>
However, quitting is beneficial even in the presence of disease, eg patients with chronic obstructive airways disease will have improved lung function and symptomatology. Even lung cancer patients can help avoid second cancers and terminal respiratory infections. Of course, early cessation, with the support of education from health professionals and stop smoking programmes, will have greater health benefit by preventing the development of disease rather than its progression.<p>
Although health issues are often given as the main reason for stopping smoking, for those who have yet to develop disease these events may be far less relevant than social or financial issues, or the health of their family.<p>
Medical practitioners and other health care workers can help by emphasising the positive benefits of quitting. Discussion of withdrawal symptoms with the patient can also help them prepare for the process of quitting. It may be worthwhile for health professionals to think about their own behaviour and attitudes to smoking and how this affects their advice to patients.
<p>

<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch5 PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS OF SMOKING CESSATION">PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS OF SMOKING CESSATION</h2><p>
<ul>
<li>Increased life expectancy
<li>Improved health of family<br>
<li>Improved physical fitness and appearance 
<li>Improved sense of well being<br>
<li>Positive psychological changes; enhanced self esteem and sense of self control
<li>Improved social standing and finances<br>
<li>Restoration of sense of taste and smell
<li>Better work performance.
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch5 WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS">WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS</h2><p>
It should be emphasised that most of these are short lived when discussing them with the patient (eg symptoms usually peak about 3 days after cessation and the withdrawal, usually mild, is over within 7-10 days for most people). Discussion of withdrawal symptoms is not to discourage the uncommitted from the attempt, but rather to help the patient be better prepared for quitting, especially if it is his or her first attempt.<br>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch5 WITHDRAWAL psycological">Psychological symptoms</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>Intense cravings for cigarettes  they are usually brief (10-15 minutes) and tend to recede with time
<li>Irritability and restlessness<br>
<li>Impatience
<li>Dejection and sorrow  it is not uncommon to report a sense of grief and mourning for a 'lost companion'<br>
<li>Depression
<li>Difficulty in concentrating<br>
<li>Anxiety and tension
<li>Frustration<br>
<li>Anger 
<li>Fatigue.
</ul>
<p>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch5 WITHDRAWAL physical">Physical symptoms</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>Sore throat
<li>Dizziness<br>
<li>Headache
<li>Coughing  often productive, as the respiratory cilia are no longer paralysed and can clear the lungs of accumulated debris<br>
<li>Tremor, perspiration
<li>Floating feeling  distance judgement may be affected<br>
<li>Increased effect of caffeine
<li>Sleep disturbance<br>
<li>Increased appetite  'looking for the cigarette in the fridge'.<p>
Weight gain should be brought up specifically as it is often an unspoken fear in women. Only half of smokers will gain weight of which the average is 2.3 kg. It is said that a weight gain of 30 kg is needed to offset the health benefits of quitting. Positive changes in lipid profile and body fat distribution also occur. The patient can be encouraged to avoid weight gain with an exercise programme and have low kilojoule prepared snacks at hand.
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<h2>HOW MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE WORKERS CAN HELP
<br></h2><p>

<h3>Individual approaches</h3><p>
A good start is to document each patient's smoking history as part of general history-taking on initial presentation. When time allows, the patient can be encouraged to talk about their smoking using a non-judgemental question such as, 'How do you feel about your smoking?' A helpful model to use when assessing the smoker's readiness to quit identifies three stages:<br>
<ol>
<li>Not ready  They are likely to become defensive and resistant to simple advice to stop. Gentle encouragement of the patient to think about their habit and making it clear that you are available for further support is the most effective approach.<p>
<li>Unsure  The advantages of continuing to smoke are still as important as the advantages of quitting. Discussion can focus on weighing up the pros and cons and any other specific concerns.<p>
<li>Ready  They will respond positively to advice to stop and can be given more specific help on how to deal with withdrawal symptoms. Provide follow-up to encourage their efforts and deal with continuing difficulties (Mendelssohn and Richmond, 1992).<p>
</ol>
It is therefore useful to identify how ready the patient is to change in order to provide the most appropriate individual assistance. An approach that helps the patient to take control and responsibility for the problem is more likely to be successful than systematically giving advice to stop or telling the patient what to do.<p>
<br>
<h3>Relapses</h3><p>
Many ex-smokers relapse, especially in the setting of social events, peer pressure and alcohol. Patients should be encouraged to view these as learning experiences, and to learn from there how to avoid future relapses when they try again. Subsequent attempts are often easier for this reason.<br>
<br>
<h3>Additional approaches</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>Nicotine chewing gum  useful for the very physically dependent. The chewing tablets can prevent withdrawal symptoms. The patient should follow the enclosed instructions carefully to avoid unpleasant side effects.
<li>Nicotine patches  useful for very physically dependent but motivated patients. Manufacturers emphasise the need for concomitant support from the medical practitioner.<br>
<li>Acupuncture
<li>Hypnosis<br>
<li>Specialist clinics
<li>Self-help and GP assistance kits.<br>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Resources available for the cessation of smoking</h3><p>

<li>If you smoke yourself, try to give up smoking or at least not smoke publicly.<br>
<li>Have a non-smoking policy in your workplace and other workplaces that you may visit.
<li>Be aware of the consequences of smoking, and know of the referral agencies available to help smokers.<br>
<li>Congratulate people when they finally break the habit.
<li>Sympathise and offer encouragement to those people who require additional support and time to give up smoking.<br>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch5 PASSIVE SMOKING">PASSIVE SMOKING</h2><p>
Recent evidence has come to light showing the harmful effects of tobacco smoke on the health of non-smokers.<p>
Cigarette smoke can be separated into two components, mainstream smoke which is inhaled by the active smoker, and sidestream smoke, the unfiltered smoke released from the end of a lit cigarette, which results in passive smoking in non-smokers.<p>
The dangers of passive smoking are highlighted by the knowledge that 85% of cigarette smoke is released as sidestream smoke. Since the sidestream smoke is unfiltered it contains higher concentrations of dangerous chemicals. The effects of this harmful smoke in non-smokers can lead to increased incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, and other chest illness in children, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, lung cancer and lung disease. In addition, the irritants in tobacco smoke are a major concern to people with asthma and people with allergies, especially of the eyes, nose and throat.<p>
Recent estimates suggest that annually approximately 150 deaths from lung cancer and 1000 deaths from heart disease in Australia are due to passive smoking (Holman, Armstrong, Arias et al., 1988).
<p>

<h3>Health risks of passive smoking</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>Higher concentrations of cancer-causing agents in sidestream smoke.
<li>Aggravation of asthma.<br>
<li>Aggravation of allergic conditions  cigarette smoke results in irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, and also headaches and coughs in non-smokers.
<li>Cancer, particularly lung cancer.<br>
<li>Respiratory illness is increased  noticeable in children of active smokers who suffer from more acute respiratory illness, wheezing, middle ear infections, sore throats and problems of lung infection.
<li>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.<br>
<li>Growth  may be a combination of the mother smoking during pregnancy, and passive smoking by the child after birth.
<li>Increased incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, and chest illness in adults and children.<br>
<li>Meningitis  recent studies indicate a possible association between meningococcal disease and passive smoking during childhood.
<li>Heart disease  increases the risk of coronary heart disease.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>At work</h3><p>
The legal ramifications of smoking in the workplace are now becoming apparent. In Australia there have been at least 10 cases since 1980 where workers have received compensation for injuries incurred as a result of passive smoking in the workplace. As a result increasing numbers of employers are making their workplaces smoke-free.

<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch7 INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2><p>
The universal term cannabis is used to identify the psychotropic product from the plant Cannabis sativa. <p>
Cannabis sativa is one of man's oldest cultivated plants, being used for its fibrous qualities (hemp) as well as its perceived medicinal properties. <p>

<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch7 CANNABINOIDS">CANNABINOIDS</h2><p>
The pharmacologically active compounds in cannabis are termed cannabinoids. The major active isolate in cannabis has been identified as D9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). As it is lipid soluble, it may remain in the body tissues for many days after a single dose.<p>
Recent studies have documented a number of health, social and psychological problems related to the regular use of cannabis. Major health concerns revolve around the knowledge that the cannabis of today is markedly (10-15 times) stronger than the cannabis used in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Consequently, previous studies examining the health and psychological risks associated with cannabis use, may not be valid today.<p>
Pharmacologic effects also differ according to the method of consumption. If cannabis is smoked a 'high' is attained much more quickly. In contrast, the effects of cannabis taken orally are much less potent, although more long-lasting. Additive effects are observed with alcohol and other CNS depressants, but no clear interaction has been noted with stimulants.<p>


<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch7 PHARMACOLOGY">PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p>
The major component of cannabis (THC) is fat soluble, which means it can remain for long periods in the fatty tissues of the body. Such lipid soluble drugs tend to leave the blood stream quickly and distribute themselves to fatty tissues, such as the brain and cell membranes<p>
Since THC becomes stored in body tissues and is only released into the blood stream over a period of days or weeks, accumulation of THC may occur. As a result of this accumulation, regular cannabis users may be under the influence of cannabis at any time, and be unaware of the dangers of this.<p>
Another concern is the possible accumulation of THC in the brain, which may in time result in brain damage.<p>


<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch7 EFFECTS OF CANNABIS">EFFECTS OF CANNABIS</h2><p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch8 INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2><p>
Cocaine is an alkaloid of the coca shrub and exhibits anaesthetic, vasoconstrictor and central stimulant properties. It has effects on a number of neurotransmitter systems in the brain and is active at many anatomical sites within the central nervous system.<p>


<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch8 PRODUCTION AND ADMINISTRATION">PRODUCTION AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p>
Cocaine is prepared from the coca plant and initially is in the form of a salt (cocaine hydrochloride). This salt can be inhaled into the nostril and absorbed into the bloodstream across the nasal mucosa.<p>
The cocaine salt can also be converted to the free base of cocaine with volatile solvents which must then be carefully removed. The free base cocaine is then burnt with inhalation of the smoke resulting in very rapid and efficient absorption across the alveolar membranes of the lungs.<p>
The third method of cocaine administration is intravenous injection of the cocaine salt.<p>
It is generally considered that most cocaine users begin with intra-nasal administration and later progress to injecting use or inhalation of smoke.<p>


<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch8 CURRENT PATTERNS OF USE">CURRENT PATTERNS OF USE</h2><p>
Cocaine was only discovered in Western Europe in the 19th century but had been used for centuries by South American Indians. In the past two decades consumption of cocaine has increased in America, Western Europe and more recently in Australia.<p>
In the mid-1980s ready made free base cocaine was marketed in the streets of American cities and became known as 'crack'. Crack, a much cheaper and more accessible version of cocaine, is widespread among lower socioeconomic groups particularly in the inner-city areas dominated by racial and ethnic minorities in the United States of America. In contrast, the users of the crystalline form of cocaine, which is inhaled, have generally been identified as those who are better educated and of a higher socioeconomic status. These socioeconomic differences, together with the different preparations of cocaine, pose problems when attempting to propose general treatment guidelines.<p>
Fox and Mathews (1992) report that in the United States, 25 000 000 people have used cocaine at least once with 6 000 000 Americans admitting use within the previous month and 3 000 000 using the drug continuously. Furthermore, 10% of pregnant women admitted to cocaine use at least once in the antenatal period.<p>
In Australia levels of use are much lower, with the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority 1988-1989 reporting figures of 84 500 users in the past 12 months and 6640 regular users. Contrary to popular perception, patterns of cocaine use in Australia have remained relatively stable between the years of 1985 and 1991. This is probably a consequence of the relative lack of availability and expense of cocaine. The only group in Australia to show an increase in use, were women in their early twenties and early thirties (Fox and Mathews, 1992).<p>
Cocaine is a highly addictive drug, although there is disagreement in the research as to whether cocaine produces physical withdrawal symptoms. In general, the research suggests that cocaine does not produce physical dependence and a withdrawal syndrome.<p>


<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch8 AT RISK GROUPS">AT RISK GROUPS</h2><p>
Generally, regular users of cocaine are a very small group in Australia and are largely confined to the more affluent groups in the cities. Those most at risk could include:<br>
<ul>
<li>those educated, most probably to university level
<li>higher socioeconomic status<br>
<li>single young people
<li>women in their late twenties and thirties.<p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch8 TOLERANCE AND DEPENDENCE">TOLERANCE AND DEPENDENCE</h2><p>
Cocaine dependence occurs without the specific physiological withdrawal symptoms observed with the abstinence of alcohol, benzodiazepines and opiates. Cocaine dependence is likely to develop within a social/occupational context.<p>
Initial tolerance to cocaine develops rapidly, but thereafter cocaine users seldom seem to develop tolerance for increased amounts. Tolerance may not be obvious because of the tendency to mix cocaine use with other drugs, in particular heroin (known as a speedball), to enhance effects.<p>


<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch8 WITHDRAWAL">WITHDRAWAL</h2><p>
Withdrawal from cocaine generally takes place in three phases. The first being 'the crash', which describes withdrawal symptoms experienced immediately after the cessation of use (usually the first 2-4 days of abstinence). Symptoms may include agitation, depression, high craving and fatigue. The second phase is that of withdrawal. This phase may last up to 10 weeks and is characterised by depression, lack of energy and anxiety, high craving and angry outbursts. The last phase, extinction, may last indefinitely and is characterised by episodic cravings for cocaine, usually in response to conditioned cues. Such cravings may surface many months or years after drug use has ceased (Gawin and Kleber, 1984). <p>
Other symptoms experienced during withdrawal may include:<br>
<ul>
<li>sleep disorders
<li>vivid dreams<br>
<li>hyperphagia
<li>irritability<br>
<li>nausea
<li>muscle aches<br>

There are no specific methods of treatment for users of this drug and management follows the general principles of management of other drugs.<p>
Treatment must take into account:<br>

</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch8 METHODS behav">Behavioural approach</h3><p>
Often known as contingency contracting, this method focuses and magnifies cocaine's aversive effects. It consists of the negotiation of an agreement between the doctor or health worker and patient regarding the consequences following any further administration of cocaine.<p>
The agreement usually takes the from of a written contract authorising the doctor or health worker to notify specific individuals  eg employer, spouse  of any confirmed consumption of cocaine.<p>
The patient must also agree to participate in a urine-monitoring program. Metabolites of cocaine can be detected in the urine samples for 48-72 hours after use, although cocaine itself is metabolised from the body within 30 minutes of ingestion.<p>
A problem with this approach is that few patients are willing to accept a contract which may link them with serious consequences following a relapse to cocaine use.<p>


<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch8 METHODS psychodynamic">Psychodynamic approach</h3><p>
Psychodynamic treatment aims to understand the functions that cocaine has played in the abuser's life and to help him or her serve these functions without drugs.<p>


<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch8 METHODS self-help">Self-help groups</h3><p>
Self-help groups provide structure, limits and a helping network.<p>
Self-help groups modelled upon lines of Alcoholics Anonymous have been developed in the United States (called Cocaine Anonymous). At this time there are no specific self-help groups in Australia for cocaine users. However, cocaine users could be helped by groups like Narcotics Anonymous (refer <a href="alc_c18.htm">Chapter 18, Community Support Services</a>).<p>


<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch8 METHODS combined">Combined approach</h3><p>
A combination of all three orientations  behavioural, supportive and psychodynamic  is probably the most common form of treatment for both inpatient and outpatient settings.<p>
Present and future hazards of this drug should be outlined to the patient and a treatment plan worked out with them.<p>
The use of tricyclic antidepressant drugs to reduce craving from cocaine has shown promise in experimental work in the United States. None of the other pharmacological approaches so far tested, however, appear to offer promise.<p>

</ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch9 INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2><p>
A volatile substance is a compound which gives off a vapour or fumes at room temperature. The recreational sniffing of gases and solvents has become relatively common, particularly among adolescents in Australia, with the mean age of solvent abusers being 12 to 15 years. Petrol sniffing is a particularly common practice among the youth of Aboriginal settlements in the outback.<p>
Volatile substances include petroleum fuels, propellants from aerosol products, chlorinated hydrocarbons, glue, nail polish remover, antifreeze, paint thinners and anaesthetic products. <p>
All of these substances are fat soluble and are stored in the fat deposits within the body, particularly in the brain. This leads to a prolonged effect on the level of consciousness even hours after the inhalation has stopped. This is an extremely dangerous practice and sudden death may occur even during the first usage.<p>


<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch9 ADMINISTRATION AND USE">ADMINISTRATION AND USE</h2><p>
Substances are generally placed into a plastic bag, or some other vessel, and placed directly over the nose and mouth and inhaled deeply. The effect of substances inhaled in this manner produces alterations in the level of consciousness including a pleasurable feeling of intoxication and visual hallucinations.<p>


<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch9 PROBLEMS">PROBLEMS</h2><p>

<li><a href="#alcohol hbk ch9 PROBLEMS physical">Physical effects</a><br>
<li><a href="#alcohol hbk ch9 PROBLEMS withdrawl">Withdrawal effects</a><p>
</ul>
The most important problem of volatile solvent use is the occurrence of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias due to intoxication. Respiratory depression can also occur.<p>
Pathological changes occurring in solvent abuse include myocardial damage and cerebral oedema.<p>
Another major concern with petrol sniffing is lead poisoning (except with the use of unleaded petrol). At this time there is no generally accepted means of treating organic lead poisoning, and the neurological and other manifestations of tetra-ethyl lead poisoning (TEL) absorption must be deemed to be effectively irreversible.<p>
There is general agreement that repeated exposure to solvents induces tolerance, though there are doubts about physical addiction; however, psychological dependence is common.<p>
<p>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch9 PROBLEMS behav">Behavioural indicators of use</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>Persistent truancy from school
<li>Unruly behaviour<br>
<li>Lack of attention (often identifiable in the classroom)
<li>Frequent use of handkerchiefs<br>
<li>Continual sniffing or sucking of shirt sleeves or jacket sleeves
<li>A change in sleep pattern<br>
<li>Truculent moody behaviour, difficult communication with parents or teachers.
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch9 PROBLEMS physical">Physical effects</h3><p>
The effects of a single use, whilst potentially very dangerous, usually wear off after a few hours and the cardiovascular symptoms predominate. The most common toxic effects are cardiac arrhythmias and asphyxia from enhancement of inhalation of volatile substances via the use of plastic bags etc. Chronic headache, sinusitis, diminished cognitive function, ataxia and peripheral neuropathy all accompany chronic use. The neurological sequelae convey the most long-term morbidity and disability. Other symptoms include:<br>
<ul>
<li>chronic or frequent cough
<li>tinnitus<br>
<li>chest pain or angina
<li>nosebleeds<br>
<li>extreme tiredness or weakness
<li>increased nasal secretions<br>
<li>red, watery eyes
<li>a dreamlike state with hallucinations<br>
<li>depression and/or anxiety
<li>shortness of breath<br>
<li>indigestion
<li>dizziness<br>
<li>stomach ulcers
<li>deep inhalation over short periods of time may cause disorientation, unconsciousness or seizures<br>
<li>the sniffing of some petrols may cause a particular type of lead poisoning, features of which are:
<ul>
<LI>liver damage<br>
<LI>acute and chronic inflammation of the kidneys and multiple abscesses<br>
<LI>cerebellar hemisphere degeneration<br>
<LI>inorganic lead poisoning causing anaemia and other effects on the blood.<p>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch9 PROBLEMS withdrawl">Withdrawal effects</h3><p>
Effects of inhalation are immediate, lasting from 5 to 45 minutes after cessation of sniffing. While initial effects may fade after several minutes, depending on the method of inhalation, effects may be felt for several hours. For most users effects will pass within an hour of ceasing inhalation of the volatile substance. Chronic users may experience withdrawal symptoms similar to those experienced from a general anaesthetic. Hangover effects may persist for several days, and may be characterised by:<br>
<ul>
<li>tremor
<li>headache<br>
<li>nausea
<li>vomiting<br>
<li>mild abdominal pain
<li>loss of appetite<br>
<li>fatigue
<li>muscular cramps<br>
<li>delirium.
</ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch9 THE MANAGEMENT OF ABUSERS OF VOLATILE SUBSTANCES">THE MANAGEMENT OF ABUSERS OF VOLATILE SUBSTANCES</h2><p>
As mentioned previously most users of volatile substances are young adolescents (12-15 years). While most abusers are recreational users and generally cease use of their own volition, in some groups there is predominantly chronic or dependent use, eg among Aboriginal youths.<p>
Management of abuse of volatile substances is extremely complex and calls for a multidisciplinary approach. The general practitioner plays a pivotal role through assessment, management and referral of the young user to appropriate counselling services. Community centres which provide drug counsellors in specific treatment areas should be found in the region in which the GP practices. Individual and group counselling can be provided which helps to develop some sharing of the problem with therapists, parents and others in the family.<p>
Health education explaining the dangers and the possible complications is important,  and should be followed by other forms of therapy such as vocational counselling. The development of social skills is also important.<p>
In some cases the use of computer games as a means of stimulating recreational activity has been found useful in those young people who are seeking and achieving abstinence from solvents. <p>
A video role-play approach has also been found to be helpful by using the role-play in discussions involving resolution of crisis and difficulties in relationships with parents or other members of the family. These films can be used in the education of other abusers of volatile substances. <p>
Hypnotherapy can be helpful, particularly for those who have developed excitability and emotional volatility, and who are difficult to handle because of the continuing abuse. However, hypnotherapy should be used only in conjunction with other techniques in aiming to change the behaviour and the personal and emotional background in which the solvent abuser lives.<p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch12 INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2><p>
Drug use in pregnancy should be reduced to a minimum. This is  because the embryo and foetus are more sensitive to the effects of all drugs. Rapidly developing tissues are particularly vulnerable. The placenta is not a barrier to the passage of most drugs, so it should be assumed that drugs taken during pregnancy will reach the foetus in at least small amounts. Pregnant women who are identified as using drugs should be referred for specialist management.<p>

<p>
<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch12 SPECIAL alcohol">Alcohol</h3><p>
It has been known for centuries that alcohol taken in excess during pregnancy may damage the foetus.<p>
The risks of prematurity, small for gestational age and miscarriage as well as a wide variety of congenital abnormalities are all trebled in drinkers, and these should be regarded as non-specific risks of alcohol consumption.<p>
The effects of alcohol on the foetal brain, however, are fairly specific and the following clinical points are important:<br>
<ol>
<li>The time of greatest sensitivity of the foetal brain is the third trimester, so that if the patient can achieve abstinence by then, the baby's brain may escape damage.<br>
<li>The foetal brain is exquisitely sensitive to alcohol during the third trimester and the first twelve months after birth. Epidemiological studies have failed to demonstrate a threshold dose for risk. Therefore total abstinence is the only responsible advice to give.<br>
<li>Foetal Alcohol Syndrome should only be diagnosed if the criteria are met (see below). Other foetal effects seen in association with alcohol should be called Foetal Alcohol Effects (FAE).<p>
Risk factors for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)<br>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol intake  the foetal effects of alcohol are related to quantity, frequency and timing of use. A single dose of more than 5 drinks very early in pregnancy or an average of 2 drinks per day in later pregnancy (second or third trimester) has been associated with subsequent learning difficulties in childhood (Streissguth, Barr and Sampson, 1990).
<li>Nutritional status of the mother  those who are undernourished can attain higher blood alcohol levels and decrease their capacity to metabolise alcohol<br>
<li>Parity  short intervals between births has been found to be associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations and severity of FAS
<li>Alcohol-related conditions that may complicate pregnancy:<br>
<ul>
<LI>cirrhosis<br>
<LI>other liver problems<br>
<LI>anaemia<br>
<LI>gastritis<br>
<LI>gastrointestinal bleeding<br>
<LI>delirium tremens<br>
<LI>diabetes<br>
<LI>pancreatitis<br>
<LI>sexually transmitted diseases<br>
<LI>tuberculosis.<br>
</ul>
<li>Multiple drug use  women who drink heavily are also more likely to smoke heavily and possibly to use other drugs, all of which may have a cumulative harmful effect on the developing foetus
<li>Medication  alcohol reduces the effectiveness of anaesthetics and analgesics<br>
<li>Increased risk of spontaneous abortion  with heavy and even moderate alcohol consumption
<li>Increased risk of complicated birth  higher risk of breech birth (15% as opposed to 3%).<p>
</ul>
<b>Characteristics of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)</b><p>
A diagnosis of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome requires: <a href="alc_fn.htm#(9)">(9)</a><br>
<ol>
<li>growth retardation<br>
<ul>
<LI>prenatal and/or postnatal growth retardation<br>
<LI>weight and/or height below the 10th percentile when corrected for gestational age.<br>
</ul>
<li>CNS abnormalities<br>
<ul>
<LI>eg neurological abnormality, developmental delay, behavioural dysfunction or deficit, intellectual impairment and/or structural abnormalities such as microcephaly or brain malformation.<br>
</ul>
<li>facial abnormalities<br>
<ul>
<LI>underdevelopment of the 'middle 1/3' of the face including short palpebral fissures, an elongation mid-face, a long and flattened philtrum, thin upper lip and flattened maxilla.<p>
</ul></ul>
Other abnormalities include:<br>
<ul>
<li>increased neonatal death rate
<li>slow physical development in the first few years of life<br>
<li>other physical features
<ul>
<LI>cardiac defects<br>
<LI>ear anomalies<br>
<LI>large haemangiomata<br>
<LI>small nails<br>
<LI>altered palmar crease patterns<br>
<LI>joint and limb abnormalities.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch12 SPECIAL tobacco">Tobacco</h3><p>
Smoking during and after pregnancy can have many adverse effects on the child. <p>
The most important toxin in tobacco smoke is nicotine which has been shown to impair placental function by:<br>
<ul>
<li>reduced placental vascularisation
<li>constriction of placental arterioles<br>
<li>thickening of the endothelium of placental blood vessels<p>
thus interfering with placental well being and maturity as well as nutrient transfer. Carbon monoxide levels in the mother also reduces oxygen availability for foetal tissues.<p>
Health risks of smoking during pregnancy<br>
<li>Retardation in foetal growth; on average a reduction in birth weight of 200 g.
<li>It should be highlighted to women that smoking cessation is still beneficial to the foetus at any time during the pregnancy. <br>
<li>Those women who stop smoking before becoming pregnant have babies of similar birth weight to women who have never smoked.<br>
<li>Women who stop smoking in the initial 3-4 months of pregnancy and abstain for the rest of the pregnancy have similar weight babies as non-smoking women.<br>
<li>Even women who stop as late as week 30 of their pregnancy have heavier babies than those women who smoke throughout the entire pregnancy.<br>
<li>The risk of low birth weight increases by about a third in mothers who continue to regularly smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day after the fourth month of pregnancy.<br>
<li>Congenital malformation  an association has been found between smoking and cleft palate, microcephalus and club foot.
<li>Spontaneous abortion  higher rates in women who smoke and is also related to the number of cigarettes smoked.<br>
<li>Effects on foetal heart rate  nicotine increases the baby's heart rate and carbon monoxide results in impaired oxygen transport.
<li>Paternal and passive smoking also has a harmful effect on the unborn child.<br>
<li>Maternal undernutrition.
<li>The risk of harmful effects to the foetus is greater in older mothers who smoke than in younger mothers who smoke.<br>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Perinatal risks</b><p>
<ul>
<li>Increased risk of perinatal mortality (about 35%)
<ul>
<LI>greater incidence of placenta praevia, abruptio placentae, ante partum haemorrhage and premature delivery<br>
<LI>higher incidence of complications during pregnancy can result in increased likelihood of stillbirths, asphyxia, pneumonia, prematurity and neonatal deaths from respiratory distress syndrome<br>
<LI>these risks are partly as a consequence of the absorption of harmful chemicals through the placenta, the most important toxin being carbon monoxide.<br>
</ul>
</ul>
<b>Infant risks</b><p>
<li>Respiratory disorders
<ul>
<LI>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome<br>
<LI>increased incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, acute otitis media and persistent middle ear effusions, eye, nose and throat disorders and impaired lung development<br>
<LI>parents and others who smoke can cause as well as aggravate disorders such as asthma, wheezing, and allergies in their children.<br>
</ul>
<li>Long-term body growth  smoking during and after pregnancy may affect the attainment of final height and also retard the growth of head and chest circumference.
<li>Increased risk of febrile seizures.<br>
<li>School performance may be retarded through repeated absences due to illness, malaise and hearing problems.
<li>Increased risk of meningococcal infection.<br>
<li>Increased problems for children with cystic fibrosis.
<li>Babies can also be at risk from mothers who smoke and breast feed<br>
<ul>
<LI>smoking reduces breast milk supply<br>
<LI>nicotine can pass into the child's bloodstream from the breast milk<br>
<LI>breast milk is still beneficial to the child, since it protects from infection, but many smoking mothers are unaware of the transmission of harmful chemicals to the child through their breast milk.<br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Foetal Tobacco Syndrome</b><p>
'Foetal Tobacco Syndrome'<PW:Popup,2.60417,1.65625>Wakefield, M. and Wilson, D. <i>Smoking during pregnancy: a literature review and working paper of the options for intervention</i>. South Australian Health Commission, Adelaide, 1988<LT>(10)</a> is a name that has been given to the growth retardation associated with maternal smoking.<p>
The term can be used when at least three of the four conditions listed below occur:<br>
<ol>
<li>The mother smoked 5 or more cigarettes per day throughout the pregnancy<br>
<li>The mother had no evidence of hypertension during pregnancy specifically:<br>
<ul>
<LI>no preeclampsia<br>
<LI>documentation of normal blood pressure at least once after the first trimester<br>
</ul>
<li>The newborn has symmetrical growth retardation at term (37 weeks), defined as:<br>
<ul>
<LI>a birthweight less than 2 500 g<br>
<LI>a ponderal index [(weight in grams)/(length in centimetres)3 x 100] greater than 2.32<br>
</ul>
<li>There are no other obvious causes of intrauterine growth retardation (eg congenital infection or anomaly).<p>
</ul>
Other risks to children<br>
<ul>
<li>Poisoning  by cigarettes and cigarette ash
<li>Burns and eye injuries from lit cigarettes<br>
<li>Matches and lighters  can cause serious accidents
<li>Role models  children are more likely to smoke if their parents do.<p>
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch12 SPECIAL cannabis">Cannabis</h3><p>
A specific concern with cannabis is the cumulative effect of _9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and how this may affect the child before and after birth. THC, the most active component of cannabis accumulates in the fatty tissues of the brain. At this stage of our knowledge it is difficult to ascertain a causal relationship between cannabis and damage to the foetus, often because mothers use combinations of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis. Health risks pertaining to cannabis use during pregnancy should be considered possible and a conservative approach taken.<p>
Several abnormalities of foetal development have been reported when pregnant women have used cannabis heavily. It must be emphasised that there is a high prevalence of cigarette and alcohol intake in association with cannabis use. Therefore it is difficult to differentiate the direct effects of cannabis.<p>
Suggested health risks of smoking cannabis during pregnancy<br>
<ul>
<li>Lower birth weights, length and head circumference
<li>Possible impairment of foetal brain development<br>
<li>Relative prematurity
<li>Malformations <br>
<ul>
<LI>toxic effects of the drug may possibly cause foetal anomalies<br>
</ul>
<li>Higher rate of miscarriage and perinatal death
<li>Cannabis use may reduce the foetal blood supply<br>
<li>Cannabis may exacerbate other risk factors in pregnancy
<li>THC accumulates in breast milk<br>
<ul>
<LI>may diminish milk supply.<br>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Effects observed in newborns</b><p>
<ul>
<li>Lethargic and slow to gain weight
<li>Increased startle reflex<br>
<li>Tremors
<li>Poor self-quieting<br>
<li>Failure to habituate to light
<li>Possible long-term developmental and behavioural effects are yet unknown.<p>
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch12 SPECIAL opiates">Opiates</h3><p>
Regular use of illicit opiates endangers the health of the woman and her foetus through continual change in blood heroin levels, exposure to a diverse range of drugs and contaminants, and infections consequent upon injecting drug use. Due to lifestyle factors associated with opiate dependency, pregnant women in this population do not usually have adequate nutrition, necessary rest or sufficient antenatal care.<p>
Health risks of taking opiates during pregnancy<p>
General medical risks associated with injecting drug use that may affect the health and development of the foetus:<br>
<ul>
<li>HIV
<li>hepatitis B and hepatitis C<br>
<li>endocarditis
<li>malnutrition<br>
<li>anaemia
<li>sexually transmitted diseases.<br>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Obstetric complications</b><p>
<ul>
<li>Increased risk of miscarriage
<li>Increased risk of intrauterine growth retardation<br>
<li>Increased risk of other obstetric complications  placental insufficiency, foetal distress, intrauterine death
<li>Risk of physical dependence in the foetus and subsequent withdrawal in the neonate (known as Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome)<br>
<li>Opiate withdrawal or detoxification during pregnancy may induce abortion, or premature labour/foetal distress particularly before the 14th week or after the 32nd week respectively. If withdrawal is to be attempted it ideally should be undertaken between the 14th and 32nd weeks under close supervision.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Opiate management options for pregnant drug-dependent women</b><p>
Opiate-dependent women generally have two management options:<br>
<ul>
<li>reduce opiate intake independently or attempt detoxification. Such a task is enormously difficult and results in many users returning to opiate use. Constantly changing states of intoxication and withdrawal can stress the foetus, particularly in the first and third trimesters
<li>enrol in a methadone maintenance program.<br>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Advantages of methadone maintenance programs</b><p>
<ul>
<li>It provides the woman with a daily dose of methadone which eliminates the fluctuating heroin blood levels experienced by mother and foetus during illicit opiate use.
<li>Women in methadone maintenance programs tend to have longer pregnancies, fewer obstetrical complications and infants who are larger for their gestational age than similar populations not in treatment (Giles et al., 1989).<br>
<li>Methadone maintenance programs dramatically reduce the possibility of foetal exposure to unknown drugs and contaminants.
<li>Enrolment in methadone maintenance programs may provide the woman with sufficient antenatal care and parenting education and support. This is important for a population who are often highly stigmatised and unsupported.<br>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS)</b><p>
<ul>
<li>Many infants born to methadone-maintained women will experience some form of withdrawal, usually within 72 hours of birth.
<li>Such withdrawal is characterised by agitation, irritability, or by vomiting, diarrhoea or convulsions in extremely severe cases.<br>
<li>This abstinence syndrome tends to respond well to morphine or phenobarbitone.
<li>Women who are stable on methadone maintenance programs should be encouraged to breastfeed. The amount of methadone in breast milk is minute and unlikely to harm the infant in the first three to six months of life. When breastfeeding is ceasing, the infant must be weaned slowly as there is a risk of withdrawal.<p>
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch12 SPECIAL barbituates">Barbiturates</h3><p>
Health risks of taking barbiturates during pregnancy<br>
<ul>
<li>Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome 
<li>Increased risk of congenital malformations such as dysmorphic facial features, digital hypoplasia and growth retardation.<p>
</ul>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch12 SPECIAL cocaine">Cocaine</h3><p>
Neurobehavioural abnormalities develop in the children of cocaine-addicted mothers. These children show signs of deficiencies in mood control and abnormal motor development. In addition, such infants may develop a non-specific syndrome of cocaine withdrawal.<p>
<br>
<b>Health risks of taking cocaine during pregnancy</b><p>
<ul>
<li>Increased risk of ante partum haemorrhage and abruptio placentae
<li>Significantly increases the rate of spontaneous abortions<br>
<li>Smaller head circumference and body length
<li>Intrauterine growth retardation<br>
<li>Restrictions in foetal growth have been observed which may be due to reduced oxygen supply to the baby caused by the blood vessel-constricting properties of such drugs
<li>Premature birth.<br>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Effects observed in newborn</b><p>
<ul>
<li>Excessive tremulousness
<li>Irritability<br>
<li>Hypertonia
<li>Labile skin circulation with colour changes<br>
<li>Persistent pulmonary hypertension
<li>Increased incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome<br>
<li>Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome
<ul>
<LI>depressed interactive behaviour<br>
<LI>excessive sleep<br>
<LI>poor feeding.<p>
</ul>
</ul>
A number of adverse effects upon the offspring of crack cocaine users have been reported overseas. These include transient neurological symptoms, which occur as a result of crack inhalation during pregnancy or passively after birth. <p>
<p>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch12 SPECIAL amphetamines">Amphetamines</h3><p>
The extent of harm associated with amphetamine use is unclear. Research is made difficult by the confounding effects of other drug use, poor nutritional status and lack of information on the frequency and dose of drug used (Wickes, 1992).<p>
Health risks of taking amphetamines during pregnancy<br>
<ul>
<li>There is a possible link between amphetamine use and congenital abnormalities
<li>Increased risk of spontaneous abortion<br>
<li>Placental abruption
<li>Premature labour<br>
<li>Foetal distress
<li>Small-for-date babies and growth-retarded babies<br>
<li>Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome
<ul>
<LI>excessive sleep<br>
<LI>decreased interactive behaviour<br>
<LI>poor feeding.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch12 SPECIAL benzodiazepines">Benzodiazepines</h3><p>
Health risks of taking benzodiazepines during pregnancy<br>
<ul>
<li>Some benzodiazepines may cause respiratory depression, hypotonia, poor feeding and impaired thermogenesis in the neonate  floppy baby syndrome
<li>Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, particularly if used in conjunction with other drugs.
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch12 SPECIAL lsd">LSD</h3><p>
Health risks of taking LSD during pregnancy<p>
The evidence is confusing and conflicting due to the difficulties with research as mentioned before.<p>
<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch12 SPECIAL ecstasy">Ecstasy</h3><p>
Little is known about the effects of the use of ecstasy on foetal development. The majority of evidence is based on animal studies.<p>
Health risks of taking ecstasy during pregnancy<p>
As yet, no study has been reported citing risks of ecstasy use during pregnancy. Since ecstasy is derived from amphetamine, the risks associated with amphetamine use during pregnancy would probably apply here also.<p>
<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch12 SPECIAL solvents">Solvents and other volatile hydrocarbons</h3><p>
Volatile organic solvents have been shown to have teratogenic effects on the growing foetus, such as physical malformations or functional impairment.<p>
Health risks of inhaling solvents during pregnancy<br>
<ul>
<li>Inhaled solvents reduce oxygen levels in body tissue thus reducing oxygen supply to the foetal brain
<li>Solvent inhalation may cause neonatal renal problems<br>
<li>Exposure to some inhalants may decrease body weight and size
<li>Some solvents are embryotoxic<br>
<li>Damage reproductive cells and thus impair future conception and pregnancy
<li>At high doses can cause the death of the foetus or even the mother<br>
<li>Cleft palate
<li>Prenatal exposure may affect learning in early childhood.<p>
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch12 SPECIAL caffeine">Caffeine</h3><p>
Health risks of taking caffeine during pregnancy<br>
<ul>
<li>There may be an association between lower birth-weight and drinking in excess of five cups of coffee or tea, or six cans of cola drinks a day.
<li>Irregular foetal heart rate may be associated with excessive amounts of caffeine intake late in pregnancy.<br>
<li>Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome has been observed in babies whose mothers used excessive amounts of caffeine.

<h1><a name="14. Detoxification and management of withdrawal"></a>14    detoxification and management of withdrawal</h1><p>
Detoxification can be defined as the means by which the drug-dependent person may withdraw from the effects of that drug in a supervised way in order that withdrawal symptoms and the risks relating to withdrawal are minimised.<br>
<ul>

</ul>
<br>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch14 SHOULD DETOX">Should detoxification occur at home or in the hosptipal?</h2><p>
In many instances effective detoxification can be performed in the home supported by the local doctor and other health workers. This should be considered when:<br>
<ul>
<li>there is no evidence of severe withdrawal, eg tremor, hallucinations, disorientation
<li>where there is no past history of delirium tremens or of fits<br>
<li>in the presence of supportive relatives who elect to stay with the patient during the period of detoxification
<li>where there is no evidence of a medical illness such as pneumonia or pancreatitis<br>
<li>when no previous history or evidence of suicide is contemplated
<li>where the patient does not have any access to the drug from which they are being withdrawn.<p>
These criteria mainly relate to detoxification from alcohol. 
</ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch14 DETOXIFICATION FROM ALCOHOL">DETOXIFICATION FROM ALCOHOL
<br></h2><p>
<h3>Should detoxification be medicated?</h3><p>
That is, assisted by the use of controlled sedatives, or non-medicated in which no sedation is required.<br>
<ul>
<li>Non-medicated detoxification is quite appropriate for patients who have no coexisting medical disorders and when only a mild withdrawal can be anticipated. 
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Non-medicated detoxification</h3><p>
This process should be carried out in a safe environment, ideally in a quiet and comfortable home environment. <br>
<ul>
<li>The therapist involved must take a very low key and empathetic approach to the patient, and all guidelines should be explained very clearly both to the patient and his or her family. It is important to avoid confrontation and arguments during this management process. 
<li>The therapist should regularly assess the orientation of the patient and his or her relationship with their environment. <br>
<li>It is necessary to explain the illusions or hallucinations and when they occur to assist in controlling the anxiety produced by them. 
<li>A balanced diet with daily use of oral thiamine is advised in all cases. 
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Medicated detoxification from alcohol</h3><p>
In the more severe cases medication is important and sedative treatment should be titrated against the severity of the patients withdrawal symptoms and signs. At no time should drug therapy be given to those patients who are still intoxicated.<p>
There are two main approaches:<p>
Tapering withdrawal regimen<br>
<ul>
<li>During mild withdrawal:
<ul>
<LI>sedate the patient for the first 24 hours<br>
<LI>administer 5-10 mg of diazepam every 6-8 hours as required<br>
<LI>reduce this dosage over 5-7 days.<br>
<li>In more severe cases:
<LI>10-20 mg of diazepam, 6 hourly, reduced over a 5-7 day period.<p>
Loading dose<br>
</ul>
<li>The principle of this form of management is to use a loading dose in the first 48 hours and follow that with a reduction over the next 5-10 days. 
<li>In mild withdrawal 5-10 mg of diazepam should be given every 6-8 hours as required by the patient's symptoms. In more severe cases a loading dose of 20 mg of diazepam may be given every two hours until sedation is achieved. <br>
<li>    No further medication is then given and the patient's signs reviewed on a four-hourly basis. No more than 120 mg should be given in the first 12 hours. On subsequent days 5-10 mg every six hours may be required but in most cases this is unnecessary.<br>
<li>    Diazepam is the drug of choice because both it and its metabolites have a long half-life:<br>
<ul>
<LI>diazepam has a half-life of 18-40 hours<br>
<LI>active metabolites have a half-life of 2 to 5 days.<br>
<PS:"bordpara-indent+">    Because of this a sufficient loading dose will usually be enough to cover the whole withdrawal period.<br>
</ul>
<li>Barbiturates and major tranquillisers should not be used in the management of alcohol withdrawal. There is also little value in the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs such as propranolol. Although these do produce some sedation there is a definite risk of inducing hyperglycemia and hypertension. 
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Other aspects of management</h3><p>
Vitamin therapy<p>
All patients treated for withdrawal from alcohol should receive thiamin to prevent the onset of Wernicke's Encephalopathy. An intravenous or intramuscular dose of 100 mg of thiamin immediately should be given and then orally 100 mg two to three times a day for two weeks. <p>
Electrolyte and fluid balance<p>
The fluid state of patients should be carefully assessed and a watchful eye kept for fluid depletion or fluid overload.<p>


<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch14 DETOXIFICATION FROM BENZODIAZEPINES">DETOXIFICATION FROM BENZODIAZEPINES</h2><p>
Withdrawal of benzodiazepines can be performed on an outpatient basis. This would need to occur over six weeks but in some cases this may be increased to 10-15 weeks. <br>
<ul>Withdrawal is managed by using a long-acting benzodiazepine such as diazepam in a dose relevant to that of the drug in question. The following guidelines should be followed:<br>
<ul>
<LI>a detailed history of total daily benzodiazepine use should be accurately determined<br>
<LI>the equivalent dose of diazepam should be calculated<br>
<LI>substitute diazepam (which has a long half-life) for other benzodiazepines<br>
<LI>maintain this dose for one week (ie stabilise the patient on this dosage)<br>
<LI>after stabilisation gradually withdraw the patient by 2.5-5 mg per week<br>
<LI>regular review and advice must be given to the patient at this difficult time<br>
<LI>cessation of the last few milligrams of diazepam can be very difficult for the patient. They may require support and encouragement particularly at this time<br>
<LI>refer to the NHMRC booklet on benzodiazepine dependence for more information (Brayley, Bradshaw and Pols, 1991).<p>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch14 DETOXIFICATION FROM OTHER SEDATIVES/HYPNOTIC DRUGS">DETOXIFICATION FROM OTHER SEDATIVES/HYPNOTIC DRUGS</h2><p>
The doctor's role in the community is firstly to prevent dependence by judicious and limited prescribing of sedatives and hypnotics for specific clinical situations on a short-term basis, and to manage the detoxification of those who have established dependence on these drugs.<br>
<ul>
<li>The withdrawal syndrome from the effect of barbiturates and other sedative hypnotics ranges in severity from mild anxiety, weakness, sweating and insomnia to an acute syndrome resembling delirium tremens. The latter may include convulsions, hallucinations and gross tremor and sweating.<p>
Such a withdrawal state may occur in those who are taking short-acting barbiturates, but often may be delayed several days in those who are taking longer-acting preparations such as phenobarbitone. Other symptoms and signs that may occur are hypertension, abdominal cramps, and anorexia.<p>
It is necessary to withdraw such patients on long-term sedation. At the outset a decision should be made whether formal detoxification is required. <p>
<li>Formal detoxification from high dose barbiturates is potentially dangerous and should be carried out in a hospital setting. Phenobarbitone equivalents should be calculated, and withdrawal proceeded with a reduction in dose of 10-15% daily. Anticonvulsant cover may be indicated.
<li>In patients taking therapeutic doses of hypnotics at night it is usually safe to stop the drug and for a few days replace it with an equivalent dose of a long acting benzodiazepine, similar to that used for withdrawal from benzodiazepine dependence. The principle is to then wean the patient on a gradual basis. In the base of barbiturates, help should be sought from a drug and alcohol specialist before attempting detoxification.<p>
Such detoxification can be achieved in the home, but in patients with more severe dependence hospitalisation in a detoxification unit is advised.<p>
</ul>
<p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch14 DETOXIFICATION FROM OPIATES">DETOXIFICATION FROM OPIATES</h2><p>
The most common opiate in use today is heroin. <br>
<ul>
<li>Withdrawal from heroin occurs within 4-6 hours of the last administered dose.<p>
Symptoms include nasal stuffiness and rhinorrhoea, sweating and lacrimation. Anxiety, restlessness and irritability follow, and over the next 36 hours chills and muscle cramps, particularly intestinal cramps, may occur. Vomiting and diarrhoea are also common at this stage. <p>
<li>The 'cold turkey' withdrawal without any medication will usually run a course of between 5-10 days depending upon the size of the patient's habit.<p>
In general the withdrawal syndrome from opiates is much less severe than withdrawal from sedative drugs or alcohol.<p>
<li>Outpatient management of detoxification can be successfully used but should take place over 10-14 days. Patients need to be seen each day and be given only a 24 hour supply of their medication; this should be reviewed on a daily basis.<p>
A combination of clonidine and diazepam is recommended. <p>
<ul>
<LI>Clonidine (Catapres) 150-130 micrograms 6 hourly up to 8 days.<br>
<LI>Diazepam (eg Valium) six hourly for 4 days should be given.<br>
<LI>Hourly review is required to check on withdrawal symptoms and blood pressure (daily review for outpatients).<br>
<LI>On day 4 the patient should be reassessed and the dose of each drug may be able to be gradually reduced over the following 10-14 days.<br>
<LI>When the withdrawal is more severe inpatient management is required.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch14 DETOXIFICATION FROM POLYDRUG USE">DETOXIFICATION FROM POLYDRUG USE</h2><p>
Because of the complexities of the pharmacology involved in polydrug use and abuse it is unwise to contemplate withdrawal except in an inpatient environment. <p>


<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch14 DETOXIFICATION FROM CANNABIS">DETOXIFICATION FROM CANNABIS</h2><p>
There is not a lot of evidence to support the idea that there is a cannabis withdrawal syndrome. This does not mean that it is easy for some people to stop using cannabis. <p>
Cessation of use may be situationally determined to a large degree. The presence of particular cues may lead to cannabis use. Cues may be internal or external. External cues may include mixing with a cannabis using group, a joint being shared or cannabis smoke at a party. Feeling bored, despondent or unhappy are all examples of internal cues which may lead to cannabis use.<p>


<h3>Management</h3><p>
Management should follow the general principles of detoxification:<br>
<ul>
<li>help to assess patient motivation
<li>weigh up the costs and benefits of stopping<br>
<li>identify the cues which lead to cannabis use
<li>devise a management plan for change.
</ul>
<p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch14 DETOXIFICATION FROM TOBACCO">DETOXIFICATION FROM TOBACCO</h2><p>
Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances known (see <a href="#5 tobacco">Chapter 5, Tobacco</a>). Any person smoking 20 or more cigarettes per day will experience nicotine withdrawal. This physical withdrawal is one aspect of relapse in smoking cessation.<p>


<h3>Withdrawal</h3><p>
The recommendations of Richmond and Webster (1988) present a very useful approach to assisting patients to quit. There are a number of  important principles:<br>
<ul>
<li>people have different levels of readiness for change
<li>people should be offered the opportunity to take each step which progresses to quitting and staying stopped<br>
<li>people need to weigh up the costs and benefits of smoking and quitting
<li>people should be assisted to develop a specific action plan including written advice and information<br>
<li>people should be offered support to quit: at home, at work and by health workers
<li>people are assisted by systematic follow up<br>
<li>people may need specific help to stay stopped, eg nicotine gum, lifestyle counselling.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Various approaches</h3><p>
The 'happy user'  <p>
These people should be informed about the risks to which they expose themselves and others. Provide written material to reinforce the information you have told them.<p>
Those thinking about quitting  <p>
These people can be assisted by encouraging them to:<br>
<ul>
<li>review their tobacco use.
<li>estimating their nicotine dependence<br>
<li>weigh up costs and benefits of smoking and quitting
<li>provide them with verbal and written information about stopping.<p>
Those who have decided to quit  <p>
These people can be helped to do so by:<br>
<li>helping them assess their specific risk factors
<ul>
<LI>habit patterns<br>
<LI>nicotine dependence<br>
<LI>high risk situations<br>
<LI>their confidence in stopping<br>
</ul>
<li>helping them to develop a specific plan
<ul>
<LI>set a quit day<br>
<LI>anticipate craving and withdrawal<br>
<LI>identify situations when there may be a temptation to smoke (eg with coffee, alcohol, when stressed)<br>
<LI>devise tactics to assist in coping with withdrawal symptoms:<p>
Delay:     a tactic to reduce feelings of panic or anxiety, by continually delaying having a cigarette. After a few days craving will lessen and a sense of achievement and confidence will emerge.<p>
Distract:    make a conscious effort to do something when a craving emerges. This may include counting, exercise, working, eating, drinking etc.<p>
Avoid:     for the first two weeks try to avoid those high risk situations, triggers or cues which may produce craving for a cigarette. These may include coffee, alcohol, the pub/club, smoking friends etc. Over time these situations will be able to be faced with confidence.<p>
Escape:     from situations that produce cravings when the tactics above fail. Leave the room, go outside or make a phone call. Such action will lower the urge to smoke and previous activities can be continued.<p>
</ul>
<li>providing them with verbal and written information on how to stop smoking
<li>planning with your patient ways to cope with a relapse. Explain that relapse is common and encourage them to try again or refer them to a specialist stop smoking clinic<br>
<li>some patients may prefer to use a nicotine gum. Carefully explain the most effective way to gain results through this form of management. In particular, stress the need to chew the gum slowly and persist with the treatment for three months. Many people who have not found this form of treatment successful have not used the gum as instructed.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Staying stopped</h3><p>
These people can be assisted by:<br>
<ul>
<li>providing support and encouragement
<li>helping them identify the most difficult situations<br>
<ul>
<LI>habitual smoking<br>
<LI>situational smoking<br>
<LI>pessimistic thinking<br>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch14 DETOXIFICATION FROM PSYCHOSTIMULANTS">DETOXIFICATION FROM PSYCHOSTIMULANTS <a href="alc_fn.htm#(11)">(11)</a></h2><p>
Detoxification from psychostimulants is generally effective using non-pharmacological management techniques. While abstinence is the preferred treatment goal, there is no evidence to suggest that tapered withdrawal is any less effective in the cessation of psychostimulant use. All patients undertaking detoxification should be encouraged to abstain from the use of other mind-altering drugs, such as alcohol or marijuana, which may act as triggers or conditioned cues for the use of psychostimulant drugs or reduce the ability of the individual to cope with cravings experienced during withdrawal.<p>
While most patients can undertake detoxification in an outpatient program, inpatient treatment may be more appropriate in the following circumstances:<br>
<ul>
<li>evidence of polydrug dependence
<li>where severe withdrawal is anticipated<br>
<li>medical complications requiring close observation or treatment
<li>psychiatric complications (eg psychotic, suicidal)<br>
<li>absence of social supports
<li>failed outpatient treatment<br>
<li>specific therapies eg introducing cue exposure.<p>
Where inpatient treatment is necessary, programs should be tailored to the specific needs of the patient. While the goals of individuals will differ, all patients should remain in inpatient care until withdrawal symptoms subside.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Non-pharmacological treatments</h3><p>
There are a number of options available, all of which will not be appropriate for all patients.<br>
<ul>
<li>Motivational interviewing
<li>Behavioural approaches<br>
<LI>relaxation techniques<br>
<LI>undertake activities to delay cravings<br>
<LI>develop cognitive techniques which encourage the individual, and discourage the use of drugs<br>
<LI>encourage relapse prevention techniques (eg identifying, avoiding and dealing with high risk situations; learning to say no) <br>
<LI>contingency contracting techniques have been effective in reducing ambivalence toward ceasing cocaine use. The use of positive contingencies to reward non-use has shown increased participation and improved outcomes.<br>
<li>Supportive therapy  the aim of this treatment is to educate the user about the realities of their drug use and its consequences. A number of lifestyle changes may be recommended:
<ul>
<LI>dissociation from other drug users<br>
<LI>the disposal of drug-using equipment<br>
<LI>encourage identification, avoidance and coping techniques to deal with high risk situations<br>
</ul>
<li>Psychotherapy/counselling  found to be effective among a minority of users. This technique encourages individuals to identify the role of the drug in their lives in order to give them an increased sense of control
<li>Family therapy  the family is often included in treatment programs because they have the potential to perpetuate changes in patterns of behaviour which may model an individual's drug use.<br>
<li>Self-help groups  groups such as AA, NA and CA are effective support sources for some individuals
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Pharmacological interventions in psychostimulant use</h3><p>
Pharmacologic interventions are used to achieve and sustain abstinence through the reduction of withdrawal symptoms. While most cases do not require drug treatment, where necessary, pharmacological interventions should be tailored to the needs of the individual and used in addition to a comprehensive treatment program.<p>
Note:    The treatments outlined below have been extrapolated from cocaine management data and therefore it is not known how effective they will be in the management of amphetamine detoxification.<p>
Desipramine is the drug of choice. When used in conjunction with bromocriptine or amantadine (both dopamine agonists), reduced craving and dysphoria are reported during cocaine withdrawal.<br>
<ul>
<li>Desipramine  starting at 25-30 mg nocte and increasing to 50-150 mg per week as clinically tolerated until reaching a maximum dose of 150-300 mg nocte.<p>
<li>Bromocriptine  starting at 0.625 mg three times daily, gradually increasing to 7.5-12.5 mg divided three times a day, as clinically tolerated, for 14 days.<p>
<li>Amantadine  has been found to be as effective as bromocriptine in reducing cocaine craving<p>
Pharmacological treatment can continue if cravings recur.<p>
Methylphenidate, which has amphetamine-like properties, has been shown to be an effective treatment in individuals with pre-existing adult attention deficit. Likewise, lithium has been an effective treatment among individuals with bipolar or cyclothymic disorders.

<title>Alcohol Handbook: Chapter 15</title>
<h1><a name="15    A MULTICULTURAL APPROACH TO DRUG AND ALCOHOL-RELATED ISSUES AND PROBLEMS"></a>15. A multicultural approach to drug and alcohol-related issues and problems</h1><p>
The cultural diversity of the Australian population has received little emphasis in the establishment of drug and alcohol services in this country. Relatively little consideration has been given to the values and heritage that predominate among different cultural communities, with the majority of drug and alcohol services available reflecting broader Australian community values. Therefore, when consulting with people of non-English-speaking  background or Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples regarding drug- and alcohol-related problems, a number of issues need to be considered.<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="#alcohol hbk ch15 LANGUAGE, KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION">Language, knowledge and information</a><br>
<li><a href="#alcohol hbk ch15 OVERCOMING LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES">Overcoming language and cultural differences</a><br>
<li><a href="#alcohol hbk ch15 Particular groups at risk">particular groups at risk</a><br>
<li><a href="#alcohol hbk ch15 A NUMBER OF ISSUES">A number of issues need to be remembered</a><p>
</ul>
<br>
<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch15 LANGUAGE, KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION">LANGUAGE, KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION</h2><p>
The greatest barrier for people of non-English speaking backgrounds is language. The information available is often insensitive to language, levels of education and cultural differences, and therefore may be an ineffective education tool. Often the printed information given is distributed to people according to their country of birth rather than by preferred language, and therefore may be irrelevant or inadequate. As a result, many people from non-English speaking backgrounds are largely uninformed about drugs and their effects, the problems that can be experienced, or the drug and alcohol support services available, and thus are oblivious to telltale signs of problems arising from intoxication and dependency. Language barriers, and the insensitivity of mainstream drug and alcohol services to cultural differences, may discourage people from non-English speaking backgrounds from accessing available services.<p>


<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch15 OVERCOMING LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES">OVERCOMING LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES</h2><p>
While many people from  non-English speaking backgrounds would prefer to consult a professional or knowledgable member in their own community about a drug- or alcohol-related problem, in many cases this may not be an option. These people are therefore faced with the prospect of accessing the mainstream agencies, often with little understanding of the services, where they exist, or the concepts upon which they are modelled. <p>
As a general practitioner or health worker, there are a number of issues you may like to consider when consulting people from non-English speaking backgrounds. <br>
<ul>
<li>Where a language barrier exists seek assistance with interpretation. This may include:
<ul>
<LI>Telephone Translating and Interpreting Service<br>
<LI>assistance from a bilingual family or community member<br>
<LI>a health worker of the same language background.<br>
</ul>
<li>Bilingual interpretation is essential. It will assist in:
<ul>
<LI>identification of needs<br>
<LI>a description of the current situation<br>
<LI>the perceived role of drugs or alcohol in the user's life<br>
<LI>establishing the extent of drug use <br>
<LI>the treatment options available<br>
<LI>accurate information regarding administration of any prescribed medications <br>
<LI>information about existing resources and supports important to the patient.<br>
</ul>
<li>Be aware that what constitutes a 'drug' differs between cultures (eg many European and Indo-Chinese cultures may not regard caffeine, alcohol or prescribed pharmaceuticals as drugs). Similarly the use of some substances may be acceptable in one culture but unacceptable in others. 
<li>Recognise that drug use or non-use can be a gender and cultural issue.<br>
<li>When determining the extent of drug use take into consideration the cultural patterns of drug choice and use, and where possible compare pre-immigration and post-immigration levels of use.
<li>Acquaint yourself with differing aspects of the cultural groups you may have contact with. Learn to recognise particular cultural features, including:<br>
<ul>
<LI>language, dialect and parochial dialogue<br>
<LI>socialisation patterns<br>
<LI>beliefs regarding health, illness and the significance of folk medicine in preventing and treating illnesses<br>
<LI>values, ideals and roles of members in the community<br>
<LI>the perceived role of drugs and alcohol in the community<br>
<LI>the role of the family unit in the community (including matriarchy and patriarchy)<br>
<LI>the cultural and interpersonal conflicts which may exacerbate drug or alcohol use among people of non-English speaking backgrounds<br>
<LI>the generational differences regarding drug use, drug choice and broader issues which may exacerbate or influence the behaviour.<br>
</ul>
<li>Where appropriate, contact a significant member of the cultural community and discuss the most appropriate ways to increase information in that community and the most effective and accepted modes of communication and intervention.
<li>A respect of people's choice is essential. What is an acceptable form of treatment for one person may not be culturally or personally acceptable for another.<br>
<li>The development of culturally sensitive approaches and interventions will result in more effective services and greater adherence to prescribed regimens. The most effective interventions will be those based upon the values of the community being dealt with.
<li>Familiarise yourself with the ethno-specific workers and agencies available in your area, and the services they offer. Networking with these agencies may enhance the distribution of information to members of particular communities who may be uninformed about drug-related issues and the relevant services available.
</ul>
<p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch15 PARTICULAR GROUPS AT RISK">PARTICULAR GROUPS AT RISK</h2><p>
There is evidence to suggest that people from some cultural backgrounds may be at greater risk of developing a drug- or alcohol-related problem:<br>
<ul>
<li>those with little or no family support
<li>unemployed migrants<br>
<li>individuals who have suffered severe trauma during wars, dispossession or displacement
<li>recent migrants or refugees<br>
<li>victims of torture and rape
<li>those facing cultural and interpersonal conflicts<br>
<li>those living alone
<li>the aged <br>
<li>those who are grieving
<li>some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.
</ul>
<p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch15 A NUMBER OF ISSUES">A NUMBER OF ISSUES NEED TO BE REMEMBERED</h2><p>
<ul>
<li>Intoxication and associated risks need proper management. It is an opportunity for early and brief intervention.
<li>Alcohol dependence is a symptom not a cause in itself.<br>
<li>It seriously disrupts health, family and social functioning.
<li>Frequent contact and liaison is required.<br>
<li>Concurrent medical conditions are often overlooked by health workers when they are dealing with intoxicated and dependent drinkers.
<li>The incidence of risk taking is increased with intoxication and therefore the medical practitioner or health worker can play an important role in providing culturally sensitive drug and sexual health education.<p>
In many remote areas there is also a high incidence of solvent abuse. This form of drug abuse is particularly evident among adolescents in the Aboriginal community (see <a href="alc_ch9.htm">Chapter 9, Volatile Substances</a>).
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Kava</h3><p>
Since the 1980s, use of kava, a traditional intoxicating drink used by South Pacific Islanders made from the root of the plant Piper methysticum, has been seen as an adjunct to or substitute for alcohol use in some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.<p>


<h3>Clinical effects</h3><p>
Kava possesses psychotropic qualities, producing a mild narcotic-like effect associated with muscle relaxation. The use of kava may lead to:<br>
<ul>
<li>reversible anaesthesia of the mouth and skin
<li>euphoria<br>
<li>sedation
<li>muscle weakness<br>
<li>ataxia
<li>intoxication<br>
<li>nausea.<p>
</ul>
Kava is an introduced drug to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The high quantities sometimes consumed are a cause for concern. Many serious toxic physical effects can result from renal and hepatic damage.<p>
Heavy kava users may present with the following symptoms:<br>
<ul>
<li>chest pains
<li>shortness of breath<br>
<li>episodic puffiness of the face
<li>redness of the eyes<br>
<li>scaly rash on the arms, legs and trunk
<li>brisk patellar reflexes<br>
<li>decrease in body mass index and skinfold thickness over triceps, biceps, subocapular and suprailiac sites.<p>
</ul>
Long term kava use has also been directly or indirectly associated with:<br>
<ul>
<li>malnutrition
<li>weight loss<br>
<li>liver and renal dysfunction
<li>abnormalities in red cells, lymphocytes and platelets<br>
<li>pulmonary hypertension.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Management</h3><p>
Kava use, like alcohol use and petrol sniffing in other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, has many complex social factors associated with its use. While there is concern regarding its use, consideration must also be given to the role of kava in these particular communities, particularly where kava is used as an alternative to alcohol.<p>
Heavy kava users should be monitored and advised to stop using. In order  to reduce the harmful effects of kava, health care workers should encourage users to reduce kava consumption, provide dietary information to reduce effects of malnutrition and work with indigenous communities to encourage their own reforms which address the physical and social effects of kava.<p>

<li><a href="#alcohol hbk ch16 HOW DO WE FIND THEM AND HELP THEM?">How do we find them and help them?  (or how do you help yourself?)</a><br>
<li><a href="#alcohol hbk ch15 WHICH ORGANISATIONS HELP?">Which organisations help?</a><p>
</ul>
<p>
A lot of health care workers drink too much and many harm themselves by doing so.<p>
Some of them take days off when they are intoxicated, while others are covered by their colleagues.<p>
A few become involved in covert illegal activities and provide drugs to those close to them.<p>
An educated guess at the number of medical practitioners addicted to illicit or prescribed drugs in the western medical community is in the order of 1%. This same level of addiction in Australian medical practitioners is suggested by the data available from monitoring sources.<p>
A significant number of health care workers are also dependent on a wide range of other drugs, thereby impairing their clinical skills.<p>


<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch16 HOW DO WE FIND THEM AND HELP THEM?">HOW DO WE FIND THEM AND HELP THEM? (OR HOW DO YOU HELP YOURSELF?)</h2><p>
There are simple things to do first.<br>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word that health care workers, like anyone else, have to be patients sometimes and there is nothing wrong with that.
<li>This may seem self-evident to most of us, but it remains an anxious prospect for some.<br>
<li>Look for indicators that the issue is being evaded, eg a colleague may seek an informal consultation such as asking about a chest pain.
<li>It is necessary to ensure that any complaint indicated in this manner is treated with professional concern in a professional location.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>The consultation</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>If a health care worker rings for a consultation there is a reasonable chance that he or she has acted out of desperation  he or she has reached the stage where the problem can no longer be ignored.
<li>That call is an urgent cry for help.<br>
<li>Occasionally the cry for help has a Russian roulette quality about it: if the prospective rescuer is out or away, the caller may procrastinate once more until it is too late.<br>
<li>Therefore, when a health care worker calls it is vital to ask directly about how ur-gent he or she perceives the problem to be and not to accept an equivocal answer.<br>
<li>When health care workers arrive it is important for the staff encountered and doctor consulted to act in a routine manner.
<li>Make it clear that he or she is now a patient and explain everything as if he or she were an intelligent layman with no medical or health background.<br>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch15 WHICH ORGANISATIONS HELP?">WHICH ORGANISATIONS HELP?</h2><p>
<br>
<h3>Doctors' Health Advisory Services</h3><p>
Over the past few years in a number of Australian States, a Doctors' Health Advisory Service has been developed as an independent, confidential and fraternal service to help impaired doctors and medical students. <p>
These organisations commenced in Victoria with the development of an organisation bearing this name and linked to the Victorian Academy of General Practice. <p>
In 1982 a steering committee was established in New South Wales representing the learned colleges and professional associations, and together with the Australian Medical Association developed the New South Wales Doctors' Health Advisory Service. <p>
These organisations are independent of the Australian Medical Association, the medical boards and other professional bodies. However, the organisations are all involved in the development and organisation of these services. <p>
A dedicated teleservice is available 24 hours a day in most States and calls for help come from many sources. These include the doctors themselves, their families, staff, patients and professional colleagues. In reviewing the calls received to date, it is interesting to note that a percentage of referrals do not come from the doctors themselves, but from friends or relatives concerned about the doctor's health.<p>
All incoming calls are referred to a panel of senior general practitioners experienced with a doctor's health problems. The 'patients' may be managed by the general practitioners themselves or referred to the Doctors' Health Advisory Service Specialist Panel. In all cases, extreme care is taken to maintain confidentiality. <p>
When calls for assistance are received from persons other than the doctor, strict procedures are followed before that medical practitioner is approached.<p>
The Doctors' Health Advisory Service is independent of the Medical Board. The service will not report doctors to the board nor will it threaten to do so. <p>
The 24-hour numbers for the Doctors' Health Advisory Services are:<br>
<ul>
New South Wales     (02) 437 6552<br>
Victoria and Tasmania     (03) 241 9316<br>
Queensland    (07) 356 0628<br>
South Australia     (08) 273 4111<p>
</ul>
Note:    All of these numbers are available 24 hours, 7 days a week with the use of answering machines and other call services. <p>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch17 HIV/AIDS hiv/aids and inject">HIV/AIDS and injecting drug use</h3><p>
Infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) may result in a wide range of complications including Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV is transmitted by exchange of bodily fluids eg during sexual contact, injecting drug use, pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. HIV transmission among drug users occurs through each of these mechanisms, but the most common is through sharing injection equipment.<p>
In most western countries during the early years of the epidemic, homosexual/bisexual males were the highest risk group, whereas in recent years cases involving injecting drug users have become more common in North America and Western Europe. Subsequently, the incidence of AIDS has increased among children and non-drug using heterosexuals.<p>
In January 1993 in Australia, 7.7% of all people diagnosed with HIV and 3.9% of people living with AIDS were identified as injecting drug users. While these figures appear relatively low compared with some western countries, eg Italy or Spain, where injecting drug users constitute the majority of HIV/AIDS cases, HIV has the potential to spread rapidly among the population of injecting drug users in Australia unless precautions are taken.<p>
HIV infection can spread rapidly among drug users. The development of AIDS takes on average 10-11 years from the time of infection. In countries where substantial proportions of drug users have become infected with HIV, the majority of children with AIDS have been found to have drug-using parents. Injecting drug users are regarded as the most likely conduit for HIV infection to reach the general community.<p>
Alcohol intoxication and other disinhibiting drugs may also contribute to the risk of HIV infection as the disinhibition resulting from the use of these drugs may increase the likelihood of unsafe sexual practices.<p>
Medical practitioners have an important role to play in the community's response to HIV infection. As infection with HIV and the resulting complications become more common in Australia, treatment will increasingly require involvement of general practitioners. Medical practitioners also have an important role in reinforcing educational efforts to reduce behavioural patterns associated with HIV transmission.<p>


<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch17 HIV/AIDS hiv infection">HIV infection and its complications</h3><p>
In most cases of HIV infection there are no symptoms or signs within the first few months or years. However, about half of the individuals develop non-specific symptoms from 2-6 weeks following infection. The illness resembles an attack of infectious mononucleosis. Symptoms include high temperature, muscle aches and pains, rashes, headaches and lassitude. These symptoms usually last for several days and resolve spontaneously. This cluster of symptoms is referred to as the Group I stage of HIV infection.<p>
The development of antibodies to HIV (Group 2) may take up to 12 weeks; for about 1% of people it can take longer than 12 weeks. People with HIV (Group 2) are, by definition, asymptomatic although non-specific symptoms are not uncommon. <p>
Group 3 involves persistent generalised lymphadenopathy in the absence of a concurrent illness or condition other than HIV infection to explain the findings (sometimes known as AIDS-related conditions).<p>
Group 4 includes the most advanced stage of HIV infection and is usually known as AIDS. This is constituted by the presence of an opportunistic infection and/or neoplasm in the presence of severe immunodeficiency. Severe diarrhoea, weight loss and other major symptoms are often present. Specific neurological impairment or severe wasting syndromes are also classified as Group 4.<p>


<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch17 HIV/AIDS the aids manual">The AIDS manual</h3><p>
The Albion Street Centre in Sydney is currently revising and updating The AIDS manual, a comprehensive reference on the human immunodeficiency virus. The third edition, published by McLennan and Petty, is perhaps the most authoritative reference text on AIDS produced in this country, and will be available late 1993.<p>
The AIDS manual provides up-to-date information on statistical trends in Australia and overseas, the changing nature and treatment of the disease, counselling, education and social, occupational and legal issues. The manual provides current information on the effects of AIDS on particular groups such as injecting drug users and haemophiliacs, children and women of child-bearing age. The manual includes useful diagrams, clinical photographs, supplementary reading material and an index.<p>


<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch17 THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN">THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN</h2><p>
The management of chronic pain can be one of the most difficult tasks in medical practice.<br>
<ul>
<li>Attention should be directed to the underlying factors which exacerbate the pain or decrease tolerance to it.
<li>Many doctors are fearful of creating addicts and provide too little analgesia even for patients with terminal conditions.<br>
<li>The irrational prescribing of patient opioid analgesics administered by injection for chronic low grade benign pain is equally difficult to defend. 
<li>Oral administration is always preferred to parenteral routes for the management of chronic pain.<br>
<li>Simple analgesics such as aspirin or paracetamol should be tried first. If this does not provide adequate relief, combinations of either aspirin or paracetamol with codeine should be tried next.<br>
<li>If more potent analgesia is required, orally absorbed, long-acting opioids such as oxycodone should be prescribed.
<li>Morphine can be given orally with satisfactory results, but the dose required might be 3-6 times the parenteral dose because of variable absorption and hepatic metabolism.<br>
<li>The use of adjuvant drugs including NSAIDs and tricyclic antidepressants is very important.
<li>Pain in inflammatory conditions should be controlled by NSAIDs without requiring opioids. It is important to appreciate that the very satisfactory analgesia produced by opioids in acute pain is not necessarily achieved by opioids when used for other pharmacological treatments.<br>
<li>Increasing the dose merely increases the risk of side effects including drug dependence.<br>
<li>The use of a range of behavioural approaches is as important as pharmacological treatment in chronic pain management.
<li>Techniques include relaxation therapy, trans-electronic nerve stimulation (TENS) and self-help chronic pain groups.<br>
<li>Pain clinics or pain specialists are now available in major centres and these will have available a range of similar psychologically based and other treatments. In cases of prolonged or intractable pain, consideration should be given to referral to such clinics.

<h1>Tell Children the Truth About Drinking</h1>

<p> Los Angeles Times OP-ED March 1, 1996 </p>

<p> Alcohol: It can be good for you. If we stressed moderation
over </p>

<p> abstinence, we'd have fewer problem drinkers, young or old. </p>

<p> By STANTON PEELE </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"><br>
</p>

<p> After years of debate, the U.S. government has finally
decided that alcohol can be beneficial. Federal dietary
recommendations, revised every five years, now indicate that
moderate drinking lowers the risk of heart disease. The dietary
guidelines note that such &quot;beverages have been used to
enhance the enjoyment of meals throughout human history. </p>

<p> There is both old and new information in this statement. We
all know that many Americans drink only occasionally or lightly
at meals and social occasions. They know when to quit, don't
misbehave when they drink and enjoy the taste and sensations of
alcohol without going overboard. </p>

<p> Most of us are also aware that people in different cultures
handle alcohol differently. In Mediterranean societies -- Italy,
Spain, Portugal -- alcohol is consumed in the form of wine,
usually at meals, by family members of all ages. Even small
children are served wine on special occasion&amp; Many European
countries permit adolescents to drink with their families at
restaurants. </p>

<p> To many Americans, the idea of offering children alcohol is
reprehensible. Yet, this approach to drinking seems to inoculate
children against alcohol abuse later in life. A study conducted
by Harvard psychiatrist George Vaillant followed a group of men
in Boston for more than four decades. The Italian, Greek and
Jewish men were only one-seventh as likely as Irish Americans in
the study to become alcoholic. </p>

<p> In contemporary America, we are taught that alcoholics are
born, not made. Yet no gene determines that any individual will
become an alcoholic. Rather, development of adult alcoholism is a
long-term, interactive process. Despite our claim to advanced
medical knowledge about alcoholism, America produces many more
problem drinkers than do many traditional cultures. </p>

<p> The groups in the Vaillant study that had few alcoholics
actually teach children responsible drinking at home. The problem
with a blanket disapproval of drinking is that many children
develop drinking habits on their own that are very different from
sipping wine at a religious feast or family meal. National
surveys show that up to half of college students and high school
seniors have drunk five or more drinks at one sitting in the
prior two weeks. Among fraternity and sorority members, this
figure is 80%. </p>

<p> Ironically, in the United States today, we follow the method
of alcohol education found least successful in the Vaillant
study. That is, alcohol is grouped with illicit drugs, and
children are taught that abstinence is the only answer. Yet
children are aware that most adults drink, and many drink alcohol
themselves on the sly. Moreover, drinking will be legal and
widely available to them within a few short years. Clearly, many
young people find the abstinence message confusing and
hypocritical. </p>

<p> Studies that examine health outcomes among groups of adults
who have been tracked for years find that moderate drinkers live
longer than abstainers. What is moderate drinking? The government
defined this as no more than two drinks daily for men and one for
women. Britain has defined higher sensible drinking limits-two to
three drinks for women and three to four for men. </p>

<p> These standards apply to adult men and post-menopausal women,
or to any adult with one or more coronary risk factors (such as
having a parent with premature heart disease, being overweight,
having high cholesterol or blood pressure). Three-quarters of all
Americans have such risk factors. These adults show significant
reduction in mortality when they drink moderately. </p>

<p> The lower death rate among moderate drinkers is due to the
reduction in heart disease, specifically atherosclerosis or
clogging of the arteries. Alcohol enhances high density-or
good-cholesterol production. However, when people average more
than two drinks daily, they are more likely to suffer from such
diseases as cancer and cirrhosis. At five to six drinks daily for
men and four drinks for women, these risks distinctly outweigh
the benefits of drinking. </p>

<p> What are people to make of these complications in the message
about alcohol? Like most things in life, sound judgment and
moderation are the bywords. After all, there are many things
people consume occasionally -- such as meat, desserts or cigars
-- that if done to excess become health problems. Even
adolescents can define the difference between healthy and
unhealthy drinking. I recommend holding such open discussions
among teenagers in place of the standard temperance lecture that
passes for alcohol education. After all, even the government
confirms that all drinking is not bad. </p>

<p>AGING AND ALCOHOL ABUSE </p>

<p>Alcohol abuse among older men and women is a more serious
problem than people generally realize. Until recently older
problem drinkers tended to be ignored by both health
professionals and the general public. The neglect occurred for
several reasons: our elderly population was small and few were
identified as alcoholics, chronic problem drinkers (those who
abused alcohol off and on for most of their lives) often died
before old age; and, because they are often retired or have fewer
social contacts, older people have often been able to hide
drinking problems. </p>

<p>Some families may unknowingly &quot;encourage&quot; drinking
in older family members if they have the attitude that drinking
should be tolerated because older people have only a limited time
left and therefore should be allowed to &quot;enjoy&quot;
themselves. </p>

<p>As more people learn that alcohol problems can be successfully
treated at any age, more are willing to seek help to stop
drinking. </p>

<p>Physical Effects of Alcohol </p>

<p>Alcohol slows down brain activity. It impairs mental
alertness, judgment, physical coordination, and reaction time --
increasing the risk of falls and accidents. </p>

<p>Over time, heavy drinking can cause permanent damage to the
brain and central nervous system, as well as to the liver, heart
kidneys, and stomach. </p>

<p>Alcohol can affect the body in unusual ways, making certain
medical problems difficult to diagnose. For example, the effects
of alcohol on the cardiovascular system (the heart and blood
vessels) can mask pain, which may otherwise serve as a warning
sign of heart attack. </p>

<p>Alcoholism can also produce symptoms similar to those of
dementia -- forgetfulness, reduced attention, confusion. If
incorrectly identified, such symptoms may lead to unnecessary
institutionalization. </p>

<p>Alcohol, itself a drug, mixes unfavorably with many other
drugs, including those sold by prescription and those bought
over-the-counter. In addition, use of prescription drugs may
intensify the older person's reaction to alcohol, leading to more
rapid intoxication. Alcohol can dangerously slow down performance
skills (driving, walking, etc.), impair judgment, and reduce
alertness when taken with drugs such as: </p>

<p>* &quot;Minor&quot; tranquilizers: Valium (diazepam), Librium
(chlordiazepoxide), Miltown (meprobamate), and others. </p>

<p>* &quot;Major&quot; tranquilizers: Thorazine (chlorpromazine),
Mellaril (thioridazine), and others. </p>

<p>* Barbiturates: Luminal (phenobarbital) and others. </p>

<p>* Pain killers: Darvon (propoxyphene), Demerol (meperidine),
and others. </p>

<p>* Antihistamines: both prescription and over-the-counter forms
found in cold remedies. </p>

<p>Use of alcohol can cause other drugs to be metabolized more
rapidly, producing exaggerated responses. Such drugs include:
anticonvulsants (Dilantin), anticoagulants (Coumadin), and
antidiabetes drugs (Orinase). </p>

<p>In some people, aspirin can cause bleeding in the stomach and
intestines. Alcohol also irritates the stomach and can aggravate
this bleeding. The combination of alcohol and diuretics can
reduce blood pressure in some individuals, producing dizziness. </p>

<p>Anyone who drinks -- even moderately -- should check with a
doctor or pharmacist about possible drug interactions. </p>

<p>Who Becomes a Problem Drinker? </p>

<p>In old age, problem drinkers seem to be one of two types. </p>

<p>The first are chronic abusers, those who have used alcohol
heavily throughout life. Although most chronic abusers die by
middle age, some survive into old age. Approximately two-thirds
of older alcoholics are in this group. </p>

<p>The second type begins excessive drinking late in life, often
in response to &quot;situational&quot; factors -- retirement,
lowered income, declining health, and the deaths of friends and
loved ones. In these cases, alcohol is first used for temporary
relief but later becomes a problem. </p>

<p>Detecting Drinking Problems </p>

<p>Not everyone who drinks regularly or heavily is an alcohol
abuser, but the following symptoms frequently indicate a problem:
</p>

<p>* Drinking to calm nerves, forget worries, or reduce
depression. </p>

<p>* Loss of interest in food. </p>

<p>* Gulping drinks and drinking too fast. </p>

<p>* Lying about drinking habits. </p>

<p>* Drinking alone with increasing frequency. </p>

<p>* Injuring oneself, or someone else, while intoxicated. </p>

<p>* Getting drunk often (more than three or four times in the
past year). </p>

<p>* Needing to drink increasing amounts of alcohol to get the
desired effect. </p>

<p>* Frequently acting irritable, resentful, or unreasonable
during nondrinking periods. </p>

<p>* Experiencing medical, social, or financial problems that are
caused by drinking. </p>

<p>Getting Help </p>

<p>Older problem drinkers and alcoholics have an unusually good
chance for recovery because they tend to stay with treatment
programs for the duration. </p>

<p>Getting help can begin with a family doctor or member of the
clergy; through a local health department or social services
agency; or with one of the following organizations: </p>

<p>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a voluntary fellowship of
alcoholics whose purpose is to help themselves and each other get
-- and stay -- sober. For information about their programs call
your local chapter or write to the national office at P.O. Box
459, Grand Central Station, New York, NY 10163. They can also
send you a free pamphlet on alcoholism and older people entitled
&quot;Time to Start Living.&quot; </p>

<p>National Clearinghouse for Alcohol Information is a Federal
information service that answers public inquiries, distributes
written materials, and conducts literature searches. For
information, write to P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20852. </p>

<p>National Council on Alcoholism distributes literature and can
refer you to treatment services in your area. Call your local
office (if listed in the telephone book) or write to the national
headquarters at 12 West 21st Street, New York, NY 10010. </p>

<p>The previous materials are a summary of information published
by: the National Institute on Aging. These materials are meant as
a general guideline. You should always consult with your own
physician prior to taking action. <br>

mark for the past twenty years. <br>

<h1><font color="#000000"><b>Fiorella LaGuardia on Prohibition</b></font></h1>

<hr>

<p><font color="#000000"><b>Fiorella H. LaGuardia</b> was a
prominent New York city politician who served several terms in
the House of Representatives. An outspoken critic of prohibition,
he testified to the policy's failure. <i>The National Prohibition
Law</i>, Hearings before the Committee on the Judiciary, U.S.
Senate, 69th Congress, 1st Session (1926): 649-52 </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">It is impossible to tell whether
prohibition is a good thing or a bad thing. It has never been
enforced in this country. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">There may not be as much liquor in
quantity consumed to-day as there was before prohibition, but
there is just as much alcohol. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">At least 1,000,000 quarts of liquor is
consumed each day in the United States. In my opinion such an
enormous traffic in liquor could not be carried on without the
knowledge, if not the connivance of the officials entrusted with
the enforcement of the law. ... </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">I believe that the percentage of whisky
drinkers in the United States now is greater than in any other
country of the world. Prohibition is responsible for that. ... </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">At least $1,000,000,000 a year is lost
to the National Government and the several States and counties in
excise taxes. The liquor traffic is going on just the same. This
amount goes into the pockets of bootleggers and in the pockets of
the public officials in the shape of graft.... </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">I will concede that the saloon was odius
but now we have delicatessen stores, pool rooms, drug stores,
millinery shops, private parlors, and 57 other varieties of
speak-easies selling liquor and flourishing. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">I have heard of $2,000 a year
prohibition agents who run their own cars with liveried
chauffeurs. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">It is common talk in my part of the
country that from $7.50 to $12 a case is paid in graft from the
time the liquor leaves the 12-mile limit until it reaches the
ultimate consumer. There seems to be a varying market price for
this service created by the degree of vigilance or the degree of
greed of the public officials in charge. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">It is my calculation that at least a
million dollars a day is paid in graft and corruption to Federal,
State, and local officers. Such a condition is not only
intolerable, but it is demoralizing and dangerous to organized
government. ... </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The Government even goes to the trouble
to facilitate the financing end of the bootlegging industry. In
1925, $286,950,000 more of $10,000 bills were issued than in 1920
and $25,000,000 more of $5,000 bills were issued. What honest
business man deals in $10,000 bills? Surely these bills were not
used to pay the salaries of ministers. The bootlegging industry
has created a demand for bills of large denominations, and the
Treasury Department accommodates them. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The drys seemingly are afraid of the
truth. Why not take inventory and ascertain the true conditions.
Let us not leave it to the charge of an antiprohibition
organization, or to any other private association, let us have an
official survey and let the American people know what is going
on. A complete and honest and impartial survey would reveal
incredible conditions, corruption, crime, and an organized system
of illicit traffic such as the world has never seen. ... </font></p>

<h2>Richmond P. Hobson Argues for Prohibition</h2>

<p>Richmond P. Hobson, a Representative from Alabama, voiced his
support for a prohibition amendment on the floor of the House of
Representatives on December 22, 1914. The proposed amendment
received a majority of votes, but not the necessary two-thirds
majority to proceed with the process. The following is scanned
from K. Austin Kerr, <i>The Politics of Moral Behavior:
Prohibition and Drug Abuse</i> (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley,
1973): 97-102 [long out of print]. </p>

<p>Hobson: </p>

<p>What is the object of this resolution? It is to destroy the
agency that debauches the youth of the land and thereby
perpetuates its hold upon the Nation. How does the resolution
propose to destroy this agent? In the simplest manner.... It does
not coerce any drinker. It simply says that barter and sale,
matters that have been a public function from the semicivilized
days of society, shall not continue the debauching of the youth.
Now, the Liquor Trust are wise enough to know that they can not
perpetuate their sway by depending on debauching grown people, so
they go to an organic method of teaching the young to drink. Now
we apply exactly the same method to destroy them. We do not try
to force old drinkers to stop drinking, but we do effectively put
an end to the systematic, organized debauching of our youth
through thousands and tens of thousands of agencies throughout
the land. Men here may try to escape the simplicity of this
problem. They can not. Some are trying to defend alcohol by
saying that its abuse only is bad and that its temperate use is
all right. Science absolutely denies it, and proclaims that
drunkenness does not produce one-tenth part of the harm to
society that the widespread, temperate, moderate drinking does.
Some say it is adulteration that harms. Some are trying to say
that it is only distilled liquors that do harm. Science comes in
now and says that all alcohol does harm; that the malt and
fermented liquors produce vastly more harm than distilled
liquors, and that it is the general public use of such drinks
that has entailed the gradual decline and degeneracy of the
nations of the past. </p>

<p>[The wets] have no foundation in scientific truth to stand
upon, and so they resort to all kinds of devious methods. </p>

<p>Their favorite contention is that we can not reach the evil
because of our institutions. This assumes that here is something
very harmful and injurious to the public health and morals, that
imperils our very institutions themselves and the perpetuity of
the Nation, but the Nation has not within itself, because of its
peculiar organization, the power to bring about the public good
and end a great public wrong. They invoke the principle of State
rights. As a matter of fact, we are fighting more consistently
for State rights than they ever dreamed of. We know the States
have the right to settle this question, and furthermore our
confidence in three-quarters of all the States to act wisely does
not lead us to fear that if we submit the proposition to them
they might establish an imperialistic empire. We believe that
three-quarters of all the States have the wisdom as well as the
right to settle the national prohibition question for this
country. </p>

<p>Neither can they take refuge about any assumed question of
individual liberty. We do not say that a man shall not drink. We
ask for no sumptuary action. We do not say that a man shall not
have or make liquor in his own home for his own use. Nothing of
that sort is involved in this resolution. We only touch the sale.
A man may feel he has a right to drink, but he certainly has no
inherent right to sell liquor. A man's liberties are absolutely
secure in this resolution. The liberties and sanctity of the home
are protected. The liberties of the community are secure, the
liberties of the county are secure, and the liberties of the
State are secure. </p>

<p>Let no one imagine that a State to-day has the real power and
right to be wet of its own volition. Under the taxing power of
the Federal Government by act of Congress, Congress could make
every State in the country dry. They need not think it is an
inherent right for a State to be wet; it is not; but there is an
inherent right in every State and every county and every township
to be dry, and these rights are now trampled upon, and this
monster prides himself in trampling upon them. </p>

<p>Why, here to-day Member after Member has proclaimed that
prohibition does not prohibit, and I have heard them actually
tell us that prohibition could not prohibit. They tell us that
this interstate liquor power is greater than the National
Government.... </p>

<p>I say now, as I said before, I will meet this foe on a hundred
battlefields. If the Sixty-third Congress does not grant this
plain right of the people for this referendum to change their
organic law, to meet this mighty evil, the Sixty-fourth Congress
will be likewise invoked. I do not say that we are going to get a
two-thirds majority here tonight ... because we have not yet had
a chance to appeal to Caesar: but I do say that the day is coming
when we shall have that referendum sent to the States, nor is
that day as far distant as some may imagine. Unless this question
has been made a State matter, as we are asking now for it to be
so made by being removed from national politics, and referred to
the States-if this is not done by the intervening Congresses, I
here announce to you the determination of the great moral, the
great spiritual, the great temperance and prohibition forces of
this whole Nation to make this question the paramount issue in
1916, not only to gain a two-thirds majority in the Houses of
Congress, but to have an administration that neither in the open
nor under cover will fight this reform, so that in the spring of
1917 with an extraordinary session of the Sixty-fifth Congress we
will have a command from the * masters of men and of Congress to
grant this right to the people. My appeal is to each one of you
now, be a man when the vote is taken and do your duty.
[Applause.] </p>

<p><i>A Habit-Forming Drug</i> </p>

<p>Alcohol has the property of chloroform and ether of
penetrating actually into the nerve fibers themselves, putting
the tissues under an anesthetic which prevents pain at first, but
when the anesthetic effect is over discomfort follows throughout
the tissues of the whole body, particularly the nervous system,
which causes a craving for relief by recourse to the very
substance that produced the disturbance. This craving grows
directly with the amount and regularity of the drinking. </p>

<p><i>Undermines the Will Power</i> </p>

<p>The poisoning attack of alcohol is specially severe in the
cortex cerebrum-the top part of the brain-where resides the
center of inhibition, or of will power, causing partial
paralysis, which liberates lower activities otherwise held in
control, causing a man to be more of a brute, but to imagine that
he has been stimulated, when he is really partially paralyzed.
This center of inhibition is the seat of the will power, which of
necessity declines a little in strength every time partial
paralysis takes place. </p>

<p><i>Little Less of a Man After Each Drink</i> </p>

<p>Thus a man is little less of a man after each drink he takes.
In this way continued drinking causes a progressive weakening of
the will and a progressive growing of the craving, so that after
a time, if persisted in, there must come a point where the will
power can not control the craving and the victim is in the grip
of the habit. </p>

<p><i>Slaves in Shackles</i> </p>

<p>When the drinking begins young the power of the habit becomes
overwhelming, and the victim might as well have shackles. It is
estimated that there are 5,000,000 heavy drinkers and drunkards
in America, and these men might as well have a ball and chain on
their ankles, for they are more abject slaves than those black
men who were driven by slave drivers. </p>

<p><i>Present-day Slave Owners</i> </p>

<p>These victims are driven imperatively to procure their liquor,
no matter at what cost. A few thousand brewers and distillers,
making up the organizations composing the great Liquor Trust,
have a monopoly of the supply, and they therefore own these
5,000,000 slaves and through them they are able to collect two
and one-half billions of dollars cash from the American people
every year. </p>

<p><i>Liquor Degenerates the Character</i> </p>

<p>The first finding of science that alcohol is a protoplasmic
poison and the second finding that it is an insidious,
habit-forming drug, though of great importance, are as
unimportant when compared with the third finding, that alcohol
degenerates the character of men and tears down their spiritual
nature. Like the other members of the group of oxide derivatives
of hydrocarbons, alcohol is not only a general poison, but it has
a chemical affinity or deadly appetite for certain particular
tissues. Strychnine tears down the spinal cord. Alcohol tears
down the top part of the brain in a man, attacks certain tissues
in an animal, certain cells in a flower. It has been established
that whatever the line of a creature's evolution alcohol will
attack that line. Every type and every species is evolving in
building from generation to generation along some particular
line. Man is evolving in the top part of the brain, the seat of
the will power, the seat of the moral senses, and of the
spiritual nature, the recognition of right and wrong, the
consciousness of God and of duty and of brotherly love and of
self-sacrifice. </p>

<p><i>Reverses the Life Principle of the Universe</i> </p>

<p>All life in the universe is founded upon the principle of
evolution. Alcohol directly reverses that principle. Man has
risen from the savage up through successive steps to the level of
the semisavage, the semicivilized, and the highly civilized. </p>

<p><i>Liquor and the Red Man</i> </p>

<p>Liquor promptly degenerates the red man, throws him back into
savagery. It will promptly put a tribe on the war path. </p>

<p><i>Liquor and the Black Man</i> </p>

<p>Liquor will actually make a brute out of a negro, causing him
to commit unnatural crimes. </p>

<p><i>Liquor and the White Man</i> </p>

<p>The effect is the same on the white man, though the white man
being further evolved it takes longer time to reduce him to the
same level. Starting young, however, it does not take a very long
time to speedily cause a man in the forefront of civilization to
pass through the successive stages and become semicivilized,
semisavage, savage, and, at last, below the brute. </p>

<p><i>The Great Tragedy</i> </p>

<p>The spiritual nature of man gives dignity to his life above
the life of the brute. It is this spiritual nature of man that
makes him in the image of his Maker, so that the Bible referred
to man as being a little lower than the angels. It is a tragedy
to blight the physical life. No measure can be made of blighting
the spiritual life. </p>

<p><i>The Blight Degeneracy</i> </p>

<p>Nature does not tolerate reversing its evolutionary principle,
and proceeds automatically to exterminate any creature, any
animal, any race, any species that degenerates. Nature adopts two
methods of extermination-one to shorten the life, the other to
blight the offspring. </p>

<p><i>The Verdict</i> </p>

<p>Science has thus demonstrated that alcohol is a protoplasmic
poison, poisoning all living things; that alcohol is a
habit-forming drug that shackles millions of our citizens and
maintains slavery in our midst; that it lowers in a fearful way
the standard of efficiency of the Nation, reducing enormously the
national wealth, entailing startling burdens of taxation,
encumbering the public with the care of crime, pauperism, and
insanity; that it corrupts politics and public servants, corrupts
the Government, corrupts the public morals, lowers terrifically
the average standard of character of the citizenship, and
undermines the liberties and institutions of the Nation; that it
undermines and blights the home and the family, checks education,
attacks the young when they are entitled to protection,
undermines the public health, slaughtering, killing, and wounding
our citizens many fold times more than war, pestilence, and
famine combined; that it blights the progeny of the Nation,
flooding the land with a horde of degenerates; that it strikes
deadly blows at the life of the Nation itself and at the very
life of the race, reversing the great evolutionary principles of
nature and the purposes of the Almighty. </p>

<p>There can be but one verdict, and that is this great destroyer
must be destroyed. The time is ripe for fulfillment. The present
generation, the generation to which we belong, must cut this
millstone of degeneracy from the neck of humanity.... </p>

<p><i>The Final Conclusion</i> </p>

<p>To cure this organic disease we must have recourse to the
organic law. The people themselves must act upon this question. A
generation must be prevailed upon to place prohibition in their
own constitutional law, and such a generation could be counted
upon to keep it in the Constitution during its lifetime. The
Liquor Trust of necessity would disintegrate. The youth would
grow up sober. The final, scientific conclusion is that we must
have constitutional prohibition, prohibiting only the sale, the
manufacture for sale, and everything that pertains to the sale,
and invoke the power of both Federal and State Governments for
enforcement. The resolution is drawn to fill these requirements. </p>

<h2>Chicago Saloons Before Prohibition</h2>

<p><font size="3">Before the advent of prohibition, saloons
proliferated in the United States to the extent where it was
difficult to earn a profit in the retail business. The situation
was a product of the competition among breweries, who stood to
gain market penetration the more retail outlets they established
and controlled.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">George Kibbe Turner, a well-known
&quot;muckraking&quot; journalist, was one writer to explained
this situation. His &quot;The City of Chicago, A Study of the
Great Immoralities&quot; appeared in<i> McClure's Magazine</i> in
April 1907 (vol. 28, pp. 575-92 explained the situation and
included a few images of saloons, and of the men in public life
connected to the trade. This is but one example of the many
treasures students and faculty may find in the Ohio State
University library. </font></p>

<h2><font color="#000000"><font size="2">The City of Chicago, A
Study of the Great Immoralities</font></font></h2>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2"><strong>George Kibbe
Turner, &quot;The City of Chicago, A Study of the Great
Immoralities,&quot; </strong><strong><i>McClure's Magazine</i></strong><strong>
28(April 1907): 576-79</strong><br>
</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">&quot;The sale of
dissipation is not only a great business; it is among the few
greatest businesses of Chicago. The leading branch of it ... is
the sale of alcoholic liquor.... The liquor interests are vastly
more extended in Chicago that any other. There are 7,300 licensed
liquor sellers in Chicago, and in addition about a thousand
places where liquor is sold illegally. The only business which
approaches it in number of establishments ... is the grocery
trade, which has about 5,200. The city spends at least half as
much for what it drinks as for what it eats.... </font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">The great central power
in the liquor business in America is the brewery. ...The
breweries own or control the great majority of the saloons of
American cities. They have a distinct policy:--if there are not
as many saloons as there can be, supply them. This is what has
been done in Chicago. Fully ninety per cent of the Chicago
saloons are under some obligation to the brewery; with at least
eighty per cent, this obligation is a serious one.</font> </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">The business of the
brewery is to sell beer.... The brewery, under present conditions
in Chicago, must sell beer at all cost, or promptly die. This is
because the brewery business has become over-capitalized and
overbuilt there for at least ten years. There has been furious
competition.... At the present time a full third of the capital
invested in the forty companies and fifty plants is not earning
dividends. Under these circumstances, the breweries of Chicago
can have but one aim--to fill Chicago with beer to the point of
saturation.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">Each brewer disposes of
his product by contracting with special saloon-keepers to sell
his beer and no other. The more saloons he has, the better....
The brewers employ special agents to watch continually every nook
and cranny in Chicago where it may be possible to pour in a
little more beer. If a rival brewery's saloon keeper is doing
well, his best bartender is ravished from him and set up in
business alongside. If a new colony of foreigners appears, some
compatriot is set at once to selling them liquor. Italians,
Greeks, Lithuanians, Poles,--all the rough and hairy tribes which
have been drawn into Chicago,--have their trade exploited to the
utmost. ...No man with two hundred dollars, who was not subject
to arrest on sight, need go without a saloon in Chicago.... With
that two hundred dollars as a margin, the brewery sorts him out a
set of its stock of saloon fixtures, pays his rent, pays his
license, and supplies him with beer. He pays for everything in an
extra price on each barrel of beer.... </font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">Under this system ...
Chicago has four times as many saloons as it should have, from
any standpoint whatever, except, of course, the brewers' and the
wholesalers'. A new license law ... now limits the number to one
[saloon] in every five hundred people; but it will be years
before that law will have any appreciable effect. There is now
one retail liquor dealer to every two hundred and eighty five
people, disregarding, of course, the one thousand unlicensed
dealers. In the laboring wards the licensed saloons run as many
as one to every one hundred and fifty. Take the stock-yards.
Around that long and dismal stockade, at every hole from which a
human being can emerge, a shop or group of shops sits waiting. At
the main entrance they lie massed in batteries....</font> </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">The Chicago market is
thoroughly saturated with beer, and incidentally with other
liquor. Reckoning it out by population, every man, woman, and
child in Chicago drank, in 1906, two and one-quarter barrels of
beer,--that is, seventy gallons,--three and one-half times the
average consumption in the United States.... </font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">Now, if the competition
is red-handed among the breweries, it is simply ravenous among
the saloon-keepers. There is a popular fallacy that there is a
great profit in the retail saloon business. The saloon-keepers
themselves believe this when they go into it....</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">All this means one
thing--a premium on the irregular and criminal saloon-keeper. The
patronage of the saloon is a very fickle and elusive thing. A
place is popular, or it is nothing. ... There are two general
business methods of attracting [a good trade]: By giving
unusually large measures or big bonuses of free lunch; or by
carrying illegitimate and illegal side lines. The first ... does
not leave large margins of profit; the second does. A year ago
the license fee was raised in Chicago from five hundred to one
thousand dollars. It was hoped this would wipe out the criminal
saloon. It did, of course, nothing of the sort. The poor,
miserable little dives in the working-man's ward, each snatching
a starvation living from the lips of the dwellers of the dozen
smoke-befouled frame tenements about it, staggered down--a few
hundred of them--and died. The man with the side-line of
prostitution and gambling naturally survived and had the benefit
of the others' failure.</font> </font></p>

<h2><font color="#000000">Student Testimony Against Prohibition</font></h2>

<p><font color="#000000">In 1926, Senator James Reed of Missouri,
an outspoken opponent of prohibition, arranged testimony before
the Senate Committee on the Judiciary that supported his
position. The following exchange occured between him and Russell
Lee Post, a student at Yale University. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Senator Reed of Missouri. What are the
facts with reference to the ability of students to obtain liquor?
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Mr. Post. Why, it is obtainable, sir;
the greater the attempts at enforcement the stronger the
sentiment against it. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Senator Reed of Missouri. Do bootleggers
ply their trade among the students? </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Mr. Post. Well, it is the reverse; the
students go to the bootleggers. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Senator Reed of Missouri. The students
go to the bootleggers? </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Mr. Post. Yes; they do not enter the
university campus. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Senator Reed of Missouri. Is there any
difficulty of any student of ordinary intelligence--and I presume
they are all that at Yale University--getting all the whisky he
wants to buy, or alleged whisky at least? </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Mr. Post. No, sir. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Senator Reed of Missouri. Is this liquor
drunk on the campus or in the quarters of the students? </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Mr. Post. Yes, sir. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Senator Reed of Missouri And is it drunk
elsewhere? </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Mr. Post. Yes, sir. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Senator Reed of Missouri. That is all. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The Woman's Crusade of 1873-74 was a
culmination across the United States of many years of women
taking direct action against the saloon and the liquor traffic.
Women in the United States then enjoyed no direct political
power, and direct action--prayer vigils, petition campaigns,
demonstrations, hymn-singing--were among the few means at their
disposal for seeking change. The crusade sought to persuade
saloon-keepers to destroy their beverages, close their doors, and
enter some other line of business. </font></p>

of American women who gained leadership experience by working in
the Sanitary Commission (from which the Red Cross later emerged)
during the American civil war. During the woman's crusade of
1873-74 she was active, and she enjoyed a notable career as a
temperance speaker thereafter. Her 1876 speaking tour in Britain
led to the formation of the British Woman's Temperance
Association. Stewart was also later a supporter of the
Prohibition party, which offered candidates for office, including
President of the United States. </font></p>

<h2> <b>The Ohio Dry Campaign of 1918</b> </h2>

<p>The successor organization to the Ohio Anti-Saloon League, the
Ohio Council on Alcohol Problems, lent Professor John C. Burnham
a set of campaign broadsides from the Ohio prohibition referendum
campaign of 1918. Austin Kerr made Xerox copies of these
materials, and, with the help of Liyan Liu, they are now scanned
and ready for use in teaching and other multi-media applications.
So far as we know, these items were never copyrighted; in any
case, their age indicates that they are in the public domain. We
will appreciate persons using these materials to note that they
are &quot;Courtesy of The Ohio State University Department of
History.&quot; </p>

<p>Ohio was a very closely contested state in the national
campaign to eradicate the liquor traffic by declaring illegal the
businesses of manufacturing, distributing, and selling alcoholic
beverages. Ohio was the birthplace of both the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union (1874) and the Anti-Saloon League (1893). The
WCTU brought a special zeal to the prohibition effort in the
1880s, failing to achieve state-wide dry legislation but
disturbing Ohio political life nevertheless. The Anti-Saloon
League later (and with the help of the WCTU) promoted the issue
in a non-partisan manner, pressuring politicians to enact dry
legislation. The League and its allies were successful in
achieving various local option measures (laws that allowed voters
of a ward or a township to declare themselves free of the liquor
traffic) and, in 1908, in achieving a law that granted counties
the authority to outlaw the liquor traffic. </p>

<p>Although prohibition was a popular reform in the state, the
issue deeply divided Ohioans. In 1909, witnessing the success of
the League in achieving county option legislation, and fearing
that it might achieve state-wide prohibition, the brewers
organized a counter-attack. Beer had become the largest single
source of beverage alcohol in the United States during the 1880s,
and the brewing industry was the most profitable of the liquor
trades. Persons of German ancestry dominated the American brewing
industry, and they worked closely with the German-American
Alliance, an organization popular in German-American communities.
The brewers had always supplied lobbyists and campaign funds to
thwart the <tt>prohibitionists</tt>. In 1909 the Ohio brewers
decided to try to reform their industry, to reduce the number of
saloons in the state dramatically, and to have legislation
enacted that would ensure that saloon keepers were citizens of
&quot;good character.&quot; Led by Percy Andreae, the Ohio
brewers used their ample financial resources and political skills
to conduct a propaganda campaign to countervail that of the drys,
and to mobilize wets in support of measures that would weaken the
dry hold in the state's politics. </p>

<p>The result was that after 1910 the Anti-Saloon League
encountered stiff opposition in the state's legislature. The drys
could, however, try to achieve state-wide prohibition through the
referendum. The Ohio Constitution permitted citizens to petition
to have amendments placed on the ballot for decision directly by
the voters. In campaigning for state-wide prohibition through the
referendum, League leaders knew they could count on only about
400,000 voters (of a total well over 1,000,000) to support
prohibition. Nevertheless, the League leaders believed they had
little choice but to push referendum campaigns if they were going
to achieve state-wide prohibition in Ohio. Although the brewers
and their wet allies could outspend the drys, the drys hoped to
make up the deficit through the righteousness of their cause and
the resulting reform zeal. After about 1910 public opinion across
the nation seemed to be turning in favor of prohibition. The
League believed that conducting referendum campaigns in Ohio
would educate the public futher to the virtues of prohibition. </p>

<p>The League engineered referendums in 1915 and 1917, which it
lost. The League was finally victorious in 1918, narrowly winning
a state-wide victory. In 1917 and 1918, James A. White, the
Superintendent of the Ohio Anti-Saloon League, organized an
&quot;Ohio Dry Federation&quot; to mobilize all of the state's
temperance and prohibition groups, including the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union. In 1917 the Federation budgeted
$450,000 for the campaign, and in 1918, $500,000, enormous sums
for the day. The advertisements that you will see were part of
that expenditure. </p>

<p>The broadsides that we are providing were apparently intended
for publication in the state's newspapers. Many of them contain
patriotic references to the mobilization for the First World War.
Although nationally political sentiment had clearly developed in
support of a prohibition amendment to the federal constitution
before the United States declared war in 1917, the Ohio Dry
Federation propagandists were looking for every advantage to win
over a majority of the state's voters. </p>

Anti-Saloon League</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1985)

<h1>&quot;A Glimpse behind the Mask of Prohibition&quot;</h1>

<p>by Percy Andreae </p>

<h1>in <i>The Prohibition Movement in its Broader Bearings upon
Our Social, Commercial, and Religious Liberties</i></h1>

<p>(Chicago: Felix Mendelsohn, 1915): 9-19 </p>

<p>Somewhere in the Bible it is said: &quot;If thy right hand
offend thee, cut it off.&quot; I used to think the remedy
somewhat radical. But to-day, being imbued with the wisdom of the
prohibitionist, I have to acknowledge that, if the Bible in
general, and that passage in it in particular, has a fault, it
lies in its ultra-conservativeness. What? Merely cut off my own
right hand if it offend me? What business have my neighbors to
keep their right hands if I am not able to make mine behave
itself ? Off with the lot of them! Let there be no right hands;
then I am certain that mine won't land me in trouble. </p>

<p>I have met many active prohibitionists, both in this and in
other countries, all of them thoroughly in earnest. In some
instances I have found that their allegiance to the cause of
prohibition took its origin in the fact that some near relative
or friend had succumbed to over-indulgence in liquor. In one or
two cases the man himself had been a victim of this weakness, and
had come to the conclusion, firstly that every one else was
constituted as he was, and, therefore, liable to the same danger;
and secondly, that unless every one were prevented from drinking,
he would not be secure from the temptation to do so himself. </p>

<p>This is one class of prohibitionists. The other, and by far
the larger class, is made up of religious zealots, to whom
prohibition is a word having at bottom a far wider application
than that which is generally attributed to it. The liquor
question, if there really is such a question per se, is merely
put forth by them as a means to an end, an incidental factor in a
fight which has for its object the supremacy of a certain form of
religious faith. The belief of many of these people is that the
Creator frowns upon enjoyment of any and every kind, and that he
has merely endowed us with certain desires and capacities for
pleasure in order to give us an opportunity to please Him by
resisting them. They are, of course, perfectly entitled to this
belief, though some of us may consider it eccentric and somewhat
in the nature of a libel on the Almighty. But are they privileged
to force that belief on all their fellow beings? That, in
substance, is the question that is involved in the present-day
prohibition movement. </p>

<p>For it is all nonsense to suppose that because, perhaps, one
in a hundred or so of human beings is too weak to resist the
temptation of over-indulging in drink-or of over-indulging in
anything else, for the matter of that-=therefore all mankind is
going to forego the right to indulge in that enjoyment in
moderation. the leaders of the so-called prohibition movement
know as well as you and I do that you can no more prevent an
individual from taking a drink if he be so inclined than your can
prevent him from scratching himself if he itches. They object to
the existence of the saloon, not, bear in mind, to that of the
badly conducted saloon, but to that of the well-regulated, decent
saloon, and wherever they succeed in destroying the latter, their
object, which is the manifestation of their political power, is
attained. That for every decent, well-ordered saloon they
destroy, there springs up a dive, or speak-easy, or blind tiger,
or whatever other name it may be known by, and the dispensing of
drink continues as merrily as before, doesn't disturb them at
all. They make the sale of liquor a crime, but steadily refuse to
make its purchase and consumption an offense. Time and again the
industries affected by this apparently senseless crusade have
endeavored to have laws passed making dry territories really dry
by providing for the punishment of the man who buys drink as well
as the man who sells it. But every such attempt has been fiercely
opposed by the prohibition leaders. And why? Because they know
only too well that the first attempt to really prohibit drinking
would put an end to their power forever. They know that 80 per
cent of those who, partly by coercion, partly from sentiment,
vote dry, are perfectly willing to restrict the right of the
remaining 20 per cent to obtain drink, but that they are not
willing to sacrifice that right for themselves. </p>

<p>And so the farce called prohibition goes on, and will continue
to go on as long as it brings grist to the mill of the managers
who are producing it. But the farce conceals something far more
serious than that which is apparent to the public on the face of
it. Prohibition is merely the title of the movement. Its real
purpose is of a religious, sectarian character, and this applies
not only to the movement in America, but to the same movement in
England, a fact which, strangely enough, has rarely, if at all,
been recognized by those who have dealt with the question in the
public press. </p>

<p>If there is any one who doubts the truth of this statement,
let me put this to him: How many Roman Catholics are
prohibitionists? How many Jews, the most temperate race on earth,
are to be found in the ranks of prohibition? Or Lutherans? Or
German Protestants generally? What is the proportion of
Episcopalians to that of Methodists, Baptists and Presbyterians,
and the like, in the active prohibition army? The answer to these
questions will, I venture to say, prove conclusively the
assertion that the fight for prohibition is synonymous with the
fight of a certain religious sect, or group of religious sects,
for the supremacy of its ideas. In England it is the
Nonconformists, which is in that country the generic name for the
same sects, who are fighting the fight, and the suppression of
liquor there is no more the ultimate end they have in view than
it is here in America. It is the fads and restrictions that are
part and parcel of their lugubrious notion of Godworship which
they eventually hope to impose upon the rest of humanity; a
Sunday without a smile, no games, no recreation, no pleasures, no
music, card-playing tabooed, dancing anathematized, the beauties
of art decried as impure-in short, this world reduced to a
barren, forbidding wilderness in which we, its inhabitants, are
to pass our time contemplating the joys of the next. Rather
problematical joys, by the way, if we are to suppose we shall
worship God in the next world in the same somber way as we are
called upon by these worthies to do in this. </p>

<p>To my mind, and that of many others, the hearty, happy laugh
of a human being on a sunny Sunday is music sweeter to the ears
of that being's Creator than all the groaning and moanings, and <i>misericordias
</i>that rise to heaven from the lips of those who would deprive
us altogether of the faculty and the privilege of mirth. That
some overdo hilarity and become coarse and offensive, goes
without saying. There are people without the sense of proportion
or propriety in all matters. Yet none of us think of abolishing
pleasures because a few do not know how to enjoy them in
moderation and with decency, and become an offense to their
neighbors. </p>

<p>The drink evil has existed from time immemorial, just as
sexual excess has, and all other vices to which mankind is and
always will be more or less prone, though less in proportion as
education progresses and the benefits of civilization increased
Sexual excess, curiously enough, has never interested our hyper-
religious friends, the prohibitionists, in anything like the
degree that the vice of excessive drinking does. Perhaps this is
because the best of us have our pet aversions and our pet
weaknesses. Yet this particular vice has produced more evil
results to the human race than all other vices combined, and, in
spite of it, mankind, thanks not to prohibitive laws and
restrictive legislation, but to the forward strides of knowledge
and to patient and intelligent education, is to-day ten times
sounder in body and healthier in mind than it ever was in the
world's history. </p>

<p>Now, if the habit of drinking to excess were a growing one, as
our prohibitionist friends claim that it is, we should to-day,
instead of discussing this question with more or less
intelligence, not be here at all to argue it; for the evil, such
as it is, has existed for so many ages that, if it were as
general and as contagious as is claimed, and its results as
far-reaching as they are painted, the human race would have been
destroyed by it long ago. Of course, the contrary is the case.
The world has progressed in this as in all other respects.
Compare, for instance, the drinking to-day with the drinking of a
thousand years ago, nay, of only a hundred odd years ago, when a
man, if he wanted to ape his so-called betters, did so by
contriving to be carried to bed every night &quot;drunk as a
lord.&quot; Has that condition of affairs been altered by
legislative measures restricting the right of the individual to
control himself ? No. It has been altered by that far greater
power, the moral force of education and the good example which
teaches mankind the very thing that prohibition would take from
it: the virtue of selfcontrol and moderation in all things. </p>

<p>And here we come to the vital distinction between the advocacy
of temperance and the advocacy of prohibition. Temperance and
self-control are convertible terms. Prohibition, or that which it
implies, is the direct negation of the term self-control. In
order to save the small percentage of men who are too weak to
resist their animal desires, it aims to put chains on every man,
the weak and the strong alike. And if this is proper in one
respect, why not in all respects? Yet, what would one think of a
proposition to keep all men locked up because a certain number
have a propensity to steal? Theoretically, perhaps, all crime or
vice could be stopped by chaining us all up as we chain up a wild
animal, and only allowing us to take exercise under proper
supervision and control. But while such a measure would check
crime, it would not eliminate the criminal. It is true, some
people are only kept from vice and crime by the fear of
punishment. Is not, indeed, the basis of some men's religiousness
nothing else but the fear of Divine punishment? The doctrines of
certain religious denominations not entirely unknown in the
prohibition camp make self respect, which is the foundation of
self-control and of all morality, a sin. They decry rather than
advocate it. They love to call themselves miserable, helpless
sinners, cringing before the flaming sword, and it is the flaming
sword, not the exercise of their own enlightened will, that keeps
them within decent bounds. Yet has this fear of eternal
punishment contributed one iota toward the intrinsic betterment
of the human being? If it had, would so many of our Christian
creeds have discarded it, admitting that it is the precepts of
religion, not its dark and dire threats, that make men truly
better and stronger within themselves to resist that which our
self-respect teaches us is bad and harmful? The growth of
self-respect in man, with its outward manifestation,
self-control, is the growth of civilization. If we are to be
allowed to exercise it no longer, it must die in us from want of
nutrition, and men must become savages once more, fretting now at
their chains, which they will break as inevitably as the sun will
rise to-morrow and herald a new day. </p>

<p>I consider the danger which threatens civilized society from
the growing power of a sect whose views on prohibition are merely
an exemplification of their general low estimate of man's ability
to rise to higher things -by his own volition to be of infinitely
greater consequence than the danger that, in putting their narrow
theories to the test, a few billions of invested property will be
destroyed, a number of great wealth-producing industries wiped
out, the rate of individual taxation largely increased, and a
million or so of struggling wage earners doomed to face
starvation. These latter considerations, of course, must appeal
to every thinking mans but what are they compared with the
greater questions involved? Already the government of our State,
and indeed of a good many other States, has passed practically
into the hands of a few preacher-politicians of a certain creed.
With the machine they have built up, by appealing to the
emotional weaknesses of the more or less unintelligent masses,
they have lifted themselves on to a pedestal of power that has
enabled them to dictate legislation or defeat it at their will,
to usurp the functions of the governing head of the State and
actually induce him to delegate to them the appointive powers
vested in him by the Constitution. When a Governor elected by the
popular vote admits, as was recently the case, that he can not
appoint a man to one of the most important offices of the State
without the indorsement of the irresponsible leader of a certain
semi-religious movement, and when he submits to this same
personage for correction and amendment his recommendation to the
legislative body, there can scarcely be any doubt left in any
reasonable mind as to the extent of the power wielded by this
leader, or as to the uses he and those behind him intend putting
it to. </p>

<p>And what does it all mean? It means that government by emotion
is to be substituted for government by reason, and government by
emotion, of which history affords many examples, is, according to
the testimony of all ages, the most dangerous and pernicious of
ail forms of government. It has already crept into the
legislative assemblies of most of the States of the Union, and is
being craftily fostered by those who know how easily it can be
made available for their purposes-purposes to the furtherance of
which cool reason would never lend itself. Prohibition is but one
of its fruits, and the hand that is plucking this fruit is the
same hand of intolerance that drove forth certain of our
forefathers from the land of their birth to seek the sheltering
freedom of these shores. </p>

<p>What a strange reversal of conditions! The intolerants of a
few hundred years ago are the upholders of liberty to-day, while
those they once persecuted, having multiplied by grace of the
very liberty that has so long sheltered them here, are now
planning to impose the tyranny of their narrow creed upon the
descendants of their persecutors of yore. </p>

<p>Let the greater public, which is, after all, the arbiter of
the country's destinies, pause and ponder these things before
they are allowed to progress too far. Prohibition, though it must
callse, and is already causing, incalculable damage, may never
succeed in this country; but that which is behind it, as the
catapults and the cannon were behind the battering rams in the
battles of olden days, is certain to succeed unless timely
measures of prevention are resorted to; and if it does succeed,
we shall witness the enthronement of a monarch in this land of
liberty compared with whose autocracy the autocracy of the
Russian Czar is a mere trifle. </p>

<p>The name of this monarch is Religious Intolerance. </p>

<p>Well, sir,&quot; said Mr. Dooley, &quot; I see that the
prohybitionists are gettin' a sthrangle hold on me old friend
an' bosom companion, King Alcohol, now more gin'rally known as
th' Demon Rum. An' where d'ye think they 're sthrongest? Ye'll
niver believe it, but it's down South. Yes, sir, in th' sunny
Southland, that I wanst thought was sunny partly because iv th'
efforts iv Nature an' partly because iv th' effects iv booze,
'tis as hard to get a dhrink now as it wanst was not to get wan. </p>

<p><img src="NEW-SOU.JPG" width="183" height="263"> </p>

<p>&quot;All me idees are upset. I've always wanted to go down
South some day an' loaf in that beauchous land, among th' palm
an' palmettoes, th' turpentine trees, th' sweet potatoes, an' th'
yellow janders, consumin' th' flagrant mint julep an' watchin'
th' happy darky pluckin' th' cotton fr'm th' vine be day an' be
night out undher th' moonlight playin' his banjo or racin' with
th' bloodhounds. Me idee iv hospitality was Southren hospitality,
an' me idee iv Southren hospitality was that a Southrengintleman
met ye at th' thrain with a noggm' iv dhrink in th' crook iv his
thumb an' if ye didn't dhrink he shot ye.<br>
<img src="SODA.JPG" width="179" height="228"> </p>

<p align="center"><i>The New Kentucky Hospitality<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;But I was all wrong, d'ye mind. Th' South that used to
be thirsty has gone dhry. Now, whin aKentucky gintleman meets ye
at th' thrain, if ye're a dhrinkin' man 'tis not to his home he
invites ye, but to th' town jail. He no longer allures ye with
th' cup that cheers an' inebyrates ye tonight an' biteth like
an asp an' stingeth like an adder tomorrah mornin'. No, sir.
Th' best ye can get in public is a small pan iv Jamaica ginger or
exthract iv vanilla in th' corner dhrug store. In th' hospitable
mansions iv th' South, with their wide porticos, their lofty
pillars an' their overhanging eaves an' morgedges, where wanst
th' tired traveller heard on approachin' a sound like th' ringin'
of sleigh bells, which showed that th' colonel had seen him
comin' an' was hurlin' together a whisky punch, he can on'y get a
dhrink be crawlin' behind th' colonel down into th' coal cellar,
while Ephraim, th' old fam'ly servant that was employed last week
at th' slave market or imployment agency, watches f'r th' polis.
An' poor Sambo or Epaminondas Beecher Roosevelt, as th' case may
be, no longer sings th' sintimintal plantation ballad iv 'Give me
me gin,' but 'Away away th' bowl . '<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><i>King Alcohol and His Subjects<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Old King Alcohol is dethroned down South. He ain't put
out altogether, mind ye. He's like th' Jook iv Orleens in Paris.
Some iv th' old fam'lies receive him quietly in their homes an'
bow lower to him than they iver did whin he was on th' throne.
But he's lost most iv his authorities. Thousands that wanst fell
on their noses befure him now refuse to recognize him in public.
Whin he goes amongst th' popylace, he goes, as Hogan says,
incognito, disguised as a cure f'r fever an' ague, an' those that
know who he is on'y give a wink. He's not supposed to be there,
but 'twud be too much throuble to fire him out entirely, so he's
allowed to hang around, payin' no taxes an' supported be a few
faithful adherents. </p>

<p>&quot;'Tis th' same with him as with King Looey. Says wan man:
' I don't care how much King Looey or King Alcohol hurts ye, he
's good f'r me. Hooray f'r King Loocahol.' Says another: 'I don't
care how good he is f'r ye, he's bad f'r me. Death to th' King.'
And th' end iv it is that he's deprived iv his throne but niver
has his head cut off; he sneaks around an' does th' best he can,
an' is loved be those that he 's been useful to, an' hated be
those that can get along better without him, an' 1oved wan time
an' hated anothor be those he harms most.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="INCOG.JPG" width="180" height="197"> </p>

<p>A man that looks on a king as a roofover his head an' a flure
undher his feet will always be in favor iv kings. King Alcohol
an' King Edward make sorr.e people better thin their neighbors.
They are both stimulating to Rothschild. A little alcohol an' a
little Edward keep him goin'. Thin come a lot iv people that King
Edward or King Alcohol do nawthin' at all f'r, an' whin they find
it out they want to abolish him. An' afther thim are a great
throng that are pizened be anny kind iv a king an' they can't get
away fr'm him. At night they're wild with lilety that makes thim
think they're betther thin they iver thought they were. Th' king
has admitted thim to a private aujience an' has let thim tell
what they think about thimsilves. ' Rise, Sl William Hoskins,'
says he, 'if ye can,' ht says, an' he hits thim over th' back iv
th' head with a soord or a bottle. An' th' next mornin' whin they
do arise th' title has disappeared an' all they have left to
remindthim iv it is th' pain in th' back iv th' head where th'
knighting was done. </p>

<p>&quot;It's cured me iv me desire to go down South.
Hincefoorth, Hinnissy, I will spend me winters in' th' North, as
usual. Not that I need dhrink mesilf as a part iv hospitality. I
can dhrink an' I can let it aloneat different times. But many
people think that th' on'y diff'rence between hospitality an'
passin' a cold potato out iv th' back dure is a dhrink. F'r
mesilf I am more happy settin' down to an innocent meal with
nawthin' but water than I wud be at a table with lashings iv
dhrink-not that night, but th' day afther. I won't go South, not
because I will suffer mesilf, but I don't want to see th'
sufferings iv others. </p>

<p><img src="KNIGHTED.JPG" width="189" height="200"> </p>

<p>&quot;Th' victim iv th' dhrink habit whin he can't get a
dhrink is a dhreadful sight to me. Ye go down South expictin' to
see th' colonel an' hear him warm up over a mint julep an' tell
ye about th' battle iv Shiloh, which he fought so bravely thin
but more bravely iver since. Ye go up to th' old house on th'
plantation; ye notice an air iv desolation about th' place. There
are weeds m th' mint bed. Th' colonel leads ye into th' house an'
calls to th' faithful old retainer: 'Rastus, ye black rascal,
bring Colonel Hinnissy a glass an' trot out th' decanter iv
Munson's Cure f'r Epilepsy. Don't be afraid, Colonel. There isn't
a barrel iv headache in a dhrop iv it. Look at it. See how th'
sun shines through th' high wines, see th' beads iv fusel oil
glistening like amethysts, notice how the crystal morphine clings
to th' sides iv th' glass. Ye won't get anny such stuff as that
in th' North. I get it especially fr'm th' distiller in
Indianapolis, Injyanny. Here's ye 'r health, Colonel. Rastus,
stand by with th' fire hose to put th' Colonel out.' I </p>

<p>don't want to be a victim iv anny kind iv dhrink, but th' wan
kind I'm partic'l'ry afraid iv dyin' iv, is th' kind that is sold
in prohybition states. I wanst knew a man that had lived f'r
twinty years in Ioway an' escaped arrest undher th' Supreme Court
decision that he was entitled to an original package. Th'
packages that he got were th' most original I iver heerd iv. Whin
he come back to Chicago he cudden't find a cocktail that suited
him outside iv a dhrug store. Whin I made wan f'r him he asked me
if I hadn't left out th' rough on rats.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><i>A Colonel's Untiimely End<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir, it's goin' to wurruk a grreat change in th'
South. I expect to read that some frind iv mine in that impeeryal
domain, afther a jovyal meeting in a paint store, where he an'
his companyons imbibed . modhrately iv a can iv gasolene, engaged
in his civic duty as a member iv a vigilance comity, an'
approachin' too near th' fire, passed away beloved be all. Har'ly
a fam'ly in th' neighborhood but what has lost a member through
th' colonel's untimely departure. </p>

<p><img src="HOSKINS.JPG" width="180" height="252"> </p>

<p>&quot;Why, innissy, I read th' other day iv a most unfortunate
occurrence down in Texas. A perfectly respectable an' innocent
man, of good connections, while attemptin' to dhraw a revolver to
plug an inimy was hastily shot down be th' rangers, who thought
he was pullin' a pocket flask. Is no man's life safe against th'
acts iv irresponsible officers iv th' law ? </p>

<p align="center"><i>The Ominous Size of Wave<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;An' I tell ye something, Hinnissy, it ain't goin' to be
very long before this here wave iv prohybition comes up here an'
deluges ye an' me. Anny day ye may look to see boots an' shoes,
or more prob'bly books, in th' window where ye now see th'
stately rows iv bottles that ye think are filled with tempting
dhrink but raaly have nawthin' in thim but th' wather I filled
thim with th' year afther th' big fire. I'm a merchant, I am, an
I'll sell something. I was cut out be nature to sell people
things that they first took because they made thim feel supeeryor
to other people an' that later became a necessity to thim. Whin I
bought this thing I vear in me shirt front, that no jooler or
other robber wud take f'r a dimon pin, I got it because it raised
me up a notch above me fellow men. But afther wearin' it a little
while I cud no more do without it thin without me undhershirt,
that no wan iver sees onless they peek up me arm. So it is with
nearly all th' things that people buy, fr'm neckties to
autymobills, includin' dhrink. If I can't sell booze I'll sell
false hair, I'll sell cuffbuttons, I'll sell hair ile, I'll
sell patentleather shoes, I'll sell pianos. I'll sell joolry,
I'll sell brownstone houses, fast horses, or nommynations to
office. I deal in pride. I will sell annything except th'
necessities iv life. If I own anny iv thim I'll put thim in a
basket on th' counter an' say: </p>

<p>'Take wan.'<br>
<br>

</p>

<p align="center"><i>A Secret of theTrade<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Do I think 'twill come? Faith, I wudden't wondher. I see
what Hogan calls portints iv th' times. Th' day was whin ivry wan
that wanted a pollytickal job asked th' privilege iv hangin' a
litthygraft iv himsilf in me window. I let thim do it because it
hurt thim with many iv me customers, who said: ' I'll niver vote
f'r that robber.' But, nowadays, be Hivens, no wan wants his
pitcher hung in a saloon. They're thryin' to get thim pasted up
in th' churches. They're gettin' on to us. I'll tell ye a secret
iv th' thrade. I'd rather have th' Father Macchew Society behind
me thin th' entire saloon vote. </p>

<p><img src="COURT.JPG" width="202" height="258"><br>
</p>

<p align="center"><i>What Drink Does for a Man<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;I wudden't mind if prohybition did b r e a k through. In
his heart th' thruest prohybitionist is a saloonkeeper. B e t t h
e r t h i n annywan else he k n o w s t h a t what's his meat is
everybody else's pizen. Havin' l o n g assocyated with th'
dhrinkin' classes, I think less iv thim more an' more ivry year.
Th' dhrink makes thim too fond iv thimsilves. As me frind
Mulrooney th' printer says, th' dhrink knocks th' dot off their
little i an' they think they're upper case. A man comes in here
whin I'm about ready to pull down th' blinds, leans on th'
cheese, an' sings: 'My bonnie lies over th' ocean,' thin says: '
What's that ? ' whin I suggist that he go home, an' fin'lly ends
up be weeping over his throubles. I know what's th' matter with
him. He's thinkin' about himself too much. I know that his voice
sounds like suds escapin' fr'm th' kitchen sink, an' I can lick
him in a minyit with an' icepick, an' I am laughin' mesilf sick
over his fam'ly throubles, but he doesn't think so. Divvle th'
bit. He's got himsilf painted like a combynation iv Melba,
Jeffreys an' th'Two Orphans, an' annybody that don t believe he's
right is lookin' f'r throuble. Faith, if anny prohybitionist
thinks 'tis pleasant presidin' over this here Palace iv Rum he's
welcome to th' job. If I was an insanity expert, instead iv bein'
on th' level as I am, I'd commit half me patients to an asylum.

<p align="center">THE CRY OF THE WOMAN </p>

<p align="center">BY ELIZABETH GRAEME BARBOUR<br>
</p>

<p>Man's work is mine, tho' woman born; <br>
My hurried way in crowded mart <br>
Is trod unswervingly each morn; <br>
I live a thing apart, <br>
I bear a hungry heart.<br>
</p>

<p>Man's love and babe's, <br>
life hath denied; <br>
No leisure e'en to give a crust <br>
Is mine, swept onward with the tide <br>
Of those enslaved by lust <br>
Of gold, or load unjust. <br>
</p>

<p>I would not vie with men for gain, <br>
Nor in the sun of ease would bask; </p>

<p>I--who man's burden bear with pain-- <br>
I want my woman's task. <br>
Give this, O Lord, I ask!</p>

<h2><font color="#000000">The Federal Council of Churches</font></h2>

<p><font color="#000000">The Federal Council of Churches
supported prohibition and the 18th Amendment. In 1926 two of its
officers reaffirmed that support in testimony before the
Committee on the Judiciary of the United States Senate. The
following is scanned from K. Austin Kerr, ed., <i>The Politics of
Moral Behavior: Prohibition and Drug Abuse</i> (Reading: Addison
Wesley, 1973) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The support of national prohibition by
the Federal Council of the Churches rests upon four fundamental
considerations. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">First. The belief that in dealing with
gigantic social evils like disease or crime, individual liberty
must be controlled in the interest of the public welfare. Second.
The belief that the liquor traffic is beyond question such an
evil. Third. The conviction that no plan less thoroughgoing than
prohibition is sufficient to eradicate the evils of the liquor
traffic. Fourth. The evidence of history that other methods of
attempting to control the traffic have failed and that
prohibition, despite inadequacies of enforcement, is succeeding
better than any other program. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Limitation upon individual freedom in
matters affecting society is the price that any people must pay
for the progress of its civilization. Personal liberty can not
rightly be claimed for practices which militate against the
welfare of others or the interests of the community as a whole. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">It is especially contrary to democratic
ideals and to enlightened public policy to permit any citizen to
make profit from a business which is detrimental to his neighbor.
This is readily recognized by all as sound policy in regard to
the trade in narcotics. It is equally true of the liquor traffic.
To insure social protection against a trade whose avowed purpose
was to get people to consume the maximum possible amount of
alcoholic liquor is the foundation on which our national policy
of prohibition rests. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The policy of prohibition was not
adopted hastily nor was it foisted upon the country by a
puritanical minority. It was first voted in most of the States
separately and then nationally, because the people had become
convinced that the liquor traffic was a social evil of such
magnitude that it had to be destroyed. The eighteenth amendment
was made a part of the Constitution by the regular methods which
the founders of the Republic devised with a view to making the
amendment to the Constitution difficult rather than easy. Yet
this amendment was adopted more promptly than any other change in
the Constitution ever proposed. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The reasons which led to prohibition not
only remain to-day but have been reinforced by the experience of
other nations. The social peril of alcoholism is becoming a
growing concern to statesmen throughout the world. If serious
evils have sprung up since prohibition, they are far less than
the evils which arose from the liquor traffic prior to the
amendment. The liquor traffic with the accompanying saloon was
allied with political corruption, crime, gambling, and
prostitution. It meant the wreckage of men and the degradation of
families, which social workers and ministers saw constantly in
their daily work. It produced needless inefficiency in industry.
Moreover, the tendency in the United States, as has been the case
in Europe, was toward an increasing consumption of the stronger
liquors with consequent intensifying of social hazards. Methods
of control short of prohibition, such as taxation, regulations,
and the governmentally controlled systems of some of the Canadian
Provinces, Norway, and Sweden, have all proved inadequate to cope
with the evil. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The proposal to modify the Volstead Act
so as to permit the sale of wines and beer presents insuperable
objections. It would make enforcement more difficult. It would
inevitably mean the return either of the saloon or something
equally undesirable. Bootlegging in stronger liquors would become
more menacing because it would tend to operate through the places
where the milder intoxicants were sold. Moreover, there is no
evidence to justify the contention that to permit wine and beer
would reduce the consumption of ardent spirits. The teaching of
experience is to the contrary. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The one path of advance is for all good
citizens personally to observe the law and to support the great
enterprise, born of the idealism of the people, of completely
ridding the Nation of as demoralizing a business as the liquor
traffic has always proved itself to be. Least of all should our
prohibition law be changed in response to the cry of those who by
their own disrespect for the law are preventing it from receiving
a fair trial or who, because of their special interest in the
return of the liquor traffic, are artificially stimulating an
agitation for changing our present law. The call of the hour is
for such a thoroughgoing work of moral persuasion and legal
enforcement as will give the policy of prohibition an adequate
opportunity to demonstrate its full value to the Nation and to
the world. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><tt>The Women's National Committee for Law
Enforcement</tt></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><tt>During the 1920s, the Women's National
Committee for Law Enforcement, a federation of Protestant women's
organizations that claimed at least 12 million followers,
observed that prohibition was partially effective in achieving
its goals. The group sought better law enforcement for the better
realization of the reform, as its president, Mrs. Henry W.
Peabody, informed a Senate committee. </tt><i><tt>The National
Prohibition Law</tt></i><tt>, Hearings before the Committee on
the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, 69th Congress, 1st Session (1926):
666-67</tt> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><tt>We represent here to-day not only
organizations of women, but, as a whole, we represent the home,
the school, the church, and we stand firmly for no amendment to
the eighteenth amendment. We hold the Constitution of the United
States inviolate. We stand for no modification of the Volstead
Act, but rather a strengthening. We stand for strict law
enforcement, with the removal of all men who do not strictly
enforce the law.</tt> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><tt>We believe that in the greater part of
the territory of this country the law is observed as well as any
law. Having traveled in various parts of this country we did not
observe more drinking than ever. We find conditions vastly
improved. Health, as testified to by the insurance companies;
morals, as shown by the statements which will be produced later;
and certainly the economic condition, on the word of our
Secretary of Commerce, seem to have justified prohibition.</tt> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><tt>The conditions in States like New York
and Maryland, where there is no State enforcement law, which is
required by the eighteenth amendment, framed to secure concurrent
action, are bad. The only remedy, it seems to us, as women, is
not a change of law which is satisfactory to the majority of the
States, but to do what the Constitution requires to make the law
enforceable. That would remove very many of the offenses which
are piled up to prove that the Nation is not appearing to enforce
its laws.</tt> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><tt>As women, we know the old saloon and
the wreckage in homes and lives of boys, men, and women. While
the vote for the eighteenth amendment was the vote of the men--it
was also the vote of the women who had prayed and worked for
protection from this ancient evil. We had thought it settled, and
perhaps for that reason and believing in the Constitution, we
have not done as much as we should have done to see to the
enforcement of the law. Perhaps we as women, not being in the
position to select men who should administer these laws, trusted
too much and needed the awakening which has come. We are
convinced that we have a good law--a righteous law--written into
the Constitution of the United States--that it does not in any
way affect the personal liberty of well-doers--those loyal to the
highest interests of the country and the great majority of the
people.</tt> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><tt>We are not satisfied that the law is
being enforced in all places. We are sure it will be when the
Nation has had time to adjust itself. In a well-regulated home it
is the policy of a mother to work faithfully and patiently,
knowing that perfect obedience requires law and discipline. It is
never the policy of a good mother or teacher to say the children
are disobedient--therefore let us give in to them and let them do
as they like.</tt> </font></p>

<h2><font color="#000000"><font size="2">The City of Chicago, A
Study of the Great Immoralities</font></font></h2>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2"><strong>George Kibbe
Turner, &quot;The City of Chicago, A Study of the Great
Immoralities,&quot; </strong><strong><i>McClure's Magazine</i></strong><strong>
28(April 1907): 576-79</strong><br>
</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">&quot;The sale of
dissipation is not only a great business; it is among the few
greatest businesses of Chicago. The leading branch of it ... is
the sale of alcoholic liquor.... The liquor interests are vastly
more extended in Chicago that any other. There are 7,300 licensed
liquor sellers in Chicago, and in addition about a thousand
places where liquor is sold illegally. The only business which
approaches it in number of establishments ... is the grocery
trade, which has about 5,200. The city spends at least half as
much for what it drinks as for what it eats.... </font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">The great central power
in the liquor business in America is the brewery. ...The
breweries own or control the great majority of the saloons of
American cities. They have a distinct policy:--if there are not
as many saloons as there can be, supply them. This is what has
been done in Chicago. Fully ninety per cent of the Chicago
saloons are under some obligation to the brewery; with at least
eighty per cent, this obligation is a serious one.</font> </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">The business of the
brewery is to sell beer.... The brewery, under present conditions
in Chicago, must sell beer at all cost, or promptly die. This is
because the brewery business has become over-capitalized and
overbuilt there for at least ten years. There has been furious
competition.... At the present time a full third of the capital
invested in the forty companies and fifty plants is not earning
dividends. Under these circumstances, the breweries of Chicago
can have but one aim--to fill Chicago with beer to the point of
saturation.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">Each brewer disposes of
his product by contracting with special saloon-keepers to sell
his beer and no other. The more saloons he has, the better....
The brewers employ special agents to watch continually every nook
and cranny in Chicago where it may be possible to pour in a
little more beer. If a rival brewery's saloon keeper is doing
well, his best bartender is ravished from him and set up in
business alongside. If a new colony of foreigners appears, some
compatriot is set at once to selling them liquor. Italians,
Greeks, Lithuanians, Poles,--all the rough and hairy tribes which
have been drawn into Chicago,--have their trade exploited to the
utmost. ...No man with two hundred dollars, who was not subject
to arrest on sight, need go without a saloon in Chicago.... With
that two hundred dollars as a margin, the brewery sorts him out a
set of its stock of saloon fixtures, pays his rent, pays his
license, and supplies him with beer. He pays for everything in an
extra price on each barrel of beer.... </font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">Under this system ...
Chicago has four times as many saloons as it should have, from
any standpoint whatever, except, of course, the brewers' and the
wholesalers'. A new license law ... now limits the number to one
[saloon] in every five hundred people; but it will be years
before that law will have any appreciable effect. There is now
one retail liquor dealer to every two hundred and eighty five
people, disregarding, of course, the one thousand unlicensed
dealers. In the laboring wards the licensed saloons run as many
as one to every one hundred and fifty. Take the stock-yards.
Around that long and dismal stockade, at every hole from which a
human being can emerge, a shop or group of shops sits waiting. At
the main entrance they lie massed in batteries....</font> </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">The Chicago market is
thoroughly saturated with beer, and incidentally with other
liquor. Reckoning it out by population, every man, woman, and
child in Chicago drank, in 1906, two and one-quarter barrels of
beer,--that is, seventy gallons,--three and one-half times the
average consumption in the United States.... </font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">Now, if the competition
is red-handed among the breweries, it is simply ravenous among
the saloon-keepers. There is a popular fallacy that there is a
great profit in the retail saloon business. The saloon-keepers
themselves believe this when they go into it....</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2">All this means one
thing--a premium on the irregular and criminal saloon-keeper. The
patronage of the saloon is a very fickle and elusive thing. A
place is popular, or it is nothing. ... There are two general
business methods of attracting [a good trade]: By giving
unusually large measures or big bonuses of free lunch; or by
carrying illegitimate and illegal side lines. The first ... does
not leave large margins of profit; the second does. A year ago
the license fee was raised in Chicago from five hundred to one
thousand dollars. It was hoped this would wipe out the criminal
saloon. It did, of course, nothing of the sort. The poor,
miserable little dives in the working-man's ward, each snatching
a starvation living from the lips of the dwellers of the dozen
smoke-befouled frame tenements about it, staggered down--a few
hundred of them--and died. The man with the side-line of
prostitution and gambling naturally survived and had the benefit
of the others' failure.</font> </font></p>

<p> STUDIES FIND DRUG PROGRAM NOT EFFECTIVE </p>

<p> Yet high-level supporters argue &quot;it's better to have it
than not have it&quot; </p>

<p> by Dennis Cauchon </p>

<p> USA TODAY, 11 October 1993 </p>

<p> In just 10 years, D.A.R.E. has grown into the USA's No. 1
drug education program, reaching 5 million fifth-graders in 60%
of school districts. </p>

<p> The Drug Abuse Resistance Education logo -- &quot;D.A.R.E. To
Keep Kids Off Drugs&quot; -- is on bumper stickers, T-shirts,
even Kentucky Fried Chicken boxes. Police, taxpayers and business
give $700 million a year. It's also a favorite of dozens of
members of Congress. </p>

<p> But a raft of scientific studies says D.A.R.E., the 17-week
course taught by uniformed police, doesn't achieve its main
long-term goal: stopping kids from smoking pot, drinking booze or
using other drugs. </p>

<p> &quot;I've got nothing against D.A.R.E., but we need to get
some white light on this issue so we can wisely decide how to
spend our money and on what programs,&quot; says Tom Colthurst,
who recently organized a national conference on drug education at
the University of California-San Diego. But D.A.R.E. executive
director Glenn Levant calls the studies flawed and not
comprehensive: &quot;Scientists, will tell you bumble bees can't
fly, but we know they can.&quot; </p>

<p> Levant says a proper national study would cost $3 million-$5
million and take seven years to finish. </p>

<p> Studies have focused mostly on specific cities, and cost
several hundred thousand dollars each. </p>

<p> Experts agree recent research on D.A.R.E. is not perfect: It
is difficult and expensive to measure the behavior of large
numbers of children over several years. But they say the research
is better than studies on other drug programs. &quot;Almost every
researcher would agree there's enough information to judge
D.A.R.E.,&quot; says Rand Corp. researcher Phyllis Ellickson. </p>

<p> &quot;It's well-established that D.A.R.E. doesn't work,&quot;
says Gilbert Botvin of the Institute for Prevention at Cornell
University Medical Center. </p>

<p> Created in 1983 under the direction of former Los Angeles
Police chief Daryl Gates, D.A.R.E. exploded after the Bush
administration gave it heavy federal subsidies. </p>

<p> The program uses lectures, role playing and other techniques
to teach children to avoid drugs. And by all accounts, the kids
who take the course and the police who teach it think it's
terrific. D.A.R.E. &quot;does no harm and by far, nothing but
good,&quot; says Scott Mandel, a Los Angeles-area teacher.
&quot;D.A.R.E. really works,&quot; says Mike Miller, Round Rock,
Texas, police officer and D.A.R.E. teacher. &quot;Surveys from
across the nation show kids who take the D.A.R.E. course are much
less likely to use drugs later in life.&quot; </p>

<p> That's not what most studies show. </p>

<p> To investigate D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness, researchers looked
at two similar groups of children: One group takes D.A.R.E.; the
other does not. Then, researchers followed the children's
behavior for several years. Since 1987, studies -- most funded by
law enforcement agencies involved in the program -- have been
conducted at 20 North Carolina schools; 31 Kentucky schools; 11
South Carolina schools; 36 Illinois schools; and 11 Canadian
schools. The results were similar. </p>

<p> The 1991 Kentucky study, the National Institute on Drug Abuse
reported, found &quot;no statistically significant differences
between experimental groups and control groups in the percentage
of new users of ... cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, alcohol,
marijuana.&quot; </p>

<p> A 1990 study funded by the Canadian government found
&quot;D.A.R.E. had no significant effect on the students' use of
any of the substances measured.... They included: tobacco, beer,
pop, marijuana, acid, Valium, wine, aspirin, uppers, downers,
heroin, crack (cocaine), liquor, candy, glue and PCP.&quot; </p>

<p> To make sense of the various studies, the Justice Department
hired the Research Triangle Institute of Durham, N.C., to conduct
a statistical analysis of all D.A.R.E. research. </p>

<p> A preliminary report from the RTI -- analyzing eight studies
involving 9,500 children -- says D.A.R.E. has &quot;a limited to
essentially non-existent effect&quot; on drug use. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. did have a positive effect on children's knowledge
and attitudes about drugs, the report says. It also added the
social skills needed to say no to drugs. </p>

<p> But even on these measures, D.A.R.E. didn't do as well as
other drug programs, including local classes taught by teachers
and students. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America has launched a behind-the-scenes lobbying
campaign against the final RTI report, due in November. </p>

<p> &quot;We're working with D.A.R.E. to ... voice their
concerns,&quot; says Winnie Reed, the National Institute of
Justice official overseeing the study. </p>

<p> The pressure has angered some academic researchers.
&quot;It's repugnant, out of line and very unusual,&quot; says
Dennis Rosenbaum, director of the Center for Research in Law and
Justice at the University of Illinois-Chicago. </p>

<p> Rosenbaum -- a D.A.R.E. supporter -- says the group is its
own worst enemy because it has spent so much effort attacking the
evaluations, rather than learning from research. </p>

<p> Even some state and local D.A.R.E. programs are backing away
from D.A.R.E. America's fight. &quot;If we aren't getting the job
done, we ought to be man enough to try something else,&quot; says
Tim DeRosa of the Illinois state police and long-time D.A.R.E.
activist. </p>

<p> Some government officials are aware of D.A.R.E.'s
shortcomings. </p>

<p> &quot;Research shows that, no, D.A.R.E. hasn't been effective
in reducing drug use,&quot; says William Modzeleski, the top drug
official at the Department of Education. </p>

<p> The department has considered asking Congress to repeal a law
requiring states to give D.A.R.E. a total of $10 million or more
a year from federal Drug Free Schools money. </p>

<p> But D.A.R.E. continues to have high-level government support.
</p>

<p> On Sept. 9 -- National D.A.R.E. Day by congressional decree
-- D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officials and students lunched with dozens of Congress
members and met Attorney General Janet Reno. Later, they visited
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. </p>

<p> Drug czar Lee Brown, who started the program in Houston when
he was police chief, remains a booster. &quot;My experience has
been positive,&quot; Brown says. &quot;The research has pointed
in many different directions, but my conclusion is it's better to
have it than not have it. I know first-hand that young people are
impressed by it and look up to the D.A.R.E. officer as a role
model.&quot; </p>

<p> Yet many drug education experts fear that D.A.R.E.'s
political clout is siphoning drug education money from better
programs. </p>

<p> &quot;D.A.R.E. has a following and sales force that is
extremely powerful in fighting for scarce resources,&quot; says
University of Michigan researcher Lloyd Johnston, who conducts
the government's survey of teen drug use. &quot;But its growth is
totally out of scale to its effectiveness.&quot; </p>

<p> Johnston and others aren't sure why D.A.R.E. isn't working
better. </p>

<p> Some think it targets children too young; some think teachers
and older students get better results than uniformed police;
others say the program relies on psychological theories that
don't work. </p>

<p> Levant thinks critics are just jealous of D.A.R.E.'s success.
&quot;We're like apple pie,&quot; he says. &quot;But I guess you
can always find someone who doesn't like apple pie.&quot; </p>

<h1>George Remus - a Prohibition Saga</h1>

<p><b>Summarized by Bob Ramsey</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>The story of George Remus is fascinating in its own right,
emcompassing love, jealousy, crime, enormous wealth, retribution,
murder, and courtroom drama. It also shows very clearly how
prohibition warps society with irresistible incentives. </p>

<p>This version of the story is excerpted from THE LONG THIRST-
PROHIBITION IN AMERICA: 1920-1933 by Thomas M. Coffey WW Norton
&amp; Co, New York City 1975 </p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS:</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>George Remus was born in Germany in 1876 and migrated to
Chicago at the age of 5. </p>

<p>His father was incapacitated when he was 14 and George
supported the family by working at a pharmacy, which he bought at
age 19. Within 5 more years, he bought another drugstore,
married, and had a daughter. He became a lawyer in 1900, at age
24. </p>

<p>He specialized in criminal defense, especially murder, and
became rather famous. By 1920 he was earning $50,000 a year (when
gold was $20 per ounce). He divorced after developing an ongoing
affair with his beautiful and ambitious secretary (Imogene), who
had a 13 year-old daughter (Ruth). Alcohol Prohibition started in
January 1920, and within a few months Remus saw that his clients,
a generally crude and ignorant lot, were becoming very wealthy
very quickly. He was sure he could do better than them with his
intelligence and knowledge of the law. </p>

<p>He memorized the Volstead Act (that enforced prohibition) and
found loopholes whereby he could buy distilleries and pharmacies
so as to sell liquor to himself under government licenses for <u>medicinal
purposes</u>. Most of the liquor would disappear on the way to
market. He moved to Cincinnati because 80 percent of America's
bonded whiskey was within 300 miles, and bought up most of
America's best-known whiskey manufacturers. </p>

<p>In less than three years he made $40 million ($760M in 1995
dollars). He bribed hundreds of police, judges, and government
officials including $500,000 to the U.S. Attorney General. </p>

<p>George and Imogene held a lavish party at their new mansion on
New Year's Eve of 1922-23. The guests included 100 couples who
were as well-connected as one could imagine. At dawn the Remus's
presented all their male guests with diamond jewelry, and gave
each guest's wife a brand new automobile for the drive home. This
was the high point. </p>

<p>Prohibition enforcement stepped up shortly and Remus found
himself sentenced to two years in Atlanta Federal Penitentiary,
which was (for rich inmates) much like a luxury hotel. </p>

<p>While Remus was in prison, his wife Imogene took up with an
extremely handsome prohibition agent named Franklin Dodge. Dodge
soon resigned from the Bureau of Prohibition. Together, he and
Imogene liquidated Remus' assets and hid as much of the money as
possible. They did various unkind things to him such as: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Imogene gave George $100 as his share of the proceeds
        when she sold the Fleischman Company. </li>
    <li>At one point she tried to have him deported, claiming his
        father had never become a citizen. </li>
    <li>Dodge and Mrs. Remus reportedly offered a gang $15,000 to
        murder George. </li>
</ul>

<p>Imogene proceeded to divorce him in late 1927. On the day the
divorce was to be finalized, on the way to court Remus had his
chauffeur chase the cab carrying Imogene and her daughter through
Cincinnati, finally forcing it off the road. Remus jumped out
screaming and shot her dead while her daughter tried to stop him.
</p>

<p>Remus the expert criminal defender was now on trial for his
life. The trial made national headlines for a month, sharing
front pages with Lindbergh's flight to Paris. Remus pleaded
temporary insanity, a novel approach at the time. </p>

<p>Having long been the most generous man in town, he was very
popular in Cincinnati, and he so successfully vilified Imogene
and her boyfriend Dodge that the jury deliberated only 19 minutes
before acquitting him by reason of insanity. The courtroom
erupted in shamefully exuberant jubilation. </p>

<p>The state of Ohio then tried to commit him to an insane asylum
since the jury found him insane, but prosecutors were thwarted by
their previous claim (backed up by the prosecution's three
well-known psychiatrists) that he could be tried for murder
because was not insane. </p>

<p>Remus tried to get back into bootlegging, but soon retired
when he found that the market had been taken over by vicious,
well-armed gangsters. He moved across the Ohio river to a
(relatively) modest home in Covington, Kentucky, and lived out
his life for another 20-odd years in relative obscurity. </p>

<h2 align="center">A little levity about arrogance<br>
<strong>by Clifford A. Schaffer</strong> </h2>

<p align="center">Some of us are destined for greatness. And the
others . . .</p>

<hr>

<p>There are a certain number of people in the world who believe,
for whatever reason, that they have the one true answer to some
major problem of their time. For a few of them, the belief is
strong enough that they charge off like Don Quixote, arrogantly
determined to make the whole rest of the world conform to their
view of reality. For a tiny, rare percentage of them it is an
actual historical truth that they have the one true answer to a
major problem. By far the majority, however, are just plain,
garden-variety nuts destined to go to their deathbed thinking
they almost had it. If you happen to be a person so afflicted,
how can you tell whether you really are one of these unique
people in history, or just a plain, old nut? </p>

<p>Consider, for example, the true story of Emperor Joshua
Norton. </p>

<p>Joshua Norton was a businessman in San Francisco in the
1800's. In the 1840's, just before the Gold Rush, he tried to
corner the market on rice and failed. He went from being very
wealthy to being destitute overnight and the experience
completely shattered his reason. A couple of months after this
event, he put on a formal admiral's uniform, complete with gold
braid and epaulets and strode in to the office of the newspaper.
He handed the editor a large, official looking proclamation which
stated in quite formal language that, due to popular demand, he
hereby declared himself Emperor Norton I of San Francisco,
California, and Mexico. He bade all his subjects show him loyalty
and the other courtesies due a person of such eminent stature. </p>

<p>From the pictures of Emperor Norton, it is immediately
apparent that this guy has gone around the bend and ain't coming
back. His eyes pointed in different directions, and neither one
quite caught straight ahead. His uniform was formal to the point
of almost gaudy and, at the same time, it was quite apparent that
he and soap were not of regular acquaintance. </p>

<p>The editor, with a rich sense of humor, decided to publish the
proclamation on the front page of the newspaper, in all
seriousness. The citizens of San Francisco, being what they are,
immediately decided that this sounded like a good idea and, by
unanimous acclamation, accepted Norton as their Emperor. It is
undoubtedly the only time in history they ever had an unanimous
vote on anything. </p>

<p>He reigned for about forty years. During that time he ate in
all of the finest restaurants and slept in the finest hotels for
free -- because he was the Emperor. He had three seats
permanently reserved in the front row of the San Francisco opera
house -- one for him, and one each for his two dogs. Twice a year
he would review the police and fire departments as they paraded
by, and then he would make a grand speech to the assembled
crowds. He printed his own money, which was accepted in business
establishments around San Francisco as legal tender. When
bicycles first came out, they got him a bicycle, too, and he
looked all the more daft because of it. When one of his dogs
died, 10,000 people turned out for the funeral to console their
grief-stricken emperor. When the Civil War rolled around, he
graciously offered his alliance and military support to Abraham
Lincoln, who politely declined. </p>

<p>Make no mistake about it, the Emperor Norton was as good a
loony as you have ever run across and I can't help feeling that a
man who was that intelligent must have had some idea of just how
completely nuts he really was. </p>

<p>Now here's the problem. During his reign as Emperor, Norton
came up with three major ideas: </p>

<p>1) He called upon the other leaders of the world to join him
in forming a League of Nations where disputes between nations
could be resolved peacefully. </p>

<p>2) He suggested that parts of San Francisco Bay be filled in
to make more room to build. </p>

<p>3) He proposed that a suspension-span bridge be built across
the spot where the Golden Gate stands now. He even laid out a
complete design that looks remarkably close to the bridge that
was built sixty years after he died. He correctly predicted that
only a suspension span bridge would have the strength to span
such a large stretch, and the flexibility to stand up under the
extreme stress which would be placed on such a structure. He did
this at a time when the only suspension bridges ever built were
rope bridges in remote parts of Africa. </p>

<p>Of course, when he proposed these ideas, the response was long
and uproarious laughter -- the Emperor was up to his old tricks
again. In time, all of his ideas became reality. At the time, no
one believed him. </p>

<p>It has occurred to me that Jesus must have had the same
problem. Think of what must have happened when he showed up for
his high school reunion. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey fellas,&quot; He says. &quot;You'll never believe
what happened. It turns out I really AM the Messiah.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; his school chums say. &quot;If you're
the Messiah, where's your Porsche?&quot; </p>

<p>That's probably why he spent all his time doing miracles like
turning water into wine -- nobody took him seriously until he
showed up with the booze. </p>

<p>So put yourself in Emperor Norton's position and consider what
you might do. Suppose you are strolling down the street one day,
perhaps toking your favorite blend, and a big bolt of lightning
comes out of the sky and blasts you right out of your shoes. When
you come to, you are thoroughly convinced that you have the one
true insight which, unique among men, has given you the answer to
one or more of society's most troubling problems. What are you to
do? </p>

<p>If you keep quiet about it, the world could be missing one of
the best emperors ever to come along. Everyone loses, including
you. </p>

<p>If you act on it, tell everyone about it, and attempt to
install yourself as emperor then you could do some real good for
both you and posterity. Certainly, if you can really save the
world then it seems almost a moral obligation to try. Of course,
if you try, you have to face the fact that, statistically
speaking, it is far more likely that you are a nut than an
emperor, and far more likely that you will be laughed at than
taken seriously. There have been lots and lots of nuts, and only
a handful of emperors. </p>

<p>So what should you do? I think the only thing you can do is
act on the belief, keep an enormous sense of humor, and be
content with the fact that you might wind up in the encyclopedia
next to Emperor Norton. But that's just my take on the situation.

<h1>The Unluckiest Guy I Ever Met </h1>

<p><b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p>This is a true story. The facts have not been embellished. In
fact, I left a lot of stuff out. </p>

<hr>

<p>When I first met Art in the late 1960's, he had just gotten
out of prison the first time and was in college, desperately
trying to make a go of his life. He was a bit scroungy in his
appearance, but everybody was a little scroungy in those days and
the truth was that Art never did have the money for fine clothes.
He did the best he could. Art was one the nicest, friendliest,
and most agreeable people I ever met. As a friend, I enjoyed his
company on every occasion and found that Art was not a complete
angel (neither was I, for that matter), but there was no reason
to ever believe that he might be any real threat to society. </p>

<p>But Art was the unluckiest soul I have ever run across. For
example, the first time Art went to prison, it was for stealing
his own motorcycle. He was later arrested and/or went to prison
for burglarizing his own apartment, stealing a mattress from a
Salvation Army box, and for selling marijuana that even the
police knew wasn't his. Those are only a few of the misfortunes
which befell him and I haven't even gotten to the part about his
lawyer. I will explain. </p>

<hr>

<h3>Stealing His Own Motorcycle </h3>

<p>When Art became old enough to get a driver's license, he
worked hard and saved his money until he was able to buy the
vehicle of his dreams, a three-wheeled motorcycle. When he
thought he had enough money, about $1,000 as I recall, he
searched around and found a three-wheeled motorcycle for sale at
a local wrecking yard. The owner of the wrecking yard was not
well-renowned for his honest business dealings, and Art probably
should have been more cautious but Art was so dazzled with the
prospect of fulfilling his dream that he bought it anyway. As Art
tells it, the owner of the wrecking yard made certain promises
about the mechanical fitness of the vehicle and Art quickly found
out that the vehicle was in no shape to be driven. </p>

<p>Art called the owner of the junkyard, raised the riot act, and
demanded that repairs be made immediately. The owner of the
junkyard told him to bring the bike on over and he would fix it
up. Art did so. </p>

<p>About a week later Art showed up to pick up his bike. It was
all repaired and ready for the road, complete with a bill from
the junkyard owner for several hundred dollars worth of repairs.
Art went ballistic, screaming and shouting that he had been
robbed and that the junkyard owner had warranted that the vehicle
was in good shape when he bought it. It was an old story, the
used car dealer with a mechanic's lien against the injured buyer
- who are you going to believe? </p>

<p>Art left in a rage and his common sense, which never was in
great supply, left him completely. The next weekend, he went to
the wrecking yard when it was closed, cut the lock on the gate,
went in, got his bike, and took it home. </p>

<p>On Monday morning, it was perfectly obvious to the junkyard
owner what had happened. The lock was cut and only one thing was
missing. This didn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure out. He had
long experience in turning such situations to his advantage. He
quickly called the police, reported the theft and, in addition,
claimed that several thousand dollars of other goods had been
taken. Who can tell what is missing from a junkyard? </p>

<p>The police simply stopped by Art's house, found the bike in
the driveway, and hauled him off to jail. The DA then trumpeted
the news that a major theft ring had been broken and shipped Art
off to prison. The proof that Art was part of a major burglary
ring was supplied by the fact that there really wasn't much
evidence. They expected, from the junkyard owner's description of
the incident, that there would be tons of stuff in Art's garage.
As it was, there was nothing but the bike which indicated only
one possible conclusion - he must have stolen tons of the stuff
and been able to fence all of it in less than 48 hours -
obviously a major theft ring. The DA and cops got a lot of good
publicity for saving the community from this awful scourge. Fine
police work saved the day, they said. </p>

<p>The junkyard owner got Art's money, the bike, and payment from
the insurance company for the items &quot;stolen&quot; but not
recovered. Art's lawyer got a mortgage on Art's parents' house.
The situation worked out great for everybody, except Art. A
couple of years later, when I met him, Art was still dealing with
insurance company people who were pursuing him and his parents
for reimbursement of the stuff he never stole. </p>

<p>For that he got a sentence of about five years, which netted
down to about 18 months in prison. He might have deserved a day
in jail and a short lecture about mechanics liens. </p>

<p>When I walked down the street with Art, or appeared in any
public place, it was immediately apparent that the Sacramento
County Sheriffs had it in for him. I am not sure whether they
really believed that Art ran a major theft ring as had been
alleged or whether they just didn't like his looks, or just
didn't like Art. I suspect it was the latter. He was an easy
target to pick on, and my personal impression was that they did
it just because a number of them were plainly sadistic and they
liked easy targets. </p>

<p>From that point forward, Art was likely to be stopped
anywhere, any time, by any Sheriff who happened to see him,
without any real cause that I could determine. They just made it
a point to hound him wherever they saw him. </p>

<hr>

<h3>The Mattress Incident </h3>

<p>Art got out of prison and enrolled in the local junior
college. Art had no money and his parents had been effectively
bankrupted by the legal experience so Art was in a daily struggle
just to keep food in his belly and clothes on his back. But there
was no question that he was trying to get an education and point
himself in the right direction. </p>

<p>Because of the financial strains at home, Art moved out of his
parents' house and got a small two-room cottage.
&quot;Small&quot; is the operative word. The &quot;bedroom&quot;
was literally not big enough to put a double bed in, and the
kitchen was smaller. Mice and roaches? Of course. It was simply
the best Art could do. </p>

<p>Life was extremely tough for Art. There wasn't much employment
available for anyone, let alone ex-cons, and he lived a
day-to-day, hand-to-mouth existence. Beset by financial
pressures, he turned to dealing marijuana on a small time basis,
using some of the contacts he had met in prison. That income was
&quot;iffy&quot; at best and Art had to use nearly all of it just
to eat, pay the rent, and support his dilapidated pickup truck,
which meant he didn't have any furniture. That is, the only thing
he had to sleep on was the linoleum floor. </p>

<p>He went out driving with his friend John one night and noticed
a mattress that someone had dumped at a Salvation Army donation
box. It seemed pretty clear to both of them that Art was just the
kind of person for whom such a donation was intended, so they
proceeded to load it in to the back of Art's pickup truck. As
they were doing so, the Sheriff pulled up. John, a tall
long-legged guy, had an ounce of weed in his pants so he quickly
hurdled two or three six-foot fences and was gone into the night.
Art was stuck. </p>

<p>The deputies started their standard routine of harassing Art
for everything they could think of. They first hit him with every
kind of mechanical citation they could on the truck, but that
wasn't much. Then they told Art they had found a joint on the
running board. Art, by this time, had learned the drill and
pointed out that, realistically, such a charge would never stick
and would just be a waste of time for both of them. Frustrated,
the cops decided to charge him with stealing the mattress. Art,
of course, clammed up and said nothing. </p>

<p>They stuffed Art and the mattress into the back of their
patrol car and drove down to the main jail in downtown
Sacramento, about fifteen miles away from where Art was arrested.
When they got downtown, they talked it over with their superiors
and decided that - despite all the danger that mattress-stealing
represented to the community - there was no way they could make
the charges stick in court. The reason was that they had caught
Art with the mattress half in, and half out, of his pickup truck
and they couldn't tell for sure whether Art was stealing the
mattress, or dropping it off. I am sure it disappointed them. </p>

<p>So they went to Art, gave him the news and showed him the exit
door. He asked for a ride back to his truck which was greeted
with great hilarity all around. Art just turned slowly and walked
to the door. As he reached the door they called out &quot;Wait!
Don't forget your mattress!&quot; </p>

<p>They explained that he certainly couldn't leave his mattress
there and would have to take it with him. Art considered telling
them that the mattress wasn't really his, but quickly realized
that, if he did so, and refused to take the mattress, they would
bust him again for stealing it. He asked for a ride again which,
he later told me, provoked absolutely panic-stricken laughter.
&quot;They were in tears!&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Art left the building dragging his mattress behind him, and
went out on the street to try to hitchhike home. He was tired,
looked a little scroungy anyway, and was carrying a mattress, all
of which is a real hindrance to efficient hitchhiking. He
considered just dumping the mattress and walking home, but there
were regular police patrols going by to watch his progress and
make sure that he didn't litter. Then it began to rain. </p>

<p>Holding the mattress over his head allowed him to keep the
rain off of himself, but it meant that the mattress got
progressively heavier with each step - and he still had more than
ten miles to go. Late that night, after several hours of struggle
with the wet mattress, an undercover narc picked Art up, allowed
Art to stuff the wet mattress in the back seat of his car, and
gave him a ride home, pumping him all the time for information on
where one might find a little weed. Art didn't tell him anything.
</p>

<p>Art finally got home, propped the soaked mattress up against
the wall in the bedroom, and went to sleep, exhausted, on the
linoleum floor again. An hour after he fell asleep, the mattress
fell over on him and, because the room was so narrow and the
mattress was so wet and heavy, it wedged him in so tight he
couldn't get out until his friend John came looking for him the
next day. </p>

<hr>

<h3>Burglarizing His Own Apartment </h3>

<p>Times were undeniably tough for Art, and the exhaustion of
having to deal with the cops on an almost daily basis didn't help
matters. A couple of times he did manage to get jobs, only to be
let go when it became obvious to his employers that Art was a
center of attention for the police. </p>

<p>But he managed to get by for quite a while doing odd jobs here
and there, eating next to nothing, and wearing the same old
threadbare clothes. Then one day the rent was due and his
landlord came to the door. Art explained that he was about to go
a job interview and then would pick up the rent money from his
parents and, if the landlord would kindly wait a little bit, Art
would surely have the money for him. It was a partial story - his
parents didn't have the money, either, but he did have a job
interview - but Art was just trying to buy a little time to keep
his life together. The landlord seemed to accept the story and
Art thought everything was fine. </p>

<p>Art started to get cleaned up for his job interview and, after
taking a shower, put on his pants and went down to the mailbox to
check the mail. By the time he got back, there was a padlock on
the door. He pleaded with the landlord but the landlord also knew
by now that Art was of special interest to the cops, so the
landlord had no incentive to give Art even the tiniest break. Art
went out and sat in the middle of a field, with nothing on but
his pants, to think. </p>

<p>By and by it got dark and Art figured he would sneak back in
to get the rest of his possessions which amounted to a belt, a
couple of shirts, an old pair of shoes, three or four pieces of
raggedy underwear, and the mattress, which he decided not to try
to deal with again, because it had become extremely moldy from
the earlier soaking in the rain. Getting in to his place was
easy. He just popped in through a side window. He was inside no
more than two or three minutes. </p>

<p>When he popped his head out the window a deputy sheriff's
flashlight shone squarely in his face. The landlord had alerted
them hours before and they were waiting for him. Due to his
previous criminal record, he wound up doing about another six
months on that one. </p>

<hr>

<h3>The Marijuana That Wasn't His. </h3>

<p>When Art got out of jail he went back to college and tried to
make a go of it again. The only regular income he could find was
from selling small amounts of marijuana and other drugs. He had
some fairly good drug connections from his various times in jail,
but we was more honest and friendly than he was shrewd so he
never did much more than a few small sales to eke out an
existence. </p>

<p>As luck would have it Art ran into a bright young business
executive who was just starting out with a new wife and baby and,
having put a little money aside, decided to dabble in the
marijuana trading market. Somehow, he managed to get his hands on
thirty pounds of weed and then started looking around to sell it.
He didn't know anyone himself who was interested in thirty pounds
of weed but eventually he ran into Art and mentioned that he
would pay Art a commission of one hundred dollars and a small bag
of personal stash if Art could introduce him to someone who would
buy it. Art knew lots of people and one hundred dollars was a lot
of money to Art, so he looked around until he found someone. </p>

<p>Art introduced the two parties to the transaction and waited
patiently for them to conclude their business so he could get his
commission and leave. In the middle of the transaction, car
lights went on and car motors started in the neighborhood around
them. In a matter of a few moments, they were surrounded by
Sacramento sheriff's deputies. The buyer he found turned out to
be a snitch. </p>

<p>To summarize the legal proceedings which followed, the guy who
actually owned the weed pleaded that he was really a good citizen
who made a mistake, he had a wife and baby, etc., etc., He walked
out with probation, with an agreement to testify against Art. </p>

<p>The snitch, who had previously been busted, got his previous
charges dropped with an agreement to testify against Art. </p>

<p>Art was charged with possession for sale of the entire thirty
pounds. That brings us to the lawyer. </p>

<hr>

<h3>And Now, The Lawyer </h3>

<p>Art's lawyer advised him that, in view of all the previous
convictions, and a long string of nuisance violations (which
should have been self-evident police harassment), this time Art
was destined to do some serious time in prison unless some sort
of miracle happened. Art's lawyer suggested that the only way out
was for Art to turn someone else in - turn snitch. </p>

<p>&quot;Snitches get killed.&quot; Art said. &quot;What else can
I do?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Maybe they would let you off if you had a job and could
show that you were trying to be an honest citizen,&quot; his
lawyer suggested. </p>

<p>Art promptly went out and got an absolutely grinding job
several miles from home. It was a massive struggle just to keep
up with the job, but he did it. Then he went back to his lawyer. </p>

<p>&quot;No dice,&quot; his lawyer told him. &quot;You are going
to have to do something else.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Like what?&quot; Art asked. </p>

<p>&quot;You could always snitch someone off,&quot; his lawyer
suggested. </p>

<p>&quot;Snitches get killed,&quot; Art said. &quot;I don't want
to get killed. What else can I do?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm,&quot; his lawyer said, &quot;maybe you should get
married to show them that you are trying to settle down.&quot; </p>

<p>Art looked up an old high school girlfriend, explained the
situation to her and she agreed to get married. She had a fairly
decent job and they were able to move into a good apartment on
her income. After the wedding, he went back to his lawyer. </p>

<p>&quot;Still not cutting it,&quot; his lawyer told him.
&quot;You are going to have to do something else.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Like what?&quot; Art asked. </p>

<p>&quot;You could always snitch someone off,&quot; his lawyer
suggested. </p>

<p>&quot;Snitches get killed,&quot; Art said. &quot;I don't want
to get killed. What else can I do?&quot; </p>

<p>His lawyer thought it over again. &quot;Maybe if you had a
baby on the way. Babies always get sympathy.&quot; </p>

<p>Art promptly went out and got his bride pregnant. When she was
beginning to show, he went back to his lawyer. </p>

<p>&quot;Closer. I had them going for a while with the baby
story, but it is still not enough,&quot; his lawyer clucked.
&quot;You're going to have to do something more.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Like what?&quot; Art asked. </p>

<p>&quot;You could always snitch someone off,&quot; his lawyer
suggested. </p>

<p>&quot;Snitches get killed,&quot; Art said. &quot;I don't want
to get killed. What else can I do?&quot; </p>

<p>His lawyer thought and thought again and finally said,
&quot;They might cut you some slack if you were a heroin addict
and claimed that what you were out of control because of your
addiction and what you really need is rehabilitation. If you did
that, I might be able to get you out with a year or so in a
hospital.&quot; </p>

<p>Art had never taken heroin in his life, but it was hard to
turn down that kind of opportunity to avoid a long stretch in
prison. He developed a good-sized heroin habit, went through a
couple of really good withdrawal episodes in front of doctors who
could testify that he really was addicted, and then went back to
his lawyer. </p>

<p>&quot;We almost had them there,&quot; his lawyer said,
&quot;but it still wasn't quite enough. You are going to have to
do something else.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Like what?&quot; Art asked. </p>

<p>&quot;You could always snitch someone off,&quot; his lawyer
suggested. </p>

<p>&quot;Snitches get killed,&quot; Art said. &quot;I don't want
to get killed. What else can I do?&quot; </p>

<p>By that time, both Art and his lawyer had run out of ideas.
Art was now working, married with a baby on the way, and a pretty
good heroin habit, all on the advice of his lawyer. Art became
resigned to the fact that, in order to avoid spending the rest of
his life in jail, he was going to have to snitch someone off. </p>

<p>The sheriffs really enjoyed Art's company as a snitch. They
rounded up several people before the word got out about Art and
it wasn't long before there were rumors floating the streets that
Art would not be long for this world if he hung around
Sacramento. </p>

<p>But, it seemed to work. For the first time since he had been
busted for the thirty pounds of pot which wasn't his, it began to
look like they were going to let him off the hook - until the
next time, at least. </p>

<p>Then, a week before his case was due to come its final
resolution, his lawyer was busted for income tax evasion and had
to drop out of the case. Art got a public defender who knew
nothing about the case and believed the sheriff's deputies when
they gleefully told him that there had been no deal with Art at
all. Art went to prison, full sentence for the full thirty
pounds, a multiple felony offender besides, and remains there
today. He spends most of his time alone in protective custody
because of the death threats against him. </p>

<h1>The Lower East Side Needle Exchange T-Shirt</h1>

<p><b>(my naive attempt to relate to a heroin user as if he were
a normal person)</b> </p>

<p><b>by Bob Ramsey (rmz@computek.net)</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>In Mid-November, I attended the 8th International Conference
on Drug Policy Reform at a hotel in Washington, D.C. On the last
evening I was walking past the propaganda table at the main
ballroom and passed this guy ambling the other way. He was
wearing a leather jacket that was unzipped revealing his black
T-shirt with white letters in a nifty graphic saying &quot;Lower
East Side Needle Exchange&quot;. We passed without greeting and
after about 5 steps I thought &quot;I want one of those
T-shirts&quot;. After 5 more steps I thought &quot;maybe he knows
where I could get one&quot;... 5 more and &quot;I'll never find
out if I don't ask him now&quot;. I turned and scurried around
the corner where he had just disappeared. </p>

<p>There were just the two of us in the 50 yard walkway alongside
the ballrooms... &quot;Excuse me, sir... excuse me... hey,
where'd you get that T-shirt? Can I get one?&quot; </p>

<p>He stopped and turned methodically. &quot;Well yeah, man,
we're selling them for 10 bucks&quot;. </p>

<p>&quot;Do you have any in extra large?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No. All we got left is large. Do you think you could get
by with... No, I guess you need an extra large. I could send you
one when we get back to New York.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;How much would it be with shipping and handling?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well gee, I dunno... I guess it would be less than
$20&quot;. </p>

<p>&quot;I suppose it would! How about 15?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I guess that'd prob'ly do it. But hey, maybe my boss has
an extra large left. We could walk around and check.&quot; </p>

<p>We exchanged pleasantries as we walked back around past the
conference entrance where I had first seen him. He found that I
was from outside of Dallas and asked if they have a needle
exchange there, but I didn't know. When we came to the small
meeting room on the other side he went in. The meeting was just
breaking up and people started filing out, some leaving, some
forming small groups in the hallway. He came out with four or six
people kind of dressed like him who assembled by the windows as
he came back over to me. &quot;I'm sorry, man, we're out of extra
large, but if you give me $15, I'll mail you one right when I get
home.&quot; </p>

<p>I didn't have correct change, but after some fumbling and
discussions with passers-by, I ended up giving him a twenty and a
five, and he gave me a ten. </p>

<p>&quot;I don't have any cards left&quot;, I said, &quot;do you
have some place I can write down my address?&quot; </p>

<p>He rifled through his stack of leaflets and handed me a light
blue half-sheet that was blank on the back. I sat on the bench
along the wall to write my address, but found that my pencil
didn't show up well on the blue paper. </p>

<p>&quot;Do you have a pen?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Sure!&quot; he said, and he handed me a syringe. The
part you push on with your thumb was in the &quot;out&quot;
position, and the glass tube was filled with a reddish
translucent liquid that I suppose was intended to represent a
mixture of blood and heroin. At the end where the needle would be
was a ball-point pen. </p>

<p>&quot;Well!&quot; I said. &quot;I've never seen anything quite
like this! Do you have any more of these?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No, man, that's from a needle exchange across town. We
just have the T-shirts.&quot; </p>

<p>Sitting there on the bench, I wrote down &quot;X-Large&quot;
and my address and handed it up to the disheveled gentleman in
black. As he leaned over to retrieve his pen, his dark wavy hair
fell alongside his face and I was hit with a strong gust of
mysterious aromas punctuated by tobacco. </p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, man. We appreciate it. I'll send you some
literature, too.&quot; </p>

<p>As he hurried off to join his comrades, he turned and waved.
&quot;Thanks again, it's for a good cause.&quot; </p>

<hr>

<p>When I got back to the office on Monday, I was a big hit with
my tales about the drug law conference and the literature I
brought back. Everyone gathered around to read &quot;Prison
Life&quot; monthly, with its advice column &quot;Ask Bubba&quot;.
Bubba dished up sage advice on such topics as &quot;My celly
snores&quot;, and &quot;I've got this thing for Hillary Clinton,
what should I do?&quot; </p>

<p>And you can imagine the mirth and merriment when I told them
about the Lower East Side Needle Exchange T-Shirt: &quot;You mean
to tell me you gave fifteen dollars CASH to a guy in a T-shirt
saying &quot;Lower East Side Needle Exchange?!!!&quot;, and
&quot;Just what was that 'good cause'?&quot; I had to agree it
was a good joke, even if it was at my expense. But I decided it
was an excellent value. For the humble sum of $15, I had bought a
ticket to the Greatest Show on Earth, a show that would last
several days at least: </p>

<p>Would I get my T-shirt, and if so, when? I thought about
starting an office pool, but nobody wanted to bet me. After all,
they felt sorry that I was already out 15 bucks. And what kind of
odds could I get? And how long is too long? </p>

<p>The T-shirt became a test of stereotypes about drug users.
Everyone assumed this guy must be into heroin and the money would
necessarily disappear. </p>

<p>So the question becomes: </p>

<p>Is it possible for a heroin user to behave responsibly? Can a
junkie carry $15 in cash from Washington to New York and render
perceived value to a faraway stranger known only by a scawled
address on a scrap of paper? Or would he need the money for
something more important? </p>

<p>That night I slept well, but awoke an hour or two early,
thinking about my interest in changing our drug laws. Injuring
people to protect them from themselves... The problem seems to
get bigger the more resources we throw at it... Would
civilization grind to a halt if we let consumers consume what
they want? Would a foreign enemy conquer us? Is the right to
remain silent the only right we have left? Do we have the right
to? Do we have the right not to? What is right? About here God
kicks in. I have had some prayers answered in my day. I'm not
very good at praying, but I've heard God only cares about
sincerity, so I went ahead, and it went something like this: </p>

<p>Dear Lord, If it be thy will, hear my prayer. I'm just a
white-bread white-boy, what don't know nothing about the evils of
heroin. I believe our laws are causing these problems, but now
I'm not so sure. I've been working on this social issue with the
goal of letting half a million people out of jail... a course of
action that would stifle the growth of America's prison industry
that has such high hopes of taking up the slack where the
military is laying off... that would make tens of thousands of
government employees rethink their career plans... </p>

<p>Give me a sign, Lord. Is prohibition a vain attempt to plug
some safety valves you installed in our souls? Can a junkie wrap
up a T-shirt and lick a stamp? I need to know if what I'm doing
is right. Either way it comes out, I promise to submit the facts
to a candid world like it says in the Declaration of
Independence. And if you really want to make it a sign, then
bless the postman's fingers and grant him Godspeed. In Jesus'
name I pr.... </p>

<p>No, that would be cheating. If it be THY will, Lord. Let's
leave Jesus out of this... Well... Jesus, if you WANT to get
involved in this, feel free. Thy will is pretty important too.
And God, if you REALLY want to make it a sign, you can put
crosses on the package or something really over-the-top that I
wouldn't even think of and..... </p>

<p>As my prayer further deteriorated into meandering brain cells
firing in the night, I closed it out and went back to sleep. </p>

<p>In the following days, I thought about the test I had
proposed. The U.S. Postal Service, or U.P.S. or whoever, didn't
break any delivery speed records, and the T-shirt didn't show up
as we were saying Grace before Thanksgiving dinner. But Time-Life
wants 4-6 weeks to send out a CD. Andwhether it shows up or not,
what is proved by a statistical sample of one? </p>

<p>I can't even send a letter to my mother- why should I expect a
nameless junkie on the Lower East Side to send me something that
costs money? A woman at work predicted I would get the T-shirt
&quot;about March. He'll lose the address and find it later.
He'll think that's soon. Those people don't think about time like
we do.&quot; </p>

<p>At the office the joking has died down, but now and again we
find someone who hasn't heard about the Lower East Side Needle
Exchange T-Shirt and it's good for another laugh. Whether I get
the shirt or not, that fifteen dollars is still providing value,
so I suppose it's way up there on the list of the best money I
ever spent. Still, there are a couple of reasons I'm hoping that
guy can get his act together. One is a positive answer to this
momentous question. The other is- I want one of those T-shirts. </p>

<h1>Advice To Little Girls </h1>

<p><b>By Mark Twain, 1865</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Good little girls ought not to make mouths at their teachers
for every trifling offense. This retaliation should only be
resorted to under peculiarly aggravated circumstances. </p>

<p>If you have nothing but a rag-doll stuffed with sawdust, while
one of your more fortunate little playmates has a costly China
one, you should treat her with a show of kindness nevertheless.
And you ought not to attempt to make a forcible swap with her
unless your conscience would justify you in it, and you know you
are able to do it. </p>

<p>You ought never to take your little brother's
&quot;chewing-gum&quot; away from him by main force; it is better
to rope him in with the promise of the first two dollars and a
half you find floating down the river on a grindstone. In the
artless simplicity natural to his time of life, he will regard it
as a perfectly fair transaction. In all ages of the world this
eminently plausible fiction has lured the obtuse infant to
financial ruin and disaster. </p>

<p>If at any time you find it necessary to correct your brother,
do not correct him with mud - never, on any account, throw mud at
him, because it will spoil his clothes. It is better to scald him
a little, for then you obtain desirable results. You secure his
immediate attention to the lessons you are inculcating, and at
the same time your hot water will have a tendency to move
impurities from his person, and possibly the skin, in spots. </p>

<p>If your mother tells you to do a thing, it is wrong to reply
that you won't. It is better and more becoming to intimate that
you will do as she bids you, and then afterward act quietly in
the manner according to the dictates of your best judgment. </p>

<p>You should ever bear in mind that it is to your kind parents
that you are indebted for your food, and your nice bed, and for
your beautiful clothes, and for the privilege of staying home
from school when you let on that you are sick. Therefore you
ought to respect their little prejudices, and humor their little
whims, and put up with their little foibles until they get to
crowding you too much. </p>

<p>Good little girls always show marked deference for the aged.
You ought never to &quot;sass&quot; old people unless they
&quot;sass&quot; you first.</p>

<h1>The Story Of The Bad Little Boy </h1>

<p><b>By Mark Twain, 1875</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once there was a bad little boy whose name was Jim - though,
if you will notice, you will find that bad little boys are nearly
always called James in your Sunday-school books. It was strange,
but still it was true that this one was called Jim. </p>

<p>He didn't have any sick mother either - a sick mother who was
pious and had the consumption, and would be glad to lie down in
the grave and be at rest but for the strong love she bore her
boy, and the anxiety she felt that the world might be harsh and
cold towards him when she was gone. Most bad boys in the
Sunday-books are named James, and have sick mothers, who teach
them to say, &quot;Now, I lay me down,&quot; etc. and sing them
to sleep with sweet, plaintive voices, and then kiss them
good-night, and kneel down by the bedside and weep. But it was
different with this fellow. He was named Jim, and there wasn't
anything the matter with his mother - no consumption, nor
anything of that kind. She was rather stout than otherwise, and
she was not pious; moreover, she was not anxious on Jim's
account. She said if he were to break his neck it wouldn't be
much loss. She always spanked Jim to sleep, and she never kissed
him good-night; on the contrary, she boxed his ears when she was
ready to leave him. </p>

<p>Once this little bad boy stole the key of the pantry, and
slipped in there and helped himself to some jam, and filled up
the vessel with tar, so that his mother would never know the
difference; but all at once a terrible feeling didn't come over
him, and something didn't seem to whisper to him, &quot;Is it
right to disobey my mother? Isn't it sinful to do this? Where do
bad little boys go who gobble up their good kind mother's
jam?&quot; and then he didn't kneel down all alone and promise
never to be wicked any more, and rise up with a light, happy
heart, and go and tell his mother all about it, and beg her
forgiveness, and be blessed by her with tears of pride and
thankfulness in her eyes. No; that is the way with all other bad
boys in the books; but it happened otherwise with this Jim,
strangely enough. He ate that jam, and said it was bully, in his
sinful, vulgar way; and he put in the tar, and said that was
bully also, and laughed, and observed &quot;that the old woman
would get up and snort&quot; when she found it out; and when she
did find it out, he denied knowing anything about it, and she
whipped him severely, and he did the crying himself. Everything
about this boy was curious - everything turned out differently
with him from the way it does to the bad James in the books. </p>

<p>Once he climbed up in Farmer Acorn's apple-tree to steal
apples, and the limb didn't break, and he didn't fall and break
his arm, and get torn by the farmer's great dog, and then
languish on a sick bed for weeks, and repent and become good. Oh!
no; he stole as many apples as he wanted and came down all right;
and he was all ready for the dog too, and knocked him endways
with a brick when he came to tear him. It was very strange -
nothing like it ever happened in those mild little books with
marbled backs, and with pictures in them of men with
swallow-tailed coats and bell-crowned hats, and pantaloons that
are short in the legs, and women with the waists of their dresses
under their arms, and no hoops on. Nothing like it in any of the
Sunday-school books. </p>

<p>Once he stole the teacher's pen-knife, and, when he was afraid
it would be found out and he would get whipped, he slipped it
into George Wilson's cap - poor Widow Wilson's son, the moral
boy, the good little boy of the village, who always obeyed his
mother, and never told an untruth, and was fond of his lessons,
and infatuated with Sunday-school. And when the knife dropped
from the cap, and poor George hung his head and blushed, as if in
conscious guilt, and the grieved teacher charged the theft upon
him, and was just in the very act of bringing the switch down
upon his trembling shoulders, a white-haired improbable justice
of the peace did not suddenly appear in their midst, and strike
an attitude and say, &quot;Spare this noble boy - there stands
the cowering culprit! I was passing the school-door at recess,
and unseen myself, I saw the theft committed!&quot; And then Jim
didn't get whaled, and the venerable justice didn't read the
tearful school a homily and take George by the hand and say such
a boy deserved to be exalted, and then tell him to come and make
his home with him, and sweep out the office, and make fires, and
run errands, and chop wood, and study law, and help his wife to
do household labors, and have all the balance of the time to
play, and get forty cents a month, and be happy. No; it would
have happened that way in the books, but it didn't happen that
way to Jim. No meddling old clam of a justice dropped in to make
trouble, and so the model boy George got thrashed, and Jim was
glad of it because, you know, Jim hated moral boys. Jim said he
was &quot;down on them milk-sops.&quot; Such was the coarse
language of this bad, neglected boy. </p>

<p>But the strangest thing that ever happened to Jim was the time
he went boating on Sunday, and didn't get drowned, and that other
time that he got caught out in the storm when he was fishing on
Sunday, and didn't get struck by lighting. Why, you might look,
and look, all through the Sunday-school books from now till next
Christmas, and you would never come across anything like this. Oh
no; you would find that all the bad boys who go boating on Sunday
invariably get drowned; and all the bad boys who get caught out
in storms when they are fishing on Sunday infallibly get struck
by lightning. Boats with bad boys in them always upset on Sunday,
and it always storms when bad boys go fishing on the Sabbath. How
this Jim ever escaped is a mystery to me. </p>

<p>This Jim bore a charmed life - that must have been the way of
it. Nothing could hurt him. He even gave the elephant in the
menagerie a plug of tobacco, and the elephant didn't knock the
top of his head off with his trunk. He browsed around the
cupboard after essence of peppermint, and didn't make a mistake
and drink aqua fortis. He stole his father's gun and went hunting
on the Sabbath, and didn't shoot three or four of his fingers
off. He struck his little sister on the temple with his fist when
he was angry, and she didn't linger in pain through long summer
days, and die with sweet words of forgiveness upon her lips that
redoubled the anguish of his breaking heart. No; she got over it.
He ran off and went to sea at last, and didn't come back and find
himself sad and alone in the world, his loved ones sleeping in
the quiet churchyard, and the vine-embowered home of his boyhood
tumbled down and gone to decay. Ah! no; he came home as drunk as
a piper, and got into the station-house the first thing. </p>

<p>And he grew up and married, and raised a large family, and
brained them all with an axe one night, and got wealthy by all
manner of cheating and rascality; and now he is the infernalist
wickedest scoundrel in his native village, and is universally
respected, and belongs to the Legislature. </p>

<p>So you see there never was a bad James in the Sunday-school
books that had such a streak of luck as this sinful Jim with the
charmed life.<br>
<br>

<p>The Story Of The Good Little Boy </p>

<p><b>By Mark Twain, 1875</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Once there was a good little boy by the name of Jacob Blivens.
He always obeyed his parents, no matter how absurd and
unreasonable their demands were; and he always learned his book,
and never was late at Sabbath-school. He would not play hookey,
even when his sober judgment told him it was the most profitable
thing he could do. None of the other boys could ever make that
boy out, he acted so strangely. He wouldn't lie, no matter how
convenient it was. He just said it was wrong to lie, and that was
sufficient for him. And he was so honest that he was simply
ridiculous. The curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassed
everything. He wouldn't play marbles on Sunday, he wouldn't rob
birds' nests, he wouldn't give hot pennies to organ-grinders'
monkeys; he didn't seem to take any interest in any kind of
rational amusement. So the other boys used to try to reason it
out and come to an understanding of him, but they couldn't arrive
at any satisfactory conclusion. As I said before, they could only
figure out a sort of vague idea that he was
&quot;afflicted,&quot; and so they took him under their
protection, and never allowed any harm to come to him. </p>

<p>This good little boy read all the Sunday-school books; they
were his greatest delight. This was the whole secret of it. He
believed in the good little boys they put in the Sunday-school
books; he had every confidence in them. He longed to come across
one of them alive, once; but he never did. They all died before
his time, maybe. Whenever he read about a particularly good one
he turned over quickly to the end to see what became of him,
because he wanted to travel thousands of miles and gaze on him;
but it wasn't any use; that good little boy always died in the
last chapter, and there was a picture of the funeral, with all
his relatives and the Sunday-school children standing around the
grave in pantaloons that were too short, and bonnets that were
too large, and everybody crying into handkerchiefs that had as
much as a yard and a half of stuff in them. He was always headed
off in this way. He never could see one of those good little boys
on account of his always dying in the last chapter. </p>

<p>Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday-school book.
He wanted to be put in, with pictures representing him gloriously
declining to lie to his mother, and her weeping for joy about it;
and pictures representing him standing on the doorstep giving a
penny to a poor beggar-woman with six children, and telling her
to spend it freely, but not to be extravagant, because
extravagance is a sin; and pictures of him magnanimously refusing
to tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for him around the
corner as he came from school, and welted him over the head with
a lath, and then chased him home, saying, &quot;Hi! hi!&quot; as
he proceeded. This was the ambition of young Jacob Blivens. He
wished to be put in a Sunday-school book. It made him feel a
little uncomfortable sometimes when he reflected that the good
little boys always died. He loved to live, you know, and this was
the most unpleasant feature about being a Sunday-school-book boy.
He knew it was not healthy to be good. He knew it was more fatal
than consumption to be so supernaturally good as the boys in the
books were; he knew that none of them had been able to stand it
long, and it pained him to think that if they put him in a book
he wouldn't ever see it, or even if they did get the book out
before he died it wouldn't be popular without any picture of his
funeral in the back part of it. It couldn't be much of a
Sunday-school book that couldn't tell about the advice he gave to
the community when he was dying. So at last, of course, he had to
make up his mind to do the best he could under the circumstances
- to live right, and hang on as long as he could, and have his
dying speech all ready when his time came. </p>

<p>But somehow nothing ever went right with this good little boy;
nothing ever turned out with him the way it turned out with the
good little boys in the books. They always had a good time, and
the bad boys had the broken legs; but in his case there was a
screw loose somewhere; and it all happened just the other way.
When he found Jim Blake stealing apples, and went under the tree
to read to him about the bad little boy who fell out of a
neighbor's apple-tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out of the tree
too, but he fell on him, and broke his arm, and Jim wasn't hurt
at all. Jacob couldn't understand that. There wasn't anything in
the books like it. </p>

<p>And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in the
mud, and Jacob ran to help him up and receive his blessing, the
blind man did not give him any blessing at all, but whacked him
over the head with his stick and said he would like to catch him
shoving him again, and then pretending to help him up. This was
not in accordance with any of the books. Jacob looked them all
over to see. </p>

<p>One thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog that
hadn't any place to stay, and was hungry and persecuted, and
bring him home and pet him and have that dog's imperishable
gratitude. And at last he found one and was happy; and he brought
him home and fed him, but when he was going to pet him the dog
flew at him and tore all the clothes off him except those that
were in front, and made a spectacle of him that was astonishing.
He examined authorities, but he could not understand the matter.
It was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books, but it
acted very differently. Whatever this boy did he got into
trouble. The very things the boys in the books got rewarded for
turned out to be about the most unprofitable things he could
invest in. </p>

<p>Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some bad
boys starting off pleasuring in a sailboat. He was filled with
consternation, because he knew from his reading that boys who
went sailing on Sunday invariably got drowned. So he ran out on a
raft to warn them, but a log turned with him and slid him into
the river. A man got him out pretty soon, and the doctor pumped
the water out of him, and gave him a fresh start with his
bellows, but he caught cold and lay sick a-bed nine weeks. But
the most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys in
the boat had a good time all day, and then reached home alive and
well in the most surprising manner. Jacob Blivens said there was
nothing like these things in the books. He was perfectly
dumb-founded. </p>

<p>When he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolved
to keep on trying anyhow. He knew that so far his experience
wouldn't do to go in a book, but he hadn't yet reached the
allotted term of life for good little boys, and he hoped to be
able to make a record yet if he could hold on till his time was
fully up. If everything else failed he had his dying speech to
fall back on. </p>

<p>He examined his authorities, and found that it was now time
for him to go to sea as a cabin-boy. He called on a ship captain
and made his application, and when the captain asked for his
recommendations he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to the
words. &quot;To Jacob Blivens, from his affectionate
teacher.&quot; But the captain was a coarse, vulgar man, and he
said, &quot;Oh, that be blowed! that wasn't any proof that he
know how to wash dishes or handle a slush-bucket, and he guessed
he didn't want him.&quot; This was altogether the most
extraordinary thing that ever happened to Jacob in all his life.
A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had never failed to move
the tenderest emotions of ship captains, and open the way to all
offices of honor and profit in their gift - it never had in any
book that ever he had read. He could hardly believe his senses. </p>

<p>This boy always had a hard time of it. Nothing over came out
according to the authorities with him. At last, one day, when he
was around hunting up bad little boys to admonish, he found a lot
of them in the old iron foundry fixing up a little joke on
fourteen or fifteen dogs, which they had tied together in long
procession, and were going to ornament with empty nitro-glycerine
cans made fast to their tails. Jacob's heart was touched. He sat
down on one of those cans (for he never minded grease when duty
was before him), and he took hold of the foremost dog by the
collar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones. But
just at that moment Alderman McWelter full of wrath, stepped in.
All the bad boys ran away, but Jacob Blivens rose in conscious
innocence and began one of those stately little
Sunday-school-book speeches which always commence with &quot;Oh,
sir!&quot; in dead opposition to the fact that no boy, good or
bad, ever starts a remark with &quot;Oh, sir.&quot; But the
alderman never waited to hear the rest. He took Jacob Blivens by
the ear and turned him around, and hit him a whack in the rear
with the flat of his hand; and in an instant that good little boy
shot out through the roof and soared away towards the sun, with
the fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after him like the
tail of a kite. And there wasn't a sign of that alderman or that
old iron foundry left on the face of the earth; and, as for young
Jacob Blivens, he never got a chance to make his last dying
speech after all his trouble fixing it up, unless he made it to
the birds; because, although the bulk of him came down all right
in a tree-top in an adjoining county, the rest of him was
apportioned around among four townships, and so they had to hold
five inquests on him to find out whether he was dead or not, and
how it occurred. You never saw a boy scattered so. ^* </p>

<p>[Footnote *: This glycerine catastrophe is borrowed from a
floating newspaper item, whose author's name I would give if I
knew it. - [M.T.]] </p>

<p>Thus perished the good little boy who did the best he could,
but didn't come out according to the books. Every boy who ever
did as he did prospered except him. His case is truly remarkable.
It will probably never be accounted for.<br>

<h1>The Danger Of Lying In Bed </h1>

<p><b>By Mark Twain</b> </p>

<p><b>1871</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>The man in the ticket-office said: </p>

<p>&quot;Have an accident insurance ticket, also?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I said, after studying the matter over a
little. &quot;No, I believe not; I am going to be travelling by
rail all day to-day. However, to-morrow I don't travel. Give me
one for to-morrow.&quot; </p>

<p>The man looked puzzled. He said: </p>

<p>&quot;But it is for accident insurance, and if you are going
to travel by rail - &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If I am going to travel by rail I sha'n't need it. Lying
at home in bed is the thing I am afraid of.&quot; </p>

<p>I had been looking into this matter. Last year I traveled
twenty thousand miles, almost entirely by rail; the year before,
I traveled over twenty-five thousand miles, half by sea and half
by rail; and the year before that I traveled in the neighborhood
of ten thousand miles, exclusively by rail. I suppose if I put in
all the little odd journeys here and there, I may say I have
traveled sixty thousand miles during the three years I have
mentioned. And never an accident. </p>

<p>For a good while I said to myself every morning: &quot;Now I
have escaped thus far, and so the chances are just that much
increased that I shall catch it this time. I will be shrewd, and
buy an accident ticket.&quot; And to a dead moral certainty I
drew a blank, and went to bed that night without a joint started
or a bone splintered. I got tired of that sort of daily bother,
and fell to buying accident tickets that were good for a month. I
said to myself, &quot;A man can't buy thirty blanks in one
bundle.&quot; </p>

<p>But I was mistaken. There was never a prize in the lot. I
could read of railway accidents every day - the newspaper
atmosphere was foggy with them; but somehow they never came my
way. I found I had spent a good deal of money in the accident
business, and had nothing to show for it. My suspicions were
aroused, and I began to hunt around for somebody that had won in
this lottery. I found plenty of people who had invested, but not
an individual that had ever had an accident or made a cent. I
stopped buying accident tickets and went to ciphering. The result
was astounding. The peril lay not in traveling, but in staying at
home. </p>

<p>I hunted up statistics, and was amazed to find that after all
the glaring newspaper headings concerning railroad disasters,
less than three hundred people had really lost their lives by
those disasters in the preceding twelve months. The Erie road was
set down as the most murderous in the list. It had killed
forty-six - or twenty-six, I do not exactly remember which, but I
know the number was double that of any other road. But the fact
straightway suggested itself that the Erie was an immensely long
road, and did more business than any other line in the country;
so the double number of killed ceased to be matter for surprise. </p>

<p>By further figuring, it appeared that between New York and
Rochester the Erie ran eight passenger-trains each way every day
- 16 altogether; and carried a daily average of 6,000 persons.
That is about a million in six months - the population of New
York City. Well, the Erie kills from 13 to 23 persons out of its
million in six months; and in the same time 13,000 of New York's
million die in their beds! My flesh crept, my hair stood on end.
&quot;This is appalling!&quot; I said. &quot;The danger isn't in
traveling by rail, but in trusting to those deadly beds. I will
never sleep in a bed again.&quot; </p>

<p>I had figured on considerably less than one-half the length of
the Erie road. It was plain that the entire road must transport
at least eleven or twelve thousand people every day. There are
many short roads running out of Boston that do fully half as
much; a great many such roads. There are many roads scattered
about the Union that do a prodigious passenger business.
Therefore it was fair to presume that an average of 2,500
passengers a day for each road in the country would be about
correct. There are 846 railway lines in our country, and 846
times 2,500 are 2,115,000. So the railways of America move more
than two millions of people every day; six hundred and fifty
millions of people a year, without counting the Sundays. They do
that, too - there is no question about it; though where they get
the raw material is clear beyond the jurisdiction of my
arithmetic; for I have hunted the census through and through, and
I find that there are not that many people in the United States,
by a matter of six hundred and ten millions at the very least.
They must use some of the same people over again, likely. </p>

<p>San Francisco is one-eighth as populous as New York; there are
60 deaths a week in the former and 500 a week in the latter - if
they have luck. That is 3,120 deaths a year in San Francisco, and
eight times as many in New York - say about 25,000 or 26,000. The
health of the two places is the same. So we will let it stand as
a fair presumption that this will hold good all over the country,
and that consequently 25,000 out of every million of people we
have must die every year. That amounts to one-fortieth of our
total population. One million of us, then, die annually. Out of
this million ten or twelve thousand are stabbed, shot, drowned,
hanged, poisoned, or meet a similarly violent death in some other
popular way, such as perishing by kerosene-lamp and hoop-skirt
conflagrations, getting buried in coal-mines, falling off
house-tops, breaking through church or lecture-room floors,
taking patent medicines, or committing suicide in other forms.
The Erie railroad kills from 23 to 46; the other 845 railroads
kill an average of one-third of a man each; and the rest of that
million, amounting in the aggregate to the appalling figure of
987,631 corpses, die naturally in their beds! </p>

<p>You will excuse me from taking any more chances on those beds.
The railroads are good enough for me. </p>

<p>And my advice to all people is, Don't stay at home any more
than you can help; but when you have got to stay at home a while,
buy a package of those insurance tickets and sit up nights. You
cannot be too cautious. </p>

<p>[One can see now why I answered that ticket-agent in the
manner recorded at the top of this sketch.] </p>

<p>The moral of this composition is, that thoughtless people
grumble more than is fair about railroad management in the United
States. When we consider that every day and night of the year
full fourteen thousand railway-trains of various kinds, freighted
with life and armed with death, go thundering over the land, the
marvel is, not that they kill three hundred human beings in a
twelvemonth, but that they do not kill three hundred times three
hundred!<br>

<h1>Accident Insurance - Etc. </h1>

<p> <b>By Mark Twain</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> <b>Delivered In Hartford, At A Dinner To Cornelius Walford,
Of London, 1875</b> </p>

<p> Gentlemen, - I am glad, indeed, to assist in welcoming the
distinguished guest of this occasion to a city whose fame as an
insurance centre has extended to all lands, and given us the name
of being a quadruple band of brothers working sweetly hand in
hand - the Colt's arms company making the destruction of our race
easy and convenient, our life-insurance citizens paying for the
victims when they pass away, Mr. Batterson perpetuating their
memory with his stately monuments, and our fire-insurance
comrades taking care of their hereafter. I am glad to assist in
welcoming our guest - first, because he is an Englishman, and I
owe a heavy debt of hospitality to certain of his
fellow-countrymen; and secondly, because he is in sympathy with
insurance, and has been the means of making many other men cast
their sympathies in the same direction. </p>

<p> Certainly there is no nobler field for human effort than the
insurance line of business - especially accident insurance. Ever
since I have been a director in an accident-insurance company I
have felt that I am a better man. Life has seemed more precious.
Accidents have assumed a kindlier aspect. Distressing special
providences have lost half their horror. I look upon a cripple
now with affectionate interest - as an advertisement. I do not
seem to care for poetry any more. I do not care for politics even
agriculture does not excite me. But to me now there is a charm
about a railway collision that is unspeakable. </p>

<p> There is nothing more beneficent than accident insurance. I
have seen an entire family lifted out of poverty and into
affluence by the simple boon of a broken leg. I have had people
come to me on crutches, with tears in their eyes, to bless this
beneficent institution. In all my experience of life, I have seen
nothing so seraphic as the look that comes into a freshly
mutilated man's face when he feels in his vest pocket with his
remaining hand and finds his accident ticket all right. And I
have seen nothing so sad as the look that came into another
splintered customer's face when he found he couldn't collect on a
wooden leg. </p>

<p> I will remark here, by way of advertisement, that that noble
charity which we have named the Hartford Accident Insurance
Company is an institution which is peculiarly to be depended
upon. A man is bound to prosper who gives it his custom. No man
can take out a policy in it and not get crippled before the year
is out. Now there was one indigent man who had been disappointed
so often with other companies that he had grown disheartened, his
appetite left him, he ceased to smile - said life was but a
weariness. Three weeks ago I got him to insure with us, and now
he is the brightest, happiest spirit in this land - has a good
steady income and a stylish suit of new bandages every day, and
travels around on a shutter. </p>

<p> I will say, in conclusion, that my share of the welcome to
our guest is none the less hearty because I talk so much
nonsense, and I know that I can say the same for the rest of the
speakers. <br>

<h1>RICHARDSON-TAYLOR REUNION NEWS</h1>

<hr>

<p><b><i>March 10, 1990</i></b> </p>

<p>The response to the last edition of the Reunion News was most
gratifying and, in some cases, frightening. I heard from quite a
few known and suspected members of the family, and picked up
quite a few addresses of people who probably did not want to be
found. Thanks to all of those who did reply, but it is still
apparent that we haven't tracked down all of the nefarious family
members so let's keep up the effort to track down, and thoroughly
embarrass all those family members who are trying to hide. </p>

<p>Bud called me one day to say that Laurence had called him to
suggest that we include with the Reunion News a brief update on
where everybody is and what they are doing. He staunchly
maintains that both he and Laurence were sober at the time. </p>

<p>He suggested that everyone should send in a short note on
their current doings and significant events and a dollar or so to
defray the expenses of producing and mailing the newsletter.
Monetary contributions to support this effort would be nice (all
blank checks eagerly accepted) but no one will be denied the
benefit(?) of this newsletter just because they failed to ante
up. </p>

<p>If you will drop me a line (as many have already) and let me
know of significant events in your life in the last year or so, I
will include them with the periodic reunion information so
everyone can know how your life is going to Hell in a handbasket.
</p>

<p>I have attached a form at the end of this letter which you can
fill out and return, if you wish, to help me keep all of the
information accurate. </p>

<p>All information on the forms is voluntary and I will not print
or give out anyone's address or any other information without
their permission. </p>

<p>Anyone who fails to report will, of course, have only the most
slanderous rumors printed about them. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Clifford A. Schaffer </p>

<p><b>REUNION DETAILS</b> </p>

<p><b>DATE:</b> <b>June 23 and 24, 1990</b> </p>

<p><b>PLACE: Howarth Park - Summerfield Rd., Santa Rosa, CA</b>. </p>

<p>The park is located on the east side of town, and a map is
enclosed. There is hiking, fishing, swimming, a small park, and
an amusement park close by. There are also paddle boats at both
lakes. </p>

<p>On the back of one of the sheets she sent me, in an almost
illegible scrawl, Ruthie wrote, &quot;It is also close to a lot
of wineries.&quot; I'll bet it is. </p>

<p><b>FOOD </b></p>

<p>There will be snacks, dips, lots of other food, and plenty of
raw meat, roots, and berries for the Morrises. Dinner will be
early, at 3:30 or 4:00 on Saturday because of the previous bad
experiences when we tried to feed the Leards and Morrises after
dark. Whatever food is left after the first attack of the Leards
and Morrises will be placed on the edge of the camp all day
Sunday to draw them away from the rest of us. </p>

<p>People who live in the area should bring salad, beans, and
other such items. People who live farther away should bring
chips, dips, and dessert. Dinnerware will be provided, but bring
drinks and charcoal for your family. </p>

<p><b>CAMPGROUNDS</b> </p>

<p>There are campgrounds in Spring Lake Park. A copy of a
campsite reservation form is enclosed. Please make arrangements
early before the authorities get wind of what is going on. </p>

<p>There is also a KOA campground nearby with all of the usual
KOA stuff. The address is: </p>

<p>San Francisco North/Petaluma KOA </p>

<p>20 Rainsville Road </p>

<p>Petaluma, CA 94952 </p>

<p>(707) 763-1492 </p>

<p>(800) 992-CAMP (Calif. Reservations Only) </p>

<p><b>MOTELS</b> </p>

<p>For those who are used to sleeping indoors, there are several
motels located within about three miles of the park. Three of
them are listed below. Ruthie recommends that everyone make their
own motel reservations as the best method of coping with the
chaos of the reunion. </p>

<p><b>FINANCES</b> </p>

<p>The contribution for this year's reunion is $8.00 for each
family - a family being defined as the members of a single
household. </p>

<p>The cost to attend this reunion is fairly small but Ruthie
wanted me to mention that we want everyone to attend and money
should not be a consideration. If anyone would like to attend,
but has a problem with funds, please contact Ruth or Laurence and
money will be provided (probably out of the leftovers of the
Taylor family bail fund). Any requests for assistance will be
kept entirely confidential. You may stay home because you are
scared or embarrassed, but don't stay home just because you're
broke. </p>

<p><b>FAMILY DOINGS </b></p>

<p>WHO THE HELL ARE THESE PEOPLE? </p>

<p>ARE THEY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM ME? </p>

<p>WHEN WILL THEY BE PAROLED? </p>

<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b> </p>

<p>I am pleased to report that the vast majority of people in the
family are apparently healthy, active, and doing well. We do not
yet have any relatives who are rich enough that we can all go
mooch off of them, but nobody seems to be starving either. </p>

<p><b>PASSINGS</b> </p>

<p>For all of those who were not aware, Mary Taylor died last
year. She and my grandmother, Laura Richardson, are the reasons
that we gather every year. She will be missed by all of us, but
we should all feel very lucky that we have had these women in our
lives. </p>

<p><b>THE FAMILY</b> </p>

<p>ALLSMAN, DOROTHY </p>

<p>(nee Richardson) - Currently selling real estate in Phoenix,
Arizona. The last time I spoke with her she made a point of
mentioning how much she enjoys meeting all of the nice people in
this family every year at the reunion. Her doctor tells me that
radical personality changes are common in persons of extreme age.
Ed has had some health problems which may limit their ability to
travel. </p>

<p>ALLSMAN, PAT </p>

<p>Pat is living in Phoenix, doing well, and he has developed
into a good judge of appropriate Christmas gifts. </p>

<p>ATKINSON, CHRISTINE </p>

<p>(nee Sweet), eldest of Margaret and Vic, is in Chicago,
working for First Boston Corp. doing something with computers.
She didn't mention anything specific about the opportunities for
embezzlement at her current position, but we know she will be
alert. She tells a fairly wild, and almost believable, story
about how her husband Scott travels a lot because of his
highfalutin position with something called Terra Museum. She
swears that it is not a front for drug smuggling. </p>

<p>BECK, META </p>

<p>Bud says she is doing well but he did not provide a lot of
details. He is probably covering up. </p>

<p>BERZ, RONNI </p>

<p>Meta's second. Currently living in Bakersfield and prospering
nicely with her husband, George, who works with computers. </p>

<p>HARTER, BARRI </p>

<p>No information. May be the same Barri Harter rumored to be
involved with Donald Trump. </p>

<p>JOHNSON, GLENDA </p>

<p>No current address. No information. May have been lost in
Borneo while filming the headhunters. </p>

<p>KRAMER, JOANNE </p>

<p>(nee Morris) - Joanne is living in Fresno and sends obscene
horoscopes to all those who write to her. She still labors under
the delusion that I am really Satan. </p>

<p>KRAMER, LARRY </p>

<p>son of Joanne, no relationship to the Japanese monster film
&quot;Son of Joanne.&quot; According to Joanne, he is living
with, and mooching off his mother in the finest Morris tradition.
</p>

<p>KRAMER, LESLIE MAUREEN </p>

<p>Daughter of Joanne, living in Cleveland and working as an
exotic dancer. (Yes, that's right.) She is the proud mother of
Crystal Ladd who, according to the sworn testimony of Joanne, is
an extraordinarily beautiful and talented child. </p>

<p>LEARD, DAVID </p>

<p>His years in the Navy permanently damaged his ability to tell
when it is too wet outside. He is currently living in the rain
forests of Seattle and doing something with computer systems. It
didn't surprise anyone that one of the Leards would eventually
return to the Bigfoot territory from whence they came. His wife
is pretty, intelligent, and very nice. He must have lied
tremendously to get her. </p>

<p>LEARD, DOUGLAS </p>

<p>Somehow the Richardson-Taylor arson gene went wrong in
Douglas. He puts out fires for a living, instead of starting
them, and apparently enjoys it. He and Barbara, and kids, live in
Rancho and, last time I checked, they were all doing well and
enjoying life. </p>

<p>LEARD, LOUISE </p>

<p>Louise is still living in the same old place in Sacramento
that she bought when houses were still $1.49. She is in good
health, reasonably good humor, and still unreasonably
conservative. She still says &quot;Well, now Michael . . .&quot;,
all the time, even when Michael is not around. </p>

<p>LEARD, MICHAEL </p>

<p>Michael just keeps on trucking. He is an air conditioning
expert at McClellan in Sacramento. He recently visited us in Los
Angeles and found that he actually could cope with the freeways
down here (but he still split as soon as he could anyway). He is
in good health but needs more practice with his .22 pistol. </p>

<p>LINK, BARBARA </p>

<p>(nee Sweet) - Barbara is married to Dan Link, a pastor with a
devotion to hopeless causes such as truth and morality. They
moved to Ruidoso, New Mexico, presumably to escape the shame and
guilt which follows excessively moral people in this family. The
name Ruidoso is Spanish for &quot;noisy&quot; which, Barbara
claims, has only a coincidental relationship to Dan's sermons. </p>

<p>MORRIS, ELEANOR </p>

<p>and Don - No current word from them, although I thought I
recognized Don playing Digit in &quot;Gorillas in the Mist.&quot;
Way to go with that second career, Fellah. </p>

<p>MORRIS, RICHARD </p>

<p>No current word on his activities. What can you say about a
Morris that hasn't already been grunted by someone else? I heard
that he was running a dress shop for transvestites and all I can
say is that Richard never denied it. </p>

<p>MORRIS, STEVEN </p>

<p>He is single (relatively speaking), working at DMV, and still
trying to impregnate every female in the city of Sacramento now
that the State has given up its effort to restrict his breeding.
Remember the family motto, Steve - <i>Never give your right name</i>.
</p>

<p>NEWCOMB, RUTH </p>

<p>(nee Taylor) - She is doing well and sends her love to
everyone. She mentioned that she is getting married very soon
(says she doesn't have to) and recommends bear traps and doe
scent as the perfect combination for nailing a man. She didn't
give his name but sent a nice picture of him bound and gagged in
the trunk of her car. Congrats, Ruthie. </p>

<p>PEREIRA, CARRIE </p>

<p>She recently had a baby, prompting Bud to lie far more than he
usually does. </p>

<p>PORTER, MICHAEL ANDREW </p>

<p>(Andy) son of Joanne Kramer - Currently living in Fullerton,
CA and doing well in sales. </p>

<p>PRUITT, BOB </p>

<p>No information. Could be the same Bob Pruitt responsible for
the Exxon Valdez disaster. </p>

<p>QUIGLEY, DONNA </p>

<p>(nee Morris) - Donna reportedly lives next door to Margie and
they are known as the Unholy Two in their neighborhood. A recent
effort by the City Council to evict them failed when the
authorities were unable to prove a connection to the rest of the
Morris family. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, BILL </p>

<p>Bill and Dawn currently live in Ohio for no apparent reason,
and Bill is now working as a cost analyst after many, many years
with the U.S. Air Force. (You know - the people who brought us
the Stealth Bomber.) He gets Air Force retirement money and
probably makes a pretty good bundle at his current job, so he is
probably a good person to borrow money from. Dawn has, by all
accounts, consistently sullied the family reputation with a long
string of church work, good deeds, and other socially acceptable
do-gooder behavior which is totally alien to this family's
character. Mark, their eldest, is either on the high school
football team, or he is the high school football team, - it
wasn't clear from their letter. I saw a picture of Craig. He has
to be healthy. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, BUD </p>

<p>He is in better health than he has a right to be, and claims
he is going to live forever. He called me just days after the
birth of his latest great grandkid and he had already concocted
the most astonishing stories about this child. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, BECKY </p>

<p>Eldest of James and Edna. No information. She may be living
with a motorcycle gang responsible for several holdups in the
Central Valley. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, JAMIE </p>

<p>Youngest of James and Edna. No information. Carried away by
Gypsies many years ago to the remotest reaches of Fresno County. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, JAMES </p>

<p>Currently retired and residing in Fresno with Edna who, for
some strange reason, is a perfect match for James. His &quot;Old
Fart&quot; hat wore out so he is getting one that says
&quot;Older Fart.&quot; Unlike fine wines, the aroma of farts is
not greatly improved by aging. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, JERRY </p>

<p>No information direct from Jerry but Bud tells me that he is
doing well. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, LARRY </p>

<p>Bud tells the same story about Larry, further straining his
credibility. </p>

<p>RICHARDSON, PETE </p>

<p>Pete has not yet learned that exercise is bad for the health
so he continues to run every day. Despite all this running, to
the best of my knowledge, he has never caught anything more
significant than the common cold. He continues to compete and win
races in the Old and Decrepit category. </p>

<p>SCHAFFER, CLIFFORD </p>

<p>I am currently working as a computer systems consultant, write
a few articles now and then and, lately, am doing some public
speaking for the ACLU. Bonnie is a computer systems manager with
Pinkerton Detectives. </p>

<p>Serena and Alyssa are 15 and in high school. Serena is in
Flags with the marching band and Alyssa earned a letter last year
on the swim team. Melissa, 12, and Courtney, 10 are both doing
well. </p>

<p>SCHULKINS, JOYCE </p>

<p>No information. Rumored to be on an expedition to find
dinosaurs in Africa. </p>

<p>SCHULKINS, LARRY </p>

<p>No information. May be the same Larry Schulkins who is
currently a hostage in Beirut. </p>

<p>SWEET, JULIE </p>

<p>Julie is currently working at the Los Angeles Zoo, as an
animal keeper and trainer and thus would probably be the best
skilled person to manage the reunion. </p>

<p>SWEET, MARGARET </p>

<p>(nee Richardson) - Margaret sent out a letter with some
outrageous tale about how she and Vic are supposedly not old
enough to qualify for Social Security or something like that so
she is continuing to work. Margaret's letter starts out
&quot;Dear Friends and Relatives&quot;, which shows that she
draws a clear distinction between the two. Vic is working in a
funeral parlor so he should have a lot of creepy stories to tell
around the campfire. </p>

<p>TAYLOR, DAVID </p>

<p>No information or parole date. </p>

<p>TAYLOR, EDITH </p>

<p>No information. Probably on the run from the law. </p>

<p>TAYLOR, LAURENCE and WILMA </p>

<p>Laurence was caught telling the truth last year and had to
spend several weeks in therapy before he was well again. When you
talk to him you will see that he is much better now. </p>

<p>TAYLOR, LOUISE </p>

<p>No information. Possible KGB double agent. </p>

<h1>RICHARDSON-TAYLOR REUNION NEWS</h1>

<p><b>SPECIAL UPDATE</b> </p>

<p><b>May 12, 1990</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Ruthie wrote me with a few updates to the prior information. </p>

<p>She says they were unable to get the park for Saturday
(something about too much police surveillance) so Saturday will
be at Spring Lake. </p>

<p>She is going to try to get &quot;the spot on your left just as
you come off the hill into the park area.&quot; Ruthie said that
if anyone has trouble finding the group she would leave a trail
of bread crumbs but, of course, that only works until the first
Morris shows up. If in doubt, look for the clouds of tear gas and
flashing police lights - the family will be in the middle. </p>

<p>Hot dogs and hamburgers will be served around noon, with the
big meal around 4:00 PM. Remember that, if you are approached by
any family member you do not immediately recognize, throw some
food away from your car. Do not attempt to feed them by hand. </p>

<p>Sunday will be at Howarth Park as previously stated. </p>

<p>She says to be sure to remember to bring all of the following
items: </p>

<p>bathing suits (to avoid the perennial lewd conduct charges) </p>

<p>lots of ice (to take the swelling down) </p>

<p>extra ice chests (storage space is always a problem) </p>

<p>snacks (in sealed packets so the Leards can't smell them) </p>

<p>charcoal (fire helps to keep the Morrises at bay) </p>

<p>drinks </p>

<p>Doug and Barbara should bring their game. Ruthie said that
everyone really enjoyed it as long as they were sober. </p>

<p>Ruthie says there are paddle boats, hiking trails (remember to
bring shoes), and a nice area for volleyball. </p>

<p>Ruthie also asked me to remind everyone that it is time to
send your contributions. The contribution is $8.00 per household
(cheaper than the average parking ticket) and should be sent to: </p>

<p>Ruth Newcomb </p>

<p>I still have not heard from all of the nefarious family
members with their most current family information. I would like
to publish a fairly complete update of the family information to
distribute at or near the reunion, so it would be nice if you
would all send it in. If you do not, I will do the most dastardly
thing possible - I will tell the truth about you. I am sure no
one wants that. </p>

<h1>RICHARDSON-TAYLOR REUNION NEWS</h1>

<hr>

<p>July 30, 1990 </p>

<p>Well, another reunion has come and gone and we can all breathe
a sigh of relief that we don't have to see <u>those</u> people
again for another year. It was a pretty good turnout with perhaps
a hundred people (anybody want to count?). As usual, everybody
got older but me. </p>

<p>We all owe thanks to Ruthie and Laurence for organizing
everything the way they did. The maps they sent me weren't the
greatest so, for all of you who thought Spring Lake park was
really in East Africa, I apologize for that. However, the parks
and all the fun and trimmings when we finally got there were very
good so I have to say that I thought they organized a pretty
successful reunion. You can always tell a successful reunion -
you can't recognize anyone. I hear that Margaret and Vic spent
most of Saturday morning with a nice family of Mexicans before
they realized it wasn't us. </p>

<p>I want to thank all of you who stepped forward to express your
appreciation for the work I did on the newsletter. I especially
want to thank all those who pulled Joanne off of me while she was
expressing her appreciation. My doctor says it was lucky I moved
when I did and there probably won't be any permanent scarring. </p>

<p>I understand that Margaret and Vic have volunteered to
organize next year's reunion, perhaps around the Carpenteria
area. I think they like that area primarily because it makes
people say &quot;Where?&quot;. It is around Santa Barbara - north
of L.A. It is a lovely oil-rich area with beautiful beaches which
have natural tar balls in the sand for your kids to track back to
your car. I am sure everyone will like it - just bring a few jars
of petroleum solvents. Assuming that Margaret still admits that
we are blood-related, I will keep you posted. </p>

<p>People who are easily offended should probably skip the Family
Doings section on Don Morris. I have made a considerable effort
to clean it up but it's hard to write anything about him and keep
it decent. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Clifford A. Schaffer </p>

<p>Copyright 1990, C. A. Schaffer </p>

<p><b>FAMILY DOINGS </b></p>

<p>WHO THE HELL ARE THESE PEOPLE? </p>

<p>ARE THEY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM ME? </p>

<p>WHEN WILL THEY BE PAROLED? </p>

<p><b><u>INTRODUCTION</u></b> </p>

<p>This is the post-reunion dirt on everyone (that I am aware of)
who either showed up or sent back their forms. It is not the
complete family listing, if there ever could be one. I will do
another relatively complete update next year before the reunion. </p>

<p><b><u>PASSINGS</u></b> </p>

<p>Mary Taylor </p>

<p>Bob Taylor - son of Mary, one of the original old-time Taylors
</p>

<p>Jan Richardson - wife of Bud. She gave him a lot of love. </p>

<p>Our loss can only be measured by the blessings they have given
us. </p>

<p><b><u>THE FAMILY</u></b> </p>

<p><b>ALLSMAN, DOROTHY</b> (nee Richardson) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Clifford Male </p>

<p>Patrick Male </p>

<p>She mentioned again how much she enjoys the reunion but said
her pain medication wasn't as strong as it should be. Like
Margaret and Bud, she claims to have a copy of the family history
that Mary produced. They all said they would send me a copy but,
apparently, they are afraid of what I might do with it. </p>

<p><b>BARBER, PATRICIA</b> &quot;Teisha&quot; (nee Taylor) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Billy Male </p>

<p>Eric Male </p>

<p>The last time I saw Teisha she was about four years old. She
must be at least eleven or twelve by now. Teisha and husband Mike
and a friend have purchased a gold claim in the Siskiyou National
Forest. If they will agree to send me ten percent of whatever
they find I will promise not to send their address to everyone in
the family. </p>

<p>Mike is a Park Manager at Ft. Stevens Park in Oregon and
Teisha is an advertising clerk for Payless. Like all Taylors,
they spend most of their time in the woods, eating whatever they
manage to catch. </p>

<p>Both of the boys are groundskeepers for a military cemetery so
we should all make it a point not to ask them if they collect
anything. Billy is reportedly working for the county litter
patrol (if you don't have any they deliver) and will be hacking
trails through the wilderness for most of the summer. </p>

<p><b>BECK, META</b> (nee Richardson) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Ronni Female </p>

<p>Carrie Female </p>

<p>Meta showed up at the reunion in a jocular mood and spent most
of her time fighting with Bud over which one of them was going to
show off her grandson. It was a tough battle, but I think Meta
won - best two falls out of three. She must be doing well because
she is considerably better fed than the last time I saw her. </p>

<p><b>BERZ, RONNI</b> </p>

<p>She was there with her husband, George, who seems to be a nice
enough guy, so there is no real explanation how he got mixed up
with this family. Like all macho computer guys he spent a lot of
time talking about his big hard disk, and showing off his son. Of
course, Bud is so proud you would think he had the kid himself. </p>

<p><b>BRYER, BRENT</b> </p>

<p>Currently managing cousin Gary's RV sales and service company
in Redding, and apparently making a bundle doing it. </p>

<p><b>HARTER, BERRI</b> </p>

<p>She works in the electronics industry and is doing well. No
longer involved with Donald Trump. </p>

<p><b>HEDRICK, MARGARET</b> (nee Morris) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Scott Male </p>

<p>Nancy Female </p>

<p>This is the woman we all once knew as Margie Morris. She says
that her husband calls her &quot;Margaret&quot; which often leads
her to believe that she is really Margaret Sweet. It's easy to
get the two confused, especially if you are one. </p>

<p>She dragged Michael and me off into the woods and went into a
monster family-old-times-hugging fit. She has been married some
incredibly long time to a guy who is a combat veteran but is
scared to show up at the reunion, and is currently living with
Donna. They tell me that Nancy (current last name unknown) is
living in the same town. Most legal authorities agree that three
Morrises in the same town is prima facie evidence of a criminal
conspiracy. </p>

<p><b>KRAMER, JOANNE</b> (nee Morris) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Michael Andrew Porter Male </p>

<p>Laurence Kramer Male </p>

<p>Leslie Kramer Female </p>

<p>She says she is working as a supervisory
&quot;registered&quot; nurse (Fresno County still requires
Morrises to be registered) in a hospital in Fresno. Can you
imagine waking up from a coma to find Joanne standing over you?
I'd probably get religion. Would you trust this woman with your
bedpan? </p>

<p>Joanne listed no Significant Other and complained that the
destruction of the rain forests is making it hard for her to find
good dates. She pines for the good old days when she could just
hide down by the railroad tracks and catch them unawares. She
says that if anyone knows any good men she will pay all costs of
capture, crating, and shipping. </p>

<p>As achievements, Joanne says she finally got her student loan
paid off, probably making her the only Morris to ever pay a bill.
</p>

<p><b>KRAMER, LAURENCE</b> </p>

<p>Joanne says he is working at Vendo drilling holes in vending
machines which has always been sort of a family tradition among
the Morrises. I remember that most of the vending machines at
Fort Miller had the Morris family trademarks on them. Did you
ever wonder why the Morrises always paid for everything with a
bag of dimes? </p>

<p><b>KRAMER, LESLIE</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Crystal Female </p>

<p>She called me (fairly frantically but I won't say why) and
said she had fond memories from her youngest years of how her
Grandpa, Don Morris, would bounce her on his knee and sing her
his happy children's songs which are far too obscene to print.
Even though she was very young at the time, she still remembered
the words quite clearly and she sang one to me over the phone. I
could have had her arrested. </p>

<p>Joanne says that Leslie has fallen in love with a &quot;nice
Italian boy&quot; (as if there really was one), with an adorable
grandmother from the old country who speaks broken English, much
like the Morrises themselves. </p>

<p>Leslie brought the &quot;nice Italian boy&quot; to the reunion
(he was the one with the shoulder holster) and introduced him
around. Joanne tried to convince me that he is a Mafia hit man,
but that's only wishful thinking on her part because she wants
Leslie to date a man with a profession. </p>

<p><b>LEARD, DOUGLAS</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Douglas Jr. Male </p>

<p>Timothy Male </p>

<p>Gummo Male </p>

<p>Maurice Male </p>

<p>Zeppo Male </p>

<p>Douglas was there with wife Barbara. His list of children may
have some omissions because they didn't send back their forms. I
didn't get a chance to talk much with them but they seem to be
healthy and in good humor. </p>

<p><b>LEARD, LOUISE</b> (nee Richardson) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Douglas Male </p>

<p>David Male </p>

<p>Michael Male </p>

<p>She shamelessly claims that she spent twenty-six and a half
years &quot;working for the State of California&quot; (an obvious
contradiction in terms) before she retired. She says she now has
more time for the typical little old lady activities such as
traveling (your tax dollars are paying for that), gardening,
shopping (your tax dollars again), walking and just being lazy.
(How is this so different than government work?) </p>

<p>In an astonishing lapse of judgment she admits to having
produced three children, now variously known as Douglas, David,
and Michael. She has not yet seen fit to apologize to anyone for
that. </p>

<p>Louise said these letters were OK &quot;as long as you don't
pick on the Leards too much.&quot; Get real, lady. We ought to
have a Best Leard Joke contest. (No one gets to submit David
Leard.) </p>

<p><b>LEARD, MICHAEL</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>None admitted. </p>

<p>He bought a home in North Highlands and claims to be getting
cooperation from his neighbors, probably because they think he is
a member of a motorcycle gang. </p>

<p>He recently bought a .357 magnum, after trying mine out on the
crowds in downtown L.A., and is now laying for the neighbor's
cat. Fire the first shot in the air, Michael. It gets them
running and makes it a whole lot more fun. </p>

<p><b>LINK, BARBARA</b> (nee Sweet) </p>

<p>She and Dan didn't show up but Magaret brought some pictures
which may explain why. They live so far out in the boonies that
they have to drive in to town just to use the outhouse. </p>

<p><b>MORRIS, ELINOR</b> (nee Richardson) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Gary Male </p>

<p>Donna Female </p>

<p>Joanne Female </p>

<p>Harpo Male </p>

<p>Robert Male </p>

<p>Richard Male </p>

<p>Margie Female </p>

<p>Chico Male </p>

<p>Nancy Female </p>

<p>Steven Male </p>

<p>Jeff Male </p>

<p>Several people wrote to say they were surprised to learn that
was Don in &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;. Amazing realism,
they said, but he looks a lot different with his hair combed. I
understand that he is currently working on his autobiography, <u>Knuckle
Tracks in the Sand</u>. </p>

<p>Don was there this year, but Elinor was not. Seems she gets a
backache just thinking about coming to the reunion. Don was
looking fairly fit (he can still carry his gut around) and he was
exceptionally well-behaved until someone coaxed him out of the
tree. </p>

<p>He is wearing suspenders now, which should help to cure the
breakaway pants problem which earned him the trophy for Most
Embarrassing Relative. After his belt got to a certain point on
his waistline there was nothing else to stop it, and away his
pants would go, far too fast for his reflexes to catch them. His
lack of underwear was the really special touch which put away the
competition year after year. I understand he even accidentally
mooned Nancy's fiance the first time they met. His timing was
always impeccable. </p>

<p>Actually the trophy for Most Embarrassing Relative was retired
in 1975 when he successfully completed his 10,000th career LPF
(Loud Public Fart). Younger family members will recognize it as
the Don Morris Memorial Award For Embarrassing Conduct, better
known as the &quot;Fellah&quot;. </p>

<p>He has had many, many memorable LPFs including some real
stunners in places such as churches, fine restaurants, and
crowded elevators. </p>

<p>One window-rattler occurred when someone invited him to attend
church (never a good idea) in the mistaken belief that it would
have some beneficial effect on his moral fiber. He stopped the
minister's sermon dead in its tracks and had half the
congregation looking out the windows for storm clouds. &quot;I
just couldn't resist,&quot; Don grinned. &quot;It echoes so
nice.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The maitre' d thought I crapped my pants!&quot; Don says
proudly about another incident. </p>

<p>&quot;Sir, would you like some assistance?&quot; the maitre' d
asked discreetly. </p>

<p>&quot;No thanks,&quot; said Don, &quot;I can fart pretty good
all by myself.&quot; </p>

<p>In crowded elevators, his sighs of relief are perhaps even
more disturbing than the actual event itself. </p>

<p>If you really want to know some of the history of why the
trophy was retired, you should ask him to tell you about the time
he got hold of some bad water while driving across the desert
with his boss and his boss's wife. </p>

<p>He says he is too old to be a threat to women anymore but that
is probably just a ruse to lure them closer. It is still better
to be safe than sorry. When some men get to his age they tend to
lose their inhibitions. </p>

<p><b>NEWCOMB, DOUGLAS</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Joey Male </p>

<p>Pam Female </p>

<p>Josh Male </p>

<p>Recently moved from North Carolina to Oregon with wife Joann
and their multiple children. Currently working in Forklift sales.
</p>

<p><b>NEWCOMB, PAUL</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Kristi Female </p>

<p>Ruthie says Paul is a &quot;20-year man&quot; but she didn't
indicate whether that was the Marines or San Quentin. </p>

<p><b>NEWCOMB, RUTH</b> (nee Taylor) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Numerous, I am not clear how many, and I don't think she is
either. </p>

<p>She proudly confirmed the name of her fiance, Tom Springer -
she showed me the driver's license she found in his wallet. He
was there and he seemed to be a nice enough guy, but probably a
little dazed by it all, and more than a little concerned about
what Ruthie considers to be humorous. </p>

<p>Ruthie says she is getting married in August and her grandson
Ed will give her away. His is a joy I am sure we wish we all
could share. </p>

<p>Ruthie said that she thought that she would have five of hers
(so we know she has at least five children) there at the reunion
for the first time in 17 years (apparently a few of them were
just let out). She didn't tell me whether she actually achieved
that but how could I tell anyway? </p>

<p><b>NEWCOMB, STEVE</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Bridget Female </p>

<p>Steve is married to wife Colleen, and working as a carpenter
in Santa Rosa. </p>

<p><b>PORTER, MICHAEL ANDREW</b> </p>

<p>I got no word from Andy but instead received a note from some
woman who identified herself as Christie Clayton (an obvious
alias) and said that Andy had been snared by &quot;a nice young
girl&quot; (where have we heard that before?). She also said that
she was going to marry him next year and presumably attempt to
breed him in captivity. </p>

<p>From what Joanne says, she is apparently fairly well-educated
(a high school diploma and actual college classes and stuff) and
her interest in Andy has nothing at all to do with her primate
research project. Christie seems to be a devious type of person
so she will probably fit in well. Joanne says Christie works in
the Disaster Coordination Office for Orange County which is why
she insisted that Christie attend the reunion. </p>

<p>This same woman, or someone purporting to be her, showed up at
the reunion with Andy in tow. He used to be a scrawny little
sucker but he ain't no more - the Morris blood lines are
beginning to show as he ages. He is working as a customer service
rep - probably for a loan shark. He laughed about the tricks we
used to play on him when he was a kid. He said he got over most
of his anger soon after the casts came off. </p>

<p>Joanne says that Andy has surprised everyone and turned into a
&quot;responsible human being&quot;. One must keep Joanne's
perspective in mind. </p>

<p><b>QUIGLEY, DONNA</b> (nee Morris) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Rick Male </p>

<p>Amy Female </p>

<p>Manfred Male </p>

<p>Felix Male </p>

<p>Julius Male </p>

<p>Donna showed up with her boyfriend Lyle and no clear
explanation of where she got that last name. She and Margie spent
most of the time telling a lot of lies about me as a child. The
truth is that I never did any of those things. Neither she nor
Margie has provided a list of their children they can still
remember. </p>

<p><b>RICHARDSON, BECKY</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Refuses to say. </p>

<p>She showed up at the reunion with some apparently nameless
guy. I have seen him before but he still looks suspicious. She
said his name is &quot;Sadistic Sid&quot; Smith, but he doesn't
look quite that civilized. She did not say what his position was
in the motorcycle gang. </p>

<p>On the subject of her occupation she wisely pleads the Fifth
Amendment but says that she is making a major contribution to the
financial health of the California wine industry. She admits to
no children or, more correctly, says the government will not
release the records. </p>

<p><b>RICHARDSON, BUD</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Meta Female </p>

<p>Larry Male </p>

<p>Jerry Male </p>

<p>By Acquisition from Jan </p>

<p>Brent Bryer Male </p>

<p>Berri Harter Female </p>

<p>How many people knew his real name was Austin? Yeah, you're
lying too. Bud clearly holds the record for the best-preserved
alias - not even his own family knew his real name. </p>

<p>Bud, the elder statesman of the family, looks to be in great
shape. He said he was going to videotape everyone at the reunion
and have them actually identify themselves, but I guess some of
the family had legal objections or something so I don't know if
he got around to it. </p>

<p>As achievements, Bud lists ten grandchildren, and one great
grandson (it is undetermined whether the word &quot;great&quot;
refers to actual family lineage or is just Bud's opinion). </p>

<p>He also suggested that we should produce a family tree. He may
be so old that he is simply beyond shame. I have ordered some
computer software which will allow me to produce one. It should
embarrass everybody. </p>

<p><b>RICHARDSON, JAMES</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Becky Female </p>

<p>Jamie Female </p>

<p>I have to correct the impression I left when I said that
&quot;old farts&quot; were not greatly improved by aging. In
truth, he smells about as good as he ever did. </p>

<p>He and Edna were there and the years seem to be treating them
fairly well. Edna says she is still working while James has
already retired. James is no fool. </p>

<p>My kids tell me that James sagely counseled them to drink beer
and smoke pot. Thanks, James, you're a real help. Edna
specifically requested that Bonnie and I and kids attend the
reunion because (to paraphrase her) &quot;misery loves
company.&quot; </p>

<p>On Sunday James engaged Laurence and Don in a lively
discussion of which type of truck and tractor seats produce the
biggest hemorrhoids. I think they finally agreed on unpadded
metal tractor seats. Never let it be said that we don't have
intellectuals in this family. </p>

<p><b>RICHARDSON, JAMIE</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>None admitted. </p>

<p>Jamie says she is currently working as a &quot;respiratory
care practitioner&quot; which she did not explain, but says it is
not the same as selling pot. She said that she is currently at a
Catholic hospital but she didn't make it clear if that is where
she works, or just where they keep her at night. </p>

<p>Jamie says she previously spent fifteen years with the County
of Fresno. She must be referring to employment because they don't
usually hold people in county jails that long unless it is a long
series of offenses. She admits to no children and says she has
been spayed, which allows her to engage in a much greater variety
of disgusting behavior. </p>

<p>As achievements she says she has a cat and pays her own bills,
both of which are apparently new for her. As hobbies she says she
skis cross-country (it helps to be in practice when you are
taking it on the lam), and hikes in the woods, where she meets
more relatives than she cares to mention. Like Becky, she is
making a major contribution to the California wine industry, with
a marginal preference for corked, rather than screw-capped, wine.
</p>

<p><b>RICHARDSON, JERRY</b> </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Jerry Jr. Male </p>

<p>Terri Lynn Female </p>

<p>He and wife Karen did not show up. Bud says he is working for
Santa Clara County and is doing well. </p>

<p><b>RICHARDSON, LARRY</b> </p>

<p>He showed up with his hair and beard dyed mostly gray as part
of his Moses imitation. Like Meta, he seems to be pretty well
fed. I didn't get to talk to him much but Bud says he works for
Baltimore Cooling Towers in Madera and has just moved into a new
home. </p>

<p><b>RICHARDSON, PETE</b> </p>

<p>Pete showed up and related the story of how he told the truth
on a few occasions some years back. It's an old story, but he
tells it well, and we all enjoyed hearing it again. </p>

<p>He says he is going to run in the Nationals in Indianapolis in
August. If he will keep me posted, I will let you know how he
does. </p>

<p><b>SHEETS, KATHY</b> (nee Newcomb) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Ed Male </p>

<p>Drew Male </p>

<p>Ed is a lucky kid. Ruthie says that with feet like his he
never has to buy swim fins. Kathy works as a wine-maker and makes
extra money by renting out Ed's old shoes as duplexes. Terry, her
husband, drives a truck. Ruthie did not say whether he is a
Teamster so I don't know anything about his possible criminal
background. Ed and Drew are reportedly &quot;two of the very best
baseball players anywhere.&quot; (Ruthie's words, apply the
Taylor Veracity Factor.) </p>

<p><b>SWEET, MARGARET</b> (nee Richardson) </p>

<p>CHILDREN </p>

<p>Christine Female </p>

<p>Barbara Female </p>

<p>Julie Female </p>

<p>This year she became the first woman in the family to openly
admit having four-footed grandchildren. (Laura Richardson was
actually the first, with the birth of the Morrises, but everyone
was too polite to mention it.) She did a heavy-duty grandmother
routine and bored us all half to death with about a hundred
pictures of mountain lions, cheetahs, and the other beasts Julie
works with at the L.A. Zoo. They were cute. Margaret says that
Julie is well-behaved and does not fight with them over the food
dish. </p>

<p><b>TAYLOR, DON</b> </p>

<p>Bob &amp; Edith's eldest is a winemaker in Oakville, CA
(notice how many Taylors are involved in making wine) and
recently married wife Rosemary on April Fool's Day. Fools rush in
. . . </p>

<p><b>TAYLOR, EDITH</b> </p>

<p>She was at the reunion, looking good, and apparently no longer
on the run from the law. </p>

<p><b>TAYLOR, LAURENCE</b> </p>

<p>Laurence was there with his famous hat. It really makes you
wonder, doesn't it? At first I thought he wore it to hold his
brains in, but then I realized that couldn't be true. Some
relatives said that what I reported about Laurence was not
correct at all. Contrary to what I said, they asserted that
Laurence had not been caught telling the truth, and stated they
found it difficult to believe that he ever would be caught
telling the truth. My apologies, Laurence. </p>

<p>Laurence spent a good deal of time telling about his work with
the FAA. He says that he is not an Air Traffic Controller but
does something to maintain the equipment all of the Air Traffic
Controllers use. I am sure that we will all feel better about
flying just knowing Laurence is on the job. </p>

<p><b>TAYLOR, LOUISE</b> </p>

<p>She was there at the reunion looking good and doing well. No
word on whether she is still connected to the KGB. </p>

<p><b>TAYLOR, ROBERT</b> </p>

<p>Bob &amp; Edith's youngest is a history teacher and basketball
coach, presumably at some sort of school, in Woodland Hills,
California. He recently took it on the lam to Egypt, Greece, and
Turkey. No word yet on whether he managed to make it through
Customs coming back. </p>

<h1><i>Richardson-Taylor Reunion News </i> </h1>

<p>Last call to make your plans for the annual reunion! If you
have not made arrangements to attend the reunion you should do it
now. </p>

<p>Margaret sent me a couple of maps to help you out in locating
the more important sites in the area of the reunion. You may note
that she has indicated the location of her home on one of the
maps. I am not sure, but I believe she mentioned that if anyone
could not find any other camping space or an available motel,
they could camp on her front lawn. No need to call - just pitch
your tent and be there when she wakes up in the morning. She
should enjoy it. </p>

<p>Margaret says she has a new grandchild, and Bud a new
great-grandchild, so you can expect both of them to be
particularly boastful this year. Dorothy says that Margaret is an
unusually aggressive grandmother so it may be best to avoid her
altogether. </p>

<p>Only a few of you have sent back your family information
forms. Of course, there is no compulsion to send in your form (or
contributions) - it is entirely voluntary. You will note,
however, that Don and Elinor did not send theirs in last year.
This year, Elinor was quite prompt. </p>

<p>As you all may have expected, there has been no word from the <b>low-down,
no-good Richardson individual living in Ohio who has never
attended even a single family reunion.</b> (Due to my extreme
respect for <b>Bill Henry</b>, I will not mention the name of
this thoroughly disreputable individual.) </p>

<p>Because the <b>low-down, no-good Richardson individual living
in Ohio who has never attended even a single family reunion</b>
has not returned his family information form, and has no apparent
intention of attending even a single family reunion, I shall have
to fill in his family's information the best I can. Therefore, I
am asking all of you to think hard and come up with all the
stories from this individual's past which most clearly delineate
his complete lack of character. There are a number of episodes
from his past which I am quite certain he would not want repeated
under any circumstances (I can think of several that are so
disgusting they would gag a maggot and make a hooker blush) so
let's collect all of these tales and make sure they are published
where all the world can read them. Because <b>he has never
attended even a single family reunion</b> we all know that he is
beyond shame, but perhaps we can induce some shame in some other
member of his immediate family. </p>

<p>I have completed the editing and formatting of Mary Taylor's
family history and I had intended to include it in this mailing,
but my laser printer is having serious problems so it will have
to wait. Besides, I am not sure if I want to send something so
worthwhile to that <b>low-down, no-good Richardson individual
living in Ohio who has never attended even a single family
reunion.</b> With any luck I should be able to have it printed
and ready to distribute to anyone who attends the reunion, which
will naturally exclude that <b>low-down, no-good Richardson
individual living in Ohio who has never attended even a single
family reunion.</b> </p>

<p>We will see you all at the reunion (with the exception of a
certain nameless and shameless Richardson individual). Call
Margaret if you have any questions. </p>

<h1>Richardson-Taylor Reunion News</h1>

<hr>

<p>Just when you thought, even hoped, that it would never happen
again, it is time to start planning for the next reunion. </p>

<p>Margaret and Vic were our hosts last year. They left town
immediately after the reunion, claiming that the timing of their
move was just a coincidence. The last I heard they were holed up
in a cave in the badlands of New Mexico. </p>

<p>As usual, we were supremely graced by the absence of several
disreputable Richardson individuals living in Ohio who have never
attended a single reunion. (As I have stated before, I do not
wish to embarrass <b>Bill Henry</b> by mentioning any names, or
by pointing out that <b>he is the only original Richardson who
has never shown his face at any reunion.</b>) I asked several
people if they had heard from these no-good people, seeing as how
they had not replied to any of the notices, or even returned
their family information sheets. (The truth must be far too
shameful for even them to admit.) The Hell's Angels have a rather
unique reproach for people who fall asleep at their parties and I
felt it was only fair that we also have a similar reproach for
people who consistently fail to attend reunions for a solid
decade. </p>

<p>I put out the word that I am interested in collecting, and
publishing, stories from this individual's past which would show
his most disgusting habits and complete lack of character. He
moved his family away from the rest of us just about the time his
kids were learning to talk so, no doubt, they have not heard the
best part of this low-down, no-good individual's criminal career.
</p>

<p>As soon as I put out the word for stories of this type, Louise
Leard and Margaret Sweet immediately leapt to his defense saying
that he is a very busy and important person (they don't have
enough practice lying to make it sound believable) and they were
sure there was some good reason why this <b>low-down, no-good
individual had missed every single reunion in the last ten years</b>.
Of course, this just illustrates my point about this individual's
character. </p>

<p>How low must one sink before Margaret and Louise come to your
defense? (They have never defended my good character, or come to
the defense of any Morris that I can recall.) They both
proclaimed with the loudness of an incompetent liar that this
individual had always been of sterling character and that there
were no terrible tales to tell from his childhood. They were so
loud, in fact, that I could not catch most of the details of the
stories Don and Laurence were telling about him. I believe that
Don may have gotten this individual mixed up with Herman Klomp in
some of the stories but that's not important </p>

<p>It is a sad case indeed when Margaret and Louise are left to
stick up for you. In any case, you should all know that I will be
collecting the most embarrassing stories about this low-down,
no-good individual and publishing them soon, so his family may
know the complete truth about why he consistently fails to attend
even a single family reunion. </p>

<p>Those of you who attended know that I passed around copies of
Mary Taylor's Family History which I transcribed and printed out
on the computer. I am not entirely sure who got copies so I have
included some copies in this newsletter for the people who
weren't there. (This, of course, includes the <b>low-down,
no-good Richardson individual from Ohio who has never attended a
single family reunion</b>.) If you did not receive a copy at the
reunion, and I did not include one for you here, just drop me a
line and I will send you a copy. It is a pretty interesting view
of the family's history going back a couple of centuries,
although some people have commented that Mary was rather
&quot;optimistic&quot; in recounting the facts. </p>

<p>There was an unusually aggressive pack of grandparents at the
reunion, all of them armed with a deadly arsenal of baby
pictures. Margaret and Vic, having waited so long for their first
two-footed grandchild, were perhaps the most vicious of the
bunch. Margaret showed me some pictures of her and I had to admit
that she is an incredibly beautiful child, with a sparkling
personality, and possessed of talents that ordinary human beings
can scarcely imagine. As soon as I did admit it, Margaret took
her foot off my throat, Vic picked me up, dusted me off, and they
both allowed as how they had always known that I was a gentleman
of intelligence and good taste. </p>

<p>Margaret and Vic were apparently unable to persuade Julie to
attend the reunion. Julie explained to me that, although she
works at the LA Zoo, she has no direct experience with large
primates. Julie puts on little shows at the LA Zoo where, among
other things, she sings a duet with a coyote. (Really!) It's
pretty interesting, but it must be said that the coyote has the
distinctly better voice. Julie also raised a mountain lion in her
home (how'd you like have this chick for a neighbor?). She said
there was no problem at all as long as she had dinner ready on
time and didn't make any sudden movements. </p>

<p>Dorothy showed up with that old tale about how she went to the
hospital and the nurse wrote on her chart that she &quot;looks at
least ten years younger than her stated age.&quot; If you haven't
heard that story yet, just get within fifty yards of her, and I
am sure the subject of medical charts will come up soon enough.
We will probably have to listen to that until she is at least ten
years older than her stated age. </p>

<p>James pontificated quite a while about the problems of these
United States and how he would solve them if he was king. Cut off
some bodily part, he said, every time someone commits a crime.
Lop off a hand, or an arm, or a foot, or something more valuable,
he said. It's an interesting idea but, if that was really the
law, his nickname would have been &quot;Stubby&quot; for many
years now. In the interests of justice and fair play, he said he
would not impose any penalties for anyone who chose to
prevaricate. In fact, he said, that is one of the few areas where
he thinks government subsidies would be justified. </p>

<p>James allows that some Richardsons, and perhaps a few Taylors,
might have committed some minor variations from the absolute
facts on rare occasions, but swears that he has never been known
to tamper with the truth. I thought about that quite a while and
then I had to admit that he was probably right. I could not
recall any time that he had been close enough to the truth that
he could have been accused of tampering with it. </p>

<p>Edna admits that her once-famous morals are gone. She says she
saves her copies of the Reunion News. </p>

<p>Doug and Barbara were there with their delightfully comatose
children. They recently made a trip with a motorcycle gang down
to the tip of Baja where they frolicked with the mating whales,
burned and pillaged a few mountain villages, participated in a
few large drug shipments, and had many other exciting adventures.
They came to visit us on the way back and took us out for a nice
Mexican food dinner -- which is not always a good idea when a
Leard is around. (I am sure we have all had an unfortunate
adventure in that regard.) </p>

<p>&quot;We didn't get the <i>turistas</i> near as bad as we
thought we would!&quot; Doug shouted through the bathroom door. I
was glad. </p>

<p>Pete has had a busy year. He says that he is still winning
foot races even at his advanced age, although he still hasn't
explained why someone would want to deliberately run around in a
circle just so they could get back to where they started before
somebody else did. He says he went to some track meet back in
Indianapolis where (he claims) he won the 400 and 800 meter races
and placed second in the 1500, or some such nonsense. When this
statement was greeted with some modest skepticism, he swore that
it was true (his standard first reply) and said the <b>low-down,
no-good Richardson individual who lives in Ohio and has never
attended even a single family reunion</b> would verify everything
he said. If two Richardsons swear to it, it's got to be true,
Pete said. Alternatively, he offered to swear on a stack of
family birth certificates. </p>

<p>As most of you already know (with the exception perhaps of
certain <b>low-down, no-good Richardson individuals living in
Ohio who have never attended a single family reunion</b>), Pete
has taken a wife, Sandy. Sandy said she thinks his name is Paul
and that what attracted her to Pete was his refined, gentlemanly
manners. As you might expect, that caused a good deal of
hilarity. </p>

<p>She is a Bohemian kind of person who wears funny clothes and
calls herself an &quot;artist&quot; and a &quot;designer&quot;,
although she was a little fuzzy on just what it is she
&quot;designs&quot;. I was in her company for most of two days
and she never did pass around any good drugs so there is some
question about her artistic credentials. She does, however, like
beer, and seems to be friendly even when she has had a few. She
claimed to be a lady of refinement and good taste before I got
the pictures of her with her head stuck in a watermelon. Most of
us hadn't seen such a sight since James sold his livestock. She
fits in pretty well. </p>

<p>David Leard did not attend this year. He sent me a Christmas
card with a rather snide remark about how I must have learned my
writing skills in jail -- a crack which was totally uncalled for
considering all the nice things I have said about the Leards.
David said that he was making huge sums of money in real estate
but he sent no cash. </p>

<p>In a prepared statement, Louise Leard said that David's recent
ventures in real estate had nothing at all to do with the failure
of several savings and loans in the Seattle area and she was
confident that the criminal investigations would exonerate him
completely. She explained that David did not attend the reunion
because one of his escrows did not close when it should have so
he was not legally allowed to leave town. We all nodded like we
believed everything she said. </p>

<p>Jerry was there promoting beer as the answer to a balanced
diet. He swears that he cannot be recognized without a beer can
in his hand. I recognized him immediately, but then the pile of
beer cans had shifted and his head was sticking out. </p>

<p>Last year I received an invitation to Laurence and Wilma's
wedding, of all things. Laurence and Wilma said they were
inviting me to attend because I am &quot;an important part&quot;
of their lives. I wondered a long time what they meant by that.
Then I realized Laurence had to be talking about the time we all
got drunk and trashed his apartment. When we left, Laurence was
standing out on the balcony in his underwear, yelling something
at us. If he had been sober enough to remember who we were, I am
sure he would have made sense. It's times like those that make a
family. </p>

<p>From what I could gather from the invitation, it seems that
Laurence actually asked Wilma to marry him some twenty-five years
ago or so, and it has taken this long to convince her that it is
a good idea. He lies pretty good, but apparently not good enough
to put that one across right away. </p>

<p>Ruthie and Tom were there. She wanted me to correct a minor
misstatement that I made in a previous issue of the Reunion News.
She said she wanted to make it clear that she <u>did not</u> send
me a picture of Tom bound and gagged in the trunk of her car.
Apparently it was some other guy. </p>

<p>Tom, who was pretty frisky the year before, looked a little
tired at times, like someone who had just spent the last year as
the only rooster in a ten acre hen house. Ruthie, on the other
hand, says she loves married life. She explains that Tom is still
in shock from the last reunion, which is certainly
understandable. Maybe it was just more than he expected. </p>

<p>Joanne was there, and managed to wrestle a few of the other
grandmothers to the ground to show them pictures of her accused
grandchildren. She called me after the reunion with some
grandiose scheme to lure unsuspecting men into joining a computer
dating service. I don't know why she wanted it on a computer, it
was pretty obvious which chick was going to get the date. </p>

<p>The last I heard, Joanne said her son, Laurence Kramer, was
working as a taste-tester on an alfalfa farm in Nevada. </p>

<p>I asked Becky why Jamie has missed the last few reunions. She
said that the reunions are usually scheduled the same week as the
Gay Pride parade in San Francisco and Jamie goes to the parade
instead of the reunion. That way, she says, she doesn't run into
quite so many oddballs. </p>

<p>Don Morris says that Elinor does not write letters, but I got
one from her last year thanking me for all the nice things I said
about Don in the last Family Doings. She was, however, a little
miffed that I failed to mention two of her children, Bonzo and
Cheetah Morris. </p>

<p>Don was there. It would purely amaze you, but he is just as
good-looking and charming as he ever was. He may have slowed down
a step or two but any sudden body movements can still clear out a
crowd just as quick as ever. Margaret and Vic thought ahead and
chose a windswept beach for the reunion. Like all the Morrises,
Don complained a lot about how hard it is to find comfortable
shoes for feet with an opposing thumb. He says that Elinor
&quot;understood&quot; all those little jokes I wrote in the last
Reunion News but confessed that some of it was just too
intellectual for him. I helped him count his bananas and told him
I understood how confusing these letters can be. </p>

<p>&quot;You can't insult a Morris,&quot; Don said. It ain't for
lack of trying. </p>

<p>Some people disputed my previous statements about Don. They
thought I flattered him unnecessarily and said they did not
believe he had ever been in church. I assert that he has,
although (by mutual agreement with the minister) it never was a
regular thing. &quot;We love our Brother Don,&quot; the minister
said, &quot;but even Jesus has limits.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If they don't want you to fart, why do they call it a
pew?&quot; Don asked indignantly. He does not understand much
about religion. </p>

<p>Did you ever wonder what happened to Baby Huey when he retired
from comic books? I met Jeff Morris when he was wandering around
down on the beach, still wearing the radio tracking collar the
game wardens gave him. He was roaming around pretty freely so I
assumed he was out of range of their receivers. His fur is not as
long as Don's but the consensus of opinion is that they are the
same sub-species. </p>

<p>&quot;Cliffy,&quot; he said. &quot;Long time, no see.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Most of the time, not long enough,&quot; I said. </p>

<p>&quot;Didn't you used to have long hair and a beard?&quot;
Jeff asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Nope, I always had a crew cut and I was clean-shaven.
You must be thinking of your sisters. You remember.&quot; I told
him. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yeah, now I remember,&quot; he said. &quot;You look
a lot different with a beard.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Say, Jeff, what are you doing these days?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Being a bum, mooching off my Dad, getting into
trouble.&quot; </p>

<p>I was surprised. He seems safe, though it's hard to tell with
anything that big. </p>

<p>&quot;Say, Jeff,&quot; I asked, &quot;how many tranquilizer
darts does it take to bring you down?&quot; </p>

<p>He said he didn't know for sure and then told me some
outlandish story about how some woman wanted him to come live
with her and just be a bum over at her place. It's the Morris
dream but he didn't have all the details consistent. </p>

<p>I got some real nice pictures of Don and Jeff and I showed
them to the clerk in the drug store when I got them developed. </p>

<p>&quot;A friend of mine shot one of those things in Northern
Washington,&quot; he said. &quot;His wife wouldn't let him bring
it in the house.&quot; That confused me. </p>

<p>&quot;David Leard lives up that way, but no Morrises that I
know of.&quot; I told him. </p>

<p>He looked at the pictures again. &quot;Coulda been a Leard I
guess.&quot; </p>

<p>There was some discussion of the fact that the family
genealogy is, shall we say, <i>subject to interpretation</i>.
Some went so far as to state that Don Morris is not, strictly
speaking, a blood relative and, therefore, it is not necessary to
claim him, despite his obvious achievements. I feel that he must
be included, if only because he has infested an unusually large
portion of the family and he seems to show up at the slightest
mention of free food. There are, however, larger issues involved.
</p>

<p>Over the years, the Richardson-Taylor clan has acquired
members by a number of different methods, including adoption,
acquisition by marriage, friends who just kept hanging around,
(on a few occasions) actual &quot;legitimate&quot; births, and
from other causes far too complicated to explain in ten or twelve
pages. This can sometimes be confusing to children and others who
are not fully acquainted with the difference between admitted and
actual history. </p>

<p>I remember when I was growing up I used to ask my mother
questions like, &quot;What relation is David Leard to me?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;He's your first cousin,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Sure. Just check the tag on his ear.&quot; She handed me
a code book from the Department of Fish and Game. </p>

<p>&quot;What is Steve Morris to me?&quot;<br>
&quot;He's your first cousin, too.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Are all the Morrises my first cousins?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;In general they are. There are a few exceptions, but
those are purely on scientific grounds.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What is Laurence?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Laurence is best avoided,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>&quot;That's common knowledge,&quot; I said. &quot;But what
relation?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oooooh, he's just some kind of relative or other.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;But what kind? Cousin? Uncle? Great-aunt? What?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure that he is at least one or more of those,&quot;
she said. &quot;Otherwise, it would be easier to get rid of
him.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well, then, what about Ruthie? What relation is
she?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Do you think it will rain?&quot; </p>

<p>Some of you may have noticed that Mary avoided certain
questions with respect to the family history. I am sure there
must be a good, logical explanation. </p>

<p>Since I started the newsletter, and will some day publish a
family tree, I have been informed that several members of the
family were acquired by means which were, shall we say, not
exactly standard. Let it suffice to say that a large portion of
the family might not pass pedigree standards for the American
Kennel Club. As some of you may know, there is even a branch of
the family which is no blood relation at all, but was acquired
solely because they smelled hamburgers on the grill. </p>

<p>In any event, it shall be my policy to consider any family
member, however acquired, to be on a par with any other family
member who does not have quite so much to explain about their
bloodlines. How you got here (marriage, adoption, or factually
recorded birth) is basically irrelevant so, unless someone
insists, I will not list details of how someone got to be at any
particular branch on the family tree. Nor will I attempt to judge
the relative merits of anyone's lineage. Just take my word for
it, that is who they are represented to be. </p>

<p>See you at the reunion, (with the exception of the <b>low-down,
no-good Richardson individual who lives in Ohio and has never
attended a single family reunion</b>). </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Clifford A. Schaffer</p>

<p>1992 Reunion Details</p>

<hr>

<p><b>When: June 20 &amp; 21, 1992</b> </p>

<p><b>Where: Mooney Grove, Visalia, California</b> </p>

<p>Arbor number 11 </p>

<p>That's really good thinking, Becky -- inviting Don Morris to a
place called &quot;Mooney Grove.&quot; </p>

<p><b>Contribution:</b> The standard contribution is again $8.00
per household, </p>

<p>giving the greatest benefit to those of you who breed like
rabbits. </p>

<p>Those of you who wish to send more may do so. The money goes
into a reunion fund which is used to pay for others who can't
manage it, or it is carried forward to the following year. Becky
says that if you contribute enough money, she will investigate
possible campsites in Rio De Janeiro for our benefit. Send your
cash, check, or small items of jewelry to: </p>

<p>Becky says that it would be helpful to know how many
bottomless pits you will be bringing with you so she can have
some idea how many sides of beef she will need. </p>

<p>Please reply by June 1 to let her know. </p>

<p><b>Bring: </b>Salads, beans (it's OK, it's outdoors - just
stay upwind of </p>

<p>the Leards), desserts, and munchies. </p>

<p>Bring your own beverages and a healthy load of charcoal. </p>

<p>Becky said to bring special dishes, gourmet cuisine, and
something which will &quot;suprise us all.&quot; Please don't. I
don't think she realizes what she is saying. Especially, please
don't bring anything you found in the park. </p>

<p><b><u>How to Get There and Other Notes</u></b> </p>

<p>Becky has chosen Visalia for this year's reunion. As you can
see from the enclosed sheet, it is the &quot;Jewel of the
Valley&quot;. Some of you may recognize it by other names. She
says she chose it because it is the only place in the area with a
low to moderate amount of gunfire in the city parks. </p>

<p>Here is Becky's description of how to get to <b>Mooney Grove:</b>
</p>

<p>To get to <b>Mooney Grove</b> in Visalia, take the Hwy 198
exit off Hwy 99. You will be turning east and the exit signs will
indicate Visalia/Sequoia National Park. You will drive right past
the majority of the motels as you head into town. Five miles
after you exit Hwy. 99 and are now heading east on Hwy. 198, take
the <b>Mooney Blvd.</b> exit and turn right (south). After
crawling about five miles through all the traffic, there will be
a little open space and on the left (east) side will be <b>Mooney
Grove</b>. </p>

<p>There is an alternate route to get to <b>Mooney Grove </b>without
using the heavily trafficked <b>Mooney Blvd</b>. Take the
Tagus/Ave. 264 exit east off Hwy 99 (this will be south of the
Hwy 198 exit by 6 miles), continue east on Ave. 264 until <b>Mooney
Blvd</b>. where you will turn left (North). <b>Mooney Grove</b>
will be on your right (east) real soon. </p>

<p>What do you think the Morrises will be thinking about by the
time they get there? Let's just hope they don't get out of hand. </p>

<p>Becky says this place is a county park (not unlike the place
where some of you may be residing) with lots of tall trees,
grass, kiddie play areas, and a duck pond where the Leards can
grab an occasional snack without bothering the rest of us. About
forty miles east of Visalia is the entrance to Sequoia National
Park. You may want to plan to visit Sequoia during your trip. </p>

<p>We have a large covered arbor -- <b>number 11, on the left
after you enter the park</b> -- reserved for both days. There are
electrical outlets on the site so you all can bring you favorite
appliances. Mooney Grove has a $2.00 per vehicle entrance fee.
There is NO parking around the outside of the park. Those who
wish to save money and/or help relieve the parking gridlock
within the park will need to leave extra vehicles and form car
pools at the shopping center north of the park, or at lodging
sites. Of course, if you just hitchhiked down for the free
hamburgers - even better. </p>

<p>In keeping with tradition (tradition? When did we ever have
any tradition beyond petty theft?) we will slaughter the fatted
calf around noon and put bowls out for the Morrises and the
Leards. We will have an early dinner on Saturday to try to get
their bellies full before the sun goes down. </p>

<p>There are two RV campgrounds nearby and campers need to
reserve early as this area gets very busy with folks traveling to
and from the National Parks. </p>

<p>Motelers have a good variety of choices. Most of the motels
are along Hwy 198 between Hwy 99 and Visalia proper; these are
recommended. (Apparently Becky has some considerable experience
with them.) There are also motels on Mooney Blvd. Mooney Blvd. is
the main commercial strip complete with six lanes of heavy
traffic , all stop and go due to frequent traffic lights . This
is also where the cruisers cruise. At one time, Visalia was
planned as the site for the movie <i>American Graffiti,</i> until
the producers decided to go to the more exciting town of Modesto.
</p>

<p>The Visalia KOA has a full range of sites offering no services
(comparable to home) to full hook-ups and tent areas. It appears
to be clean and well-maintained. Amenities include a pool, game
room, and a small playground. Becky says she was quoted $16.65
for full hook-ups. Reserve early, their busy season starts in
April. See the enclosed sheets for location map and campground
layout.</p>

<h1>Richardson-Taylor Reunion News</h1>

<p>December 1, 1992</p>

<hr>

<p>Merry Christmas! The annual family reunion has come and gone
again. I believe it is caused by a chemical imbalance in the
brain. </p>

<p>Well, for all of you who attended the reunion this year, you
know that Becky and Carl put on one of the better feeds of the
past few years. There was some really good steak, and everybody
brought a lot of other fixings which, luckily, we did not have to
share with any of the lower creatures such as Bill Henry. All in
all, I would say it was successful. Only a couple of people took
shots at me, and both of those were deflected. Becky, being the
gracious hostess that she is, offered to help them reload, but
cooler heads prevailed. </p>

<p>When we got to the reunion, Meta came running out to meet us.
I am a good bit faster than she is, so I kept a good distance
between us until I was sure she was in a good mood. I am sure you
will understand when I tell you that the sight of a smiling
relative fills me with mixed emotions. I never know whether they
are genuinely glad to see me, or just anticipating the pleasure
of killing me. Meta is an especially dangerous relative because
she works at the Internal Revenue Service where she is the
manager of Torture Chamber Number 3. She says that it is against
the rules for her to look up any particular person's taxes, which
helps to establish her alibi when you are suddenly picked for an
audit. Beware of anyone who claims innocence before your bad
luck. </p>

<p>As usual, Bill Henry did not show up for the umpteenth year in
a row. As you all know, I have no interest in trashing his
reputation, even if such a thing was possible. Therefore I shall
try to report only the most favorable things I heard about him. </p>

<p>There were signs that Bill Henry would show up, but it turned
out to be a false alarm -- somebody ran over a skunk. Bud was not
fooled, he knew right away it wasn't Bill Henry. </p>

<p>&quot;Ain't nearly as pungent as Bill Henry,&quot; he said.
&quot;You'd have to have whole carload of skunks before I'd think
Bill Henry was coming.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Now Bud,&quot; Louise said, &quot;I think you're going
to offend some skunks with that kind of talk.&quot; </p>

<p>As it turned out, nobody had anything nice to say about this
low-down individual. Even Louise Leard, who normally comes to his
defense, had to admit that Bill Henry and soapy water had never
been close companions. &quot;You have to remember that it is not
really his fault that he has never attended a single
reunion,&quot; she said. &quot;it is just that he is so obese now
that he takes up two first-class seats on the airplane. He has to
steal an awful lot to get that much money.&quot; </p>

<p>Ruthie tried to apologize for him. &quot;I heard he tried to
come but his kids couldn't make it through the farm animal
quarantine.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Talking about farm animals,&quot; Pete said,
&quot;Living with Bill Henry was kinda like living with a grand
champion Berkshire hog that eats nothing but chili beans.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Now, be careful there,&quot; Louise cautioned him.
&quot;You might offend some Berkshire hogs that way.&quot; </p>

<p>Don said the worst things about Bill Henry. &quot;Me and Bill
Henry are buddies,&quot; he said, &quot;like two peas in a pod.
Bill Henry always looked up to me as a model of refinement and
fine behavior. Of course, he never was quite the gentleman that I
am.&quot; Don was right about that. Bill Henry never was a high
society character like Don, and was not nearly as good-looking,
either. </p>

<p>I called Bill Henry, just to see if he had any kind of
miserable excuse for missing every single reunion that has ever
been held. He was his usual weasel self. He told me that the most
recent lewd conduct charges were all a mistake, because he was
only holding it for a friend. </p>

<p>He told me he was coming to California in December to see some
woman named Nasa. He said Dawn knew nothing about it and tried to
get me to believe that he and all his family are doing well. Mark
is either in college or in jail, and Craig is in his senior year
in high school and will soon be eligible to be tried as an adult.
Dawn, he says, was recently arrested for a long string of
unsolicited good deeds. Bill says he has been doing a fair amount
of running in 5K races lately and soon hopes to run a
sub-15-minute mile. He became concerned about his physical
condition when some old lady ran him down and took her purse
back. </p>

<p>As usual, he gave me the mealy-mouth pretty bad about coming
to the reunion. He said he would try but he could not promise
anything. (His wife hears that a lot.) He said he wanted to make
up for his thoroughly disgusting behavior, so he told me to tell
everyone that he would give one hundred dollars to every person
who calls him <u>collect</u> to remind him to come to the
reunion. He said to be sure to call between the hours of midnight
and 2 AM, California time. If he seems a bit irritable when you
call, just hang up and try again in ten or fifteen minutes. </p>

<p>James and Edna were there in fine form, and James spent a good
deal of time telling me about one occasion when he did not go to
jail even though, by his own admission, he thoroughly deserved
it. </p>

<p>Don Morris was there. More than anything else he reminds me of
a mountain gorilla with a good beer gut, wearing Frisco jeans and
a long-sleeved shirt, desperately trying to pass for human. You
have to give him credit because sometimes he almost makes it.
Elinor came along, too, with no unrealistic expectations about
Don's behavior. Jeff did not come along. Elinor explained that he
slipped his collar and ran off to Sacramento. Elinor does not
attend all that many reunions but it must be stated that her
attendance record is a thousand times better than Bill Henry's. I
heard that Don was sick with a heart problem earlier this year
and, on one occasion, he actually passed on for a short time. The
Lord, however, saw Don knocking on the pearly gates, thought
better of His actions, and immediately sent Don back. Don says I
&quot;appreciate&quot; him. I suppose that is one way of putting
it. I guess the Lord does too. </p>

<p>Joanne was there with her new granddaughter. It looks as if
Christy's attempts to breed Andy have been successful. Their
daughter is an absolutely stunning child, a fact which can be
confirmed by anyone who had the misfortune to wander too close to
Joanne's new cub. I would send you all a picture of her but the
only picture I got shows Joanne proudly displaying her in the
Morris Moon position, and you have all seen that before. Her
Grandpa Don is justifiably proud. </p>

<p>Pete and Sandy were there. Pete says I should go talk to Gary
in Oregon. Ruthie says that she has the highest possible opinion
of Sandy and explained that Sandy is Grade-A Certifiable. I think
we can believe Ruthie on this one. </p>

<p>Ruthie was there but Tom was not. Ruthie explained that, in
less than two years of marriage, Tom had come down with double
pneumonia so she thought it best to leave town while he
recovered. </p>

<p>Louise Leard wrote me a letter in which she told me that she
liked all the parts of these letters that I thought were the
dullest. There is no accounting for taste, particularly in
Louise's case. She says that she enjoys reading them aloud with
the other members of her family. Now that is something I never
even contemplated -- Louise Leard telling fart jokes to her
grandchildren. Maybe she should ask Don to come over and share a
few of his experiences with them. Louise said that she was
pleased to see that I was able to talk about the Leards without
using swear words, because it is so seldom done. </p>

<p>We missed Edith and Louise Taylor at the reunion for the first
time in years. They are usually there every year, except for
those rare occasions when there are rumors that Bill Henry might
show up. The last I heard they were both doing well and making
lots of money. Edith is probably organizing a marathon. </p>

<p>Bud was the clear winner for bringing the most family members
to this reunion. I never thought he was that prolific, but from
the looks of the crowd that he had, he must have been having a
whole lot more fun than I thought. You could tell they were all
related to him, too. They showed up and the food vanished. </p>

<p>Several of you have complained about (among other things) that
I never say anything about myself and my family. Part of this is
due to the fact that I tend to be considerably more refined than
the rest of you (especially the Ohio branch of the family) but,
in deference to the unending stream of complaints about one thing
or another, I shall try. </p>

<p>What can I tell you about my family? You can't really hate
somebody until you marry them. There is no happiness in life that
having children cannot cure. </p>

<p>Serena and Alyssa (the twins) have both graduated from high
school, more or less on time. The Pope has declared it a miracle
and will be erecting a small shrine in front of our house. Alyssa
is now going to the local junior college studying nothing in
particular, and works as a secretary for a real estate appraiser.
Serena has been working full time for the last two years at
Pinkerton Detectives in the Employee Benefits Department, and
will begin college in January. They have matching worthless
boyfriends. </p>

<p>Melissa is in high school, has not been arrested recently
(last thirty days) and had a job over the summer doing telephone
canvassing for a real estate company. Her boss said she was good
at talking on the phone -- a real surprise for all of us. </p>

<p>Courtney is now in junior high school and is wearing the
braces that could have been my new car. Anyone who thinks they
have ever seen stubborn should meet Courtney. For years she has
insisted that one of the Four Tops biggest hits was &quot;I'll Be
Darned&quot;. </p>

<p>Bonnie works at Pinkerton as some kind of manager in the
computer systems department, when she is not home complaining. As
a hobby, they all spend money. </p>

<p>Now, I am sure that all of you with children feel that your
children are a very special brand of idiot. In the majority of
cases, I am sure you are right. That is, you spend a good deal of
time just staring in amazement and shaking your head at the dumb
things they do. Well, so do I, but yours probably don't make it
into the local newspaper. I have enclosed a copy of a news
article which appeared in our local newspaper. </p>

<p>It seems that Courtney (our youngest) was accused of gambling
at school. One of her friends dropped a quarter, so Courtney
picked it up and handed it to her. One of the teachers (a
well-known local nut) saw Courtney do it and assumed that
Courtney and her friend were gambling. Consequently, the teacher
confiscated the money, which was the friend's lunch money, and
said Courtney must come in for Saturday school (their usual
punishment for schoolyard felonies). It was clearly a bum rap
because neither one of them could even accurately describe the
usual technique of gambling, because neither one of them had much
interest in it until they got busted. </p>

<p>We, as parents, took exception to a stupid situation and
protested the matter but, as long as Courtney didn't have to go
to the Saturday school, we were ready to drop it. However, I am
sure the school authorities had no idea they were messing with
Alyssa. </p>

<p>Alyssa is the kind of person who will tell people off just
because they need to be told off. She sort of considers it as a
public service on her part. In fact, she goes out of her way to
find people who need this service. Since we have lived here she
has told off the neighbors, their kids, their pets, the
homeowners association, the gardeners, the security guards, the
mail man, the street sweeper, the sheriff, and the people
building the housing tract next door -- to name a few. Somehow,
an issue always seems to come up which requires her input. She is
often the kind of person who makes you wonder if you can knock
them out with one punch. Alyssa could piss off the Pope. Mother
Theresa would strangle her. I have disclaimed any knowledge of
her on many public occasions. </p>

<p>Alyssa never seems to run short of things that she objects to
and she likes nothing better than a good crusade, so when this
happened to her younger sister she was outraged and vowed to do
something about it. I am not entirely sure why she felt she had
to do something because, on any other occasion, she would
gleefully torment Courtney in any way she could, and I have had
to break up more than a few good fist fights between these two.
If she could have personally arranged for Courtney to attend
extra Saturday schools on any other occasion, I am sure she would
have done it in a heartbeat. I guess the injustice of the
situation was just too much for Alyssa to tolerate. </p>

<p>Alyssa called the local newspaper and reported it to them,
providing them with our correspondence with the school, the name
of the other girl, a few other pertinent facts, and a suitable
amount of righteous indignation. They investigated and published
the enclosed article on page one of the Sunday paper. </p>

<p>As result, the school authorities now eye Courtney with great
suspicion, like Richard Nixon views reporters. No doubt they will
tread lightly when they think of messing with Alyssa, or anyone
who might know her. Their policy of arbitrarily seizing money
from kids has, however, stopped. </p>

<p>As for me, I am doing itinerant computer consulting, some
writing on various subjects, and a good deal of rabble-rousing
for radical organizations such as the American Civil Liberties
Union. I am the only member of the Los Angeles Chapter who is
also a member of the National Rifle Association. Even the ACLU
thinks I am a radical. It makes me feel special to be a misfit
even among the misfits. </p>

<p>My specialty is the legalization of drugs, although I will
willingly engage almost any conservative fool on almost any
subject. As some of you may already know I have spent the last
few years debating everyone from local prosecutors to the Drug
Czars on this issue and, to date, have never lost. The reason I
don't lose is simple enough -- any rational review of the
evidence shows that legalization is a far better approach. Most
of the information I have is really surprising. </p>

<p>Do you know why drugs were originally outlawed? Cocaine was
outlawed because of the fear that superhuman Negro Cocaine Fiends
would drink large amounts of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola and go on a
violent sexual rampage and rape white women. Caffeine was almost
outlawed at the same time because of the same fear. Police
nationwide switched from .32 caliber to .38 caliber pistols
because, as one police officer put it, &quot;Those cocaine
niggers sure are hard to kill.&quot; Opiates were outlawed
because of racial prejudice against the Chinese, and marijuana
was outlawed as a legal weapon against Mexican laborers during
the Depression. The laws never had anything to do with public
health and safety. </p>

<p>As some of you may know, this year there were three judges
from Orange County who publicly came out and said they supported
legalization of drugs. I have been coaching these judges on how
to debate the subject of drug legalization in media appearances
and there has been more than a little success. In any flat-footed
debate they are just about unbeatable. On one recent radio talk
show one of the judges I am coaching was supposed to debate
Sherman Block, the LA County Sheriff. The morning of the debate,
Sheriff Block announced that he would have to release 20 percent
of all of the prisoners in Los Angeles County because there were
no more jails to hold them. Sheriff Block failed to show up for
the debate and the radio station could not find any official in
LA or Orange County who was willing to defend the criminal laws
against drugs. A recent survey showed that forty percent of all
of the judges in Orange County now support legalization. </p>

<p>(Can you imagine Louise Leard reading this propaganda about
drug legalization to her grandchildren? I'm gonna get scolded for
sure. She already blames me for corrupting her youngest child,
and still watches me warily when I talk to him.) </p>

<p>Attached you will find the latest info on the next reunion.
Pete says there will be more information later, presumably after
he has already collected all the money. </p>

<p>Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!</p>

<pre width="132">
Where:                  <b>Merced River Resort, near Turlock</b>                  
                                                   

When:                   <b>June 26 and 27, 1993</b>                               
                                                   

 
                        In the absence of further information from Pete,   
                        we should assume that the contribution will be     
                        the same, $8.00 per household or loosely           
                        organized mob.                                     

<b>Important:</b>              Pete says he needs to know who is coming by        
<b>January 15, 1993</b> in order to reserve the camp      
                        sites.  Reserved camp sites, tents, and trailers   
                        will need to be paid for by April 15, 1933.        


</pre>

<hr>

<p>The campground has camp sites, tents, trailers which may be
reserved on a first-come, first-served basis. The camp sites and
tents each rent for $15 per night, and you may have more than one
tent per camp site. </p>

<p>The trailers rent for $35 per night. The trailers, I am told,
have three beds and will sleep up to six people, depending upon
their degree of familiarity. One bed is an actual bed, another
bed is really a table, and a third is a sofa -- kinda like we all
used to sleep when we lived on Fedora. The trailers are supposed
to be 24 footers with all of the amenities of home. Those of you
who use linens on your bed will need to bring them with you. </p>

<p>Pete says to get your reservations in early because there are
only six trailers and Pete and Laurence have already taken two of
them. Ruthie will probably take another one, so anyone who
doesn't speak quickly is going to be sleeping in the park again. </p>

<p>There is also a clubhouse which serves breakfast from 9 to 10
AM (too early for me) for about two or three dollars per adult
(too rich for most of us). Alternatively, they have large
dumpsters available to feed the Morrises and the Leards. </p>

<p>Additional accommodations are available in the motels in
Turlock eight miles away, for $36 to $44 per night. Pete says he
will supply more information about these later. </p>

<h1>Richardson-Taylor Reunion News</h1>

<hr>

<p>March 26, 1993 </p>

<p>Pete called me with the latest update on the reunion. As he
claimed before, it is being held at the Merced River Resort
which, he further goes on to claim, is a luxurious private resort
and park with numerous amenities such as a swimming pool, spa,
enormous club house, and neighboring nudist camp. They have
breakfast in the morning for a nominal fee and kids can eat for
half price. He says that it is so good that they guarantee good
weather. He also says that there are lots of things in the area
such as the Museum at Castle Air Base, the Musuem of Merced
County, some sort of Pioneer Exhibit, and the Yosemite Wildlife
Area. </p>

<p>Doug Leard wrote to commend me on my &quot;internecine
approbation.&quot; (Douglas is sometimes excessively
sesquipedalian.) He went on to say that I should spread some more
of that condemnation on other people in the family, besides the
lower-grade Ohio member, such as Robert and Richard Morris, whose
combined attendance record is nil and seldom. Robert is now
living in Florida and I am of the belief that it is not good
policy to encourage any Morris to come out of a swamp. Richard
last attended at one of the Santa Cruz reunions where he got too
close to the campfire and burned his fur pretty badly. I hear
that he still has a large bald spot on his back and is still
shaken up by the experience. </p>

<p>Bud wrote to say that he has a new great-grandson named (of
all things) James Richardson, born January 23, 1993, weighing in
at seven pounds, eleven ounces, and 21.5 inches long. As usual,
Bud took more credit for this event than any three people would
have deserved, and says that one of his grandchildren played some
minor role in helping to bring this about. We certainly
congratulate him but I think that, in view of the historical
record, his parents might have been more judicious in their
choice of a name. </p>

<p>I have heard that Edna took a nasty fall and broke her leg
pretty badly. She did not explain why she chose to do this, I
would think that she would have wanted to avoid it. Anyway, I
also heard that she seems to be recovering pretty well now but
may still have a slight limp when she gets to the reunion. I was
sorry to hear about her getting hurt but I have to admit that I
am glad of any advantage I can get whenever she starts chasing me
(her favorite nephew) around the table with a butcher knife. </p>

<p>Alyssa, our eldest, appeared on the television game show,
Scattergories, at the end of February, and will soon be appearing
again on April 19 or 20 because they screwed up the scoring the
first time. She has completed her schooling to become a real
estate appraiser and will soon be taking the licensing test. If
she passes the test, she will probably become the youngest
certified real estate appraiser in the state of California. </p>

<p>Melissa took some career aptitude tests for high school and,
overall, scored higher than the school administrators had ever
seen before. In fact, they said that she was probably qualified
to become a research scientist, if she chose. (This is the same
girl whose head whistles when the wind blows.) They said she
scored off the top of the scale on one particular aptitude -- the
ability to talk. That was a great surprise to all of us. </p>

<p>Now to raise the hackles of a good number of you. The years of
Fascist dictatorship under Reagan and Bush has finally overcome
my political apathy and I have resolved to do something about it.
I had hoped that Bill Clinton would make some major changes on
some issues but he appears to be wimping out, so he will probably
have to be pushed. </p>

<p>I am opposed to abortion, for example, but feel that there are
better ways than criminal laws to prevent or dissuade people from
having them. As in many other areas, the use of the police to
enforce essentially private behavior does not add any real
benefit to the equation. </p>

<p>Clinton appears to have wimped out on the issue of gays in the
military, too. The fact is that there have been gays in the
military since the days of Achilles and Patrocles. There were gay
guys in my Army Intelligence unit in Korea and they did not seem
to be a disruptive influence, except to those people that I
thought were a disruptive influence. They had the same kind of
hysterical talk about disorder in the barracks when they were
going to racially integrate the armed services. It was balderdash
then and it is balderdash now. </p>

<p>As I told you, I have been involved in a campaign to
decriminalize drugs. I don't want to get too political here, but
we have people in this family who have suffered greatly, and
continue to suffer, because of a terribly misguided war against
drugs. Aside from the political aspects, this is an issue which
has directly affected this family. Because of some recent events
in the family, a few more of you have come around to my way of
thinking and specifically asked to hear more of what I had to say
about the issue. Therefore, I have enclosed some of the
literature I have put together on the issue. I encourage you all
to go to the library and read the evidence. No rational person
can support our current drug policy once they have read the
evidence. </p>

<p>Things seem to be coming to a head on this issue. I have had a
pretty fair number of speeches and debates, including some on the
radio. The most interesting thing was a meeting we held at the
Hoover Institution at Stanford University on February 26. The
meeting was held at the offices of Dr. Milton Friedman, the
Nobel-prize winning economist, and included some of the most
prominent medical authorities on drugs in the world. Together, we
drafted a resolution calling for immediate public hearings to
form a new drug policy. I have enclosed a copy of the resolution
and a partial list of the people who have signed it. </p>

<p>The resolution was published across the nation. It immediately
received the endorsement of Dr. Dean Edell, and the San Jose
Mercury, and made front-page news in Baltimore and other cities.
In addition, the California Medical Association adopted a
resolution which went even further and openly called for
decriminalization. We are now trying to sign up as many major
prominent people or organizations as we can and, in another
ninety days or so, we will carry the resolution to Bill Clinton
to try to get him to act on it. We have already received a
tremendous response to our announcement and we are anticipating
much more. We believe that, in addition to Baltimore Mayor Kurt
Schmoke, we will soon have the signatures of several more mayors
of major cities. </p>

<p>I have to say that the meeting was intensely interesting.
There were nine doctors in attendance, including the American
doctor who formed Britain's drug treatment plan in 1947, and the
doctor who was appointed by the state legislature to head
California's Research Advisory Panel on Drugs. All of the doctors
agreed that medical patients are suffering unnecessarily because
the war on drugs has limited doctors' ability to provide pain
relief. Dr. Harvey Rose spent three years and more than $100,000
fighting charges that he gave too much Darvon to a woman who was
in her 80's and had crippling arthritis. The war against drugs
has gone so far overboard that doctors cannot prescribe adequate
pain relief, even for people who are desperately ill. </p>

<p>I described to them the medical problems of a few members of
the family and they all agreed on the one thing that they would
prescribe for severe pain -- heroin. They said it was a highly
desireable analgesic because it was safe, powerful, and
short-acting. They all agreed that, for severe medical pain,
heroin is the drug of choice. What was most surprising to me was
that they consistently used the same word to describe all of the
illegal drugs in general, and heroin in particular. The word they
used was &quot;harmless.&quot; Doctors are now coming to
understand that drugs such as marijuana, heroin, and morphine
have very important medical benefits which are not provided by
any other type of drug. Marijuana is the treatment of choice for
conditions such as glaucoma and nausea from chemotherapy. Heroin
and morphine help people heal much faster after severe injuries
or surgery because, by reducing pain, they reduce the stress on
the nervous system. </p>

<p>It is with great regret that I must report that Wilma Taylor
has died. We will miss her.</p>

                      Pete says that the party will really start Friday  
                      night, June 25, for all the really hard-core       
                      family members with a campfire, marshmallow        
                      roast, and the traditional Lewd, Obnoxious         
                      Behavior Contest. Pete said that he wanted to      
                      hold the contest on Friday night because there     
                      was a chance that Bill Henry might show up on      
                      Saturday and he wanted other people to have a      
                      fair chance.  He says that ten families are        
                      already signed up for Friday night.                

                      Saturday will be the big day with hot dogs and

                      an underground beer vat at his home.               
                      Contributions must be in by June 1 and the money   
                      will be all spent by June 21.  As usual, let us

<h1>Richardson-Taylor Reunion News</h1>

<hr>

<p>November 10, 1993 </p>

<p>The Richardsons right before the raid. Nobody of any
importance is missing from this picture. </p>

<p>The Reunion News is coming out a little early for a couple of
reasons. The first is that I got a call the other day from
Laurence. He left a message on my answering machine telling me
that he was going to get &quot;fixed&quot; in January and he
wanted to invite a whole bunch of people to watch. If it is going
to be held in Santa Rosa I may have to pass. He did not explain
much about whether this was some kind of civil or criminal
requirement which had been imposed upon him, or whether he
thought it would just be a fun way to spend the afternoon. </p>

<p>Come to think of it, the tape was not very clear and he could
have said either that he was going to get &quot;fixed&quot; or
that he was going to get &quot;hitched.&quot; I figured the first
was much more likely, and of far greater public benefit, so
that's how I will pass it on to the rest of you. </p>

<p>The second reason I will explain a little later. </p>

<p>As you all know (with the exception of those who have never
attended a single reunion), the last reunion was held on the
Merced River where it was hotter than Hell most of the time. You
could drink all day and never take a leak. </p>

<p>When I arrived a rather strange looking person came running
toward me. &quot;Hi, Cliff!&quot; he said. </p>

<p>I always find it unnerving when eye-witnesses can identify me.
I figured it was best to humor him. &quot;Hi,&quot; I said. </p>

<p>&quot;Do you know who I am?&quot; he asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Stranger,&quot; I told him, &quot;I think you are in the
wrong camp. We don't ask questions like that around here.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'll give you a clue,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm a
Taylor,&quot; as if that would have narrowed down the field. </p>

<p>&quot;That may well be, but it's nothing to brag on,&quot; I
told him, &quot;and taking your word for it, I would hate to
guess.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'm David Taylor,&quot; he said merrily, &quot;and I
brung my whole family with me,&quot; apparently not noticing the
look of shock and dread which crossed my face.</p>

<hr>

<p>Don Morris: Redefining handsome</p>

<hr>

<p>I had no reason to believe that this had any relation to the
truth but I decided to accept his story for two reasons. The
first is that it is my standing policy not to question anyone's
tales of how they could be related to the family, no matter how
remarkable the story might be. The second is that I quickly
decided that if anyone wanted to claim to be David Taylor, I
would not dispute him for the honor of it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Pete's explanation for why he is unemployed.</p>

<hr>

<p>He told me how much he liked reading the Reunion News and
assured me that, while some high-falutin' people may have been
offended by some things I said, he certainly was not. He went on
to assure me that he was just as hard to insult as any of the
Morrises, and for pretty much the same reasons. It was a
comforting thought. </p>

<p>He spent the better part of half an hour introducing me to all
the people he had brought with him with the obvious expectation
that I might remember some of them the next time around. I have
made no such effort to remember anyone in the past and no one
should expect that I would make such an effort now or in the
future. It makes no difference in the conversation anyway. From
then on, he would pull me aside every couple of hours to
introduce me to some new &quot;relative&quot; of his (he claimed
that the majority of them were his children, though he was hazy
on more than a few) who had shown up just in time to eat. I
figure that the eight dollar contribution for his household
probably worked out to about ten cents a head. </p>

<p>David Leard and his wife, Pat, were there. She still uses her
maiden name, Lindsey, in order not to be too closely associated
with him. They could be legally attached or just living in sin.
She was suspiciously friendly and I wondered why until she pulled
me aside and slipped me five dollars so I wouldn't say anything
bad about them. The going rate is ten -- each. </p>

<hr>

<p>Laurence under the influence again.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now I am going to tell you something that you probably would
not have believed even if you had been there and seen it with
your own eyes, but they decided that David Leard met the sanitary
standards to host a reunion, and that he and the woman who cleans
his cage would host the next family reunion in some place called
Seattle. I know that some of you will find this hard to believe
but it is cold, hard fact. I can assure you that I had no part in
the transaction and I would have denied responsibility in any
case. The vote was made and carried entirely by the Alzheimer's
crowd, led by Margaret, whose mental state had apparently been
adversely affected by the long drive from New Mexico. Pete went
so far as to auction off fifteen pounds of perfectly good
hamburger rather than cart it up to Seattle for next year.</p>

<hr>

<p>Lunch wasn't quite enough for Richard and Pat.</p>

<hr>

<p>Laurence was there and spent some time telling me that he
agreed with me wholeheartedly on legalizing drugs. &quot;It is
tremendously important,&quot; he said, &quot;that sick people
have a right to pain killers and anesthesia.&quot; He
demonstrated the point by applying a liberal dose of anesthesia
to himself. </p>

<p>As many of you know, Laurence spent some time in the hospital
earlier this year and he says that, because of his emotional
condition after Wilma's passing, the hospital staff labeled him
as being under great stress and therefore allowed him to do
anything he chose. &quot;It was great,&quot; he said, &quot;I
could cuss and scream and kick and rant and rave and piss on the
floor and they wouldn't do nothing. It was just like home.&quot;
Despite his emotional stress he was on his best behavior, so most
of the time he actually left the crowd and went behind a trailer
to relieve himself. </p>

<p>When he was at least a couple of six packs into the
conversation, he got into an argument with Dorothy about
something to do with politics. I don't remember what it was
exactly, and I don't think you could have gotten a clear
explanation from either one of them. </p>

<p>&quot;Laurence, you are a stupid, ignorant, bigoted,
illiterate, and disgusting idiot!&quot; Dorothy told him. </p>

<p>&quot;So what's your point?&quot; he asked. He is among the
quicker of the Taylors. </p>

<p>Louise Leard (my Aunt Polly) was there again. She said that
nothing much new has happened in her life, except that she has a
new pair of stove lids for glasses. They look nice on her. She
says that I should respect her more now that she is a
hundred-and-something (or is it two hundred-and-something?) years
old. I told her that if she had gotten to be that old she should
stop expecting miracles. I am quite sure that some day Louise
will be just as old as she always wanted to be. </p>

<p>Ruthie and Tom were there but Tom spent most of Saturday in
the trailer. Ruthie explained to me that he was laid up because
of something that had happened between them the previous night.
This was no great surprise to me and I would tell you what it
was, but there are some things that I prefer she didn't share
with me.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ruthie spent the weekend burglarizing cars.</p>

<hr>

<p>James and Edna were there and Edna was sporting the latest in
orthopedic appliances for her broken leg. She is doing better
than anyone would have a right to expect after such an injury
(she really did it good when she did it) although she passed up a
perfectly good chance to get several cartons of pain-killers and
other mind-altering drugs. She claims she likes it better that
way. Not me. I want morphine for paper cuts. </p>

<p>Since the reunion there have been a number of interesting
developments on the drug legalization front. Judge James P. Gray
and Joseph McNamara presented the resolution to Dr. Lee Brown,
the current drug czar at a dinner meeting on August 4. The Drug
Policy Foundation in Washington has picked up the resolution as a
cause. They have already printed it once in their newsletter and
will soon print it again as a tear-out page that people can send
it to Clinton. Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein wrote a major
article about the resolution in the July 8 NY Times, it has been
on Nightline, in Newsweek, in High Times, and has received lots
of other media coverage. Dr. Dean Edell mentions the resolution
about once a month on his radio show and Hugh Downs has done two
shows in which he has mentioned the resolution and quoted
directly from the things I have written. (Oddly enough, he chose
the only facts in my little booklet which I cannot directly
support with actual statistics. For example, he used my line
that, &quot;More Colombians die from American tobacco than the
number of Americans who die from Colombian cocaine.&quot; I don't
have any actual statistics for that one, although there is every
reason to believe it is true.) We have received literally
thousands of signed resolutions from all over the world,
including Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, England, and other
places. </p>

<hr>

<p>Unlike Bill Henry, David Taylor scrounged up the cash to make
bail and came to the reunion.</p>

<hr>

<p>In one of the more interesting events, I appeared on the Mo
Gaffney show (an Oprah-type talk show) against William Von Raab.
Mr. Von Raab is the former Customs Commissioner under Reagan and
Bush and the father of the &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; program
where they confiscated millions of dollars worth of property
under the pretext that a marijuana seed was found. He quit the
Bush administration because he thought they were not tough enough
on drugs and has been one of the biggest campaigners for tougher
sentences and bigger prisons. James would love him. I had been
waiting years to get somebody like him in front of an audience
where they could not run and could not hide. </p>

<p>To make a long story short, I beat the snot out of him for an
hour and he caved in and gave up. I did not even give him a break
during the commercials. At the end of the hour he signed the
resolution calling for an objective commission to rewrite our
drug policy and admitted to me that he did not know anything
about drugs and, therefore, was not qualified to speak on drug
policy. He also told me that our previous Drug Czars, William
Bennett and Bob Martinez, knew even less about drugs than he did,
so there was no way they could have been qualified for their
jobs, either. (His words.) I do not believe that he will ever try
to speak out on this issue again. </p>

<p>As a result of the resolution, on September 20, a bill was
introduced into Congress, H.R. 3100, The National Drug Control
Policy Act of 1993, by Representative Don Edwards of San Jose.
This bill calls for a thirteen-member commission to review and
rewrite our national drug policy, based on an objective
evaluation of the evidence. Five members of the commission would
be appointed by the President, and four each by the Senate and
the House of Representatives. Currently elected or appointed
government officials would not be allowed as members of the
commission. The bill is being supported by the Drug Policy
Foundation, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, and others. I urge
everyone to write to your elected officials and support H.R.
3100. </p>

<p>Anyway, I told you there is another reason why the reunion
news is coming out early this year. It is because David Leard has
put together the plans for the next reunion and, assuming
everyone agrees to it, it will be necessary to notify the place
where it will be held by November, 1993. So you all have to
respond fairly quickly to let him know. </p>

<p>So here is David Leard's proposal for the next reunion,
recited verbatim, with only minimal comments on my part. </p>

<p>First, he wants to hold it at a place called the &quot;Icicle
River&quot; in Washington. Pretty inviting, huh? Bring your
bathing suit and watch your body pucker. I guess he thinks that
is the only way he could top Becky after she invited the Morrises
to <b>Moon</b>ey Grove. </p>

<p>Here is what David had to say. Some corroborating
incriminating evidence is also enclosed. </p>

<p>Because of the distance folks will have to travel, they won't
be able to bring food as they normally do for the California
reunions. That limited choices to places which could provide food
at reasonable cost, provide activities, have camping nearby and
be beautiful (not hot and dusty) We have chosen Mountain Home
Lodge in Leavenworth, WA as the main location for lodging and
meals. There are many activities available here. </p>

<p>Those who are driving or camping can plan on going straight to
the Lodge or rv/camping area described below. If you are flying
into SEATAC airport, you will have to rent a car to drive to
Mountain Home Lodge. You will need a map of Washington. Detailed
directions to come later should there be enough interest. </p>

<p>Mountain Home, Tel.(509) 548-7077, is a destination vacation
lodge just outside Leavenworth, WA, approximately 2-2 hours
drive from SEATAC and Seattle. We have arranged to have the
entire lodge if we can book enough rooms in advance. Tentatively
planned for weekend of Friday/Saturday, June 24, 25, Sunday
optional. We would have to reserve for Friday and Saturday nights
and anyone wishing more nights could do so. (rate sheet enclosed)
The cost for entire lodge is $892 for lodging of 18 people, 24
maximum. There are eight (8) rooms, each accommodating one to
three people. Rates range from $88 to $118 per night for two
people. An addition person in a room is $15 more. A buffet dinner
on Friday and Saturday would cost $15 per person, per night,
Continental Breakfast is $3.50 ea. and big breakfast is $8.25.
(Their continental breakfast is quite good and the regular
breakfast is more than ample). Lunch is $6.00; usually soup,
sandwiches, lemonade, cookies. </p>

<p>In order to guarantee that we are not sharing the loge, we
have to let them know by November. If we don't fill the lodge, we
could still use it as a base, but other guests would be there
also. That could mean younger children would not be allowed in
main lodge accommodations, but OK for day visits. i.e., children
and pets normally not accepted at lodge. The accommodations are
much better than average and the food is always good. The owners
are friendly and willing to work with us on the menu. Usually
dinner is BBQ salmon or steaks, done outside main lodge. Lots of
activities, including: hiking, horseshoes, volleyball, tennis,
swimming in the pool, and a hot tub located just off the large
main deck. Lots of things to do. </p>

<p>There is the &quot;best RV Park I have ever seen&quot; just a
few miles from the lodge. The Icicle River RV Park, 7305 Icicle
Road, Leavenworth, WA 98826. Tel. #(509) 548-5420 They are closed
during winter, open in April, a Good Sam Park, with 10% discount
for Good Sam members, AAA, Golden Age (62), and when taking 5
unites or more, other discounts apply, please inquire if
interested. Rates are: $22.50 per day for full hook up; $15.50
per day for tent space. These rates apply to two people per unit.
It's very clean, with facilities for laundry, showers, etc. They
are the kind of place that fills early in the year, so make
reservations as soon as possible. They do take reservations
during the winter when closed. Keep trying if no answer. </p>

<p>There is fishing right out your back door if you stay at
Icicle River. It's a bit of a drive to Mountain Home from the
park, in the range of 20 -25 minutes because of the road to
Mountain Home. (A bit primitive, slow going, but it is kept in
good shape during most of summer. Can be muddy in spring if snow
melt is slow.) </p>

<p>The Lodge will provide transportation to the Lodge from the
bottom of Mountain Home Road, just outside Leavenworth, but they
charge a fee. In addition, if you are not staying at the Lodge,
they charge a day use fee of $10 per person allowing access to
all facilities at the lodge, this fee is reduced if you include a
meal while there. </p>

<p>We realize this is more expensive than reunions in the past.
Although Margaret volunteered us, we accepted the challenge and
did our best. It was a difficult search because of the summer
demand for recreation and camping in this area. The close-in
spots are taken years/months in advance or lease their best
facilities by the month only and they are all taken. If this
doesn't work for too many people, there is always the option of
returning to somewhere in CA. We will be happy to follow through
with the plan if the OK is given by enough folks to fill the
lodge and others can stay in the camping area. </p>

<p>Well, there you have it. This plan will probably require a
fair amount of decision-making so discuss it all among yourselves
and call David Leard </p>

<h1>Richardson-Taylor Reunion News </h1>

<hr>

<p>February 13, 1994 </p>

<p>David &quot;Bigfoot&quot; Leard wrote to me with a reunion
update, so I thought I would pass it along. </p>

<p>As you all may know, there was something of an earthquake down
here. Some people said it was God's reaction to the thought that
Laurence might reproduce but I take a more charitable view. That
big freeway overpass that collapsed that you saw on TV is about
five miles from where I live, and I go over that exact stretch of
road every morning on the way to work. It woke us up (to be sure,
it woke us up) at 4:30. The whole house was flying around and all
the lights were out, except for the flashes of the explosions in
the distance. We crawled over the junk to get out of our bedroom
and located the kids and they were OK, except that Serena had
gotten buried by falling furniture but was none the worst for
wear. Bonnie evidently got hit in the shoulder by a falling lamp.
That is all we can figure anyway, because she did not notice it
at the time and did not even report any pain until several hours
later. </p>

<p>When these things happens, all the best laid plans go right
out the window. We had bought rechargeable flashlights for years
and had them all over the house most of the time, in addition to
numerous regular flashlights of various types and sizes. In the
first two hours we could not find any of them. After that, the
sun was up. Luckily, however, we did happen to have adequate
supplies of food and drinkable water to last through the next few
days. There were no utilities at all for about 24 hours, then we
got electricity, and two days later we got running water, but had
to boil it or put bleach in it to drink it for about three weeks.
There were people passing out free bottled water all over the
place and the Miller beer company even bottled up a bunch of
water in beer bottles and passed it out, two cases for each
person, for free. </p>

<p>There was a lot of damage to nearly everything. The roads were
buckled all over the place, and some had inch-wide cracks which I
tracked for more than a mile. Water was seeping up through the
pavement from the broken water mains and most of the concrete
block walls I saw had fallen down. There were several buildings
around which suffered severe structural damage and there were
three people that Bonnie works with whose homes were destroyed. </p>

<p>Basically, the whole house was trashed. All of the bookcases,
entertainment centers, and cabinets in the house fell over. The
china cabinet fell on the dining room table and pulverized our
crystal, china, and miscellaneous other collectibles. Every
television in the house was face down on the floor and we lost a
few VCRs and other appliances. </p>

<p>We found out later that the fault ran from Northridge, right
up through the center of Santa Clarita and broke the surface just
a little north of us. Considering the size of the quake and its
proximity to us we were pretty lucky. </p>

<p>The freeway which collapsed was, of course, the only major
road into Los Angeles, so that means, naturally, that there are
huge traffic jams at that point nearly all day long because they
have to steer all that freeway traffic through a bunch of old
surface roads. (Not real good planning, guys!) As a result,
thousands of people who never would have dreamed of taking the
brand-new Metrolink commuter train are now taking it every day.
As fate would have, among this crowd was my eldest daughter
Alyssa. </p>

<p>As a result of the earthquake, Alyssa was on national
television twice in the same day. The second time was when she
got back to the train depot in Santa Clarita on her way home.
When she got off the train, she saw a Channel 7 KABC television
crew and recognized the cameraman as a guy who lives just down
the street from us. They interviewed her about the quake (One of
those typical news interviews -- &quot;You have just seen half
your town destroyed in a few seconds -- how do you feel?&quot;)
and what she was doing to solve her commuting problems. The
interview wound up on the national news feed and was shown all
over the US. </p>

<p>But that wasn't the good one. </p>

<p>It seems that, earlier in the day, Alyssa had been waiting on
the train platform in Burbank and there was a KNBC Channel 4 crew
down there doing a live remote. KNBC was showing the world how
all these people were now crowding into the trains and all the
rest. While this was going on, the train people started making
announcements to the crowd to tell them to move in back of the
yellow line, because the training was coming. Alyssa said the
television lights were in everybody's eyes so they could not
where the yellow line was. So she turned to the cameraman and
asked him, &quot;Would you please turn down the lights or point
them in another direction? Because we can't see where the yellow
line is.&quot; </p>

<p>The cameraman did not respond, so Alyssa tapped him on the
shoulder (she said he was about 6-2, she says she is a full five
feet) and said, &quot;Could you please turn down the lights or
point them in another direction? We can't see the yellow
line.&quot; </p>

<p>The cameraman did not respond, so Alyssa stuck her hand in
front of the lens and said, a little louder this time,
&quot;Would you please turn down the lights or point them in
another direction?&quot; </p>

<p>At that point, the cameraman grabbed her hand and twisted it
away rather roughly which hurt her, so Alyssa gave him a few
choice words but the crowd held her back from an all-out assault.
A few minutes later, the camera crew and the dippy newscaster
were looking around for someone to interview and they walked over
to Alyssa to interview her. Alyssa was pissed. </p>

<p>&quot;You want to interview something?,&quot; she said,
&quot;Why don't you interview this finger you almost broke?&quot;
And she presented it to them -- on live television. That's my
little lady. </p>

<p>The earthquake was quite a shaker but equally unnerving is the
fact that ever since the big one we have had other earthquakes, 3
to 5 pointers, several times a day. For the first few days we
were having them every five or ten minutes around the clock. It
made it difficult to sleep because every time you would doze off
another one would come rolling around. It is slowing down lately
though. I can only recall a couple of earthquakes today. </p>

<p>The roads were out, the utilities were out, and the phones
were out so there was nothing left to do but party. A bunch of
Serena's friends came over because our house was in better shape
than their condo and they did not want to be in their condo while
the rock and roll continued. So we all broke out just about
everything drinkable, and barbecued all the fish and meat that we
thought would spoil and partied hardy for a couple of days. It
was a major inconvenience to be sure, but we'll make it. </p>

<p>Anyway, David sent me a letter, reproduced below, which lays
out most of his latest information on the reunion. David always
types his letters on a computer, which makes them very neat. He
is different from Becky who is liable to write her letters across
the face of Ed McMahon to save paper, or Pete who has Sandy write
his letters so there will be no spelling errors, or Joanne, who .
. . . well, we won't talk about Joanne's letters. </p>

<p>Here's the latest on reunion bookings at Mountain Home Lodge.
The Lodge's reservations have gone very well. The rooms at the
Lodge were all booked by January 3. I called them and arranged to
also use one of the owner's cabins. (They call it a cabin, it's
really much more than a cabin.) There were four additional rooms
available, now only three. Bud Richardson reserved one of the
rooms on January 4. </p>

<p>If all the rooms at the cabin are taken, I have the names of a
B&amp;B and two motels in Leavenworth, WA </p>

<p>&quot;Run of the River&quot;, a Bed and Breakfast, just south
of town, views of the river. 1-800-288-6491. </p>

<p>Ritterhauf, Motel, 55 Units, lower cost, with kitchens in some
1-800-255-5845 </p>

<p>Leavenworth Village Inn, newer place, a little more expensive
that Ritterhauf. 1-800-343-8198. </p>

<p>There are other motels in and around Leavenworth, I don't have
specific information on them. I have no new information on the
campground reservations of how they are going. But, this
campground is really not any more expensive than others used in
the past that were in resort areas. The Icicle River RV Park,
7305 Icicle Road, Leavenworth, WA 98826 (509) 548-5420 </p>

<p>Now that the Lodge is filled (and possibly the extra cabin), I
am negotiating with the owners next week (January 15) to
eliminate the day-use fees for family members who will be eating
lunch and/or dinner at the lodge. Drive your own vehicles to the
Lodge and save another few dollars. This will keep the costs
down. In addition, those folks who are flying up to the area, may
be able to share rental car expense by meeting at SEATAC Airport
and driving together to the lodge. There is also the option of
sharing room(s) at the Lodge or the cabin. Another options is
helping out those who are have special financial difficulties
with money from the Reunion Kitty and any contributions from
those willing to part with a dollar or two. Kids will be welcome
now that we have booked the entire lodge. </p>

<p>Kids will be welcome as long as they are kept on chains. </p>

<p>This reunion is a little different from past versions and
proving to be more popular than first thought. Give it a try. But
move quickly, the accommodations are going fast. </p>

<p>After the letter came I got a call from Michael who said that
David had more news so I called him. When I first called he said
he couldn't talk right then because Pat had broken her foot while
trying escape back to her people and he had to go drag her back
into the house before the neighbors saw her, or something like
that. When he called back he told me this tremendously long tale
about how he was out of work because there had been a lot of
securities fraud, and embezzlement, and a couple of liquor store
stick-ups by employees of the firm and the whole thing had been
shut down by various vice squads. He assured me that he did not
steal near as much as the other employees and, therefore,
expected to be able to plea bargain his way out of it. As usual,
I wish him the best and I will attempt to protect his rapidly
deteriorating reputation at every opportunity. </p>

<p>Then he told me that Pete had sent him an ungodly sum of money
which was left over from the hamburger sales at the previous
reunion. He asked me to tell everyone that being poor and
destitute and generally socially undesirable should be no
impediment to attending the reunion. He said that money is
available to help out those who need it. Those who need help
should just ask, he said. I immediately made a suggestion as to
how this money could be most constructively used but David,
thick-headed as he is, did not go for it. </p>

<p>He said also that, because the other paying customers had
canceled all their reservations when they heard that we were
coming, the day use fee has been eliminated, and children will be
granted free run of the facilities, including the deer-hunting
range next door. </p>

<p>For those who have too much common decency too stay with the
rest of the group, David said that he had discovered a KOA
campground half a mile or so away from the road to the lodge, and
a pretty dumpy RV place at the bottom of the hill. He also
mentioned the Linderhof motel and the Icicle Inn, a particularly
inviting place, just from its name alone. He says that the
campgrounds are going pretty fast up there so you better make
your reservations fast or you will be sleeping by the side of the
road as usual. </p>

<p>And now a spot of news for the drug legalizers among you. You
will be pleased to know that our Resolution has recently received
endorsements from, among others, the LA Times, the Mayor of
Minneapolis, the President of the Detroit City Council, a Senator
from Colombia, the entire staff of the San Bernardino County
Probation Department, the entire staff of the Harbor/UCLA Medical
Center, the Berkeley City Council, and every District Attorney in
Rotterdam, The Netherlands, just to name a few. </p>

<p>Judge Gray and I have made numerous appearances on radio and
television down here and we almost never get even a single
opposing phone call. In fact, one of Judge Gray's appearances on
radio brought so many favorable letters that the station decided
to run it again. Two weeks ago we appeared together on a TV talk
show in Palmdale. Prior to the show the producers had arranged
for representatives of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the
District Attorney, and the Sheriff to come on the show and take
the other side. The morning of the show the producers got phone
calls from each of the groups and, when they heard who was going
to be on against them, they all suddenly remembered that they had
conflicting appointments, or could not find a baby-sitter, or
something. The real problem, of course, is that they have been
getting the snot beat out of them every time they showed up. As a
result, the judge and I had about two hours of free TV air time
to say what we wanted. They did manage to find a drug abuse
counselor to oppose us, but he wound up agreeing with us and
volunteered to help with the Resolution. </p>

<p>The major national drug policy organizations such as the Drug
Policy Foundation, NORML, and various other groups are beginning
to see the wisdom in our strategy and have adopted the proposals
I have outlined as their primary strategy. If you were reading
the news lately, you know that Surgeon-General Joycelyn Elders
stated that the issue of drug legalization should be studied.
This remark was a direct result of our Resolution. You may not
know that, in a later interview she referred to some things I had
written (which someone else had sent her) and said that she had
read some of the research on the subject and was more convinced
than ever that legalization should be seriously considered. You
may expect to hear more from her on this subject in the near
future. </p>

<p>H.R. 3100, the bill which calls for a 13-member Federal
commission to study drug policy is alive and well and gaining
sponsors in Congress. Basically, the bill calls for a panel of
thirteen people to be appointed, five by the President and four
each by the Senate and House. The panel is supposed to hear all
of the relevant evidence on drug policy and make a report on the
findings within eighteen months. This is an intelligent,
reasonable approach to solving the drug problem and I hope
everyone will write to their Senators and Representatives and ask
them to support this bill. </p>

<p>We are also producing a television show for local access cable
TV. I don't know if you know it or not, but if you have a
television show that you think ought to be aired, the cable TV
companies are required to show it at no cost to you. (Provided
the content is not obscene, etc.) As a result, we have people all
over the country showing these shows on television. </p>

<p>One of the most interesting shows is on the history of
marijuana. It includes a United States Department of Agriculture
film called &quot;Hemp for Victory.&quot; The film was made in
1942 and encourages farmers to grow hemp (marijuana) because the
US Navy literally could not sail without it. It was so vital to
the US military during World War II that farmers who grew hemp
were exempted from military duty. Prior to 1937, marijuana was
grown throughout the United States in industrial quantities. It
was the primary source of durable cloth such as the sixty tons of
sail and ropes carried by the average large sailing ship, or the
canvas which covered the Conestoga wagons of the pioneers. It was
also the primary source of oil-based fuels, paints, and other
products. &quot;Hemp for Victory&quot; really makes people wonder
how it came to be illegal in the first place. </p>

<p>That's it for now. Call David if you have any questions. <br>

<h1>Richardson-Taylor<br>
Reunion News </h1>

<hr>

<p>December 3, 1994 </p>

<p>Yes, just when you thought you would never hear from any of us
again, it is time to start planning for the next major debacle,
the family reunion of 1995. I did not attend the last reunion in
Washington myself and I understand that the turnout was lower
than any time in recent memory, primarily because of a persistent
rumor that Bill Henry would show up. He did not show up, to the
great relief of everyone in the family and Washington's farm
animals, too. Laurence is the organizer of the 1995 reunion and
says that he has taken steps to have guards posted to prevent
Bill Henry from showing up. Therefore, he says, we will not have
to worry about Bill Henry's ugly mug spoiling any of the group
pictures. He probably would have spent most of his time doing the
Morris Moon anyway. </p>

<p>Laurence, as you all know, is now a married man which just
goes to prove that the laws against such things are not
tremendously effective. He wrote me to tell me that he had been
laid up recently due to a heart bypass operation (apparently the
doctors found that his heart served no useful purpose) and an
operation for a blood clot in his leg. Both of these problems, he
said, were the result of what could be politely described as an
overly strenuous honeymoon, which he related at great length, and
was obviously confused with some things which actually happened
in high school. Men really don't need drugs because they have
women. Barbara, his bride tells a somewhat different story, with
considerably fewer disgusting details. In any event, he says that
he is recovering nicely now and will be just as gross and
disgusting as we all have gotten used to, and even come to
cherish. Like Don Morris, he is something of a gem in his own
right. </p>

<p>I have not been in touch with many of you so I cannot relate a
lot of news about other people. I can assure you it is a great
relief. However, on my own front, some significant things have
happened. As far as my campaign to get our drug laws changed,
there has been more success than we had dared hope. Far too much
has happened, even in the last six months, for me to relate it
all so I will stick to some of the highlights. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Both the California Medical Association and the
        Department of Health and Human Services have issued major
        reports stating that the undertreatment of pain in the
        United States is a major national tragedy. They said that
        narcotics such as morphine are the cheapest, safest, and
        most effective treatments for pain and the reason doctors
        do not prescribe them is because they are afraid of
        prosecution if they do. Both organizations recommended
        that narcotics be used as soon as the patients request
        them and that patients be allowed to control their own
        dose. They both said that the risk of addiction is so
        small that it is of no practical concern. As the
        Department of Health and Human Services said,
        &quot;Addiction (as the result of medical use of
        narcotics) almost never happens.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The head of Interpol, the British Association of Chiefs
        of Police, the Attorney-General of Colombia, and many
        other major law enforcement officials have called for
        either decriminalization or legalization of drugs and it
        is apparent that several law enforcement officials and
        organizations are now mounting a major push to get drugs
        decriminalized in all of Europe. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>There have been two TV specials and several radio shows
        in the last six months which were based at least in part
        on the things I have written, one by MTV which aired in
        September, and another by the BBC titled &quot;The Drug
        War, R.I.P.&quot;, which aired on the Arts and
        Entertainment Channel in September. There will also be a
        one-hour television special coming up on ABC which, I
        understand, will be based largely on the points I have
        made and taught others to make. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Our campaign for a Federal commission to review drug
        policy has been successful. Language establishing such a
        commission was included in the recent Crime Bill, which
        everyone made such a fuss about. In all the hullabaloo
        about banning guns, Representative Don Edwards of San
        Jose was able to slip the language in during the
        Conference Committee and it went unnoticed in the final
        vote, even though a number of members of Congress had
        said they were deadset against it. The commission is due
        to start its work in 1996 and is supposed to issue its
        report by 1998. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>A couple of years ago I published a pamphlet I called
        Persuasive Strategies. The purpose of it was to teach
        anyone how to beat the snot out of drug warriors in a
        debate and do it so completely that there would be no
        question in anyone's mind who won the debate. These
        strategies were probably the primary reason for the
        success of all the things we have done. A lot of other
        people saw them, liked them, and started using them,
        including a lot of fairly famous people. As a result, The
        Drug Enforcement Administration and their allies have
        found that they have been getting their butts kicked
        every time they showed up to discuss the subject in
        public -- all across the nation. They called an emergency
        meeting in August, calling in drug warriors from all
        across the country to discuss what to do about it. <br>
        It must have been an interesting meeting. I can just
        imagine the conversation, &quot;I got my butt kicked in
        LA.&quot; &quot;I got my butt kicked in Buffalo&quot;,
        &quot;I got my ass kicked in Albuquerque&quot; and so
        forth. Unfortunately, they did not invite me or I could
        have given them a few tips myself.<br>
        In order to try to combat what I have been doing they
        have issued a 40 page booklet called &quot;How to Hold
        Your Own in a Drug Legalization Debate&quot; which
        attempts to train their people how to debate people who
        are using my tactics. They even lifted paragraphs from my
        pamphlet and slightly altered the wording. Imitation is
        the sincerest form of flattery. I thought one paragraph
        from their booklet was particularly flattering:<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Legalization proponents are formidable opponents. The group
acknowledged that proponents of legalization are generally
well-prepared and credible people whose arguments, though
compelling, are faulty. Proponents effectively use lawyers and
public relations firms to espouse liberalization of drug
policies.<br>
</p>

<p>Shortly after their booklet was published I got a call from a
publisher asking me to do a book in reply to theirs, which you
should see in the bookstores next year. </p>

<p>But enough about politics. Now we will go on to the sordid
details of the next reunion. </p>

               north on Stony Point Road.  The park is at the fourth stop  
               light.                                                      
               There is a map attached to this newsletter, but it was      
               based on something drawn by Laurence so I cannot verify     
               its accuracy.

<b>Bring</b>          Locals should bring one main dish such as beans, salad,     
               etc.  Laurence always recommends that somebody bring beans  
               and says that, despite his recent medical problems he will  
               be &quot;in tune&quot;.

               Laurence says they are all close and have restaurants       
               nearby.                                                     

<b>Supplies:</b>      Safeway, Albertson's, and Longs Drugs are a half milefrom   
               the park.  Safeway has an excellent deli.                   

<b>Other:</b>         The park has swimming pools, which Laurence says cost a     
               bundle.  It also has volley ball, horse shoes (for those    
               of you who don't have your own shoes), tennis, covered      
               pavilions with barbecues, handicapped access and restrooms  
               (I'll bet you are all glad of that!)  It also has a very    
               nice playground.

How DARE they! :) </p>

<p> Date: 13 May 1995 05:54:34 GMT </p>

<p> DARE also has a big problem passing misinformation. I've
personally heard them tell kids that recreational drugs are far
more dangerous and KILL more people than alcohol! That's just not
fact... </p>

<p> A few years ago my niece turned her father in for pot after
being interrogated by DARE officers in the principle' s office at
her school in a very small town. My niece claims they told her
that her parents had a </p>

<p> crack problem. She claims all she said was that she knew her
parents smoked pot in college and once she thought she smelled it
at home. Being a small town ... they ran out and got a search
warrant and searched their home and their two adjoining home
businesses a beauty salon and a green house/nursery. After
ripping apart their home and businesses they found nothing! </p>

<p> But the trauma of being told their daughter turned them in
for crack and having their home torn apart with about 6 officers
in front of their neighbors has about destroyed that family and
their businesses. They are reluctant to pursue a lawsuit because
their daughter is involved &amp; they'd like to put it behind
them. </p>

<h1>A BRIEF HISTORY OF FEDERAL FIREARMS ENFORCEMENT </h1>

<p><b>Frederick S. Calhoun. Ph.D.</b> </p>

<p>Historian </p>

<p>Federal Law Enforcement Training Center </p>

<p>This is Appendix G from the David Koresh Investigation. It is
included because it contains interesting information on the
background of Federal law enforcement. </p>

<hr>

<p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) is a
relatively young law enforcement organization, having been
created formally in 1972. Yet, measured by the federal laws
related to the regulation and taxing of alcohol, tobacco, and
firearms-the laws ATF now enforces-the history of the bureau's
duties and responsibilities stretches across the full two
centuries of American history. As early as 1791, revenue acts
taxed both alcohol and tobacco and created the offices of tax
inspector, collector, and supervisor. During the next century,
the offices changed names as frequently as the tax rates changed,
but the federal interest in raising revenues from alcohol and
tobacco remained strong. Indeed, the formal organization of an
independent bureau within the Department of Treasury specializing
in alcohol, tobacco, and firearms law enforcement belatedly
recognized the distinct need for such an agency. </p>

<p>After the Civil War, revenue agents battled moonshiners
throughout the South in some of the bloodiest opposition ever to
federal law enforcement. Revenue agents and deputy U.S. marshals
by the score were killed as they roamed the hills and hollows
searching out illicit stills. Prohibition changed the
government's focus from taxing whiskey to banning it, yet the
revenue agent's job remained as dangerous. After experimenting in
social adjustment a dozen years, Prohibition was rescinded.
Spawned by the 1933 repeal of Prohibition, the Alcohol Tax Unit
was established as a tax-collecting branch within the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS). Continued concern over the violent,
organized mobs that plagued the major cities compelled the
federal government to try to curb the gangsters' ability to arm
themselves. Rather than ban outright the purchase of machine guns
and sawed-off shotguns-the weapons of choice for the
mobsters-Congress in 1934 simply imposed a tax those weapons.
Paying the tax required registering the weapon. The registration
requirement was intended to discourage ownership of such weapons
without outlawing them. No self-respecting gangster would want to
register, much less pay the tax, on his Tommygun. Their evasion
of the tax gave the government another legal tool to use in
arresting the gangsters and breaking up the mobs. </p>

<p>Because it was a tax rather than a prohibition, it fell to
Treasury to enforce the law as part of Treasury's role in
collecting all funds due the government. Within Treasury, the
Alcohol Tax Unit seemed the logical branch to enforce the new
law. Registering and taxing stills required many of the same
procedures and investigatory talents that would be needed to
register and tax weapons. In the end, the new assignment proved
comparatively easy. The unit was not overwhelmed with
registrations nor by the 1940s were the investigations into
evasions of the tax very time-consuming. As the gangsters
declined in number and power, so did their use of machine guns
and sawed-off shotguns. Enforcing the alcohol taxes again
occupied most of the unit's attention. </p>

<p>In 1951, the Alcohol Tax Unit began enforcing federal taxes on
tobacco, thus prompting a name change in 1952 to the Alcohol and
Tobacco Tax Division. Once again, the logic seemed to be that
collecting the tax on tobacco closely resembled the work
necessary to collect the tax on alcohol, machine guns, and
sawed-off shotguns. The 1968 passage of the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act and the Gun Control Act expanded the IRS
unit's jurisdiction to the criminal use of explosives and bombs.
The new laws also defined specific federal offenses involving
firearms, including transportation across state lines and use in
organized crimes. In recognition of this new enforcement
responsibility, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division changed its
name to the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division (ATFD). Two
years later, Congress passed the Explosives Control Act defining
certain bombings and acts of arson as federal crimes. It assigned
jurisdiction for enforcing this new law to ATFD. With these
expanded responsibilities. the Treasury Department on July 1,
1972 created the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms under
the general oversight of the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
for Enforcement, Tariffs and Trade, and Operations. For the past
twenty-one years, ATF has enforced the collection of federal
taxes on alcohol and tobacco and the federal controls and
regulations on firearms, with particular attention to their use
by criminals. </p>

<p>Although on its face the bureau seems a discordant collection
of separate duties, the techniques for enforcing the taxes and
ferreting out the illicit products, whether cases of whiskey,
cartons of cigarettes, crates of automatic weapons, or containers
of bombs, are strikingly similar. </p>

<p>Subsequent laws have expanded ATF's jurisdiction. The 1976
Arms Export Control Act focused the Bureau's attention on
international gun smuggling. The 1982 Anti-Arson Act gave ATF
authority to investigate the destruction of property by fire as
well as by explosives. Increased taxes on cigarettes and alcohol,
and enhanced regulatory measures such as the 1978 Contraband
Cigarette Act, have also enhanced the bureau's responsibility to
ensure the government receives its lawful taxes. </p>

<p>The bureau has been an effective force in law enforcement.
Supplies of illicit alcohol and smuggled tobacco have steadily
decreased, and tax revenues have risen. During 1991, for example,
ATF collected $7.7 billion in alcohol taxes and $4.8 billion in
tobacco taxes. ATF agents have also focused on tracking down
armed career criminals and criminal gang members. Investigations
in Florida resulted in the arrest of 45 Warlock motorcycle gang
members in 1991. Members of the Gullymen Posse, a gang of
Jamaican drug dealers known for its propensity to commit murder,
were arrested in New York by ATF agents in January 1991.
Similarly, an ATF investigation into the activities of the Born
to Kill gang culminated in the arrest of a dozen gang members in
August 1991. Sixteen members of the San Diego chapter of the
Hells Angels were convicted in 1992. As a result of these and
similar investigations, ATF has become the nation's principal
repository for gang-related information and intelligence. </p>

<p>The bureau has also earned an excellent reputation for working
well with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. ATF
agents also specialize in identifying anonymous bombers by their
&quot;signature&quot; habits in making bombs. For example, in
1990, the assassin of Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge
Robert Vance was ultimately identified by ATF agents who
recognized the way the bomb was constructed. Similarly, in the
midst of the tragedy in Waco, Texas, ATF agents investigating the
World Trade Center bombing helped to identify the van that was
used to hold the bomb. This early identification led FBI agents
to the rental car company and thereafter to arrests of the
terrorists before they could escape the country. </p>

<p>The bureau has developed considerable expertise in arson
investigations. At the request of the National Fire Protection
Agency, ATF began developing nationwide standards for fire
investigators. The State Department's Diplomatic Security Service
invited ATF to develop a protocol establishing an International
Response Team of investigators trained to search blast scenes
involving U.S. property abroad. Despite a rather eclectic array
of duties, ATF has succeeded in developing considerable expertise
in each area of its enforcement responsibilities. </p>

<p>The raid by ATF agents on the Branch Davidian compound
resulted from its enforcement of contemporary federal firearms
laws. In a larger sense, however, the raid fit within an
historic, well-established and well-defended government interest
in prohibiting and breaking up all organized groups that sought
to arm or fortify themselves. The 1934 law taxing weapons was
only the first time the federal government addressed private
ownership of weapons; it was not the first federal effort to
control firearms. From its earliest formation, the federal
government has actively suppressed any effort by disgruntled or
rebellious citizens to coalesce into an armed group, however
small the group, petty its complaint, or grandiose its ambition.
The collection of large arsenals by organized groups lent itself,
ultimately, to the violent use of those weapons against the
government itself or portions of its citizenry. Indeed, federal
agents who tried to disband the groups frequently became the
targets. </p>

<p>The discomfort over armed organizations predated the
Constitution. </p>

<p>The outbreak of what became known as Shays' Rebellion in 1786
gave added urgency to the establishment of a strong national
government. During the rebellion, hundreds of angry Massachusetts
farmers, most veterans of the Revolution and facing foreclosures
on their farms, banded together to keep the courts from issuing
any executions. Calling themselves Regulators, the farmers
quickly organized into a small army. Significantly, their first
foray was to capture the arsenal at Springfield. Although the
Regulators failed, the specter survived. Five months, delegates
from each of the thirteen states met in Philadelphia to design a
new experiment in government. </p>

<p>The lesson of Shays' Rebellion was not forgotten, even after
the new government was formed. In 1792, Congress passed a law
empowering the president to call out the state militias to
suppress insurrections if either an associate justice of the
Supreme Court or a local district court judge certified that
opposition to the laws was beyond the powers of the civil
authority to suppress. Ironically, the first occasion to resort
to that law grew out of the violent, organized, and armed
resistance to the federal government's whiskey tax. Thus, two of
the duties that ATF would later inherent-enforcing alcohol taxes
and controlling firearms-combusted in 1794 into the Whiskey
Rebellion, the first violent opposition to the new federal
government.[1] </p>

<p>Across the next century, succeeding presidents had sporadic,
though no less fearsome, occasion to dispatch the Army and the
state militias to suppress various outbreaks of armed opposition
to federal laws, taxes. and interests. In 1799, Fries Rebellion
against a federal tax on houses forced President John Adams to
muster the militia. Fugitive slave rescues during the 1850s
prompted the government to call out the military. Organized
resistance in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, and
Wisconsin raised a troublesome specter. &quot;The main
opposition,&quot; President Millard Fillmore warned Congress in
December 1851, &quot;is aimed against the Constitution
itself.&quot; At the end of the decade, John Brown's ill-fated
raid on Harper's Ferry,. Virginia, sparked the government to
decisive action. Brown chose Harper's Ferry because of the
federal arsenal there. His intent was to distribute the weapons
among Southern slaves and lead them in revolt for their freedom.
Federal troops, however, thwarted the plan.[2] </p>

<p>After the Civil War, the federal government battled
unrepentant Southerners to protect the rights of the freedmen.
Nonetheless. federal officials acted only after the innumerable
Klan-style attacks were finally perceived as organized.
&quot;Outrages of various descriptions.&quot; Attorney General
George Williams advised southern U.S. Attorneys and Marshals in
1874. &quot;and in some cases atrocious murders have been
committed in your district by bodies of armed men. sometimes in
disguise and with the view it is believed of overawing and
intimidating peaceable and law abiding citizens and depriving
them of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution and
laws of the United States.&quot; The attorney general ordered his
attorneys and marshals &quot;to detect, expose. arrest, and
punish the perpetrators of these crimes.&quot;[3] </p>

<p>Throughout the western territories and along the Mexican
border, the federal government found occasional need to suppress
armed bands of outlaws, ganged together to steal cattle or rob
the mails. General William Tecumseh Sherman. sent to the Arizona
border in April 1882 to investigate the outlaw troubles there,
advised President Chester A. Arthur that &quot;the Civil Officers
have not sufficient forces to make arrests, to hold prisoners for
trial or punish when convicted.&quot; The President promptly
proclaimed on May 31 that the areas plagued by the outlaws were
in a state of rebellion.[4] </p>

<p>The federal government looked no more kindly on the labor
strikes that broke out in the closing years of the nineteenth
century and the opening years of the twentieth. What seemed so
dangerous about events such as the 1894 Pullman strike was not
just the disruption of he mails, which was the legal basis on
which the government relied to break the strike, but the fact
that the mails were being violently disrupted by organized
groups. &quot;We have been brought to the ragged edge of
anarchy,&quot; Attorney General Richard Olney frantically
explained when he ordered that the trains be kept running.
Eventually, Eugene Debs and his colleagues in the American
Railway Union, which took the lead in the strike, were indicted
and convicted. Once again, it was the volatile mixture of
violence and organization-combinations determined difficult to
suppress-that evoked the full power of the federal government.[5]
</p>

<p>The passage of the National Firearms Act of 1934, the first
federal effort to control private ownership of firearms, grew out
of this historic fear of armed organizations. The various
collections of gangsters that proliferated during Prohibition
were the true targets of the law, which required a tax and
registration on the sale of their weapons of choice-machine guns
and sawed-off shotguns. Subsequent federal firearms laws have
been of a piece. Oher than the 1968 ban on mail-order sales,
which was in direct, though delayed, response to the
assassination of President Kennedy, federal gun laws have
typically been concerned with the weapons of considerable
destructive power generally preferred by organized groups-bombs,
machine guns, and automatic weapons. </p>

<p>In recent times, the federal government has shown itself even
less patient with armed groups than it had historically. Radical
extremists of both the Right and the Left have been pursued
aggressively once they began breaking the law. For instance,
after the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) launched its
self-styled &quot;people's war&quot; by kidnapping newspaper
heiress Patty Hearst and committing a number of daring bank
robberies, the federal government dedicated its full resources to
tracking the group down. Within approximately three months, FBI
agents and Los Angeles police closed in on the group at a house
just outside what was then known as Watts. During an intense gun
battle and fire, every member of the SLA in the house was
killed.[6] </p>

<p>Gordon Kahl, who stood at the opposite end of the political
spectrum from the SLA, met a similar end. Kahl belonged to the
Posse Comitatus which refused to recognize the authority of any
government above the county level. Accordingly, Kahl consistently
refused to pay his federal taxes, even after he served time in
prison for not doing so. When U.S. Marshals attempted to arrest
him for violating the terms of his probation, Kahl killed two of
them. For the next five months, Kahl hid among his friends and
sympathizers until FBI agents located him in a farmhouse just
outside Smithville, Arkansas. After refusing to surrender, Kahl
was killed, and the farmhouse was burned down.[7] </p>

<p>Robert Matthews, the head of a group of right-wing fanatics
known as the Order, embraced many of Kahl's beliefs. Unlike Kahl,
whose resistance was essentially passive until the marshals tried
to arrest him, Matthews and the Order launched an aggressive
private war against the country. Like the SLA, the Order
committed a series of bank and armored car robberies, netting
$3.6 million in one heist alone. The Order also assassinated Alan
Berg, a radio talk show host in Denver, Colorado. </p>

<p>The FBI began an equally aggressive pursuit. After a brief,
violent skirmish in Idaho and another in Portland, Oregon, FBI
agents finally closed in on Matthews hiding out among three
adjoining houses on Whidbey Island, some fifty miles north of
Seattle. After ngotiating his surrender for two days, Matthews
began firing on an FBI Hostage Response Team that attempted to
enter the house. Protected by a full suit( of body armor,
Matthews ran from the first floor to the second floor firing
automatic weapons. The FBI dropped a magnesium flare from a
helicopter. The flare landed on the roof of the house and burned
through it to the room where Matthews had stored his ammunition
and explosives. These ignited, setting off a roaring, exploding
fire that consumed Matthews.[8] </p>

<p>A year later, in the spring of 1985. ATF collected
considerable evidence that an 80-member group styling itself the
Covenant of the Sword and the Arm of the Lord (CSA) had
stockpiled a large arsenal at its fortified compound in Arkansas.
The group had collected over 150 firearms, (including 35 machine
guns), two anti-personnel mines, three anti-aircraft rockets, 50
pounds of military plastic explosives, 300 blasting caps, 2,000
feet of detonating cord, and around 100 explosive devices. CSA
had also stockpiled food, water, and supplies. TF led the assault
on the CSA compound on April 20, 1985. CSA members retreated
farther into the compound, barricading themselves behind their
defenses. The agents set up a siege perimeter and settled in to
wait. The group used the wait to destroy many of the weapons (and
hence evidence) illegally obtained. Negotiators from the FBI
arrived and began the tedious, frustrating process of talking the
group out. Three days later, on April 22, 1985, James D. Ellison
and the 75 members of the CSA surrendered.[9] </p>

<p>As both history and recent events clearly show, the United
States has never tolerated armed groups residing within its
borders. The intent of the particular organization, whether
ideological or criminal, mattered little. If the group was
building an illegal arsenal, the group was subject to a federal
enforcement action. To this day, ATF's enforcement focus retains
the flavor of that historic concern with armed organizations. The
agency has developed considerable expertise and success in
investigating the activities of motorcycle, street, and drug
gangs, all of which share in common a proclivity to amass large
arsenals of powerful weapons. The raid on the Branch Davidian
compound occurred in the context of that historical background. </p>

DOJ Report</a> - Feb, 1994 </p>

<p>This Department of Justice report was a search and summary of
all of the existing evidence on the relationship between drugs
and violence. The report found that alcohol was the only drug
which had any real connection to drug-induced violence. Nearly
all of the violence associated with illegal drugs was a result of
the fact that the drugs are illegal, not as a result of
pharmacological effects. </p>

significant, it needs to be viewed carefully in light of the
problems which are encountered with any attempt to collect
information on illegal activities. In addition, when such
information is reported to the media, the government officials
releasing the information will tend to make up press reports
which are misleading, to say the least, when compared with the
full text of the reports. Readers of these reports should read
them carefully to determine the difference between the press
release and the details of the report, and they should also refer
to the problems in collecting accurate data, discussed in the GAO

<h1>Psychoactive Substances and Violence </h1>

<h2>Issues and Findings </h2>

<p> Discussed in the Research in Brief: The current status of
research on the links connecting violence to alcohol and illegal
psychoactive drugs, and evaluations of interventions to prevent
violence related to these substances. </p>

<p> Key issues: Correlations between violence and psychoactive
substances; the social, economic, cultural, psycho-social,
neurobehavioral, and other factors that explain the correlations;
and prevention strategies for reducing the violence associated
with these substances. </p>

<h3>Key findings: </h3>

<ul>
    <li>Research has uncovered strong correlations between
        violence and psycho-active substances, including alcohol
        and illegal drugs, but the underlying relationships
        differ by type of drug. </li>
    <li>The links between violence and psychoactive substances
        involve broad social and economic forces, the settings in
        which people obtain and consume the substances, and
        biological processes that underlie all human behavior.
        These factors interact in chains of events that may
        extend back from an intermediate triggering event such as
        an argument to long-term predisposing processes that
        begin in childhood. </li>
    <li>Of all psychoactive substances, alcohol is the only one
        whose consumption has been shown to commonly increase
        aggression. After large doses of amphetamines, cocaine,
        LSD, and PCP, certain individuals may experience violent
        outbursts, probably because of preexisting psychosis.
        Research is needed on the pharmacological effects of
        crack, which enters the brain more directly than cocaine
        used in other forms. </li>
    <li>Alcohol drinking and violence are linked through
        pharmacological effects on behavior, through expectations
        that heavy drinking and violence go together in certain
        settings, and through patterns of binge drinking and
        fighting that sometimes develop in adolescence. </li>
    <li>The most promising strategies for reducing
        alcohol-related violence are to reduce underage drinking
        through substance abuse preventive education, taxes, law
        enforcement, and peer pressure. </li>
    <li>Illegal drugs and violence are linked primarily through
        drug marketing: disputes among rival distributors,
        arguments and robberies involving buyers and sellers,
        property crimes committed to raise drug money and, more
        speculatively, social and economic interactions between
        the illegal markets and the surrounding communities. </li>
    <li>The most promising strategy for reducing violence related
        to illegal drugs appears to be reducing the demand that
        fuels violent illegal markets. Promising tactics include
        preventive education, pretrial monitoring of arrestees
        through urinalysis and, for convicted violent offenders,
        in-prison therapeutic communities integrated with
        postrelease treatment followup. </li>
    <li>In the future, medications may reduce violence by
        reducing cocaine craving and by blocking the
        aggression-promoting effects of opiate withdrawal and
        alcohol consumption. </li>
</ul>

<p> Target audience: State and local policymakers, court
administrators, law enforcement and juvenile justice
practitioners, and drug treatment program staff. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> As noted by the Panel on the Understanding and Control of
Violent Behavior, the character of violence presents simultaneous
challenges to understanding and opportunities for prevention.
First, violence is diverse. Acts as different as spontaneous
drive-by shootings and met-iculously planned serial killings, for
example, are both included in the legal and statistical category
of murder. Second, the causes of violence are complex, involving
a very wide variety of factors. The panel found it useful to
classify these factors in terms of four levels of analysis at
which they are usually studied: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Broad social and economic forces (macrosocial). </li>
    <li>Encounters between people in particular settings
        (microsocial). </li>
    <li>Individual behavioral development from childhood through
        adulthood (psychosocial). </li>
    <li>Neurobehavioral and other biological processes that
        underlie all human behavior (neurobehavioral). </li>
</ul>

<p> Factors at these four levels operate and interact in chains
of events that may begin long before the violent event that
results. Therefore, the panel's classification framework also
categorized causal factors in terms of their temporal proximity
to the violent event itself: from the immediate triggering
mechanism (for example, a response to an insult), back through
the situation that led up to the triggering event, to
predisposing factors that months or years earlier increased the
risk of a future violent event. </p>

<p> This diversity and complexity might at first glance seem to
discourage efforts to prevent violence. In fact, however, they
create promising opportunities. Merely acknowledging the
diversity breaks the overall &quot;violence problem&quot; into
separate problems that may be preventable through interventions
by different public agencies. Recognizing the causal complexity
expands the list of options for preventing a particular violence
problem by highlighting all the points at which chains of events
leading to it may be breakable. Problem-solving
initiatives--programs that involve design and evaluation of
preventive interventions at various links in these chains of
events, that revise these interventions in light of the
evaluation findings, and that replicate the evaluations--have the
potential to simultaneously reduce violence and increase the
understanding of its causes. </p>

<p> Many chains of causal events for violence include links to
alcohol or to illegal psychoactive drugs. The panel found these
links worth exploring in depth for at least three reasons. First,
statistics consistently demonstrate correlations between violent
events and involvement with alcohol and other psychoactive drugs.
Second, the variety of potential causal links between violence
and different psychoactive substances--alcohol, opiates, cocaine
in smokable and powdered form, amphetamines, hallucinogens, and
other illegal drugs--presents an especially rich example of the
panel's classification framework. Third, preliminary evidence
from research and evaluations suggests that certain interventions
related to psychoactive substances should be considered in
developing strategies for controlling violence. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h3>

<h3>Correlations between violence and psychoactive substances </h3>

<p> Research supported by the National Institute of Justice and
other organizations has repeatedly found strong correlations
between violence and psychoactive substances: </p>

<ul>
    <li>For at least the last several decades, alcohol
        drinking--by the perpetrator of a crime, the victim, or
        both--has immediately preceded at least half of all
        violent events, including murders, in the samples studied
        by researchers. </li>
    <li>Chronic drinkers are more likely than other people to
        have histories of violent behavior. </li>
    <li>Criminals who use illegal drugs1 commit robberies and
        assaults more frequently than do nonuser criminals, and
        they commit them especially frequently during periods of
        heavy drug use. </li>
    <li>In a study of New York City murders in 1988, researchers
        classified more than half the homicides (53 percent) as
        drug-related: 39 percent in the course of drug
        distribution, 8 percent through pharmacological effects
        on the offender, 2 percent while the offender was
        obtaining money to buy drugs, and 4 percent through more
        than one of these links.2 </li>
</ul>

<p> Data from the National Institute of Justice Drug Use
Forecasting (DUF) program, which tests for drug use among booked
arrestees in 24 sites nationwide, showed the following patterns
in 1989: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Most males and females who were interviewed after arrest
        for a violent crime reported drinking alcohol within 72
        hours before the crime for which they were arrested. </li>
    <li>About 60 percent of arrestees booked for violent crimes
        were confirmed by laboratory test to have used at least
        one illegal drug3 in the hours before arrest. </li>
</ul>

<h3><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h3>

<h3>Explaining the correlations </h3>

<p> While these statistical patterns strongly suggest that
psychoactive substances play significant roles in acts of
violence, they do not explain the nature of those relationships.
In trying to sort out links between violence and psychoactive
substances, the panel categorized potential links in terms of the
four levels noted above: </p>

<h4>o Social and economic forces (macrosocial): </h4>

<p> Processes that affect large social units such as nations or
communities. Examples include cultural practices related to
alcohol use and, in the United States, economic and social
processes surrounding the illegal markets in which psychoactive
drugs other than alcohol are sold. </p>

<h4>o Encounters between people (microsocial): </h4>

<p> Characteristics of encounters between people. Examples
include group drinking in settings where violence is expected and
socially acceptable; arguments that are begun or aggravated
because the participants are under the influence of drugs or
alcohol; and disputes involving organizations, buyers, and
sellers in illegal drug markets. </p>

<h4>o Psychosocial: </h4>

<p> Influences on individuals' behavior patterns, which begin
developing in early childhood and continue to evolve throughout
adulthood. Examples include patterns of heavy drinking and
aggression that develop during adolescence and psychoses that
predispose a few individuals toward violent psychotic episodes
while under the influence of certain drugs. </p>

<h4>o Neurobehavioral: </h4>

<p> Processes in the brain that underlie all human behavior and
that may be altered by pharmacological effects of alcohol and
other drugs. Examples include effects of substance abuse during
pregnancy on fetal development, effects of chronic substance
abuse on brain functioning, and temporary neurological effects of
being &quot;high&quot; or &quot;blue.&quot; </p>

<p> These and other examples of links at all four levels between
violence and alcohol or other drugs are displayed in table 1.
Much of the evidence for specific links is suggestive rather than
conclusive. One challenge in understanding and verifying the
links is the complexity of interactions among factors at
different levels. It would be difficult at best to sort out such
interactions. What makes the challenge even greater is that most
studies measure factors at only one or two levels at a time, so
that the full range of interactions is rarely observed in a
single study. In addition, it is difficult to study violent
events using methods that yield generalizable conclusions.
Controlled experiments under laboratory conditions produce the
strongest confirmation of factors that influence behavior, but
practical and ethical constraints generally limit those methods
to studies of behaviors that are far milder than the potentially
lethal violence that occurs in homes and communities. At present,
therefore, there are only fragments of scientific evidence
providing partial support for the existence of many causal links
between psychoactive substances and violence. These findings
neither explain definitively how the links interact nor provide a
basis for ranking them in order of importance in explaining
variation in violence related to alcohol or other drugs. </p>

<h5>Neurobehavioral explanations </h5>

<p> Research on humans and many animal species suggests there are
several neurobehavioral links between violence and psychoactive
substances: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Expectant mothers' use of psychoactive substances during
        pregnancy adversely affects fetal development. The
        resultant damage causes learning and communication
        problems that, in turn, increase the risk of early grade
        school failure, a well-documented precursor of violent
        behavior. </li>
    <li>Alcohol is the only psychoactive drug that in many
        individuals tends to increase aggressive behavior
        temporarily while it is taking effect. However, factors
        at other levels--behavior patterns when people are not
        drinking, the setting in which people drink, and local
        drinking customs, for example--influence the strength of
        this relationship. </li>
    <li>Among alcohol abusers, those who also abuse other
        psychoactive substances, who are diagnosed with
        antisocial personality disorder, and whose parents have
        been diagnosed as alcohol abusers are at especially high
        risk of chronic violent behavior. Some researchers have
        suggested that a genetic process may contribute to this
        relatively rare pattern. </li>
    <li>Marijuana and opiates temporarily inhibit violent
        behavior, but withdrawal from opiate addiction tends to
        exaggerate both aggressive and defensive responses to
        provocations. </li>
</ul>

<p> Individual humans and animals deviate widely from these
&quot;average&quot; behaviors. For example, the
aggression-promoting effects of alcohol are strongest in animals
having high blood levels of testosterone, the principal male
hormone that distinguishes males from females; humans may or may
not exhibit the same pattern. A study of violent Finnish alcohol
abusers suggests that the alcohol-violence link may be associated
with abnormally low levels of blood sugar (that is, hypoglycemia)
and of metabolites of the brain chemical serotonin. Another study
suggests that the alcohol-violence link is especially strong in
people who exhibit certain abnormal brain wave patterns, both at
rest and while responding to outside stresses. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h3>

<h3>Common Assumptions Called Into Question </h3>

<p> On the other hand, several common assumptions about
connections between drugs and violence are called into question
by research findings: </p>

<ul>
    <li>There is no evidence to support the claim that snorting
        or injecting cocaine stimulates violent behavior.
        However, research is urgently needed on the behavioral
        effects of smoking cocaine in crack form, which affects
        the brain more directly. </li>
    <li>Anecdotal reports notwithstanding, no research evidence
        supports the notion that becoming high on hallucinogens,
        amphetamines, or PCP stimulates violent behavior in any
        systematic manner. The anecdotes usually describe chronic
        users with histories of psychosis or antisocial behavior,
        which may or may not be related to their chronic use of
        drugs. </li>
    <li>Occasional anecdotes about &quot; 'roid
        rages&quot;--violent outbursts by men who use anabolic
        steroids to accelerate muscle growth--appear to describe
        isolated coincidences rather than any common, systematic
        effect. </li>
</ul>

<h3><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h3>

<h3>Psychosocial links </h3>

<p> Evidence from research on animals and humans indicates that
patterns of substance abuse and aggressive behavior reinforce
each other. It cannot be said that one &quot;causes&quot; the
other. For example, alcohol may trigger violent episodes in
aggressive animals and people, but rarely in submissive ones. </p>

<p> Patterns of aggressive behavior and substance abuse often
become intertwined starting in childhood. Early childhood
aggression is a predictor of later heavy drinking, and the
combination is associated with an above-average risk of adult
violent behavior, especially among those who also abuse other
psychoactive drugs. </p>

<p> Research suggests at least four possible explanations for the
link between substance abuse and violent behavior in adolescents.
First, adolescents may chronically use psychoactive substances to
help them temporarily escape from such feelings as rage, guilt,
worthlessness, or depression--emotions that often precede
aggressive behavior. Second, repeated family arguments over
teenage substance abuse may eventually take on a violent
character. Next, underlying family problems or socially expected
responses may lead some adolescent males to patterns of heavy
drinking and fighting as ways to demonstrate their masculinity.
Last, boys who regularly observe older males fighting while
drinking may learn to expect that violent behavior accompanies
alcohol use. All of these processes may be at work, but their
roles, interactions, and importance as explanations have not yet
been sorted out. </p>

<p> Preexisting psychosis appears to account for occasional
violent outbursts by people who are under the influence of
amphetamines or hallucinogens, especially PCP. While these drugs
are well known to cause disorganized, bizarre behavior, they
trigger violence in very few people who are not also psychotic.
In studies of laboratory mice and monkeys, bizarre behavior on
the part of animals under the influence of PCP fairly commonly
provokes violent attacks by others in the group. Anecdotal
information and newspaper accounts report similar attacks on
humans using alcohol, amphetamines, powdered cocaine, or LSD, but
this relationship has not been systematically studied in humans. </p>

<h4>Encounters between people </h4>

<p> In a variety of ways, alcohol and drugs modify encounters
between people in ways that make these substances greater hazards
for violence. In the case of alcohol, these hazards tend to be
related to use, while for illegal psychoactive drugs they tend to
be related to distribution and purchase. </p>

<p> Alcohol use and sexual violence. Some therapists who treat
violent sex offenders have reported that their patients tend to
have both histories of alcohol abuse and high blood levels of
testosterone. Without comparisons to men who are not violent sex
offenders, these clinical observations cannot demonstrate that
alcohol abuse or high testosterone levels cause sexual violence.
Studies of many animal species suggest a causal connection--that
alcohol reduces testosterone levels but has stronger
aggression-promoting effects in individual high-testosterone
animals. However, that relationship has not yet been tested in
humans. The frequent involvement of alcohol in acquaintance rapes
suggests that social expectations may also be at work; that is,
young men who expect to have sex after drinking may try to
satisfy their expectations, sometimes forcibly if they encounter
resistance. </p>

<p> Illegal drug markets. Illegal drug markets operate outside
the world of contract law, courts and mediators for resolving
disputes, and business customs that distinguish socially
acceptable from unac- ceptable approaches to buying and selling.
Illegal markets often develop substitute mechanisms that involve
the threat or actual use of violence. Examples include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Violence by drug distributors in the course of
        territorial disputes between rival organizations, threats
        of violence to make &quot;staff&quot; obey organizational
        rules, violent punishment of rulebreakers to keep the
        threats credible, battles with police, and protection of
        sellers or drugs on the street. </li>
    <li>Violence between buyer and seller during a drug
        transaction, caused, for example, by attempted robbery of
        one or the other, failure to hand over drugs or money, or
        &quot;honest&quot; misunderstandings of local rules of
        the game on the part of buyers and sellers. </li>
    <li>Violence involving people other than buyers and sellers
        who are found around drug markets--third parties such as
        innocent bystanders and people operating in related
        illegal markets for &quot;protection,&quot; guns, or
        prostitution. </li>
</ul>

<p> As places where violence tends to occur for the reasons
listed above, illegal drug markets may also serve as
&quot;magnets.&quot; As such, they attract valuable drugs and
cash, weapons, and people who are accustomed to violence. The mix
of these ingredients creates hazardous conditions for robberies
and other forms of violence that may not be directly related to
drugs. </p>

<p> Obtaining drug purchase money. In some settings, the need for
money to buy drugs also increases the chance of a violent
encounter. A taxi driver carrying a passenger late at night, for
example, is presumably at greater risk of being robbed if the
passenger wants to buy drugs but lacks the cash to do so. While
robbery is still a common way to obtain money to buy drugs, it
has been replaced by drug selling in some large cities. </p>

<p> Using alcohol and drugs. If alcohol caused violence only by
making individuals behave more aggressively, violence would be
equally common in all places where drinking occurs. In fact,
however, most drinking places are rarely scenes of violence. A
few acquire reputations as &quot;animal houses&quot; or
&quot;fighting bars,&quot; where people expect drinking and
violence to go hand in hand. </p>

<p> Just what characteristics of a drinking place make it a
hazard for violence are not precisely known, but there is
supporting evidence for several possible explanations. People who
drink in fighting bars may behave violently in order to &quot;fit
in&quot; or to advance socially. People who experience anger or
frustration may seek out such settings, because they believe that
drinking in these types of establishments means social permission
to engage in violent behavior. One study of a group of young men
who were observed during an evening of drinking illustrates this
by suggesting that behavior patterns and situational influences
may play off each other. As the evening progressed, the group
began both to behave more aggressively and to move on to
establishments where aggressive behavior was more socially
acceptable. </p>

<p> Connections between drinking and violence have been
identified by researchers in many countries with predominantly
European cultures. But they have not been found in many tribal
and folk societies, even where binge drinking is common. For
reasons not yet known, expectations that violence follows
drinking have failed to develop in those cultures. </p>

<p> Finally, it seems likely that substance abuse is indirectly
related to violence in ways that are difficult to identify and
count. Examples of indirect relationships include robberies
committed to replace household money spent on drugs or alcohol,
or spouse assaults arising from disputes over money or time spent
away from home drinking or taking drugs. </p>

<p> Violence is related to the distribution, purchase, and use of
illegal drugs or alcohol in a wide variety of human interactions.
Unfortunately, the difficulty of counting such interactions makes
it also difficult to rank them in order of importance. Better
counts would help in focusing violence prevention strategies on
the most common interactions in which drug- and alcohol-related
violence occurs. </p>

<h3>Social and economic forces </h3>

<p> If the patterns of behavior discussed above were the only
links between illegal drug distribution and violence, every city
that experienced a crack epidemic in the 1980's would also have
seen a substantial increase in homicide at the same time. Indeed,
policymakers have occasionally claimed a &quot;uniform, straight
line relationship&quot; between illegal drug use and murder.4 </p>

<p> The reality is more complex. The murder rate increased 350
percent in Washington, D.C., and by a smaller amount in New York
City as their crack epidemics unfolded. However, during the crack
epidemics in Detroit and Los Angeles these cities experienced
decreases in the murder rate. This suggests that the
relationships between illegal drug market activity and lethal
violence are intertwined with social and economic processes in
the surrounding community. </p>

<p> What are these processes? Because causal patterns at the
social level are especially difficult to establish, the answers
are necessarily speculative. Fragments of evidence suggest that
some or all of the following factors may influence the
relationship between levels of violence and illegal drug market
activity: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Stability of drug market control: Situations that produce
        violent encounters--fights over territorial allocations
        or misunderstandings between buyers and sellers, for
        example--arose relatively infrequently in markets
        controlled by old, stable organizations that had
        developed operating rules decades ago and enforced them
        through a standing threat to punish violators violently.
        Where the spread of crack manufacturing technology
        encouraged new organizations to enter the markets, the
        resulting destabilization may temporarily have increased
        the frequency of violent encounters. </li>
    <li>Community access to legitimate economic opportunities:
        Where the rise of crack markets followed the exodus of
        legitimate economic opportunities from central cities,
        economic rewards shifted away from skills valued by
        legitimate employers to those valued by crack
        distribution organizations; these included the ability to
        threaten and use violence. </li>
    <li>Strength of informal violence controls: Where the exodus
        of legitimate economic opportunities from urban
        communities took with it many people committed to legal,
        nonviolent values, those people were no longer available
        for roles in preventing drug-related violence. They were
        not available, for example, as nonviolent role models for
        adolescents, as passers-by who might discourage drug
        buyers or intervene in emerging violent events, or as
        concerned individuals who might inform parents if their
        children began drifting toward involvement in drug
        markets. </li>
    <li>Social status and moral authority: During crack epidemics
        in some communities, successful young drug entrepreneurs
        either supplanted or intimidated neighborhood &quot;old
        heads&quot;--unofficial community leaders who upheld
        traditional values and had exercised moral authority in
        the neighborhood. Where this occurred, it tended to
        weaken cultural restraints against violence in all
        contexts, including drug markets. </li>
</ul>

<p> Because such relationships are difficult to verify, evidence
supporting their influence is only suggestive and fragmentary,
and new research is needed to explore them more fully. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>Preventive interventions </h2>

<p> A number of intervention strategies for preventing violence
related to psychoactive substances have been proposed: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Police disruption of illegal drug markets. </li>
    <li>Selectively longer incarceration of violent drug-using
        criminals. </li>
    <li>Reducing teenagers' access to alcohol. </li>
    <li>Substance abuse prevention. </li>
    <li>Drug abuse treatment. </li>
    <li>Pharmacological therapies to reduce drug craving and
        aggressive tendencies associated with alcohol use and
        heroin addiction. </li>
</ul>

<p> Some of these strategies have been evaluated to test their
effectiveness in reducing violence. Only a few have demonstrated
success under any conditions; none have shown universal
effectiveness. Developing better interventions will require
collaborative problem-solving initiatives that involve
representatives of criminal justice agencies, providers of
substance abuse treatment and other social services, and
evaluation researchers. These initiatives are needed to turn
promising ideas into workable programs, to evaluate the programs,
and to refine them in light of the evaluation results. The
findings of evaluations conducted thus far are summarized in the
following sections. </p>

<p> <strong>Disrupting illegal drug markets.</strong> Police
attack illegal drug markets through a number of tactics:
undercover investigations leading to dealers' arrests;
cooperation with community antidrug efforts; and large-scale,
high-visibility crackdowns. Evaluations of these tactics in
Birmingham, Alabama; Lawrence and Lynn, Massachusetts; New York
City; Oakland, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and
Washington, D.C., present a mixed picture. Perhaps the strongest
supportable statement is that their chance of success is improved
by intervening early in emerging markets, by creating a highly
committed police force, and by generating community receptivity
and cooperation in advance. NIJ's Drug Market Analysis (DMA)
program is helping with the first prerequisite--early detection
of drug markets. Specific techniques for creating supportive
climates in police departments and the surrounding communities
are less well understood, although many approaches are now being
tested as part of community policing initiatives. </p>

<p> <strong>Incarcerating violent drug-using criminals. </strong>Researchers
have generally found that compared to other violent offenders,
those who use drugs tend to have higher average frequencies of
violent crimes such as robbery and assault. This finding raises
the possibility that sentencing drug-involved offenders who are
convicted of these crimes to longer prison terms might reduce
violence. However, analyses suggest that this strategy of
&quot;selective incapacitation&quot; would reduce violent crime
levels very little unless it were accompanied by massive
increases in prison populations. </p>

<p> <strong>A related strategy--monitoring pretrial releasees'
drug use through urinalysis</strong>--showed rather surprising
effects in a Washington, D.C., evaluation. Although positive drug
test results did not predict significantly higher pretrial
rearrest rates, failure to show up for the test was a strong
predictor of subsequent new crimes leading to rearrest. </p>

<p> <strong>Reducing teenagers' access to alcohol.</strong>
Evidence is fairly clear that increases in tax rates and other
measures that reduce the availability of alcohol to adolescents
(social pressure and enforcement of underage drinking laws) in
turn reduce drinking and certain associated problems such as
death rates due to auto collisions. Therefore, these strategies
may also reduce adolescents' disproportionate share of violence.
That conjecture remains to be tested, however. </p>

<p> <strong>Substance abuse prevention. </strong>By reducing the
demand that fuels violent, illegal drug markets, substance abuse
prevention should, in theory, reduce violence levels. Many
substance abuse prevention programs have been evaluated,
including the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE), which
brings police officers into classrooms as instructors.
Evaluations of prevention programs have generally found them
effective in delaying the onset of tobacco, alcohol, and
marijuana use. Evaluations have not generally found that
education succeeds in preventing use of &quot;harder&quot; drugs,
perhaps because use of those drugs was rare even in the control
groups that did not receive preventive education. However, to the
extent that minor drugs are &quot;stepping stones&quot; to the
harder ones,5 the programs may have meaningful, yet delayed,
effects for violence reduction. </p>

<p> <strong>Prevention</strong> may have an especially important
role to play for one category of adolescents--males whose
behavior meets diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality
disorder and whose parents abuse alcohol. Research indicates that
these two factors, coupled with both alcohol and drug abuse,
create a high-risk profile for violent behavior in adulthood. </p>

<p> <strong>Drug abuse treatment</strong>. Successful drug
treatment programs reduce criminal activity among adult clients.
For drug abusers who are not in prison, stays of at least 3
months in therapeutic communities reduce the tendency to commit
crime after discharge. Up to about 18 months, longer stays in the
therapeutic community produce greater reductions. </p>

<p> For drug abusers in prison, treatment usually involves only
individual or group sessions a few times a week with no
postrelease followup. Evaluations of this approach have not found
it sufficient to reduce criminal behavior following release.
However, a more intensive approach--combining inprison
therapeutic communities, planning for postrelease treatment, and
postrelease treatment in the community--reduces overall rearrest
rates of inmates who complete the program. At least three
programs have used this approach: Stay 'n Out (in a New York
prison), Cornerstone (in the Oregon State Hospital), and the
California Civil Addict Program. </p>

<p> In addition to these beneficial effects of drug treatment on
offenders' behavior, successful treatment may reduce aggregate
levels of violence related to drug markets by lowering the demand
that fuels the markets. Such an effect would, however, be
difficult to measure. </p>

<p> <strong>Pharmacological interventions.</strong> Like other
forms of drug treatment, pharmacological therapies that reduce
drug craving may also lower the demand that supports violent drug
markets. For decades, methadone and related chemicals have been
used to reduce craving for heroin. There is no analogue to
methadone for treating addiction to cocaine in powdered or
smokable form. However, using animals as test subjects,
researchers have identified the receptors for certain subtypes of
two brain chemicals, dopamine and norepinephrine, as promising
sites to begin developing such medications. Animal research also
suggests neurochemical starting points for developing medications
that reduce violence in other ways: by disrupting the
aggression-promoting effects of alcohol and by preventing
aggression during withdrawal from heroin addiction. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>

<p> Too few of the links between violence and psychoactive
substances have been established with enough certainty to
advocate a comprehensive national policy for preventing violence
related to those substances. Instead, a program of testing and
evaluating tactics for implementing a variety of promising
strategies is called for. Among these strategies, criminal
justice agencies have particular roles in developing and testing
tactics to disrupt illegal drug markets, in monitoring drug use
of pretrial releasees, in establishing drug abuse treatment for
convicted criminals, and in creating effective substance abuse
prevention programs. Fulfilling these roles will require
cooperation between the criminal justice system and drug
treatment, prevention, and education authorities. Eventually,
efforts to prevent drug-related violence may be assisted by
pharmacological therapies to reduce the aggression-promoting
effects of alcohol and the craving for other psychoactive drugs. </p>

<h2>Notes </h2>

<p> 1. Among studies of this relationship, many group all illegal
drugs together. Those that distinguish among drugs usually list
cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, barbiturates, and hallucinogens
other than marijuana. See, for example, Elliott, D.S., and D.
Huizinga, The Relationship Between Delinquent Behavior and ADM
[Alcohol, Drug, and Mental Health] Problems, National Youth
Survey Report No. 26. Boulder, Colorado: Behavioral Research
Institute, 1984. </p>

<p> 3. The DUF program uses urinalysis to confirm self-reports.
The urine specimens are tested for cocaine, opiates, marijuana,
PCP, methadone, benzodiazepine (Valium), methaqualone,
propoxyphene (Darvon), barbiturates, and amphetamines. Samples
are collected at the time of arrest on a voluntary basis; an
average of 80 percent of arrestees voluntarily cooperate. Test
criteria are set to detect use of most drugs in the preceding 24
to 48 hours, but marijuana and PCP can be detected in the urine
several weeks after use. </p>

<p> 5. Until recently, research on developmental pathways
consistently found these drugs to be &quot;gateways&quot; or
&quot;stepping stones&quot; to cocaine use. Preliminary findings,
presented after the Panel completed its report, suggest that
since the New York City &quot;crack epidemic&quot; of the early
1980's, crack-using youth in increasing numbers are skipping the
gateway drugs and starting directly with crack. </p>

<p> Author's Biography </p>

<p> Dr. Jeffrey A. Roth served as study director for the Panel on
the Under-standing and Control of Violent Behavior. Currently he
is research director in the Bethesda, Maryland, office of the Law
and Public Policy area of Abt Associates, Inc. </p>

<p> Sidebar 1 </p>

<p> Panel on the Understanding and Control of Violent Behavior </p>

<p> Violence is universally recognized as a pervasive part of
contemporary American society and of our Nation's past as well.
Many of the attempts to understand the phenomenon have been made
in response to specific situations, such as the lawlessness of
the Prohibition era, the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, and the urban riots of the mid-1960's. Other attempts at
understanding violence singled out particular causes for
analysis. In none of these studies, however, was the full body of
research on violence reviewed comprehensively, and none of them
took an interdisciplinary approach. </p>

<p> The Panel on the Understanding and Control of Violent
Behavior was set up to meet the need for a more comprehensive
assessment of what is known about violent behavior. It was
established in response to a request made by three Federal
agencies: the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National
Institute of Justice (NIJ), and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC). NSF asked for a review of current knowledge
about the causes of violent behavior and recommendations for
future research. The other two agencies shared these goals, but
their areas of interest reflected their particular missions. As
the research arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, NIJ wanted to
find out about means to prevent and control violent crime. The
CDC wanted assistance in setting priorities for preventing
injuries and deaths caused by violence. </p>

<p> Created in 1989, the panel reviewed research on
&quot;interpersonal violence&quot;--events involving at most a
few perpetrators and victims. This limitation excluded suicide
and self-mutilation as well as large-scale collective and State
violence. The focus was on describing, understanding, and
controlling violence in the United States. Research in
biomedical, psychological, and other social sciences was
reviewed. The work of the panel was intended both to help guide
future research and evaluation projects aimed at prevention and
control and to suggest strategic directions for violence control
policy. </p>

<p> The findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the panel
were published in Volume 1 of Understanding and Preventing
Violence, published by the National Academy Press. Three volumes
of background papers commissioned by the panel are forthcoming.
The panel concluded that numerous, often interacting factors give
rise to violent events. Although the underlying interactions are
not well understood, attention to the factors suggests many
promising preventive interventions. Testing and evaluating these
interventions creates opportunities to prevent particular types
of violence while gaining better understanding of them. The panel
made recommendations in a number of areas, among them development
of problem-solving initiatives to control and understand
violence; better statistical systems for measuring violence; and
a program of research to identify underlying causes. This
Research in Brief is one of a series that summarizes the panel's
findings. </p>

<p> NIJ is committed to implementing the recommendations of the
panel. Its commitment has begun through support for the Program
on Human Development and Criminal Behavior, a longitudinal,
multicommunity research project that is exploring the factors
associated with violence. In addition, the panel's
recommendations have helped shape the goals of NIJ research and
evaluation activities and its long-range plans for research. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 1 </p>

<p> INTRODUCTION </p>

<p> Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) is currently the
Nation's predominant school-based drug prevention program, and
both its prevalence and popularity continue to expand. The
D.A.R.E. program, designed to prevent students' use of tobacco,
alcohol, and other drugs, uses trained, uniformed police officers
in the classroom to teach a highly structured curriculum.
Developed by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los
Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) as a collaborative
venture, the primary or core D.A.R.E. curriculum is directed
toward pupils in the final grade of elementary school (usually
grade 5 or 6). Additional curricula for students in kindergarten
through fourth grade, junior high school, senior high school, and
for parents have been developed and implemented. </p>

<p> Purpose of the Study </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s popularity, as demonstrated by the extraordinary
growth in its rate of dissemination and by abundant anecdotal
reports of its success, is self-evident. In part because of its
preeminent position, policymakers, researchers, educators, and
parents are asking a number of fundamental questions about the
program: </p>

<p> o How effective is D.A.R.E. in preventing drug use? </p>

<p> o What are D.A.R.E.'s effects compared with those of other
school-based drug prevention programs? </p>

<p> o What are some of the basic features common to most D.A.R.E.
programs? </p>

<p> o Who usually manages the D.A.R.E. program? </p>

<p> o How extensively is D.A.R.E. implemented nationwide? </p>

<p> o How do other alcohol and drug prevention programs compare
with D.A.R.E. and D.A.R.E. with them? </p>

<p> To address these and other questions, the National Institute
of Justice (NIJ) awarded the research team of the Research
Triangle Institute (RTI) and the University of Kentucky's Center
for Prevention Research (CPR) a grant to conduct an extensive
review of the D.A.R.E. program and to assess its place within the
context of the broad spectrum of school-based drug prevention
efforts. </p>

<p> Study Objectives </p>

<p> The research team proposed and carried out two distinct types
of assessments, the first pertaining to implementation and the
second to outcomes or effectiveness. The primary objectives of
the implementation assessment were to </p>

<p> o assess the organizational structure and operation of
representative D.A.R.E. programs nationwide; </p>

<p> o review and assess factors that contribute to the effective
implementation of D.A.R.E. programs nationwide; and </p>

<p> o assess how D.A.R.E. and other school-based drug prevention
programs are tailored to meet the needs of specific populations. </p>

<p> The first two objectives for the implementation assessment
relate exclusively to D.A.R.E. The third targets D.A.R.E. but
also includes other drug use prevention programs. </p>

<p> The primary objectives of the outcome assessment were to </p>

<p> o identify all outcome evaluations of D.A.R.E.'s core
curriculum conducted to date in the United States and Canada; </p>

<p> o assess the methodological rigor of those evaluations; </p>

<p> o examine the nature and extent of the effects of D.A.R.E.'s
core curriculum; and </p>

<p> o compare the effectiveness of D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum
with that of other school-based drug use prevention programs
targeting 5th- and 6th-grade pupils. </p>

<p> Although the first three objectives of the outcome assessment
focus exclusively on D.A.R.E., the fourth places D.A.R.E. in a
larger context by comparing it with other drug prevention
programs. </p>

<p> In this report, we synthesize the most important findings
from both of the assessments and present overall conclusions, and
some recommendations. </p>

<p> Description of the Study </p>

<p> To achieve the study's goals and objectives, the research
team designed a set of research strategies that would yield data
pertinent not only to a review and critique of D.A.R.E., but also
to an assessment of how D.A.R.E. compares with other school-based
drug prevention programs, and of future directions for these
programs. </p>

<p> For the implementation assessment, we collected original data
by conducting </p>

<p> o informal interviews and discussions with the coordinators
and/or educational advisors of D.A.R.E.'s Regional Training
Centers (RTCs); </p>

<p> o a survey of State D.A.R.E. coordinators; and </p>

<ul>
    <li>a survey of drug prevention coordinators in a
        representative, stratified sample of school districts
        that included districts with and without D.A.R.E. </li>
    <li>We also conducted site visits to two pairs of schools
        (one school in each pair had D.A.R.E. and the other did
        not). We discuss the methodologies used for each
        component of the implementation assessment in Section II
        of this report. </li>
</ul>

<p> For the outcome assessment, the research team conducted a
review and assessment of the published and unpublished
evaluations of D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum conducted to date. We
collected no primary data, but instead studied prior D.A.R.E.
evaluations using meta- analytic techniques. The methodologies we
used for the outcome assessment are presented in Section III of
this report. </p>

<p> At the conclusion of our data collection and analysis
efforts, the research team joined Tom Colthurst of the University
of California at San Diego Extension Program in March 1993 to
host a conference in San Diego, California, titled
&quot;Evaluating School-Linked Prevention Strategies Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Other Drugs.&quot; Almost an entire day of this
3-day conference for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners
centered on the preliminary results from this study. This
conference provided an opportunity to disseminate early study
findings from both the implementation and outcome assessments,
and to incorporate participants' responses (including responses
from D.A.R.E. America as well as D.A.R.E. and other drug
prevention researchers) to the findings in this final report. </p>

<p> Strengths and Limitations of the Study </p>

<p> We believe our approach to this study was fully responsive to
NIJ's solicitation. Among the many strengths of this approach are
the following: </p>

<p> o a multifaceted study methodology that collected information
from the national, regional, State, and school district levels of
D.A.R.E. and reviewed all short- term evaluations of the D.A.R.E.
core curricula conducted to date; </p>

<p> o a rigorous examination and synthesis of the results of
previous evaluations of D.A.R.E.; and </p>

<p> o incorporation into this final report of both formal and
informal feedback from researchers and practitioners attending
the dissemination conference. </p>

<p> However, we recognize that there are limitations to our
study, due primarily to limitations in the resources available to
us. For example, our study budget would not allow us to survey
local D.A.R.E. officers and classroom teachers, or monitor the
delivery of D.A.R.E. in the classroom. Additionally, some
questions raised in NIJ's solicitation, such as issues relating
to the effectiveness of the regional and State D.A.R.E. training
centers, could be answered only in part. A complete answer would
have required a many-layered study that examined training
centers' objectives, how these objectives are put into effect
through training received both by trainers and by D.A.R.E.
officers, and ultimately how the officers perform in the
classroom. This was clearly outside the scope of this study. We
also were limited in assessing certain questions, such as
variability in effectiveness of the D.A.R.E. curriculum by the
sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents because of
the lack of research in this area (see Chapter 8 for further
details). </p>

<p> Given the level of resources available for this study, the
research design required some compromises among the multiple
objectives invoked in NIJ's stated purposes, goals, objectives,
and program strategies. </p>

<p> However, the research team believes that the study represents
an optimal mix of data collection methods and sources.
Discussions with members of the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory
Board and other officials associated with the D.A.R.E. training
centers, when combined with information gathered from the survey
of State D.A.R.E. coordinators, provided answers to the questions
relating specifically to the structure and operations of the
D.A.R.E. program. The survey of school district drug prevention
coordinators yielded information about D.A.R.E. and its
relationship to other school-based drug prevention programs. The
site visits provided an illustrative, if unrepresentative,
snapshot of D.A.R.E.'s implementation in two schools. A rigorous
examination of past D.A.R.E. evaluations provided information on
the effects of the program on students. </p>

<p> Overview of the Report </p>

<p> This report is organized into four sections and four
appendices. Section I contains the first two chapters, which
provide an overview and history of school-based drug prevention
programs, with detailed information about the curricula and
teachers of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Section II has four chapters that present the methodologies
and results of each of the four components of the implementation
assessment. In these four chapters, we present information about
the national/regional-level operations of D.A.R.E. (Chapter 3),
State-level operations of D.A.R.E. (Chapter 4), and the
implementation of D.A.R.E. and other drug prevention programs at
the local level (Chapters 5 and 6). </p>

<p> Section III (Chapter 7) presents the methodology and results
of the outcome assessment. In Section IV (Chapter 8), we
synthesize and discuss findings from both the implementation and
outcome assessments, and present recommendations. </p>

<p> Appendix A contains sampling information for the school
district drug prevention coordinators survey. </p>

<p> Appendix B contains descriptions of each study utilized in
the meta-analysis conducted for the outcome assessment. Appendix
C presents a bibliography of comparison program evaluations, and
Appendix D contains data collection materials for the
implementation assessment. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 2 </p>

<p> OVERVIEW AND HISTORY OF SCHOOL-BASED DRUG PREVENTION PROGRAMS
AND D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> History of School-Based Drug Prevention Programs School-based
educational programs are the most common approach to drug
prevention aimed at young people. </p>

<p> Prevention efforts are located in educational settings </p>

<p> both because drug use typically begins during adolescence </p>

<p> and because classrooms provide the best opportunity for </p>

<p> reaching a large number of youth simultaneously.=20 </p>

<p> Although rates of drug use among U.S. students generally </p>

<p> have been declining over the past few years (University </p>

<p> of Michigan, 1994), these rates are still higher than </p>

<p> rates of all other Western industrialized nations. =20 </p>

<p> The U.S. Congress reacted to concerns about youth </p>

<p> drug use by enacting the Drug-Free Schools and </p>

<p> Communities Act (DFSCA) of 1986. The DFSCA was designed </p>

<p> to establish programs of drug abuse education and </p>

<p> prevention throughout the Nation. A key part of the </p>

<p> DFSCA is Subtitle B of Title IV, which provides Federal </p>

<p> money to States, schools, and communities to initiate or </p>

<p> expand drug prevention programs. Actions resulting from </p>

<p> Subtitle B of Title IV quickly resulted in the single </p>

<p> largest drug prevention activity offered by the Federal </p>

<p> Government, reaching $498,565,000 in FY 1993.=20 </p>

<p> Research conducted by RTI staff concerning the </p>

<p> implementation of State and local programs of the DFSCA </p>

<p> found that in the 1988-1989 school year all 50 States, </p>

<p> the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto </p>

<p> Rico have actively participated in programs funded by the </p>

<p> DFSCA at the State and local levels. Of all the school </p>

<p> districts in the Nation, 78% reported that they received </p>

<p> DFSCA funding, either directly or through regional or </p>

<p> county education organizations (Thorne, Holley, Wine, </p>

<p> Hayward, &amp; Ringwalt, 1991). </p>

<p> The DFSCA funds appear to have had a positive </p>

<p> effect on the school-based prevention programs of school </p>

<p> districts. To be eligible for DFSCA funding, schools </p>

<p> must implement a comprehensive drug prevention program.=20 </p>

<p> More than half of the districts receiving DFSCA funding </p>

<p> A total of 25% of these districts had increased their </p>

<p> curriculum development activities, and 48% had increased </p>

<p> their degree of involvement with other groups in the </p>

<p> community. The availability of DFSCA funds may be more </p>

<p> limited in the future. </p>

<p> Drug Use Prevention Strategies </p>

<p> A variety of school-based intervention programs </p>

<p> have been developed over the past three decades for </p>

<p> preventing drug use among youth (Botvin, 1990; Flay, </p>

<p> 1985; Hansen, 1992; Moskowitz, Malvin, Schaeffer, &amp; </p>

<p> Schaps, 1983; Tobler, 1986). The types of programs </p>

<p> differ both in terms of what they teach as well as in how </p>

<p> they are taught (Tobler, in press, 1994). Program </p>

<p> content generally reflects assumptions about why young </p>

<p> people use drugs. For example, activities to boost self- </p>

<p> esteem reflect the belief that low self-esteem is a risk </p>

<p> factor for drug use; strategies that teach youth how to </p>

<p> refuse offers of drugs from friends assume that peer </p>

<p> pressure leads to drug use. Similarly, teaching methods </p>

<p> implemented in various strategies reflect beliefs about </p>

<p> the most effective means for teaching young people not to </p>

<p> use drugs. Programs that use didactic methods reflect a </p>

<p> traditional expert model for learning; programs that </p>

<p> emphasize group activities reflect the belief that </p>

<p> participatory activities enhance understanding and </p>

<p> learning more effectively. </p>

<p> Although hundreds of individual school-based </p>

<p> prevention programs have been developed, they generally </p>

<p> fall into three broad categories:=20 </p>

<p> (a) knowledge/information programs, (b) affective </p>

<p> programs, and (c) social influences programs. A fourth </p>

<p> category of prevention programs, alternative programs, </p>

<p> includes those usually offered outside the school </p>

<p> setting. Knowledge/information and affective education </p>

<p> programs have sometimes been grouped together as more </p>

<p> traditional approaches, while social influences programs </p>

<p> represent newer approaches (Bruvold, 1993; Tobler, in </p>

<p> press, 1994). These three types of programs tend to </p>

<p> differ in content, in methods, and in their </p>

<p> effectiveness. Even so, there is overlap among them. </p>

<p> Knowledge/information programs were the earliest </p>

<p> school-based prevention efforts to be developed. These </p>

<p> strategies are based on the assumption that youth begin </p>

<p> using drugs because they are not sufficiently </p>

<p> knowledgeable about adverse consequences. Once youth </p>

<p> have adequate and accurate knowledge about drugs, it is </p>

<p> assumed that they will behave rationally and choose not </p>

<p> to use drugs. It is also assumed that changes in </p>

<p> knowledge about drugs will promote more negative </p>

<p> attitudes toward drug use, which in turn will be a </p>

<p> deterrent to using drugs. Knowledge programs typically </p>

<p> present factual information about the legal, biological, </p>

<p> and psychological effects of drug use. Some of these </p>

<p> programs have adopted scare tactics to present the risks </p>

<p> of drug use to youth in a dramatic fashion. The methods </p>

<p> used by knowledge/information programs typically include </p>

<p> didactic presentations, discussion, and audiovisual </p>

<p> presentations. </p>

<p> Affective programs were developed in the late 1970s </p>

<p> and early 1980s and are based on the assumption that </p>

<p> young people use drugs because of personal and social </p>

<p> deficits. These programs emphasize increasing self- </p>

<p> esteem, enhancing self-awareness, clarifying values, </p>

<p> making responsible decisions, and improving interpersonal </p>

<p> skills. Affective programs often do not mention drug use </p>

<p> at all. By enriching personal and social development, it </p>

<p> is assumed that youth will make responsible decisions </p>

<p> about drug use. These programs typically are taught by </p>

<p> the same types of methods as for knowledge/ information </p>

<p> programs, but they also may include group activities. </p>

<p> Social influences programs are the most recent </p>

<p> approach to drug use among youth. These programs are </p>

<p> based on the assumption that youth use drugs because they </p>

<p> do not have the social competencies needed to resist </p>

<p> social pressures to use drugs. Some programs focus </p>

<p> specifically on teaching youth the skills needed for </p>

<p> resisting drug use influences. Other programs emphasize </p>

<p> developing more general social competencies, such as </p>

<p> increasing decisionmaking, improving communication, and </p>

<p> reducing anxiety, in addition to enhancing drug-specific </p>

<p> social skills. They may also include activities to </p>

<p> correct misperceptions about the prevalence and </p>

<p> acceptability of drug use among peers, as well as </p>

<p> activities that seek to establish conservative group </p>

<p> norms about drug use. Social influences programs </p>

<p> typically include active, participatory learning </p>

<p> experiences, such as modeling, role-playing, and </p>

<p> practicing behavioral skills. Social influence </p>

<p> strategies also frequently and actively involve &quot;peers </p>

<p> leaders&quot; as teachers, in role-playing, or to facilitate </p>

<p> discussion. </p>

<p> Despite the differences across program categories, </p>

<p> there is actually much overlap among school-based </p>

<p> prevention programs in their components. Affective </p>

<p> programs share similarities with some social influences </p>

<p> programs in their emphasis, for example, on developing </p>

<p> personal competencies. Social influences programs </p>

<p> frequently include information about drugs and adverse </p>

<p> consequences. Some programs include elements of all </p>

<p> three categories of programs and have been labeled </p>

<p> comprehensive programs. Indeed, many school-based </p>

<p> curricula, including D.A.R.E., combine strategies that </p>

<p> reflect knowledge/information, affective, and social </p>

<p> influences programs. </p>

<p> Research on the effectiveness of school-based </p>

<p> prevention programs suggests that all three program </p>

<p> strategies are not equally successful in preventing </p>

<p> adolescent drug use (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold, 1993; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Knowledge/information </p>

<p> programs generally have not been effective in preventing </p>

<p> drug use among youth. The evidence suggests that, </p>

<p> although information-based programs may increase </p>

<p> students' knowledge of drugs, they are unlikely to result </p>

<p> in positive changes in either attitudes or behavior. In </p>

<p> fact, some research indicates that these programs may </p>

<p> lead to undesirable changes in attitudes (Bruvold &amp; </p>

<p> Rundall, 1988). Affective strategies also have not </p>

<p> performed well in previous evaluations and meta-analyses </p>

<p> (Botvin, 1990; Tobler, 1986). For example, Hansen, </p>

<p> Johnson, Flay, Graham, and Sobel (1988) found that </p>

<p> students who received an affective education program </p>

<p> reported significantly more drug use than students in a </p>

<p> comparison group and that these differences increased </p>

<p> over time. In contrast, the results of evaluation of </p>

<p> social influences programs have been generally more </p>

<p> positive (Botvin, 1990; Bruvold, 1993, 1986; Bruvold &amp; </p>

<p> Rundall, 1988; Flay, 1985; Hansen, 1992; Moskowitz, 1989; </p>

<p> Pentz et al., 1989; Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). In </p>

<p> comparison with knowledge/information and affective </p>

<p> programs, social influences programs have been more </p>

<p> effective at preventing adolescent drug use. </p>

<p> History of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is a school-based drug prevention program </p>

<p> designed to prevent students' use of tobacco, alcohol, </p>

<p> and other drugs. Most D.A.R.E. activities are directed </p>

<p> toward pupils in the last grade of elementary school </p>

<p> (grade 5 or 6), which is thought to be the age at which </p>

<p> youth are most receptive to an anti-drug message, and </p>

<p> before they begin experimenting with drugs (Bureau of </p>

<p> Justice Assistance [BJA], 1991b). The original D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum, which was implemented in 1983, was </p>

<p> developed by Dr. Ruth Rich, health education specialist </p>

<p> from the LAUSD. Dr. Rich based the D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum on a review of other prevalent drug prevention </p>

<p> programs, particularly Project SMART (Self-Management and </p>

<p> Resistance Training), a prevention program designed by </p>

<p> the Health Behavior Research Institute of the University </p>

<p> of Southern California. =20 </p>

<p> From its inception, D.A.R.E. was designed to be a </p>

<p> continuing education program for kindergarten through </p>

<p> high school. To that end, junior high and senior high </p>

<p> curricula were developed in 1986 and 1988, respectively.=20 </p>

<p> Additionally, D.A.R.E. designers created a parent </p>

<p> curriculum to teach parents how to recognize and prevent </p>

<p> drug use among youth and to provide them with information </p>

<p> about the program. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is distinctive among school-based drug </p>

<p> prevention programs in that it uses trained, uniformed </p>

<p> police officers in the classroom to teach a highly </p>

<p> structured curriculum. D.A.R.E. officers enter the </p>

<p> classroom not only because of a cooperative agreement </p>

<p> between the local school district and law enforcement </p>

<p> agency, but also because the community is willing to </p>

<p> forgo or replace the time that D.A.R.E. officers lose to </p>

<p> other police duties. During D.A.R.E.'s first year, 1983- </p>

<p> 1984, 10 officers taught the curriculum to around 8,000 </p>

<p> students in 50 Los Angeles elementary schools (BJA, </p>

<p> 1991a). D.A.R.E. is now widely implemented throughout </p>

<p> the Nation and parts of Europe and Asia. According to </p>

<p> the BJA (1991b), some 6 million students in the United </p>

<p> States received D.A.R.E. in the 1991-1992 school year, </p>

<p> and D.A.R.E. is currently implemented in 8,000 cities </p>

<p> across the Nation (Glenn Levant, personal communication).=20 </p>

<p> Indeed, the D.A.R.E. workbooks are currently available in </p>

<p> Japanese, Vietnamese, Spanish, and Braille. In addition, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. has been adopted by several governmental </p>

<p> agencies that sponsor schools, including the Department </p>

<p> of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the </p>

<p> Capitol police, the National Park Service, and all </p>

<p> overseas branches of the Department of Defense. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. combines an essentially local, grass-roots </p>

<p> effort with a high degree of centralized program control </p>

<p> asserted by coordinating mechanisms at the national, </p>

<p> regional, and State levels. At the national level, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America assumes the primary responsibility for </p>

<p> implementing and managing D.A.R.E., assisted by five RTCs </p>

<p> that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board.=20 </p>

<p> A detailed examination of the roles of national, </p>

<p> regional, and State D.A.R.E. organizations is presented </p>

<p> in Section II, Chapter 3.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Curricula </p>

<p> The primary purposes of all the D.A.R.E. curricula </p>

<p> for students are to </p>

<p> o teach students to recognize pressures </p>

<p> to use drugs from peers and from the </p>

<p> media, </p>

<p> o teach students the skills to resist </p>

<p> peer inducements to use drugs, </p>

<p> o enhance students' self-esteem,=20 </p>

<p> o teach positive alternatives to </p>

<p> substance use, and </p>

<p> o increase students' interpersonal, </p>

<p> communication, and decision-making </p>

<p> skills (BJA, 1991a). </p>

<p> Each of the curricula is periodically updated; an updated </p>

<p> version of the core curriculum is currently being pilot </p>

<p> tested and will be implemented in September 1994. A </p>

<p> brief summary of each of the five D.A.R.E. curricula </p>

<p> follows. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. core curriculum, which is taught in </p>

<p> the 5th or 6th grade, comprises </p>

<p> 17 hour-long weekly lessons. The D.A.R.E. officers have </p>

<p> sole responsibility for teaching all of the lessons, </p>

<p> although classroom teachers are encouraged to </p>

<p> participate. Officers use a variety of teaching </p>

<p> approaches, including the presentation of facts, group </p>

<p> discussions, role-playing, and workbook exercises. =20 </p>

<p> The core curriculum was updated in 1993 and will be </p>

<p> fully implemented in 1994. The updated curriculum </p>

<p> differs from the previous version in a variety of ways.=20 </p>

<p> The new curriculum, which has been renamed &quot;D.A.R.E. to </p>

<p> Resist Drugs and Violence,&quot; </p>

<p> o includes specific lessons concerning </p>

<p> tobacco and inhalants, </p>

<p> o emphasizes normative beliefs and </p>

<p> protective factors, </p>

<p> o adds violence prevention/conflict </p>

<p> resolution strategies, </p>

<p> o uses more participatory learning </p>

<p> activities, and </p>

<p> o employs a more collaborative </p>

<p> partnership between the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer and the teacher in the </p>

<p> classroom (Charles Dunn, personal </p>

<p> communication, June 22, 1993). </p>

<p> In both the old and new versions of the core curriculum, </p>

<p> the lessons are cumulative, building upon concepts </p>

<p> introduced in previous lessons. With the exception of </p>

<p> lesson 14 in both versions, the lessons are implemented </p>

<p> in sequence and without variation. </p>

<p> The data collection for the implementation </p>

<p> assessment and the evaluations studied in the outcome </p>

<p> assessment occurred before the introduction of the new </p>

<p> curriculum. We, therefore, believe it is important to </p>

<p> provide information on both versions. Exhibit 2.1 </p>

<p> presents a summary of the original version of the core </p>

<p> curriculum upon which the outcome evaluation was based, </p>

<p> and Exhibit 2.2 displays a summary of the updated </p>

<p> curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> In elementary schools that receive the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum, officers may also visit students in </p>

<p> kindergarten through 4th grade to teach brief </p>

<p> introductory (15- to 20- minute) lessons. Topics in this </p>

<p> curriculum include personal safety, the consequences of </p>

<p> taking medicine and using drugs, saying &quot;no&quot; when
asked </p>

<p> to engage in antisocial activities, and learning about </p>

<p> feelings. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. junior high school curriculum was </p>

<p> originally developed to provide or </p>

<p> reinforce information and skills that help students </p>

<p> resist pressure to use drugs. Revisions were made in </p>

<p> 1989 to include violence reduction, conflict resolution, </p>

<p> and anger management. The 10 lessons are taught </p>

<p> cooperatively by the officer and the classroom teacher.=20 </p>

<p> The lessons and activities (summarized in Exhibit 2.3) </p>

<p> are implemented over a 10-day period as part of a </p>

<p> required course, such as health, science, or social </p>

<p> studies. </p>

<p> The senior high school curriculum also focuses on </p>

<p> drug abuse and its effect on communities and young people </p>

<p> (see Exhibit 2.4 for a summary of the lessons). The </p>

<p> senior high school curriculum was designed to be taught </p>

<p> over an 11-day period during health or another </p>

<p> appropriate class. Responsibility for teaching the </p>

<p> lessons is divided between the officer and the classroom </p>

<p> teacher. Officers and teachers are trained together and </p>

<p> are encouraged to be present during the entire 11-day </p>

<p> period. </p>

<p> Because of the difficulties educators have </p>

<p> continually faced persuading parents to attend school </p>

<p> educational functions, the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum was </p>

<p> designed to be </p>

<p> implemented where parents live and work. This curriculum </p>

<p> consists of four or five 2-hour Exhibit 2.1 D.A.R.E.'s

<p> resources and </p>

<p> referrals </p>

<p> sessions generally held in the evenings (see Exhibit 2.5 </p>

<p> for a summary of these lessons). Topics covered in this </p>

<p> curriculum include developing better skills to interact </p>

<p> with children, learning about peer pressures, and </p>

<p> identifying signs and reducing risks of potential </p>

<p> substance abuse. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Officers and Training </p>

<p> Law enforcement agencies exercise considerable </p>

<p> discretion in identifying qualified, motivated police </p>

<p> officers to be trained as D.A.R.E. officers. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers must be full-time, uniformed officers with at </p>

<p> least 2 years of experience. When selecting candidate </p>

<p> officers, local police departments are encouraged to </p>

<p> consider the officer's ability to interact with children, </p>

<p> ability to organize, and ability to handle the </p>

<p> unexpected, as well as whether the officer would provide </p>

<p> an exemplary role model and refrain from sexual, racial, </p>

<p> stereotypical, or inappropriate remarks (BJA, 1991b). =20 </p>

<p> Selected officers undergo an intensive, 2-week </p>

<p> course of at least 80 hours of training. Officers are </p>

<p> trained not only in the core curriculum, but also in </p>

<p> public speaking, teaching skills, and classroom </p>

<p> management. Their performance is directly critiqued by </p>

<p> assigned mentors, who are experienced and specially </p>

<p> trained D.A.R.E. officers. Outside speakers and </p>

<p> consultants are also used to instruct the officers in </p>

<p> areas requiring special expertise (e.g., a psychologist </p>

<p> may present information on the stages of child </p>

<p> development). The core curriculum training course </p>

<p> includes opportunities to practice lessons both with </p>

<p> peers and in an actual classroom setting. =20 </p>

<p> Additional training is provided for officers </p>

<p> teaching the junior and senior high school and parent </p>

<p> curricula. Officers teaching these curricula are </p>

<p> required to be certified as a D.A.R.E. officer and to </p>

<p> have taught the core curriculum at least two semesters.=20 </p>

<p> In-service training is provided to review what officers </p>

<p> have previously learned in light of their actual </p>

<p> classroom experiences and to acquaint them with changes </p>

<p> to the curricula. The time that D.A.R.E. officers commit </p>

<p> to the program varies considerably from one law </p>

<p> enforcement jurisdiction to the next. For some officers, </p>

<p> particularly those in large urban departments, teaching </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is a full-time occupation. In departments that </p>

<p> serve rural communities, D.A.R.E. officers administer the </p>

<p> program on a part-time basis, devoting the remainder of </p>

<p> their time to other law enforcement tasks. =20 </p>

<p> Once in the field, D.A.R.E. officer performance is </p>

<p> monitored by mentors who observe classroom presentations </p>

<p> and evaluate performance. Mentors may also use input </p>

<p> from school administrators, classroom teachers, health </p>

<p> education coordinators, and advisory committees to </p>

<p> provide officers with feedback on their presentations. =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in the Context of Other School-Based Drug Use </p>

<p> Prevention Programs </p>

<p> Considering that the D.A.R.E. curricula were based </p>

<p> on several preexisting school-based drug prevention </p>

<p> curricula (primarily Project SMART), it is not surprising </p>

<p> that the curricula closely resemble other programs in </p>

<p> content. Exhibit 2.6 show that D.A.R.E.'s core </p>

<p> curriculum includes lessons that represent all three </p>

<p> curricular strategies discussed earlier.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. differs from most other school-based drug </p>

<p> prevention programs in the structure by which it is </p>

<p> organized and implemented. First, D.A.R.E. is </p>

<p> implemented by law enforcement officers; most other </p>

<p> programs are taught by teachers. Second, D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer training lasts 2 weeks and is highly intensive; </p>

<p> most drug prevention program training for teachers is of </p>

<p> a shorter duration. Third, D.A.R.E. officers are </p>

<p> strongly encouraged to deliver their lessons in sequence, </p>

<p> departing only minimally (if at all) from their lesson </p>

<p> plans; teachers are much more free to adapt curricula at </p>

<p> will, emphasizing those areas they believe to be most </p>

<p> salient or useful or integrating the drug prevention </p>

<p> material into their general education curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> Fourth, D.A.R.E. officer performance is often carefully </p>

<p> monitored and evaluated; generally, the accountability </p>

<p> mechanisms for teachers' implementation of their </p>

<p> curricula are less structured. Fifth, the mission of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers in the school is exclusively drug </p>

<p> prevention; to most teachers, drug prevention is often </p>

<p> only part of a larger curriculum. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 3 </p>

<p> NATIONAL AND REGIONAL OPERATIONS </p>

<p> In any consideration of the organization of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. at the national and regional levels, it is </p>

<p> important to remember that D.A.R.E. is very much a grass- </p>

<p> roots program. In essence, it is a product of memoranda </p>

<p> of understanding between community law enforcement and </p>

<p> local public school districts across the Nation. The </p>

<p> primary purposes of the D.A.R.E. hierarchy described in </p>

<p> this chapter are to ensure the integrity of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum and the fidelity with which it is delivered; </p>

<p> to develop and uphold standards for the integrity, </p>

<p> coordination, and quality of D.A.R.E. operations; and to </p>

<p> provide support to D.A.R.E. at the community level. </p>

<p> As we have said, in its degree of organization at </p>

<p> the national and regional levels, D.A.R.E. differs </p>

<p> greatly from other school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, most of which limit their activities to </p>

<p> delivering packaged curricula to school districts and </p>

<p> offering some level of training to teachers. In </p>

<p> contrast, the D.A.R.E. organization oversees all aspects </p>

<p> of the prevention program, including the consistency with </p>

<p> which it is implemented in the classroom. In this </p>

<p> chapter, we discuss the functions of D.A.R.E. America, </p>

<p> the preeminent D.A.R.E. organization, and its </p>

<p> relationship with the </p>

<p> o D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board; </p>

<p> o State Training Centers, State Charter </p>

<p> Organizations; and State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Coordinators; </p>

<p> o Los Angeles United School District </p>

<p> (LAUSD); and </p>

<p> o D.A.R.E. America Scientific Advisory </p>

<p> Board. </p>

<p> We obtained much of the information for this chapter from </p>

<p> an interview conducted in August 1994 with Glenn Levant, </p>

<p> Executive Director of D.A.R.E. America. This information </p>

<p> is supplemented by relevant D.A.R.E. documents. We also </p>

<p> summarize a series of loosely structured interviews </p>

<p> conducted in 1992 with representatives of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. at the national, regional, State, and </p>

<p> local levels is promoted, monitored, and overseen by </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America, which is chartered as a nonprofit </p>

<p> organization. As specified in its charter, D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America has responsibility for a variety of key func- </p>

<p> tions, including </p>

<p> o administering the D.A.R.E. program, </p>

<p> o providing educational materials to </p>

<p> communities implementing D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> o overseeing D.A.R.E. officer training </p>

<p> and ensuring its consistency, </p>

<p> o improving the curriculum, and </p>

<p> o providing support to D.A.R.E. both </p>

<p> nationally and internationally. =20 </p>

<p> In 1988, the BJA awarded four grants to establish </p>

<p> the RTCs that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board, and a fifth RTC was established the </p>

<p> following year. The RTCs are located in Arizona, </p>

<p> California, Illinois, Virginia, and North Carolina, and </p>

<p> the States associated with each are presented in Exhibit </p>

<p> 3.1. The responsibilities of the RTCs include making </p>

<p> recommendations to D.A.R.E. America concerning the </p>

<p> accreditation of State-level training centers. In </p>

<p> addition, the RTCs provide oversight to the local </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs to ensure that the copyrighted </p>

<p> curriculum is taught as specified. Educational </p>

<p> specialists representing the five RTCs, together with </p>

<p> staff of the LAUSD, are charged with curricular </p>

<p> development, taking advice from the Scientific Advisory </p>

<p> Board and other specialists. In Federal FY 1994, it is </p>

<p> expected that the BJA grant, which in the past has flowed </p>

<p> to the RTCs, will come directly to D.A.R.E. America to </p>

<p> support the RTCs. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is also organized at the State level. In </p>

<p> more than one-third of the States, D.A.R.E. America has </p>

<p> helped charter a nonprofit (501C3) organization, over </p>

<p> which D.A.R.E. America has oversight, and which is </p>

<p> designed to support the program in that State. The board </p>

<p> of the chartered organization typically comprises the </p>

<p> State's attorney general, the superintendent of </p>

<p> education, and prominent business and education people.=20 </p>

<p> The board of directors may also include a representative </p>

<p> of the State's D.A.R.E. Officers' Association (described </p>

<p> below) as well as, in some States, a D.A.R.E. coordinator </p>

<p> whose prominence and position may vary considerably. It </p>

<p> is expected that in time there will be D.A.R.E. charter </p>

<p> organizations in the remaining States. In those States </p>

<p> that currently lack a charter organization, there is </p>

<p> typically some individual identified as the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinator who often is a State employee. This </p>

<p> person's responsibilities include coordinating candidate </p>

<p> selection and scheduling training for D.A.R.E. officers, </p>

<p> obtaining State funds to support D.A.R.E. programs, </p>

<p> providing local technical assistance, and overseeing </p>

<p> policy development and implementation at the State level.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America meets with these individuals, and with </p>

<p> the State charter organizations, on a quarterly basis. </p>

<p> In addition to D.A.R.E. State charter organizations </p>

<p> at the State level, a total of 42 States currently have </p>

<p> developed State Training Centers (STCs), the purpose of </p>

<p> which is to conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers. These centers are differentially accredited; </p>

<p> all conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. officers in </p>

<p> the core curriculum, while only some are accredited to </p>

<p> teach the other curricula or to train D.A.R.E. mentors.=20 </p>

<p> The STCs are supported both by the States and by D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America. The level of activity of these centers varies </p>

<p> considerably given the size of the State and demand for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officer training. At present, there are some </p>

<p> 20,000 certified D.A.R.E. officers. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America also owns and protects the </p>

<p> copyright to the D.A.R.E. name, logo, and associated </p>

<p> slogans. D.A.R.E.'s name is considered a valuable </p>

<p> intellectual property. D.A.R.E. America approves all </p>

<p> materials (e.g., bumper stickers) and celebrities used to </p>

<p> promote the D.A.R.E. program. In addition, the </p>

<p> organization screens sponsors for fund-raising events to </p>

<p> exclude companies manufacturing alcohol or tobacco </p>

<p> products. =20 </p>

<p> Together with the LAUSD, D.A.R.E. America owns the </p>

<p> copyright to the core curriculum. The superintendent of </p>

<p> the LAUSD has been represented on the board of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America since 1983. Through the RTCs, D.A.R.E. America </p>

<p> monitors the implementation of D.A.R.E. in each community </p>

<p> and may withdraw its permission to use D.A.R.E. if a </p>

<p> local school district has improperly modified the </p>

<p> curriculum. To fulfill its responsibility of improving </p>

<p> the curriculum, D.A.R.E. America established in 1993 a </p>

<p> Scientific Advisory Board, which is chaired by Dr. Herb </p>

<p> Kleber of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse </p>

<p> (CASA) at Columbia University. Dr. Kleber was formally </p>

<p> the chief official for demand reduction in the Bush </p>

<p> Administration's White House Office of National Drug </p>

<p> Control Policy (ONDCP). The board includes prevention </p>

<p> specialists from across the Nation. </p>

<p> The National D.A.R.E. Officers' Association, which </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America helped to found in 1987, serves to </p>

<p> improve communications among police officers within </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. The association now has a State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Officers' association in each of the 50 States. Each of </p>

<p> the 18 other countries that have adopted the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program also has an association of D.A.R.E. officers, </p>

<p> although those association are not formally a part of the </p>

<p> national association. However, all associations, both </p>

<p> domestic and foreign, look to D.A.R.E. America for </p>

<p> guidance in matters of policy. </p>

<p> Finally, D.A.R.E. America provides considerable </p>

<p> support to communities implementing D.A.R.E. in the form </p>

<p> of the educational materials that support the curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> In some cases, D.A.R.E. America offers communities direct </p>

<p> financial support as well. </p>

<p> We collected further information by means of </p>

<p> informal interviews and discussions we conducted with the </p>

<p> coordinators and/or educational advisors of each of the </p>

<p> five RTCs in January 1992. The RTC coordinators/advisors </p>

<p> discussed with us a number of their needs and </p>

<p> recommendations for the D.A.R.E. program. Summaries of </p>

<p> their discussions with us are presented below. </p>

<p> An increasing need for in-service training. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors indicated that a substantial number </p>

<p> of officers have received D.A.R.E. training in the past </p>

<p> decade. However, they stressed that the original </p>

<p> training of many officers may now be several years old.=20 </p>

<p> RTC coordinators/advisors indicated that although </p>

<p> mechanisms for providing in-service training do exist, </p>

<p> these mechanisms may not be sufficient. Furthermore, </p>

<p> they suggested that because training of new officers </p>

<p> already stretches available resources, the increasing </p>

<p> need for in-service training for existing D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers will strain D.A.R.E.'s budget further.=20 </p>

<p> The increasing need to train State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators. RTC coordinators/ </p>

<p> advisors indicated that most States now have State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinators (see Chapter 4). However, they </p>

<p> reported that many are relatively new in these positions </p>

<p> or have received little formal information about how to </p>

<p> conduct their jobs. They stated that coordinator </p>

<p> training should include the responsibilities and roles of </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. coordinators, as well as how they can </p>

<p> effectively interact both with their RTC and the schools </p>

<p> in their States. RTC coordinators/advisors reported that </p>

<p> plans are currently under way to establish procedures to </p>

<p> accredit State D.A.R.E. coordinators. =20 </p>

<p> The need to improve lines of communication and </p>

<p> clarify lines of authority. RTC coordinators/advisors </p>

<p> indicated that because of the lack of formal training and </p>

<p> the lack of communication among State coordinators, many </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. coordinators have had to learn their jobs </p>

<p> by trial and error. They stated that although a certain </p>

<p> amount of communication occurs among State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators (especially among coordinators in </p>

<p> neighboring States), increasing communication would </p>

<p> greatly enhance efficiency by enabling coordinators to </p>

<p> draw on the experiences of others instead of
&quot;reinventing </p>

<p> the wheel.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> RTC coordinators/advisors also indicated that State </p>

<p> coordinators may need assistance with getting local </p>

<p> programs to recognize developing lines of authority. For </p>

<p> example, they stated that in the past, local programs </p>

<p> worked directly with RTCs; they said that many local </p>

<p> programs will need to be prompted to now work with the </p>

<p> STC instead. </p>

<p> The need for increased D.A.R.E. officer mentoring.=20 </p>

<p> At present, RTC coordinators/ </p>

<p> advisors reported that there is a well-developed system </p>

<p> for monitoring D.A.R.E. officer performance in the </p>

<p> classroom. They reported that D.A.R.E. mentors </p>

<p> periodically monitor and evaluate officer performance by </p>

<p> observing classes taught by the officer. They also </p>

<p> indicated that teachers are given the opportunity to rate </p>

<p> officer performance. They reported that D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers are informed of any problem areas, told how to </p>

<p> correct these problems, and later reevaluated to ensure </p>

<p> that the problem has been corrected. However, to be </p>

<p> truly useful, RTC coordinators reported that these </p>

<p> mentors should have the time and resources necessary to </p>

<p> work closely with D.A.R.E. officers to improve their </p>

<p> performance. </p>

<p> The need for increased collaboration between </p>

<p> education and law enforcement. RTC coordinators/advisors </p>

<p> indicated that because D.A.R.E. was created as a close </p>

<p> partnership between the LAUSD and the Los Angeles Police </p>

<p> Department, the program is dependent on a strong and </p>

<p> continuing relationship between education and law </p>

<p> enforcement at every level. </p>

<p> At the State level, RTC coordinators/advisors see </p>

<p> close collaboration between the department of education </p>

<p> and the organization administering D.A.R.E. (typically </p>

<p> related to law enforcement) as essential. They indicated </p>

<p> that the institutional commitment of State Departments of </p>

<p> Education to D.A.R.E. is essential, in part, to help </p>

<p> resolve any community-level problems. Further, they </p>

<p> indicated that as administrators of DFSCA funds, State </p>

<p> Departments of Education have an increasing role to play </p>

<p> in providing guidance concerning the various components </p>

<p> of a school district's comprehensive K-12 curriculum </p>

<p> (including D.A.R.E.) and how these components should be </p>

<p> integrated to ensure a comprehensive approach. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators indicated that ways in which State </p>

<p> Departments of Education could play a role in assisting </p>

<p> with the evaluation of D.A.R.E. officer performance </p>

<p> should be examined. </p>

<p> At the local level, RTC coordinators indicated that </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is initiated when a school district invites a </p>

<p> police department to teach the program. They reported </p>

<p> that the police department nominates a candidate for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officer training, and the candidate must be </p>

<p> acceptable to the school district administration. In the </p>

<p> classroom, they stated, the role of the teacher is </p>

<p> evolving from an observer and monitor of the officer's </p>

<p> performance to an active partner in D.A.R.E. instruction.=20 </p>

<p> The need to maintain limits to the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> &quot;bureaucracy&quot;. RTC coordinators/ </p>

<p> advisors stressed that pressures on D.A.R.E. to expand </p>

<p> its operations are considerable. They indicated that as </p>

<p> an institution, D.A.R.E. remains committed to maintaining </p>

<p> high standards at the community level. They reported </p>

<p> that as the role of the State coordinator continues to </p>

<p> become more important in this regard, the need for the </p>

<p> RTCs to provide technical assistance and to monitor State </p>

<p> activities becomes even more crucial. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors reported that because existing RTC </p>

<p> resources are already strained by current demands, </p>

<p> further growth at the national level seems inevitable.=20 </p>

<p> They indicated that even if support for such growth </p>

<p> exists, however, there is concern that a bureaucracy will </p>

<p> develop that may weaken the &quot;grass-roots&quot; nature of
the </p>

<p> enterprise. Coordinators/advisors indicated that it will </p>

<p> be a challenge to increase the size and capabilities of </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. bureaucracy to manage and control this </p>

<p> burgeoning program with the need to keep the bureaucracy </p>

<p> streamlined and responsive to the needs of the </p>

<p> communities that D.A.R.E. serves. </p>

<p> The need to locate permanent funding sources. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors indicated that D.A.R.E. currently </p>

<p> receives substantial support from DFSCA. However, they </p>

<p> feel that Federal DFSCA funds appear to have reached a </p>

<p> plateau in the past 3 years and are likely to be </p>

<p> subjected to budget cuts in the future. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors fear that D.A.R.E. could be reduced </p>

<p> or even eliminated as a line item. Regardless, they </p>

<p> reported that Federal funding may have been a mixed </p>

<p> blessing, insofar as Federal support may displace local </p>

<p> efforts to secure the resources necessary to implement </p>

<p> the program.=20 </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> In this chapter, we focused on the national- and </p>

<p> regional-level operations of D.A.R.E. We conducted </p>

<p> unstructured interviews with the executive director of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America and representatives from each of the </p>

<p> RTCs. We also reviewed available documents. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is a grass-roots program that operates </p>

<p> through memoranda of understanding between community law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies and local schools. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America, a nonprofit organization, coordinates, promotes, </p>

<p> monitors, and assumes ultimate responsibility for the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. program at all levels. The D.A.R.E. America RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board, which is composed of staff from the RTCs, </p>

<p> serves in an advisory capacity to D.A.R.E. America. In </p>

<p> addition to making recommendations to D.A.R.E. America, </p>

<p> RTCs are responsible for oversight of the local D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> programs and coordinating and conducting D.A.R.E. officer </p>

<p> training. Organizations and individuals working to </p>

<p> promote and coordinate the D.A.R.E. program at the State </p>

<p> levelinclude State-chartered nonprofit organizations, State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers' associations, and State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators. Also at the State level are STCs that </p>

<p> provide training to D.A.R.E. officers. </p>

<p> Curriculum development and changes are the </p>

<p> responsibility of educational specialists from each of </p>

<p> the RTCs, together with staff from the LAUSD. A </p>

<p> Scientific Advisory Board, composed of leading prevention </p>

<p> specialists, assists in these endeavors. </p>

<p> Our interviews with the RTC coordinators indicated </p>

<p> the following key issues: a need for increased in- </p>

<p> service training and mentoring, providing training to </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. coordinators, improving communication and </p>

<p> collaboration between agencies, maintaining limits on the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. bureaucracy, and locating permanent funding </p>

<p> sources. </p>

<p> Findings from this chapter and resulting </p>

<p> recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 4 </p>

<p> STATE-LEVEL OPERATIONS </p>

<p> In this chapter, we present the second component of </p>

<p> the implementation assessment, a survey of those </p>

<p> individuals who generally manage the State-level D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> operations: the State D.A.R.E. coordinators. This </p>

<p> component was conducted to fulfill NIJ's request for </p>

<p> information concerning: </p>

<p> o features common to most D.A.R.E. programs, </p>

<p> o funding arrangements for D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> o management of D.A.R.E. and supporting </p>

<p> organizations, and </p>

<p> o availability of the D.A.R.E. curricula. </p>

<p> The primary objective of this component was, of course, </p>

<p> to provide information concerning D.A.R.E.'s State-level </p>

<p> operations. As a secondary objective, we collected </p>

<p> preliminary information to facilitate sample selection </p>

<p> for the school district drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> survey, the results of which we present in Chapter 5. </p>

<p> This chapter covers both the methodology for and </p>

<p> findings from the survey of State D.A.R.E. coordinators.=20 </p>

<p> The findings section presents data concerning the </p>

<p> administration, funding, implementation, challenges, and </p>

<p> problems of State-level D.A.R.E. operations. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> Instrument Design </p>

<p> We based the content of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators' survey on the research issues raised in </p>

<p> NIJ's solicitation, discussions with NIJ personnel, a </p>

<p> review of the literature on D.A.R.E.'s structure and </p>

<p> operations, and an examination of prior studies of </p>

<p> school-based drug education conducted at RTI.=20 </p>

<p> Recognizing that State D.A.R.E. coordinators have </p>

<p> considerable demands on their time, we designed the </p>

<p> instrument to be as brief and straightforward as </p>

<p> possible. To minimize ambiguity and burden, we used </p>

<p> mostly close-ended items. A few open-ended questions </p>

<p> were included to encourage respondents to provide </p>

<p> detailed information. =20 </p>

<p> The survey instrument was composed of two parts: a </p>

<p> questionnaire and a list of school districts. The </p>

<p> questionnaire contained items concerning administration, </p>

<p> funding, and implementation of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program. The list of school districts contained those </p>

<p> districts we selected from that State for the first-phase </p>

<p> sample of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators' survey (see Chapter 5). We asked State </p>

<p> coordinators to indicate whether each district on their </p>

<p> list used D.A.R.E., and we then used this information to </p>

<p> draw the second-phase sample for the school district </p>

<p> survey. </p>

<p> We pretested the instrument on three State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators in early February 1992. We also shared the </p>

<p> instrument with all five RTC coordinators and requested </p>

<p> their feedback. We incorporated the responses of pretest </p>

<p> participants, as well the comments of the RTC </p>

<p> coordinators, the NIJ program manager, and other alcohol </p>

<p> and drug prevention program experts into the final draft </p>

<p> of the data collection instrument. A copy of the survey </p>

<p> instrument and other data collection materials can be </p>

<p> found in Appendix D. </p>

<p> Data Collection </p>

<p> In January 1992, the RTC coordinators provided us </p>

<p> with lists of names and addresses of State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators. Based on this information, we identified </p>

<p> 44 States with D.A.R.E. coordinators. We mailed each </p>

<p> coordinator a package containing cover letters from the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board and RTI, a </p>

<p> questionnaire, and a list of school districts in the </p>

<p> coordinator's State. The cover letter from the RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board expressed support for the research effort </p>

<p> and encouraged participation. The cover letter from RTI </p>

<p> explained the study, provided assurances that all </p>

<p> information would be kept strictly confidential, and </p>

<p> requested copies of any pertinent State documents </p>

<p> concerning the organization and/or administration of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. =20 </p>

<p> We mailed the packages to the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators on February 18, 1992. Two weeks after the </p>

<p> initial mailout, we contacted nonresponders by telephone.=20 </p>

<p> We made repeated attempts by mail and telephone to secure </p>

<p> the return of completed materials or to collect the </p>

<p> information by phone. The RTCs were again of great </p>

<p> assistance to us in urging coordinators to return </p>

<p> surveys. </p>

<p> Of the 44 respondents identified by the RTC </p>

<p> coordinators, 39 completed the instrument. For purposes </p>

<p> of verification, one question in the survey asked </p>

<p> respondents to confirm that the State had a D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinator. Although four States responded that they </p>

<p> did not have such a position, we determined after some </p>

<p> investigation that they did have a person who performs a </p>

<p> coordinator's role. Respondents from all four of these </p>

<p> States reported that administration of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program was one of several roles they performed as </p>

<p> supervisors or directors in law enforcement agencies.=20 </p>

<p> We, therefore, did not delete these responses from our </p>

<p> analysis. It should be noted, however, that because of </p>

<p> skip patterns in the survey instrument, these four </p>

<p> respondents did not complete survey items specifically </p>

<p> directed to the State D.A.R.E. coordinator. =20 </p>

<p> Findings </p>

<p> Administration </p>

<p> To address issues raised in the NIJ solicitation </p>

<p> concerning management of the D.A.R.E. program, we asked a </p>

<p> series of questions about the agencies involved in </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s administration at the State level, the </p>

<p> functions of each agency, and the relationships among </p>

<p> them. Findings from these questions are presented below. </p>

<p> Agencies Involved. We first asked respondents to </p>

<p> report the agency with primary responsibility for </p>

<p> managing the State D.A.R.E. program. As shown in Exhibit </p>

<p> 4.1, the great majority of States indicated that a law </p>

<p> enforcement or criminal justice agency was entrusted with </p>

<p> States are encouraged to establish statewide boards </p>

<p> that will help ensure that the State D.A.R.E. program </p>

<p> accommodates competing points of view, remains responsive </p>

<p> to the needs of its constituency, and continues as a </p>

<p> permanent component of State prevention activities (BJA, </p>

<p> 1988). We asked coordinators if the State had a policy </p>

<p> advisory board (PAB), and 15 States (38%) reported </p>

<p> affirmatively. </p>

<p> To explore PAB membership, we asked the 15 </p>

<p> coordinators with PABs to indicate the </p>

<p> agencies/individuals who held memberships on these boards </p>

<p> and to indicate the representative who chaired it.=20 </p>

<p> Yet another agency encouraged to become involved in </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is the State Department of Education. States </p>

<p> are encouraged to retain an educational consultant to act </p>

<p> as a liaison between the State Department of Education, </p>

<p> local school administrators, and D.A.R.E. instructors </p>

<p> (BJA, 1988). We, therefore, asked if the State had an </p>

<p> educational consultant. Twenty-five (64%) of the 39 </p>

<p> respondents reported having an educational advisor, and </p>

<p> two States reported two advisors. Further, we inquired </p>

<p> about the employers of these consultants and found that </p>

<p> educational systems employed 17 of the 27 educational </p>

<p> advisors and law enforcement agencies employed 4 (Exhibit </p>

<p> Functions. Next, we sought to examine the </p>

<p> responsibilities of both the State D.A.R.E. coordinators </p>

<p> and the PABs by asking respondents to indicate the </p>

<p> functions of each agency (Exhibit 4.4). The most fre- </p>

<p> quently mentioned roles of State D.A.R.E. coordinators </p>

<p> were D.A.R.E. advocacy and officer training within the </p>

<p> State. The most frequently mentioned roles of PABs were </p>

<p> formulating State policy, exploring funding sources, and </p>

<p> advocating for D.A.R.E.=20 </p>

<p> We also asked respondents to list functions </p>

<p> Communication. As mentioned earlier, State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs are strongly encouraged to develop </p>

<p> relationships with State Departments of Education.=20 </p>

<p> Having an educational consultant, however, does not </p>

<p> guarantee communication between the agencies. We, </p>

<p> therefore, asked the State coordinators about how well </p>

<p> they communicate with the Department of Education. Most </p>

<p> of the State D.A.R.E. coordinators reported having a </p>

<p> great deal (35%) or some (47%) communication with the </p>

<p> State Department of Education. In six States, </p>

<p> coordinators reported little communication, and only one </p>

<p> reported none. Seven coordinators (20%) reported having </p>

<p> a signed agreement between the State D.A.R.E. coordinator </p>

<p> and the Department of Education. =20 </p>

<p> We also asked coordinators about the level of </p>

<p> communication between the PABs and the State Department </p>

<p> of Education. Most of the coordinators reported that </p>

<p> PABs had a great deal of communication with the Depart- </p>

<p> ment of Education. Eight of the 15 States with PABs </p>

<p> reported that their boards had a great deal of </p>

<p> communication, three reported some communication, three </p>

<p> reported little, and one reported none. =20 </p>

<p> Only one State reported that both the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinator and the PAB had little communication </p>

<p> with the Department of Education. </p>

<p> Funding </p>

<p> The NIJ solicitation also requested information on </p>

<p> funding arrangements for D.A.R.E. To this end, we asked </p>

<p> respondents to report the amount of funding received by </p>

<p> the primary managing agency. Exhibit 4.5 presents </p>

<p> ranges of funding received for D.A.R.E. at the State </p>

<p> level. Four States reported that no funds were received </p>

<p> for State-level D.A.R.E. operations, and two State </p>

<p> coordinators were unable to provide this information. =20 </p>

<p> The mean amount of funds received by the primary </p>

<p> managing agency for operating D.A.R.E. at the State level </p>

<p> in the 1991-1992 school year (excluding $0 values) was </p>

<p> $273,657; funding ranged from $25,000 to $2,635,000. The </p>

<p> total amount received by the responding States was </p>

<p> $9,260,700. </p>

<p> Data Unavailable 5.1 </p>

<p> We asked the 33 respondents who reported the amount </p>

<p> of funding for State-level operations to identify the </p>

<p> sources of this funding (Exhibit 4.6). Four of the 33 </p>

<p> respondents did not answer this question. We also asked </p>

<p> coordinators to indicate the percentage of funds received </p>

<p> from each source. Fifteen States indicated that all </p>

<p> funds were received from one source (six from the BJA, </p>

<p> four from State governors' grants, two from the State </p>

<p> Department of Education, two from legislative funds, and </p>

<p> one from other sources). Eight States reported that </p>

<p> funding was received from two sources, and eight States </p>

<p> reported receiving funding from three or more sources. =20 </p>

<p> Additionally, we asked respondents to report other </p>

<p> sources of funding not mentioned in the close-ended </p>

<p> response options. Responses included State and local </p>

<p> matching funds, special education trust funds, State </p>

<p> *As indicated by Question 2 of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinator survey, this information refers to </p>

<p> funding of State-level D.A.R.E. programs only. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America has informed us that all </p>

<p> State-level programs receive support from D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America (Glenn Levant, personal communi- </p>

<p> cation, August 9, 1994). </p>

<p> Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention </p>

<p> (OJJDP), fund-raisers, and Federal forfeiture funds. </p>

<p> State Training Centers </p>

<p> As mentioned in Chapter 3, one goal of the RTCs has </p>

<p> been to develop STCs in their geographic areas.=20 </p>

<p> Increasingly, RTCs have adopted a &quot;train the
trainer&quot; </p>

<p> model to prepare STCs in their jurisdiction to conduct </p>

<p> their own D.A.R.E. officer training and certification </p>

<p> procedures. We, therefore, asked coordinators whether </p>

<p> their State had its own STC. About 87% (34 States) </p>

<p> reported affirmatively. One of the five States without a </p>

<p> training center reported that the State was in the </p>

<p> process of establishing a training center. </p>

<p> Implementation </p>

<p> To obtain a general idea of the level of </p>

<p> implementation of each of D.A.R.E.'s curricula, we asked </p>

<p> respondents to indicate each curriculum used in the State </p>

<p> during the 1991-1992 school year. All respondents </p>

<p> reported that the core curriculum and the K-4 visitations </p>

<p> were used in at least one school in the State.=20 </p>

<p> Furthermore, 28 States (72%) implemented the junior high </p>

<p> curriculum, 26 States (67%) implemented the senior high </p>

<p> school curriculum, and 9 States (23%) implemented the </p>

<p> parent curriculum in at least one school. </p>

<p> Challenges and Problems </p>

<p> To acquire an understanding of the challenges and </p>

<p> problems facing D.A.R.E. and the State D.A.R.E. coordina- </p>

<p> tor in the coming years, we asked two open-ended </p>

<p> questions about these issues. We categorized the </p>

<p> responses and counted the number of State coordinators </p>

<p> indicating each category. (We advise caution in using </p>

<p> these findings to make recommendations given the small </p>

<p> number of coordinators mentioning each category.) =20 </p>

<p> First, we asked respondents to identify the most </p>

<p> significant issues they face in working with the State's </p>

<p> Department of Education. The two most common responses </p>

<p> were improving communication between agencies (mentioned </p>

<p> by eight States) and acquiring a full-time educational </p>

<p> advisor (mentioned by seven States). Most of the other </p>

<p> responses were specific actions that coordinators wanted </p>

<p> the State Department of Education to undertake, such as </p>

<p> o assisting with program evaluation and monitoring </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers (six States), </p>

<p> o formally mandating the D.A.R.E. program (three </p>

<p> States), </p>

<p> o understanding the role of law enforcement in </p>

<p> education (three States), </p>

<p> o assisting with funding for D.A.R.E. (three </p>

<p> States), </p>

<p> o providing greater support for the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program (two States), </p>

<p> o assisting in training programs (one State), and </p>

<p> o helping resolve problems between officers and </p>

<p> teachers (one State). </p>

<p> We then asked respondents to indicate the most </p>

<p> significant issues facing the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinator. It should be noted that most of these </p>

<p> issues could be mentioned by coordinators of other drug </p>

<p> prevention programs, as well as coordinators of D.A.R.E.=20 </p>

<p> Most of the responses centered on funding, communication, </p>

<p> evaluation, and training. The responses, by category, </p>

<p> were as follows:=20 </p>

<p> Funding </p>

<p> o maintaining or increasing funding (13 States) </p>

<p> o locating funding sources (8 States) </p>

<p> o locating funding specifically for training (6 </p>

<p> States) </p>

<p> Communication </p>

<p> o increasing communication between </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. agencies at the local, </p>

<p> regional, and national levels (10 </p>

<p> States) </p>

<p> o improving relations with State </p>

<p> Department of Education (4 States) </p>

<p> o coping with the disorganization of the </p>

<p> program (4 States) </p>

<p> o improving public relations (3 States) </p>

<p> o keeping up with constantly shifting </p>

<p> policies of the D.A.R.E. America RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board (2 States) </p>

<p> Evaluation </p>

<p> o monitoring officers in the classroom (8 </p>

<p> States) </p>

<p> o evaluating the program (4 States) </p>

<p> Training </p>

<p> o improving training (3 States) </p>

<p> o handling problem officers (2 States) </p>

<p> o obtaining STC certification (1 State) </p>

<p> Staffing </p>

<p> o increasing staffing (6 States) </p>

<p> o formally establishing a State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinator position (2 States) </p>

<p> o forming a PAB (2 States) </p>

<p> Expansion </p>

<p> o expanding D.A.R.E. to other grades or </p>

<p> schools (7 States). </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> This chapter focused on a survey of the </p>

<p> administrators of the State D.A.R.E. programs. Thirty- </p>

<p> nine of the 44 States with State D.A.R.E. coordinators </p>

<p> responded to the survey. =20 </p>

<p> We found that most of the State D.A.R.E. programs </p>

<p> are managed by law enforcement or criminal justice </p>

<p> agencies and that most retain educational consultants.=20 </p>

<p> About two-fifths of the States had PABs. Most of the </p>

<p> coordinators reported high levels of communication </p>

<p> between themselves and the State Department of Education.=20 </p>

<p> They also reported high levels of communication between </p>

<p> the PABs and the Department of Education. Most States </p>

<p> received at least $50,000 in funding for training and </p>

<p> administrative purposes, and most States had their own </p>

<p> STC. </p>

<p> Findings from this chapter and resulting </p>

<p> recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 5 </p>

<p> SCHOOL DISTRICT DRUG PREVENTION </p>

<p> COORDINATOR SURVEY </p>

<p> A survey of school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators was the main component of our implementation </p>

<p> assessment. This component of the assessment was </p>

<p> conducted to fulfill NIJ's request for information about </p>

<p> the implementation of D.A.R.E. and other school-based </p>

<p> drug prevention programs at the local level. NIJ </p>

<p> specifically requested information on the following </p>

<p> questions: </p>

<p> o Who usually manages the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program at the local level? </p>

<p> o How involved in D.A.R.E. are </p>

<p> classroom teachers, churches, and </p>

<p> community groups? </p>

<p> o How extensively are D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other school-based alcohol and </p>

<p> other drug (AOD) prevention </p>

<p> programs implemented nationwide </p>

<p> in terms of geography, target </p>

<p> populations (such as ethnic </p>

<p> groups, economic strata, and </p>

<p> urbanicity), and grade levels? </p>

<p> o How do other AOD programs compare </p>

<p> with D.A.R.E. and D.A.R.E. with </p>

<p> them? </p>

<p> o What are local funding </p>

<p> arrangements for D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs? How do these </p>

<p> resources affect implementation? </p>

<p> A careful reading of these questions reveals that NIJ had </p>

<p> three primary objectives: (a) to secure information </p>

<p> about the administration of D.A.R.E., (b) to develop </p>

<p> estimates of the national prevalence of D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs, and (c) to make comparisons between </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs on a variety of issues. =20 </p>

<p> RTI staff developed and conducted a comprehensive </p>

<p> survey of school district drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> that addressed each of the above-mentioned objectives and </p>

<p> questions. We selected drug prevention coordinators as </p>

<p> respondents, as opposed to classroom teachers or police </p>

<p> officers, because we believed that drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators were the school district staff members best </p>

<p> able to provide us with a broad perspective on all drug </p>

<p> prevention activities in the district, including both </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD prevention programs. </p>

<p> This chapter presents the methodology and findings </p>

<p> for this survey. We should note that for this chapter </p>

<p> the results we display will be descriptive, as opposed to </p>

<p> explanatory, in nature. That is, our purpose is to </p>

<p> report what the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators have told us, and not attempt to explain why </p>

<p> they responded as they did. Although efforts to explain </p>

<p> our respondents' answer are feasible, we believe they </p>

<p> would ultimately prove unsatisfactory because our </p>

<p> explanatory variables (e.g., the school districts' racial </p>

<p> balance or percentage of youth in poverty) are very </p>

<p> limited, and any differences we find may be misleading. </p>

<p> The findings section first presents information we </p>

<p> received from districts with D.A.R.E., followed by </p>

<p> estimates of the numbers of districts with D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs, and comparisons of D.A.R.E. with </p>

<p> other AOD programs. At the end of the findings section, </p>

<p> we also provide some general information about drug </p>

<p> policies in all the districts surveyed. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> Sample Design </p>

<p> The sample design for the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators' survey was a two-phased </p>

<p> stratified random sample. The two-phases of the sample </p>

<p> design was necessary to meet the multiple goals of this </p>

<p> survey. The goal of the first-phase sample was to </p>

<p> produce estimates by region, district size, socioeconomic </p>

<p> status (SES) categories, ethnicity categories, and </p>

<p> urbanicity. The goal of the second-phase sample was to </p>

<p> enable comparisons between districts with and without </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. A detailed discussion of each phase of the </p>

<p> sample design is discussed below. </p>

<p> Sampling frame. The first step in our sampling </p>

<p> design was to obtain a list of public school districts </p>

<p> nationwide. We obtained such a list from Quality </p>

<p> Educational Data (QED) Inc., of Denver, Colorado. The </p>

<p> QED file, which is updated every summer, lists all public </p>

<p> school districts nationwide and contains a wealth of </p>

<p> useful information for each school district. We used </p>

<p> this file as our sampling frame. Information that we </p>

<p> used from this file included the school district's </p>

<p> o SES (defined as the percentage of </p>

<p> children in the district below </p>

<p> poverty level), </p>

<p> o urbanicity (defined as urban, </p>

<p> suburban, or rural), </p>

<p> o ethnicity (defined as the </p>

<p> percentage of children in the </p>

<p> district who were black or </p>

<p> Hispanic), and </p>

<p> o district size (defined as the </p>

<p> number of students enrolled in </p>

<p> the district). =20 </p>

<p> For each of the 14,715 districts on the QED file, </p>

<p> we created five new variables that we later used for </p>

<p> stratification and weighting purposes. First, we created </p>

<p> a region variable that was based on the jurisdictions of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s five RTCs (see Chapter 3, Exhibit 3.1). Next, </p>

<p> to keep the total number of stratum cells within </p>

<p> reasonable bounds, we dichotomized urbanicity, SES, </p>

<p> ethnicity, and district size. We first collapsed the </p>

<p> urban and suburban categories on the QED file into one </p>

<p> category. We computed percentiles for minority status, </p>

<p> SES, and district size within each region-by-urbanicity </p>

<p> group. We then used the median of each variable to </p>

<p> define two categories (low/high) for each of the three </p>

<p> variables. The number and percentage of school districts </p>

<p> in the sampling frame in each of the strata are presented </p>

<p> in Appendix A, Exhibit A.1. </p>

<p> First-Phase Sampling. The goal of the first-phase </p>

<p> of our sampling design was to ensure that we selected a </p>

<p> nationally representative sample of school districts.=20 </p>

<p> Additionally, we wanted to ensure that districts in each </p>

<p> region, urbanicity category, SES category, minority </p>

<p> status category, and district size category were </p>

<p> adequately sampled. Therefore, our first-phase sample </p>

<p> was a stratified random sample. =20 </p>

<p> The first step in selecting our first-phase sample </p>

<p> was to define each strata. We initially constructed 10 </p>

<p> region-by-urbanicity strata by crossing the 5 regional </p>

<p> strata with the 2 urbanicity strata. We then crossed </p>

<p> each of these 10 strata with 2 SES categories (resulting </p>

<p> in 20 strata). We then crossed each of those 20 strata </p>

<p> by minority status (resulting in 40 strata). Finally, we </p>

<p> crossed each of those 40 strata by district size </p>

<p> (resulting in 80 strata). The number of school districts </p>

<p> in the sampling frame in each of the 80 strata is </p>

<p> presented in Appendix A, Exhibit A.2. </p>

<p> The next step in our sampling design was to </p>

<p> determine how districts from each strata would be </p>

<p> selected for inclusion in the first-phase sample. We </p>

<p> assayed two methods of allocating the sample to strata.=20 </p>

<p> In the first method, we assigned equal sample sizes </p>

<p> across strata (i.e., we sampled 15 districts from every </p>

<p> stratum regardless of whether the stratum in the sampling </p>

<p> frame contained 15 or 200 districts). This method would </p>

<p> have ensured good precision across strata. In the second </p>

<p> method, we assigned sample sizes proportional to the </p>

<p> frame size within each stratum. For example, if 5% of </p>

<p> the districts in the sampling frame were in a particular </p>

<p> stratum, proportional sampling would have ensured that 5% </p>

<p> of the first-phase sample would be allocated to that same </p>

<p> stratum. Unlike equal allocation, proportional </p>

<p> allocation yields approximately equal sampling weights, </p>

<p> reduces variance, and thus provides better precision for </p>

<p> overall survey estimates. =20 </p>

<p> Because of its clear advantages, we chose </p>

<p> proportional sampling. Thus, we randomly selected a </p>

<p> proportional number of school districts within each of </p>

<p> the 80 strata. The first-phase sample consisted of 1,500 </p>

<p> school districts. Exhibits displaying the sample </p>

<p> allocation to strata are provided in Appendix A, Exhibits </p>

<p> A.3 and A.4. </p>

<p> Second-Phase Sampling. The goal of the second- </p>

<p> phase of our sampling design was to ensure that the </p>

<p> second-phase sample included both D.A.R.E. and non- </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. school districts. To make this determination, </p>

<p> we asked State D.A.R.E. or DFSCA coordinators to classify </p>

<p> the 1,500 school districts in the first-phase sample as </p>

<p> either D.A.R.E. or non-D.A.R.E. districts (see Chapter </p>

<p> 4). Because some State coordinators did not return this </p>

<p> information or only partially completed the information, </p>

<p> we created a third category of school districts with an </p>

<p> unknown D.A.R.E. status. State coordinators reported </p>

<p> that 43% of the sampled districts used D.A.R.E. and 40% </p>

<p> did not; D.A.R.E. status was unknown for 17% of the </p>

<p> districts. Exhibit A.5 in Appendix A displays the </p>

<p> responses of the State coordinators on the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> status of the first-phase sample by region. </p>

<p> The next step in selecting our second-phase sample </p>

<p> was to determine the number of districts to be selected.=20 </p>

<p> Calculations to determine the number of districts needed </p>

<p> in the second-phase sample were based first on the type </p>

<p> of analysis we planned to conduct and second on an </p>

<p> anticipated 80% response rate. Because we calculated </p>

<p> that 400 responding school districts were necessary to </p>

<p> achieve sufficient statistical power and precision, we </p>

<p> selected a second-phase sample of 500 school districts. </p>

<p> Finally, we used the classifications provided by </p>

<p> the State coordinators to select proportional numbers of </p>

<p> school districts with D.A.R.E., without D.A.R.E., and </p>

<p> with unknown D.A.R.E. status across the five regions.=20 </p>

<p> Thus, we selected 215 school districts with D.A.R.E., 200 </p>

<p> without D.A.R.E., and 85 with unknown D.A.R.E. status.=20 </p>

<p> Exhibit A.6 in Appendix A displays the second-phase </p>

<p> sample by region and D.A.R.E. status. </p>

<p> Survey Estimation. All survey estimates were </p>

<p> computed using software developed at RTI specifically for </p>

<p> the analysis of surveys based on complex sample designs.=20 </p>

<p> We computed analysis weights that took into account the </p>

<p> two-phase stratified sample design. Weighted data </p>

<p> provides a less biased estimate than unweighted data </p>

<p> because the weighted data more accurately represents the </p>

<p> true population. The weights varied across strata based </p>

<p> on region, ethnic composition, urbanicity, SES, and size </p>

<p> of the school district. Analysis weights were computed </p>

<p> as the product of the first-phase sample weight and the </p>

<p> second-phase sample weight. Sampling weights were also </p>

<p> adjusted for nonresponse. We performed quality checks on </p>

<p> the analysis weights to ensure that the sum of the </p>

<p> analysis weights coincides with the number of districts </p>

<p> in the frame. We also examined the variability of the </p>

<p> analyses weights and their impact on survey variances. </p>

<p> Instrument Design </p>

<p> RTI staff determined the contents of the school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators' survey based on </p>

<p> the research issues raised in NIJ's solicitation, </p>

<p> discussions with NIJ personnel, a review of the </p>

<p> literature, and examination of the studies of drug </p>

<p> education programming previously conducted at RTI. We </p>

<p> used close-ended items whenever possible to minimize </p>

<p> ambiguity and burden. A few open-ended questions were </p>

<p> included to encourage respondents to provide detailed </p>

<p> information. =20 </p>

<p> All drug prevention coordinators completed a set of </p>

<p> core items that were designed to provide background </p>

<p> information about the district and about the specific </p>

<p> drug prevention curricula used. Additionally, </p>

<p> coordinators in districts using D.A.R.E., alone or in </p>

<p> combination with other drug prevention curricula, </p>

<p> completed a set of items concerning the D.A.R.E. program </p>

<p> only. Coordinators in districts using other AOD </p>

<p> prevention programs, alone or in combination with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., completed a set of items concerning other AOD </p>

<p> (i.e., non-D.A.R.E.) programs only. Therefore, school </p>

<p> districts </p>

<p> implementing D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs answered </p>

<p> both sets of items. </p>

<p> After submitting the data collection instrument to </p>

<p> our NIJ program manager for comment and discussion, we </p>

<p> formally pretested all data collection materials and </p>

<p> procedures. Both regional and State DFSCA coordinators </p>

<p> assisted in identifying pretest subjects. Seven school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators (two in New York, </p>

<p> two in South Dakota, one in North Carolina, one in Rhode </p>

<p> Island, and one in South Carolina) completed a pretest </p>

<p> questionnaire in early April 1992. </p>

<p> We used the responses of pretest participants, as </p>

<p> well as the comments of our NIJ program manager and other </p>

<p> AOD prevention program experts, to make final decisions </p>

<p> on the data collection procedures and instruments. A </p>

<p> copy of the survey instrument and other data collection </p>

<p> materials for this component of the study can be found in </p>

<p> Appendix D. </p>

<p> Data Collection </p>

<p> On May 1, 1992, we mailed a cover letter, </p>

<p> questionnaire, and prepaid return envelope to school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators in each of the 500 </p>

<p> selected school districts. The cover letter included a </p>

<p> brief statement of study objectives, information on how </p>

<p> the data would be used, and confidentiality assurances.=20 </p>

<p> Approximately 2 weeks after the initial mailing, we sent </p>

<p> postcards to coordinators who had not responded. The </p>

<p> postcard asked if the initial packet had been received, </p>

<p> reminded the coordinator of the importance of the study, </p>

<p> and offered the RTI toll-free number in case assistance </p>

<p> was needed. Upon request, we provided duplicate </p>

<p> mailouts. </p>

<p> Four packages were returned as undeliverable. Each </p>

<p> of these was followed up by telephone inquiry to </p>

<p> ascertain the correct address. We obtained correct </p>

<p> addresses for three of the four returned packages and </p>

<p> remailed the material. The remaining school district had </p>

<p> recently merged with another school district. Because </p>

<p> this merged district was already included in the sample, </p>

<p> the duplicate was dropped. </p>

<p> We began making follow-up telephone calls to </p>

<p> nonresponders approximately 2 weeks after the reminder </p>

<p> postcards were mailed. Follow-up phone calls were made </p>

<p> by trained RTI telephone interviewers between June 2 and </p>

<p> July 15, 1992. Interviewers encouraged coordinators to </p>

<p> complete and return their instruments as soon as </p>

<p> possible. Those coordinators who indicated to </p>

<p> interviewers that they would not otherwise complete the </p>

<p> instrument were asked to complete the survey over the </p>

<p> telephone. The survey instrument was exactly the same </p>

<p> for both telephone and mail administration. The final </p>

<p> response rate was 85.6%, which considerably surpassed our </p>

<p> expected response rate of 80%. The final sample </p>

<p> disposition is presented in Exhibit 5.1. </p>

<p> No response 63 12.6 </p>

<p> Duplicate 1 0.2 </p>

<p> As indicated, we completed almost twice as many </p>

<p> interviews by phone as by mail. We attribute this to </p>

<p> several factors. First, phone surveys traditionally have </p>

<p> higher response rates than mail surveys. Second, the </p>

<p> questionnaires were not mailed until late in the school </p>

<p> year; therefore, coordinators may have had end-of-the- </p>

<p> year obligations that limited the amount of time they </p>

<p> could spend on additional duties. Third, the part of the </p>

<p> instrument that asked about each of the packaged drug </p>

<p> prevention curricula was imposing; we believe that having </p>

<p> the interviewers read these questions to the respondents </p>

<p> may have made answering them less burdensome. Because </p>

<p> the information gathered in this survey was not sensitive </p>

<p> in nature, we believe that data obtained via both methods </p>

<p> of administration are comparable. </p>

<p> Returned questionnaires were delivered to a </p>

<p> check-in station where they were logged in, coded, </p>

<p> manually edited, keyed, and key verified. We implemented </p>

<p> machine-editing procedures to verify and correct skip </p>

<p> patterns and logical inconsistencies. We recontacted a </p>

<p> few school district drug prevention coordinators to </p>

<p> resolve problematic responses, such as incomplete or </p>

<p> contradictory information. </p>

<p> Findings </p>

<p> Administration of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> The first objective of this survey was to obtain </p>

<p> information about the administration of D.A.R.E. at the </p>

<p> local level. This section presents findings concerning </p>

<p> the implementation, administration, participation of </p>

<p> teachers and the community in the D.A.R.E. program, </p>

<p> integration and coordination of D.A.R.E. with other </p>

<p> school-based drug prevention efforts, problems with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., and future plans for the use of D.A.R.E. Data </p>

<p> from survey items asked only of the districts with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. are presented in this section. =20 </p>

<p> Implementation. In the 1991-1992 school year, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was implemented in 51.8%, or 222, of the school </p>

<p> districts surveyed. Some 42% of all school districts </p>

<p> surveyed used the core curriculum, 17% used K-4 lessons, </p>

<p> 11% implemented the junior high school curriculum, 3% </p>

<p> used the senior high school curriculum, and 3% used the </p>

<p> parent curriculum. =20 </p>

<p> Of the 222 school districts with D.A.R.E., the </p>

<p> great majority (81%) implemented the core curriculum, </p>

<p> around 33% used the K-4 visitations, 22% used the junior </p>

<p> high school curriculum, 6% implemented the senior high </p>

<p> school curriculum, and 5% used the parent curriculum. We </p>

<p> further asked the respondents to indicate every grade in </p>

<p> which the D.A.R.E. curricula were used. Exhibit 5.2 </p>

<p> displays the percentage of school districts with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> implementing the program at each grade. Almost 70% of </p>

<p> the districts with D.A.R.E. implemented the curriculum in </p>

<p> 5th-grade classes, and almost 60% used it in 6th-grade </p>

<p> classes. Thus, a substantial number of districts </p>

<p> implemented the core curriculum in both grades, which </p>

<p> probably reflects the different cutoff grades separating </p>

<p> elementary from junior high or middle schools in that </p>

<p> district. </p>

<p> Administration. One objective of NIJ's </p>

<p> solicitation was to ascertain what agencies usually </p>

<p> manage D.A.R.E. and have responsibility for various </p>

<p> aspects of the program at the local level. To address </p>

<p> these issues, we first asked coordinators to report all </p>

<p> agencies managing D.A.R.E. Around 81% of the districts </p>

<p> with D.A.R.E. reported that a single agency administered </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. program, while 16.3% reported that two </p>

<p> agencies and 2.3% reported that three or more agencies </p>

<p> administered the program (Exhibit 5.3). Almost 34% of </p>

<p> the school districts with D.A.R.E. reported that the </p>

<p> county sheriff's department alone administered the </p>

<p> program, and about 34% reported city/town police </p>

<p> departments administered it.=20 </p>

<p> We next asked coordinators to report whether law </p>

<p> enforcement or education was responsible for various </p>

<p> activities. Coordinators with D.A.R.E. most frequently </p>

<p> reported that law enforcement agencies were responsible </p>

<p> for selecting D.A.R.E. officers and determining classroom </p>

<p> activities (Exhibit 5.4). They reported that </p>

<p> responsibility for selecting schools to receive D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> selecting classrooms to receive D.A.R.E., and assigning </p>

<p> extracurricular D.A.R.E. activities were performed by </p>

<p> education. </p>

<p> Participation of Teachers and Community. NIJ's </p>

<p> solicitation also requested an examination of the extent </p>

<p> of involvement of classroom teachers. About 84% of the </p>

<p> coordinators reported that classroom teachers were </p>

<p> actively involved in the program. We also asked </p>

<p> coordinators about classroom teachers' level of </p>

<p> participation during D.A.R.E. lessons. About 21% </p>

<p> reported a great deal of participation, 46% reported some </p>

<p> participation, 28% reported little participation, and 5% </p>

<p> reported no participation by the classroom teachers. =20 </p>

<p> To determine the extent to which teachers reinforce </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. lessons, we asked coordinators about </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.-related activities performed by classroom </p>

<p> teachers. Most of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators (89%) reported that teachers remain in the </p>

<p> classroom during D.A.R.E. lessons. About 72% reported </p>

<p> that classroom teachers integrate the D.A.R.E. message </p>

<p> into other activities, 39% said that teachers collect </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. homework, and 15% reported that teachers assign </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. homework. </p>

<p> The NIJ solicitation also requested that we examine </p>

<p> the extent to which members of community groups (e.g., </p>

<p> church or youth groups) participate in the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program. Indeed, recent research suggests that linking </p>

<p> school-based interventions with the larger community </p>

<p> strengthens their effectiveness (Pentz et al., 1989; </p>

<p> Perry &amp; Tobler, 1992). Therefore, we asked the </p>

<p> prevention coordinators to specify members of the </p>

<p> community who were actively involved in D.A.R.E. About </p>

<p> 51% of the coordinators said that parents were actively </p>

<p> involved, 22% indicated that civic groups were so </p>

<p> involved, 13% said that youth groups were so involved, </p>

<p> and 5% said that church groups were so involved. </p>

<p> Integration and Coordination. Another objective </p>

<p> of this study was to examine the extent of D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> integration and coordination with other school-based drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts. To address this issue, we first </p>

<p> asked coordinators to indicate the level at which </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was integrated with other AOD programs. About </p>

<p> 63% of the prevention coordinators reported D.A.R.E. was </p>

<p> very well integrated, 31% reported it was well </p>

<p> integrated, and 7% reported it was poorly integrated. To </p>

<p> determine whether D.A.R.E. was better integrated in some </p>

<p> types of school districts than in others, we examined the </p>

<p> differences in the percentages of coordinators reporting </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. was very well integrated by minority </p>

<p> status, SES, urbanicity, and district size. No </p>

<p> statistically significant differences were found.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was equally well integrated with other AOD </p>

<p> programs across different types of school districts. </p>

<p> One type of mechanism for coordinating the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> responsibilities of law enforcement with those of </p>

<p> education agencies are written agreements that solidify </p>

<p> commitment, define roles and duties, and establish sound </p>

<p> working relationships. We asked coordinators about the </p>

<p> existence of such agreements and found that approximately </p>

<p> 44% of the coordinators reported that their district had </p>

<p> a written agreement. We asked those coordinators with </p>

<p> written agreements about the contents of these </p>

<p> agreements. The following components of the agreements </p>

<p> were mentioned by the accompanying number of </p>

<p> coordinators: </p>

<p> o the responsibilities of all parties (23 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o time (21 coordinators); </p>

<p> o funding/fees (20 coordinators); </p>

<p> o scheduling (15 coordinators); </p>

<p> o curricula (10 coordinators); </p>

<p> o schools to be offered in (9 coordinators); </p>

<p> o grades used in (6 coordinators); </p>

<p> o general use of D.A.R.E. (6 coordinators); </p>

<p> o length of program (5 coordinators); </p>

<p> o school policies (4 coordinators); </p>

<p> o sequence of lessons (3 coordinators); </p>

<p> o materials (3 coordinators);=20 </p>

<p> o graduation program (3 coordinators); and </p>

<p> o &quot;don't know&quot; (4 coordinators). </p>

<p> Problems. We asked school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators to provide information concerning problems </p>

<p> with implementing and coordinating D.A.R.E., and to </p>

<p> suggest how the effectiveness of D.A.R.E. might be </p>

<p> improved.=20 </p>

<p> We asked coordinators to indicate whether there </p>

<p> were any barriers to implementing D.A.R.E. and then to </p>

<p> specify these barriers. Only 26% of the school district </p>

<p> drug prevention coordinators with D.A.R.E. mentioned any </p>

<p> barrier to implementing the program. Some 16% of the </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. mentioned inadequate funding </p>

<p> as a barrier to implementation, 13% mentioned too few </p>

<p> officers, and 11% mentioned scheduling difficulties </p>

<p> (Figure 5.5). The two most frequently mentioned barriers </p>

<p> were in areas over which the school system has little </p>

<p> control (funding and number of officers). </p>

<p> Exhibit 5.5 Problem Areas That Are Barriers to </p>

<p> Implementing D.A.R.E. in All Schools </p>

<p> Note: Based on responses of coordinators using D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> (N=3D222). </p>

<p> Next, in an open-ended question, we asked </p>

<p> coordinators to elaborate on any problems with the </p>

<p> coordination of D.A.R.E. The responses of those with </p>

<p> problems were </p>

<p> o lack of time (19 coordinators); </p>

<p> o insufficient funding/staff (12 coordinators); </p>

<p> o scheduling problems (9 coordinators); </p>

<p> o officers not good teachers (5 coordinators); </p>

<p> o difficulties getting program started (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o inadequate officer/teacher interaction (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o officer scheduling problems/absences (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o other officer problems (4 coordinators); and </p>

<p> o lack of coordination between school and </p>

<p> police (3 coordinators). </p>

<p> Finally, we asked coordinators what, if any, </p>

<p> changes they thought would make D.A.R.E. more effective </p>

<p> in their district, and then to elaborate on these </p>

<p> changes. About one-third of the coordinators mentioned </p>

<p> that there was at least one change that they thought </p>

<p> would make D.A.R.E. more effective. The following </p>

<p> responses were the changes they mentioned: </p>

<p> o expand to other grade levels (26 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase staff/officers (11 coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase parental participation (7 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase funding (6 coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase community involvement (6 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase teacher training and involvement (5 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o improve quality/dependability officers (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase integration with other curricula (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase time spent on D.A.R.E. (3 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o decrease time spent on D.A.R.E. (3 </p>

<p> coordinators); =20 </p>

<p> o increase publicity (2 coordinators); </p>

<p> o adapt curriculum to grade level (2 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o change curricula (2 coordinators); </p>

<p> o teach officers to be teachers (2 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase refresher training for officers (2 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o include D.A.R.E. as part of student </p>

<p> assistance program (1 coordinator); </p>

<p> o increase D.A.R.E.'s availability in </p>

<p> rural/isolated areas (1 coordinator). </p>

<p> Future Use of D.A.R.E. To examine whether the </p>

<p> demand for D.A.R.E. is </p>

<p> going to increase or diminish over the next few years, we </p>

<p> asked coordinators about their future plans for D.A.R.E.=20 </p>

<p> Some 43% of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. planned to </p>

<p> expand use of D.A.R.E. in the next 5 years, and 55% </p>

<p> planned to maintain the current level (only 2% planned to </p>

<p> decrease use). Of the 208 school districts without </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., 38% had not considered using D.A.R.E., 21% </p>

<p> planned to implement D.A.R.E. in the future, 20% were </p>

<p> undecided, 15% reported they definitely will not use </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., and 6% had discontinued use of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Further, to determine whether any particular type </p>

<p> of school district was more likely to expand use of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in the next 5 years, we examined the differences </p>

<p> in the percentages of districts planning to increase </p>

<p> their use of D.A.R.E. by minority status, SES, or </p>

<p> urbanicity. No statistically significant differences </p>

<p> were found. Plans for the expansion of D.A.R.E. were </p>

<p> fairly equal across different types of school districts.=20 </p>

<p> National Prevalence Estimates of D.A.R.E. and Other AOD </p>

<p> Programs </p>

<p> The second objective of this survey was to develop </p>

<p> national estimates of the prevalence of D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs. To accomplish this objective, we </p>

<p> asked coordinators to indicate all published drug </p>

<p> prevention curricula used by the school district in the </p>

<p> 1991-1992 school year. Based on previous research and </p>

<p> discussions with school-based drug prevention curricula </p>

<p> experts, we provided a list of 13 published curricula </p>

<p> that we thought coordinators would mention most often.=20 </p>

<p> In addition, we provided ample space for open-ended </p>

<p> responses concerning other published curricula. We </p>

<p> used this information in combination with the sample </p>

<p> stratification variables to develop estimates by </p>

<p> geographical area, ethnicity, SES, and urbanicity. We </p>

<p> also asked respondents to complete a series of questions </p>

<p> concerning grade levels and substances targeted, as well </p>

<p> as type of teachers for each of these curricula.=20 </p>

<p> Based on the number of school districts in our </p>

<p> sample using the three most frequently mentioned </p>

<p> curricula, we estimated the number of school districts </p>

<p> nationwide using these curricula. These prevalence </p>

<p> estimates and other findings concerning the three most </p>

<p> frequently mentioned published drug prevention curricula </p>

<p> used in the 1991-1992 school year are presented below. </p>

<p> Prevalence. According to our estimates, the </p>

<p> published curricula used most often by our respondents in </p>

<p> the 1991-1992 school year were D.A.R.E., Quest, and </p>

<p> Here's Looking at You. Exhibit 5.6 presents the </p>

<p> estimated numbers and percentages of school districts </p>

<p> nationwide using these three curricula overall and by the </p>

<p> districts' region, urbanicity, SES, minority status, and </p>

<p> district size. Urban/suburban school districts were </p>

<p> significantly more likely than small school districts to </p>

<p> use D.A.R.E. (p&lt;.01). =20 </p>

<p> Grade Levels Targeted. To determine grade levels </p>

<p> targeted by each of the three most frequently used </p>

<p> curricula, we asked coordinators to indicate which </p>

<p> curricula were used in the school district at each grade </p>

<p> level. Grade levels targeted by coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. were presented in Exhibit 5.2. Around 46% of </p>

<p> the school districts with Quest targeted the program to </p>

<p> the elementary school level, 81% to the middle/junior </p>

<p> high school level, and 12% to the senior high school </p>

<p> level. Almost 89% of the school districts with HLY </p>

<p> targeted the program to the elementary school level, 55% </p>

<p> to the middle/junior high school level, and 35% to the </p>

<p> senior high school level. Coordinators reported that all </p>

<p> three curricula were more likely to target elementary or </p>

<p> middle/junior high school levels. </p>

<p> Substances Targeted. To determine whether the </p>

<p> three most frequently mentioned curricula differed in </p>

<p> substances targeted by the program, we asked the school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators to indicate which </p>

<p> substances each of the prevention curricula targeted. We </p>

<p> found no significant differences in substances targeted </p>

<p> among D.A.R.E., Quest, and HLY (Exhibit 5.7). All three </p>

<p> of the packages were comprehensive in targeting all </p>

<p> substances.=20 </p>

<p> indicate who taught each of the prevention curricula. As </p>

<p> expected, almost all school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators reported that police officers were </p>

<p> responsible for teaching the D.A.R.E. curricula.=20 </p>

<p> Classroom teachers were primarily responsible for </p>

<p> teaching Quest and HLY (Exhibit 5.7). More than one- </p>

<p> fifth of the coordinators reported that classroom </p>

<p> teachers were also involved in teaching D.A.R.E. =20 </p>

<p> Comparison of D.A.R.E. and Other AOD Programs </p>

<p> The final objective of this study was to make </p>

<p> comparisons between D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs on a </p>

<p> variety of issues. Comparison data are presented in this </p>

<p> section. Topics include funding, satisfaction with the </p>

<p> curricula, support for the curricula, and adaptations to </p>

<p> curricula. We asked respondents to report on other AOD </p>

<p> curricula in general because it would have been too </p>

<p> burdensome and time-consuming for them to answer each of </p>

<p> the questions for every curricula in use during the 1991- </p>

<p> 1992 school year. =20 </p>

<p> We first asked school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. (222 of the 429 respondents) </p>

<p> to answer a set of survey items concerning their D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> programs only. We asked all coordinators using other </p>

<p> (non-D.A.R.E.) AOD programs (406 of the 429 respondents) </p>

<p> to answer an identical set of items concerning their </p>

<p> other AOD curricula only. The respondents using both </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs answered both sets of </p>

<p> items. Information gathered from these matched sets of </p>

<p> questions allowed a direct comparison of responses about </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. curricula with responses concerning other </p>

<p> AOD curricula. Only 3% of the districts used only </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.; 46% used only other AOD curricula; and 49% used </p>

<p> both D.A.R.E. and other AOD curricula. </p>

<p> Funding. The first comparisons we examined were </p>

<p> comparisons of funding. We asked respondents to indicate </p>

<p> all sources of funding for the districts' D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs (Exhibit 5.8). The most frequently </p>

<p> mentioned sources of funding for D.A.R.E. were law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies and DFSCA education funds. The most </p>

<p> frequently mentioned sources of funding for other AOD </p>

<p> programs were DFSCA education funds and school district </p>

<p> funds. D.A.R.E. programs were more likely than other AOD </p>

<p> programs to receive funding from city/county funds, </p>

<p> corporate donations, and individual donations. </p>

<p> Satisfaction with Curricula. Next, we compared </p>

<p> satisfaction ratings for each of the curricula. We asked </p>

<p> the school district drug prevention coordinators to rate </p>

<p> five program components as very satisfactory, </p>

<p> satisfactory, unsatisfactory or very unsatisfactory. The </p>

<p> five components were curriculum, teaching, administrative </p>

<p> requirements, student receptivity, and effects on </p>

<p> students. None of the respondents with D.A.R.E. rated </p>

<p> any of the five components as very unsatisfactory.=20 </p>

<p> Approximately 1% of the respondents with other AOD </p>

<p> programs rated teaching, administrative requirements, or </p>

<p> effects on students as very unsatisfactory. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was much more likely than other AOD </p>

<p> programs to be viewed by the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators as very satisfactory on each of </p>

<p> the five components (Exhibit 5.9). Well over half of the </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. rated each of the components </p>

<p> as very satisfactory. Between 23% and 35% of the </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs rated each of the </p>

<p> components as very satisfactory. Students' receptivity </p>

<p> was the component with the highest percentage of </p>

<p> coordinators rating it as very satisfactory for both </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs. =20 </p>

<p> To determine whether school districts with </p>

<p> particular characteristics were more likely to rate </p>

<p> program components as very satisfactory than other </p>

<p> districts, we examined ratings of each of the components </p>

<p> by these characteristics. Among coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., those in high-percentage minority districts </p>

<p> were significantly more likely than those in low- </p>

<p> percentage minority districts to rate student receptivity </p>

<p> as very satisfactory (p&lt;.05) (Exhibit 5.10). Among </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs, those in urban </p>

<p> districts were significantly more likely (p&lt;.05) than </p>

<p> those in rural districts to rate student receptivity and </p>

<p> there were no significant differences in support between </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs in urban and rural districts or between </p>

<p> other AOD programs in urban and rural districts. </p>

<p> Adaptations of Curricula. Some drug prevention </p>

<p> curricula, such as D.A.R.E., require instructors to </p>

<p> strictly adhere to the curricula and established </p>

<p> procedures. Other curricula allow instructors to adapt </p>

<p> the curricula to meet their particular needs. However, </p>

<p> little is known about how prevention curricula are </p>

<p> actually adapted. We asked the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators whether D.A.R.E. or other AOD </p>

<p> programs were adapted in any way as a result of gang </p>

<p> activity, drug availability, the racial/ethnic </p>

<p> composition of the district, student or community </p>

<p> poverty, urbanicity, or for some other reason. About 43% </p>

<p> of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. reported adapting </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. for at least one of these reasons, while about </p>

<p> 54% of the coordinators with other AOD programs reported </p>

<p> adapting for one of these reasons. </p>

<p> Exhibit 5.15 presents the percentage adapting </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD curricula as a result of the </p>

<p> above-mentioned issues. The most frequently mentioned </p>

<p> reasons for adapting both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs </p>

<p> were drug availability and student/community poverty. </p>

<p> Respondents with D.A.R.E. were provided with </p>

<p> additional space to explain ways in which the curricula </p>

<p> were adapted. Adaptations mentioned by the coordinators </p>

<p> included: </p>

<p> o targeting particular drugs </p>

<p> prevalent in the area; </p>

<p> o making adaptations for the </p>

<p> physically and mentally </p>

<p> handicapped; </p>

<p> o adding more information on </p>

<p> violence prevention; </p>

<p> o discussing drug abuse in the home </p>

<p> environment; </p>

<p> o teaching students to be more </p>

<p> tolerant of others; </p>

<p> o discussing local drug arrests; </p>

<p> o involving high school students as </p>

<p> role models; </p>

<p> o communicating with families of </p>

<p> youth to gain familial support </p>

<p> and ensure attendance at </p>

<p> graduation; </p>

<p> o taking field trips; and </p>

<p> o omitting lessons. </p>

<p> General Drug Policies </p>

<p> In this final section of Chapter 5, we present </p>

<p> information from responses to questions that were </p>

<p> designed to examine general drug policies in the school </p>

<p> districts. All coordinators responded to these questions </p>

<p> regardless of whether they used D.A.R.E. or any other </p>

<p> drug prevention curricula. =20 </p>

<p> Anti-Drug Policies. We first asked whether the </p>

<p> school district had a written anti-drug policy. We found </p>

<p> that 96% did have such a policy. </p>

<p> Student Assistance Programs. One type of drug </p>

<p> prevention program that many schools have adopted is the </p>

<p> student assistance program (SAP). Modeled after employee </p>

<p> assistance programs (EAPs) in businesses, SAPs conduct </p>

<p> such activities as screening for alcohol and drug </p>

<p> involvement, making referrals, and developing and </p>

<p> coordinating early intervention plans for youth with </p>

<p> problems that could lead to substance abuse. =20 </p>

<p> Almost 55% of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators reported that their districts had SAPs in </p>

<p> place during the 1991-1992 school year. Of the 237 </p>

<p> districts with SAPs, 51% targeted these programs to the </p>

<p> elementary school level, 78% focused on the middle/junior </p>

<p> high school level, and 81% targeted the senior high </p>

<p> school level. </p>

<p> We asked the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators using SAPs to indicate what types of </p>

<p> individuals were trained to participate in these programs </p>

<p> (Exhibit 5.16). Almost 89% of the coordinators mentioned </p>

<p> that teachers had been trained, and nearly 75% mentioned </p>

<p> that principals and guidance counselors had been trained </p>

<p> to participate in SAPs. </p>

<p> We also asked the coordinators using SAPs to </p>

<p> indicate the types of individuals who actually </p>

<p> implemented the programs and how effective they were </p>

<p> (Exhibit 5.17). Coordinators most frequently mentioned </p>

<p> that teachers, principals, guidance counselors, and </p>

<p> students implemented SAPs. However, they perceived </p>

<p> guidance counselors, D.A.R.E. officers, and </p>

<p> district/school nurses as the most effective at </p>

<p> implementing these programs. Coordinators most </p>

<p> frequently mentioned that community professionals and </p>

<p> community volunteers were not effective.=20 </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> This chapter focused on the results of our </p>

<p> nationally representative, random sample of 500 school </p>

<p> districts. A total of 429 school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators responded to the survey. Data </p>

<p> presented in this chapter were weighted to take into </p>

<p> account the complex sample design. </p>

<p> Over half of the school districts in the United </p>

<p> States used D.A.R.E. in the 1991-1992 school year.=20 </p>

<p> Additionally, demand for the program is going to increase </p>

<p> over the next few years; two-fifths of those with the </p>

<p> program planned to expand its use and one-fifth of these </p>

<p> without the program plan to begin use. The two other </p>

<p> most frequently used packaged curricula were Quest and </p>

<p> Here's Looking at You, both used by about one-fourth of </p>

<p> the districts. </p>

<p> Only 3% of the districts used only D.A.R.E.; 46% </p>

<p> used only other AOD curricula; and 49% used both D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and other AOD curricula. Most of the coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. reported receiving funding for the program from </p>

<p> law enforcement and/or DFSCA funds. Most of the </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs reported receiving </p>

<p> funding for these programs from DFSCA and/or district </p>

<p> funds. D.A.R.E. was more likely than other AOD programs </p>

<p> to be rated very satisfactory in terms of curriculum, </p>

<p> teaching, administrative requirements, student </p>

<p> receptivity, and effects on students. Furthermore, </p>

<p> coordinators were more likely to indicate that the </p>

<p> community, school personnel, students, parents, law </p>

<p> enforcement, and civic groups were very supportive of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E than of other AOD programs. Around two-fifths of </p>

<p> the coordinators with D.A.R.E. and over one-half the </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs reported adapting </p>

<p> the program to meet their needs. The most common reasons </p>

<p> for adaptation for both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs </p>

<p> were drug availability and student/community poverty. </p>

<p> Most of the D.A.R.E. programs were administered at </p>

<p> the local level by a single law enforcement agency (i.e., </p>

<p> sheriff's department or city/town police department). In </p>

<p> most districts, coordinators reported that officer </p>

<p> selection and classroom activities were the </p>

<p> responsibility of the police, while school and classroom </p>

<p> selection were the responsibility of education. </p>

<p> Findings from this chapter and resulting </p>

<p> recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 6 </p>

<p> SITE VISITS </p>

<p> The final component of the implementation </p>

<p> assessment consisted of site visits to school districts.=20 </p>

<p> We designed these visits to obtain a snapshot of the </p>

<p> organization and operations of D.A.R.E. and other school- </p>

<p> based drug prevention programs. The site visits also </p>

<p> gave us an opportunity to speak with the officers, </p>

<p> teachers, and students directly and to see the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program in action.=20 </p>

<p> For the site visits, we selected four schools in </p>

<p> three school districts. Two of the school districts were </p>

<p> adjacent to one another in a northern inner-city </p>

<p> environment, with a large minority population and a </p>

<p> substantial drug problem. The third school district was </p>

<p> located in a rural area in the South; it also had a </p>

<p> substantial minority population but less of a drug </p>

<p> problem. The school in one urban school district had </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., and the school in the other urban district did </p>

<p> not have D.A.R.E. In the rural district, one school had </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and one did not. </p>

<p> Because the school districts and schools were </p>

<p> limited in number and purposively, rather than randomly, </p>

<p> selected, the information gathered from these sites is </p>

<p> not representative of schools in general. We present </p>

<p> data gathered from this component of the assessment to </p>

<p> illustrate and complement findings from other components </p>

<p> of the implementation assessment. We recognize the need </p>

<p> to exercise caution in interpreting site visit findings </p>

<p> and encourage readers to use similar discretion. </p>

<p> For the site visit interviews and observations, we </p>

<p> developed site visit protocols that were based on issues </p>

<p> raised in the previous components of the implementation </p>

<p> assessment. The protocols were designed to elicit </p>

<p> general, open-ended, and free-flowing discussions. We </p>

<p> used protocols instead of structured surveys because we </p>

<p> believed the structured format would inhibit the </p>

<p> exploration of schools' individual characteristics.=20 </p>

<p> Further, we expected respondents would provide us with a </p>

<p> wealth of information that a structured format might have </p>

<p> prevented. We often departed from the protocols to </p>

<p> follow up any line of inquiry that appeared of potential </p>

<p> interest. As a result, the reports from our sites are in </p>

<p> some ways dissimilar. Copies of the protocols can be </p>

<p> found in Appendix D. =20 </p>

<p> Site visits were conducted by two teams. Each team </p>

<p> included at least one senior investigator with </p>

<p> considerable experience in conducting site visits. A </p>

<p> two-person team conducted a 2-day site visit in the urban </p>

<p> schools, and a four-person team conducted a 1-day site </p>

<p> visit in the rural schools. Two or more site visitors </p>

<p> jointly interviewed key individuals, and each interviewer </p>

<p> took notes to reduce the chances of missing key </p>

<p> information. When appropriate, we interviewed up to four </p>

<p> individuals at the same time. </p>

<p> Each team conducted interviews with a variety of </p>

<p> individuals, including </p>

<p> o the coordinator responsible for the </p>

<p> development and implementation of drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts in the school </p>

<p> district; </p>

<p> o individuals teaching drug prevention </p>

<p> curricula to students (including </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers at schools with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.), </p>

<p> o their supervisors (if any), and </p>

<p> o teachers in whose classes D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers teach (at D.A.R.E. sites). </p>

<p> When available, we also interviewed others involved in </p>

<p> drug prevention program planning, delivery, or referral </p>

<p> (e.g., representatives of community advisory or drug </p>

<p> action groups). =20 </p>

<p> In each of the two D.A.R.E. schools, the site visit </p>

<p> team monitored a D.A.R.E. lesson and the officer's </p>

<p> activities in the school outside the classroom. We also </p>

<p> observed a drug prevention lesson in both of the schools </p>

<p> without D.A.R.E. We note that both of the classroom </p>

<p> observations in the non-D.A.R.E. schools were conducted </p>

<p> in special education classes. The selection of classes </p>

<p> to be monitored was based on what teacher was teaching </p>

<p> drug prevention the day of our site visit and the </p>

<p> discretion of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator. </p>

<p> This chapter contains two sections. In the first, </p>

<p> we discuss drug prevention programming in the urban </p>

<p> schools; and in the second, we describe drug prevention </p>

<p> programming in the rural schools. Within each section, </p>

<p> we present information about the D.A.R.E. school, </p>

<p> followed by information about the non-D.A.R.E. school. </p>

<p> Urban Schools </p>

<p> Urban School with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> The school we selected received D.A.R.E. after </p>

<p> being on a waiting list for approximately 1 year; all </p>

<p> 5th-grade classes and one 6th-grade class in the school </p>

<p> received D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> We interviewed three individuals involved in the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. program: </p>

<p> o the police administrator in </p>

<p> charge of the local D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program (an officer with many </p>

<p> years of experience who had </p>

<p> administered D.A.R.E. for </p>

<p> 5 years); </p>

<p> o a D.A.R.E. officer (involved with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. for 5 years and </p>

<p> currently teaching 16 classes a </p>

<p> week); =20 </p>

<p> o the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinator.=20 </p>

<p> The following summarizes our discussions with these </p>

<p> respondents. =20 </p>

<p> Administration. According to the police </p>

<p> administrator, the D.A.R.E. program in this city follows </p>

<p> the same procedures employed nationally. He stated that </p>

<p> the local police, State police, and Board of Education </p>

<p> work together to provide the D.A.R.E. program. He </p>

<p> further indicated that this coordination has ensured the </p>

<p> integrity of D.A.R.E.'s implementation, D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> consistency with drug education required by the State, </p>

<p> and smooth integration with other drug education </p>

<p> initiatives. =20 </p>

<p> Implementation. Initial steps in the </p>

<p> implementation of the D.A.R.E. program, as reported by </p>

<p> the police administrator, are as follows. The local </p>

<p> police department conducts initial screening of candidate </p>

<p> officers for the D.A.R.E. program. Potential D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers are interviewed by the local police department, </p>

<p> and then by the State police. Successfully screened </p>

<p> candidates are sent for a 2-week training program offered </p>

<p> by the State police. After completing the training, </p>

<p> officers are assigned to particular schools or sets of </p>

<p> schools by the local police department. The D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer who was interviewed indicated that he is assigned </p>

<p> a general target area and allowed to select the schools </p>

<p> in that area in which he wishes to teach. He indicated </p>

<p> that he and other officers are provided with a list of </p>

<p> schools that have requested D.A.R.E. to guide their </p>

<p> selections. He further reported that no more than 20% of </p>

<p> the schools he selects can be private. </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, a limited </p>

<p> attempt is made to match officer and student </p>

<p> characteristics. For example, he stated that in the </p>

<p> Hispanic community, the local police department attempts </p>

<p> to provide D.A.R.E. officers who can speak Spanish.=20 </p>

<p> Beyond this, however, he indicated that little matching </p>

<p> occurs. =20 </p>

<p> The police administrator said that the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program is monitored by both the State and local police </p>

<p> departments. He reported that a staff member from the </p>

<p> State police visits each D.A.R.E. instructor during the </p>

<p> year to observe and assess teaching skills and students' </p>

<p> receptiveness to the program, as well as to solicit </p>

<p> feedback from classroom teachers. The administrator also </p>

<p> stated that he monitors classroom activities as part of </p>

<p> his supervisory responsibilities. </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, school </p>

<p> personnel are very supportive of the D.A.R.E. program, in </p>

<p> part because the program is free to the school. The </p>

<p> schools are, thus, able to use their drug prevention </p>

<p> resources for additional drug prevention purposes. </p>

<p> The police administrator indicated that some </p>

<p> teachers get involved in the D.A.R.E. program because of </p>

<p> personal interest, but that most do not. The D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer reported that although State policy requires </p>

<p> teachers to remain in the classroom during the lesson, </p>

<p> they assist him only in disciplinary matters. The drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinator indicated that although teachers </p>

<p> do not participate in teaching the lessons, they have </p>

<p> been very receptive both to the program and the officers.=20 </p>

<p> The coordinator noted that teachers cannot be required to </p>

<p> allow D.A.R.E. into their classrooms, and the fact that </p>

<p> no teacher has refused D.A.R.E. indicates the degree of </p>

<p> acceptance that the program enjoys. When asked about </p>

<p> problems between regular teachers and D.A.R.E. officers, </p>

<p> the police administrator reported that although there are </p>

<p> some individuals who do not get along, it is not a </p>

<p> system-wide problem. The D.A.R.E. officer stated that </p>

<p> although principals are supportive of the program, he has </p>

<p> yet to see one in his classes, and that no other school </p>

<p> staff participate in the program. </p>

<p> The police administrator indicated that parental </p>

<p> involvement generally has taken the form of assistance </p>

<p> from the PTA in co-sponsoring D.A.R.E. graduation </p>

<p> ceremonies. However, he stated that the level of </p>

<p> parental involvement varies substantially from one school </p>

<p> to another. The D.A.R.E. officer reported that in his </p>

<p> experience parents generally do not show an active </p>

<p> interest in D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, the </p>

<p> investment of the community in the D.A.R.E. program is </p>

<p> limited. He further indicated that D.A.R.E. officers </p>

<p> have little time to seek community involvement: &quot;The </p>

<p> reality is that the D.A.R.E. instructor has a full day </p>

<p> teaching classes; there isn't time to do anything
else.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer also reported that community groups </p>

<p> have little participation in the program. </p>

<p> Funding. The police administrator reported that </p>

<p> when the D.A.R.E. program began in this city, much of the </p>

<p> funding came from the Federal Government (i.e., from BJA </p>

<p> through a grant to the State police). He reported that </p>

<p> support received from the State police is currently </p>

<p> limited to training and materials. Salaries of officers </p>

<p> and supervisors are paid by the local police department, </p>

<p> and limited contributions are provided by the community.=20 </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, there is real </p>

<p> danger of D.A.R.E. becoming a victim of budget cuts </p>

<p> because of the current budget crisis; he indicated that </p>

<p> implementation has already been severely restricted </p>

<p> because of lack of resources. </p>

<p> Curriculum. We asked the police administrator </p>

<p> whether the D.A.R.E. curriculum was adapted to meet the </p>

<p> special needs of his area. He responded, &quot;We teach </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. D.A.R.E. is D.A.R.E. Once you decide to use a </p>

<p> program that is administered throughout the country, then </p>

<p> you do not tailor it.&quot; When asked about addressing the </p>

<p> needs resulting from gang activity, he indicated that </p>

<p> officers incorporate their own street experiences and </p>

<p> information they received from the police academy into </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. gang lessons. He reported that local gangs </p>

<p> and their behaviors are discussed. =20 </p>

<p> The police administrator stated that local D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> advocates believe that classroom activity should be </p>

<p> supported by parental involvement. He, however, did not </p>

<p> express interest in the parent curriculum at this time.=20 </p>

<p> The reasons he gave were that the program is still </p>

<p> experimental and has not been evaluated, the supply of </p>

<p> officers is already inadequate to meet the demand, and </p>

<p> the cost of the parent program would dramatically </p>

<p> increase overall costs (i.e., because the parent </p>

<p> curriculum is generally offered in the evening, officers </p>

<p> would be paid time-and-a-half). The police administrator </p>

<p> stated that &quot;If more money was available, this (parent </p>

<p> curriculum) would certainly be an option the local </p>

<p> department would look into.&quot; </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. The police </p>

<p> administrator stated, &quot;One of our major problems is that
</p>

<p> we have so few officers and so many schools.&quot; He </p>

<p> indicated that the department tries to &quot;keep D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> moving through the schools&quot; and to cover as many
students </p>

<p> as possible. The administrator reported that although </p>

<p> this rotation policy maximizes the number of schools </p>

<p> reached within the department's limited resources, it </p>

<p> also creates problems (i.e., just about the time the </p>

<p> school becomes accustomed to D.A.R.E., the program is </p>

<p> discontinued and moved to another school). The </p>

<p> administrator reported that many school officials are </p>

<p> angry about this policy. </p>

<p> The police administrator also indicated the need </p>

<p> for more evaluation. He stated, &quot;Evaluation is the only </p>

<p> way to find out what works and what doesn't. I don't </p>

<p> think we're ever going to find that D.A.R.E. solves the </p>

<p> drug problem in the United States, but that it is a first </p>

<p> step. Evaluation must be written into everything. It </p>

<p> has taken too long for evaluations to come about.&quot; He </p>

<p> said that he would at least like to have information on </p>

<p> how effective the program is in suburban, rural, and </p>

<p> inner-city areas. He asked, &quot;If we find the program is </p>

<p> working in a certain area, that's great, but what can we </p>

<p> do in the other areas to enrich the program and diversify </p>

<p> it to meet those needs?&quot; =20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer mentioned several problems </p>

<p> areas. First, he indicated that although one of his </p>

<p> schools is heavily Hispanic, it does not have D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> books in Spanish. Second, he stated that the program was </p>

<p> designed for the officer to stay in contact with the </p>

<p> school and that in his current situation, he is in and </p>

<p> out of the school with little chance for further contact </p>

<p> with the students. Finally, he reported the need for </p>

<p> greater recognition of graduates of the program.=20 </p>

<p> &quot;Something should be done to get the parents and </p>

<p> principals more involved so that students feel they have </p>

<p> really accomplished something that has meaning.&quot; </p>

<p> The only problem mentioned by the drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator was the need for a bilingual officer. </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a fifth-grade </p>

<p> classroom of 25 students, composed of 6 Hispanics, 4 </p>

<p> African Americans, and 15 Caucasians. Two of the </p>

<p> students spoke limited English and needed translations of </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. lesson.=20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. instructor was a white male police </p>

<p> officer in his forties who was dressed in regulation </p>

<p> uniform. The officer presented himself to the class as a </p>

<p> friend. The officer's teaching style was very </p>

<p> straightforward and &quot;streetwise,&quot; and he was both
gruff </p>

<p> and engaging. He was very knowledgeable about the </p>

<p> material and taught the whole lesson without notes. The </p>

<p> interaction between officer and students was an easy, </p>

<p> bantering one. </p>

<p> The 40-minute lesson that we observed focused on </p>

<p> the media and how advertisement can be used to persuade </p>

<p> consumers and children to purchase and use different </p>

<p> products. The lesson began with a short introductory </p>

<p> lecture on the influences of advertising and the goals of </p>

<p> the media. The officer then asked students questions </p>

<p> about different products to show them how much they have </p>

<p> learned from the media. The officer gave examples of </p>

<p> different types of advertisements (e.g., &quot;personal </p>

<p> testimony,&quot; &quot;bandwagon&quot;) and also used ads
from magazines </p>

<p> to illustrate his point. Most of the class period (30 </p>

<p> minutes) was spent in interaction. =20 </p>

<p> During the class, the students were rowdy but </p>

<p> attentive. They called out answers to the officer's </p>

<p> questions and felt free to make comments. The students </p>

<p> treated the officer with genuine respect. The interest </p>

<p> and interaction level in this particular lesson was high.=20 </p>

<p> The classroom teacher was present during the </p>

<p> lesson, leaving only once to go to the principal's </p>

<p> office. The teacher sat at the back of the room grading </p>

<p> papers; however, he had a D.A.R.E. book and followed the </p>

<p> lesson as it progressed. Most of the teacher's input </p>

<p> occurred in the beginning of the class before the lesson </p>

<p> got started. The only other time the teacher spoke was </p>

<p> to maintain discipline in the classroom, and then he only </p>

<p> reprimanded talkers. </p>

<p> Once the lesson was completed, the officer left </p>

<p> immediately. There was no evidence of any outside </p>

<p> contact with students. =20 </p>

<p> Urban School Without D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> We interviewed two individuals at the non-D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> school, the drug prevention coordinator for that school </p>

<p> district and the classroom teacher who taught the drug </p>

<p> prevention lesson that we observed. The following </p>

<p> summarizes the discussions with these individuals. </p>

<p> Administration. The drug prevention coordinator </p>

<p> reported that there is no specific drug prevention </p>

<p> program in place. She indicated that drug prevention </p>

<p> textbooks are used and, at times, individuals from </p>

<p> outside the school make presentations at drug prevention </p>

<p> assemblies. According to the coordinator, a teacher </p>

<p> might incorporate a drug prevention lesson into a reading </p>

<p> class or show a video. She stated, &quot;We put together lots
</p>

<p> of little things that add up to something you might call </p>

<p> a program, but we don't have a structured program.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> Implementation. The coordinator indicated that </p>

<p> each student at the school receives drug education </p>

<p> information at least on a monthly basis. However, she </p>

<p> reported that lower grades receive less and in a more </p>

<p> loosely structured format. The teacher reported that he </p>

<p> makes sure his students receive some drug prevention </p>

<p> education every week. According to the coordinator, </p>

<p> classroom teachers do not have specific times set aside </p>

<p> for drug prevention, but rather fit it in when they can.=20 </p>

<p> The seventh and eighth graders do use and follow a drug </p>

<p> prevention textbook and have regular discussions. =20 </p>

<p> The coordinator indicated that teachers' support </p>

<p> for the drug prevention program depended on which teacher </p>

<p> you were talking about. She indicated that all teachers </p>

<p> think that drug prevention education is important, but </p>

<p> that some are far more committed than others to </p>

<p> incorporating drug prevention lessons into their </p>

<p> curriculum. The classroom teacher stated that most of </p>

<p> his fellow teachers support the school's drug prevention </p>

<p> efforts, but that some teachers just did not know how to </p>

<p> talk to students about issues like drugs and gangs. He </p>

<p> stated, &quot;Some either don't know what to say or just
don't </p>

<p> care enough.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> The coordinator reported that law enforcement </p>

<p> personnel have been sporadically involved in the school's </p>

<p> drug prevention activities and have attended local school </p>

<p> council meetings and conducted in-service training with </p>

<p> teachers about drug awareness. She noted that 2 years </p>

<p> ago law enforcement officials came into the school to </p>

<p> work with students targeted as high risk. She stated </p>

<p> that &quot;the success of that program depended upon whether </p>

<p> or not the student accepted the officer.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> When we asked the coordinator about the involvement </p>

<p> of individuals from the community in the school's drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts, she responded that no person from the </p>

<p> community has been involved in implementing the school's </p>

<p> drug prevention program. She indicated that most of the </p>

<p> community has no idea about what the school is doing in </p>

<p> terms of drug prevention education. She stated, &quot;I don't
</p>

<p> think the community feels that it is their place to be </p>

<p> involved.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> Funding. According to the drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator, there were virtually no drug prevention </p>

<p> activities until the school began receiving money </p>

<p> specifically designated for drug prevention education </p>

<p> (DFSCA) about 3 or 4 years ago. She reported that the </p>

<p> school was currently in its third year of receiving DFSCA </p>

<p> funds and that the amount of funding had steadily </p>

<p> increased over those years. She noted, however, that </p>

<p> this funding cannot be counted on from year to year, and </p>

<p> it is difficult for the school to make long-term plans.=20 </p>

<p> According to the coordinator, the lack of resources </p>

<p> prevents consistency in the school's drug prevention </p>

<p> program. =20 </p>

<p> Curriculum. The drug prevention coordinator </p>

<p> indicated that although all drugs are covered by their </p>

<p> drug prevention efforts, alcohol is targeted. The </p>

<p> coordinator and the classroom teacher both reported that </p>

<p> alcohol is the most widely abused drug among children and </p>

<p> adults in their community. The teacher indicated that he </p>

<p> spends a great deal of time on this issue and that he </p>

<p> spends more time teaching students about self-esteem and </p>

<p> resisting peer pressure than teaching specifically about </p>

<p> drugs. The classroom teacher stated it is a mistake to </p>

<p> spend too much time educating students about the types of </p>

<p> drugs and their effects unless a strong foundation of </p>

<p> self-esteem has first been created. </p>

<p> When we asked whether the school drug prevention </p>

<p> program had been adapted to meet the needs of ethnic </p>

<p> minorities, the coordinator indicated that stereotypes </p>

<p> about who is on drugs and who is selling drugs are </p>

<p> reflected in the materials she has purchased; that is, </p>

<p> many of the pictures are of minorities. If anything, she </p>

<p> felt that white suburbs would have to work more with </p>

<p> adapting materials to fit their population. The </p>

<p> classroom teacher indicated that he was aware of the </p>

<p> cultural diversity in his school and addressed it on an </p>

<p> individual basis with students and their parents. The </p>

<p> teacher expressed frustration about the difficulty of </p>

<p> teaching drug prevention when many of the students live </p>

<p> in homes where the norm is to &quot;drink heavily and abuse </p>

<p> family members.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. The drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator said that in the future she would like to </p>

<p> purchase a packaged curriculum=FEpossibly D.A.R.E. She </p>

<p> indicated that she did not know very much about D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> but would like information about how to get the program.=20 </p>

<p> One negative factor she reported having heard about </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is that there is a long waiting list for the </p>

<p> program. She stated, &quot;When you first called and asked if
</p>

<p> we had D.A.R.E., I got excited and thought that someone </p>

<p> was going to give us D.A.R.E.; I don't really know what </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is, but I assume that because it is in other </p>

<p> schools, it is good.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> The drug prevention coordinator also indicated that </p>

<p> she would like to increase the amount and consistency of </p>

<p> delivery of the drug prevention education program, and to </p>

<p> bring greater structure to. The coordinator and the </p>

<p> classroom teacher both reported that they want to have </p>

<p> the drug prevention program administered by one person </p>

<p> who would come in and take responsibility for the </p>

<p> program. =20 </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a special </p>

<p> education class of 22 students. It was a remedial class </p>

<p> comprising 14 Hispanics, 6 African Americans, and 2 </p>

<p> Caucasians. There were 12 girls and 10 boys. =20 </p>

<p> The teacher was a white man in his forties, dressed </p>

<p> in a suit and tie. He encouraged the students and drew </p>

<p> on their strengths. He often called on students who </p>

<p> would not otherwise volunteer answers and helped them </p>

<p> formulate answers. When an answer was not exactly </p>

<p> correct, he encouraged the student to think further about </p>

<p> the question asked. The teacher carefully and adequately </p>

<p> answered students' questions. </p>

<p> The topic of the observed lesson concerned the </p>

<p> functioning of the lung and heart. This was a lesson </p>

<p> designed to provide students with background information </p>

<p> about the human body, before the impact of drugs on the </p>

<p> body's major organs were discussed. The teacher followed </p>

<p> the textbook closely. Because the students were slow </p>

<p> learners, he altered the lesson slightly by asking the </p>

<p> students to read sections aloud and then immediately </p>

<p> asking questions about the section just covered. Most </p>

<p> students appeared interested in the lesson. They </p>

<p> followed along in the textbook and answered questions </p>

<p> with sincerity. A few students consistently put their </p>

<p> hands up to answer questions, but most were quiet. There </p>

<p> were no discipline problems during the class. After </p>

<p> class, we asked the teacher whether he ever used group </p>

<p> discussions. He reported that this group of students was </p>

<p> too remedial to use a discussion format. =20 </p>

<p> Rural Schools </p>

<p> Rural School with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. program in the rural district employed </p>

<p> four D.A.R.E. officers. We interviewed five individuals, </p>

<p> including: </p>

<p> o the police administrator in charge of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. program, </p>

<p> o a D.A.R.E. officer, </p>

<p> o the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator, </p>

<p> o the school guidance counselor, and </p>

<p> o the teacher in whose class the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer taught. </p>

<p> The following summarizes our discussions with these </p>

<p> respondents. </p>

<p> Administration. The police administrator indicated </p>

<p> that the D.A.R.E. program was administered by the city </p>

<p> police department. He reported that this was the first </p>

<p> semester that D.A.R.E. had been offered in this </p>

<p> particular school. He stated that the agreement between </p>

<p> the school and police department is informal. </p>

<p> Implementation. The police administrator reported </p>

<p> that the initial steps in implementing the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program include selection of a D.A.R.E. officer by the </p>

<p> local police department, approval of the officer by the </p>

<p> State police, and training for the officer at a D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> training course. </p>

<p> The officer reported that there are no problems </p>

<p> coordinating D.A.R.E. activities. He stated that there </p>

<p> is &quot;eagerness from all sides to make the program
work.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> According to the officer, some classroom teachers </p>

<p> participate in the lesson, but most do not. He further </p>

<p> indicated that much of the time students are just as </p>

<p> receptive without the teacher present. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer indicated that parents are </p>

<p> becoming more involved in the program. He stated that </p>

<p> they are very interested and supportive of D.A.R.E., and </p>

<p> that his attendance at nonclassroom school functions, </p>

<p> such as Friday night dances, has greatly improved his </p>

<p> relationships with parents. He reported that he hopes to </p>

<p> receive training on the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum as </p>

<p> soon as possible. </p>

<p> According to the officer and the police </p>

<p> administrator, there was little community involvement.=20 </p>

<p> They attributed this to the program being new and hoped </p>

<p> that there would be more community involvement in the </p>

<p> coming semesters. However, the coordinator did report </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. is well received by the &quot;educated&quot; </p>

<p> community. He indicated that churches in the community </p>

<p> have not been particularly receptive and simply do not </p>

<p> want to get involved. The coordinator and the guidance </p>

<p> counselor saw the lack of involvement by churches as a </p>

<p> loss to the program. </p>

<p> According to the school counselor, students' </p>

<p> attitudes toward police had changed considerably since </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. lessons began. She stated that &quot;students </p>

<p> now see the officer as a friend instead of someone to </p>

<p> avoid.&quot; </p>

<p> Funding. The police administrator reported that </p>

<p> the police department funds the salary of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer, while the school pays any costs for the </p>

<p> curriculum (i.e., books, materials). The school district </p>

<p> coordinator indicated that the school did not have the </p>

<p> funds to purchase D.A.R.E. T-shirts and related </p>

<p> paraphernalia. He further stated that the district is </p>

<p> seeking a State grant for additional supplies. </p>

<p> Curriculum. The guidance counselor reported that </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. classes are a &quot;wonderful way of teaching </p>

<p> students to say no&quot; and that the self-esteem modules are
</p>

<p> particularly valuable and effective. According to the </p>

<p> district coordinator, D.A.R.E. complements all their </p>

<p> other drug prevention programs, but that unfortunately </p>

<p> there was little coordination between different </p>

<p> curricula.=20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer reported that he does not </p>

<p> target the curriculum to any particular substances and </p>

<p> does not adapt the curriculum to specific ethnic needs.=20 </p>

<p> He indicated that he does teach the gang lesson (as do </p>

<p> most D.A.R.E. officers in the State), even though in this </p>

<p> community there is little gang activity. </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. The guidance counselor </p>

<p> indicated that she would like the school to provide </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in all classrooms in grades 5 through 7. The </p>

<p> guidance counselor and the classroom teacher indicated </p>

<p> the need for the school to offer D.A.R.E. or some other </p>

<p> drug prevention education at earlier grade levels.=20 </p>

<p> According to the counselor, &quot;Trying to teach drug </p>

<p> prevention education in high school is futile.&quot; </p>

<p> The classroom teacher indicated that D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other programs need to focus more on at-risk children.=20 </p>

<p> She indicated that there are some 15- and 16-year-olds </p>

<p> still in the 6th grade. She reported that these students </p>

<p> usually have poor attendance records, are poorly </p>

<p> motivated, and are frequently in trouble. She stated </p>

<p> that current prevention programs, including D.A.R.E., are </p>

<p> not adequately meeting the needs of these students.=20 </p>

<p> The district coordinator indicated that one problem </p>

<p> has been the lack of ongoing evaluations of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a fifth-grade </p>

<p> class of 22 students, 12 boys and 10 girls. Twenty </p>

<p> students were African American, and two students were </p>

<p> Caucasian. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer was a white man in his </p>

<p> thirties who was dressed in regulation uniform. The </p>

<p> officer presented himself as a &quot;big brother,&quot;
someone </p>

<p> whom the students could seek out if they needed guidance </p>

<p> or assistance. The officer brought the D.A.R.E. mascot-- </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. bear--with him to class. </p>

<p> The lesson that we observed focused on alternatives </p>

<p> to drug use. The officer discussed how athletics could </p>

<p> be used as an alternative to drug involvement. He used </p>

<p> examples of well-known, drug-free athletes. The officer </p>

<p> encouraged students to ask questions. He also used a </p>

<p> &quot;D.A.R.E. question box.&quot; In the previous week,
students </p>

<p> had been asked to write questions for the officer and </p>

<p> place them in the box. During the lesson, he drew a </p>

<p> question from the box and answered that question. For </p>

<p> the remainder of the lesson, the officer took the </p>

<p> students outside to play games to illustrate alternatives </p>

<p> to drug use. He also involved the school's gym teacher </p>

<p> in supervising the games. </p>

<p> During the class, students were interested and </p>

<p> inquisitive. They seemed to feel free to ask the officer </p>

<p> questions. There were no disciplinary problems. The </p>

<p> classroom teacher remained present during most of the </p>

<p> lesson, sitting at the back of the room and grading </p>

<p> papers. =20 </p>

<p> The officer seemed to spend a great deal of time in </p>

<p> the school. After the lesson was over, he talked to </p>

<p> students in the hallway. Indeed, almost all students </p>

<p> seemed to know him. When an emergency occurred (a </p>

<p> student fell and broke his arm) and the principal was not </p>

<p> present, the staff sought the officer's assistance. This </p>

<p> was not the first such occurrence, and we learned that </p>

<p> the school staff relied frequently upon the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer to act as a sort of assistant principal.=20 </p>

<p> Clearly, he was viewed as an integral--and important-- </p>

<p> part of the school staff. </p>

<p> Rural School Without D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> We interviewed four individuals at the non-D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> school, including the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator (who was the same for both rural schools), </p>

<p> the supervisor of health services, and two members of a </p>

<p> local advisory board for substance abuse. The following </p>

<p> summarizes discussions with these individuals. </p>

<p> Administration. Coordination of the drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts in the observed non-D.A.R.E. school </p>

<p> and other such schools in the community rests with the </p>

<p> school district drug prevention coordinator. He </p>

<p> indicated that there are a variety of programs currently </p>

<p> available to schools but that implementation and </p>

<p> coordination are sporadic. </p>

<p> Implementation. According to the coordinator, </p>

<p> parents in this school are becoming more aware of the </p>

<p> drug problem and are beginning to ask what they can do to </p>

<p> get involved. He stated that many parents are realizing </p>

<p> that they cannot &quot;send their kids to school to get </p>

<p> fixed,&quot; and so are starting to take responsibility for </p>

<p> their children's problems. He also indicated that school </p>

<p> personnel are becoming more involved.=20 </p>

<p> Funding. According to the district coordinator, </p>

<p> the school receives most of its drug prevention funds </p>

<p> from DFSCA. He also indicated funds were provided by the </p>

<p> school board and a local university, as well as the </p>

<p> Indian Education Act. These latter resources, however, </p>

<p> could only be spent on programs delivered to Native </p>

<p> American children. </p>

<p> Curriculum. According to the coordinator, a </p>

<p> variety of curricula are available to teachers at this </p>

<p> school, but not all teachers use the same curriculum, and </p>

<p> some do not provide drug prevention education at all.=20 </p>

<p> The coordinator reported that Here's Looking at You 2000 </p>

<p> is one package available to teachers in this school.=20 </p>

<p> However, he indicated that only about half the teachers </p>

<p> had been trained to teach this program. </p>

<p> The advisory board members informed us of a </p>

<p> community drug abuse treatment program currently in use </p>

<p> in this and other area schools that follows the
&quot;12-step&quot; </p>

<p> model. This program offers intervention, education, and </p>

<p> prevention to youth who have been suspended for substance </p>

<p> use, as well as to their families. One board member </p>

<p> stated that suspended youth must attend this program </p>

<p> before returning to school. </p>

<p> The coordinator indicated that the SAP is just now </p>

<p> being implemented in this school. </p>

<p> The health supervisor reported that the school also </p>

<p> sponsors Red Ribbon week, a program sponsored by the </p>

<p> National Federation of Parents that invites youth and </p>

<p> community members to pledge their support for drug-free </p>

<p> lives by displaying red ribbons. </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. All individuals </p>

<p> interviewed indicated the need for greater coordination </p>

<p> between the different types of drug prevention programs, </p>

<p> as well as assessments of drug prevention efforts. The </p>

<p> coordinator reported that he would like to have someone </p>

<p> responsible for the delivery of drug prevention programs </p>

<p> in the school and someone responsible for evaluation. He </p>

<p> said that &quot;a lot of people are working very hard, but </p>

<p> have little idea of whether or not their efforts are </p>

<p> successful.&quot; </p>

<p> The coordinator indicated that time is also a major </p>

<p> problem in the delivery of drug prevention education. He </p>

<p> stated that preparing students for end of the year </p>

<p> testing takes up most of the classroom teachers' time and </p>

<p> allows them little time to teach drug prevention. </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a 5th grade </p>

<p> class of three girls and seven boys. This was a class </p>

<p> for exceptional children that included students with </p>

<p> emotional and behavioral problems. Five of the students </p>

<p> were Caucasian, three were African-American, and two were </p>

<p> Native American. </p>

<p> The instructor was an African-American woman in her </p>

<p> twenties. She used an approachable and upbeat teaching </p>

<p> style. She was careful to include all of the students in </p>

<p> the lesson. </p>

<p> Because this was a class for exceptional children, </p>

<p> the teacher tailored the drug lesson to the students.=20 </p>

<p> The teacher drew her lesson from health textbooks used in </p>

<p> regular classes. The lesson lasted approximately 1 hour.=20 </p>

<p> The teacher indicated that the length of the class and </p>

<p> how much time she spends on the drug lesson generally </p>

<p> depends both on her assessment of how much of the lesson </p>

<p> the students are absorbing and their interest level. She </p>

<p> indicated that drug prevention lessons are usually taught </p>

<p> two or three times a week. </p>

<p> The observed lesson was about learning how to make </p>

<p> healthy choices. Topics included why people smoke and </p>

<p> use drugs, how magazine advertisements promote smoking </p>

<p> and drinking, and the differences between drugs that are </p>

<p> helpful and harmful. The teacher covered a wide range of </p>

<p> concepts, including how self-esteem and peer pressure </p>

<p> contribute to drug use, the importance of reading warning </p>

<p> labels on medications, and techniques advertisements use </p>

<p> to glamorize drug use. The class format was primarily </p>

<p> question and answer, and the teacher encouraged each </p>

<p> student to participate. The teacher used a variety of </p>

<p> visual aids, including charts, examples of magazine ads, </p>

<p> and a collection of common medications that can be </p>

<p> inappropriately used. </p>

<p> For the most part, the students were very </p>

<p> attentive. Most were eager to be called on and to </p>

<p> participate in the class. The teacher encouraged </p>

<p> participation by all the students. </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> This chapter focused on site visits to four schools </p>

<p> in three school districts. Two of the schools were </p>

<p> located in one rural school district; one of these </p>

<p> schools had D.A.R.E. and one did not. The other two </p>

<p> schools were located in adjacent school districts in an </p>

<p> urban area; again, one school had D.A.R.E. and one did </p>

<p> not. </p>

<p> In both of the schools with D.A.R.E., limited </p>

<p> participation of teachers, parents, and the community </p>

<p> were reported. Both schools also mentioned having </p>

<p> inadequate resources for the program. Neither school </p>

<p> reported adapting the curriculum for any reason. In both </p>

<p> schools, the need for ongoing, long-term evaluations was </p>

<p> stressed. </p>

<p> Neither of the non-D.A.R.E. schools had a specific </p>

<p> drug prevention program. Both reported that </p>

<p> implementation and coordination was sporadic. Both </p>

<p> schools reported wanting one person who would be </p>

<p> responsible for administering the drug prevention program </p>

<p> in the school. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 7 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. OUTCOME ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> Project D.A.R.E. is a drug use prevention program </p>

<p> with curricula targeted at elementary, middle, and senior </p>

<p> high school students. The original core curriculum used </p>

<p> in elementary schools is the subject of this review (a </p>

<p> revised core curriculum will be implemented in September </p>

<p> 1994). The junior and senior high school curricula are </p>

<p> not included in the review because they are more recent, </p>

<p> not as prevalent, and generally have not been evaluated.=20 </p>

<p> Future evaluation efforts should focus on these </p>

<p> curricula, as well as on the cumulative effects of the </p>

<p> comprehensive program. </p>

<p> The purpose of the current review is to assess the </p>

<p> short-term effectiveness of the original D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum by using meta-analytic techniques to </p>

<p> synthesize the evaluation findings of several studies.=20 </p>

<p> We searched for all D.A.R.E. evaluations, both published </p>

<p> and unpublished, conducted over the past 10 years (i.e., </p>

<p> since D.A.R.E. originated) and selected for further </p>

<p> review those studies that met specified methodological </p>

<p> criteria. To establish a comparable measure of </p>

<p> effectiveness across studies, we calculated effect sizes </p>

<p> for each study. In addition, to put D.A.R.E. in the </p>

<p> context of other school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, we compared the average magnitude of the effect </p>

<p> sizes for D.A.R.E. with those of other programs that </p>

<p> target youth of similar age. </p>

<p> This chapter covers six topics. First, we briefly </p>

<p> summarize the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum. Second, </p>

<p> we provide some general background on meta-analysis and </p>

<p> describe the methodological criteria used to select </p>

<p> evaluations for the review. Third, we identify the eight </p>

<p> studies that met the criteria and provide an overall </p>

<p> description of these studies. Fourth, we examine the </p>

<p> reported immediate effects of D.A.R.E., based on these </p>

<p> studies. Fifth, we compare the D.A.R.E. effect sizes </p>

<p> averaged across studies with the average effect sizes of </p>

<p> other drug use prevention programs. Finally, we discuss </p>

<p> several methodological considerations related to the </p>

<p> evaluations included in our review that are important to </p>

<p> interpretation of the results. Further discussion of the </p>

<p> results is included in Chapter 8 of this report. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. Core Curriculum </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. core curriculum is offered to pupils </p>

<p> in the last year of elementary school, typically fifth or </p>

<p> sixth grade. The 17 lessons in the core curriculum are </p>

<p> usually offered once a week for 45 to 60 minutes. The </p>

<p> lessons focus on teaching pupils the skills they need in </p>

<p> order to recognize and resist social pressures to use </p>

<p> drugs. In addition to information about drugs, lessons </p>

<p> emphasize decisionmaking skills, building self-esteem, </p>

<p> and choosing healthy alternatives to drug use. Officers </p>

<p> use a variety of teaching methods, including lectures, </p>

<p> group discussions, question-and-answer sessions, </p>

<p> audiovisual materials, workbook exercises, and role- </p>

<p> plays. </p>

<p> Several aspects of the D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> suggest that it should be successful as a drug use </p>

<p> prevention curriculum. First, the curriculum includes </p>

<p> elements of prevention strategies generally thought to be </p>

<p> effective, such as emphasis on peer resistance and social </p>

<p> competence skills (Botvin, 1990; Hansen, 1992). Interac- </p>

<p> tive programs have shown more promise than those using </p>

<p> more traditional teaching methods (Tobler, 1986, in </p>

<p> press, 1994), and at least some of D.A.R.E.'s teaching </p>

<p> strategies encourage role-playing and interactions among </p>

<p> pupils. Also, the core curriculum is offered to children </p>

<p> at the age when they are believed to be most receptive to </p>

<p> antidrug use messages, which is just before experimenta- </p>

<p> tion with drugs begins (BJA, 1988; Oetting &amp; Bauvais, </p>

<p> 1990). In addition, the program targets cigarettes, </p>

<p> alcohol, and marijuana--the &quot;gateway drugs&quot; that
children </p>

<p> tend to experiment with first (Ellickson, Hays, &amp; Bell, </p>

<p> 1992; Kandel, 1975). Finally, the structured nature of </p>

<p> the curriculum and extensive training of the officers </p>

<p> helps ensure that the program is implemented as designed </p>

<p> (BJA, 1988). </p>

<p> Meta-Analysis Background and Study Selection Criteria </p>

<p> Meta-analysis is a methodology for integrating the </p>

<p> research findings of a body of studies (Bangert-Drowns, </p>

<p> 1986; Cook et al., 1993). The purpose of meta-analysis </p>

<p> is to discover whether some pattern of results is </p>

<p> discernible in a set of studies pertaining to the same </p>

<p> research question (Bangert-Drowns, 1986; Glass, McGaw, &amp; </p>

<p> Smith, 1981; Rosenthal, 1991). Meta-analysis differs </p>

<p> from a traditional narrative review of studies by </p>

<p> providing statistical techniques for summarizing the </p>

<p> research findings from the studies. By quantifying </p>

<p> outcomes across studies and making them comparable with </p>

<p> each other, meta-analysis provides an objective rather </p>

<p> than subjective basis for drawing conclusions about </p>

<p> patterns of study results. </p>

<p> Three basic steps are commonly followed in </p>

<p> conducting meta-analyses (Bangert-Drowns, 1986). First, </p>

<p> all relevant studies are collected, and some studies are </p>

<p> selected for inclusion according to a set of a priori </p>

<p> defined methodological criteria. Second, effect sizes </p>

<p> are calculated for each study. Effect sizes represent </p>

<p> the statistical outcomes of each study transformed to a </p>

<p> common metric. This transformation allows comparisons </p>

<p> across different scales of different outcome measures.=20 </p>

<p> Third, effect sizes for the set of studies are averaged.=20 </p>

<p> In addition, explanations for variability in effect sizes </p>

<p> across studies usually are tested. We followed these </p>

<p> three steps in conducting our assessment of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum; we did not, however, examine possible </p>

<p> causes of differences in outcomes across the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> studies (e.g., differences in D.A.R.E. outcomes by the </p>

<p> racial/ethnic composition of the study samples). The </p>

<p> relatively small number of D.A.R.E. studies precluded </p>

<p> this type of analysis. </p>

<p> In selecting studies, our review focused on </p>

<p> student-based, quantitative evaluations of D.A.R.E. that </p>

<p> measured program effects on drug use behavior and/or </p>

<p> other outcomes targeted by the D.A.R.E. core curriculum, </p>

<p> such as attitudes about drug use. Evaluations that </p>

<p> reported only subjective assessments or satisfaction </p>

<p> ratings are outside the scope of this review. We also </p>

<p> did not consider the results of parent, teacher, </p>

<p> administrator, or D.A.R.E. officer surveys, which </p>

<p> sometimes were conducted as part of the total evaluation </p>

<p> effort. (For information about the opinions of school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators concerning </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., see Chapter 5.) It should be noted that there </p>

<p> are many possible D.A.R.E. outcomes of importance other </p>

<p> than the ones we examined in this meta-analysis, such as </p>

<p> improved school and police relations and greater trust in </p>

<p> law enforcement among youth. </p>

<p> We attempted to locate all the quantitative </p>

<p> evaluations of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> conducted to date through a survey of D.A.R.E.'s five </p>

<p> RTCs, telephone interviews with individuals known to be </p>

<p> involved with D.A.R.E., and computerized searches of the </p>

<p> published and unpublished literature using several data </p>

<p> bases. The computerized data bases included ERIC, </p>

<p> PsychINFO, and Dissertation Abstracts Online.=20 </p>

<p> Through the combined sources, we identified 18 </p>

<p> quantitative D.A.R.E. evaluations conducted in 12 States </p>

<p> and one Canadian province. The location and primary </p>

<p> reference for each evaluation are shown in Exhibit 7.1.=20 </p>

<p> Several of the evaluations were reported in multiple </p>

<p> reports or papers; we generally used the final, most </p>

<p> complete report or the published paper for our review. </p>

<p> From the 18 studies, we selected studies to include </p>

<p> in our meta-analysis that met the following criteria:=20 </p>

<p> (a) use of a control or comparison group; (b) pretest- </p>

<p> posttest design or posttest only with random assignment; </p>

<p> and (c) use of reliably operationalized quantitative </p>

<p> outcome measures. Quasi-experimental studies were </p>

<p> excluded if they did not control for preexisting </p>

<p> differences on measured outcomes with either change </p>

<p> scores or covariance adjusted means (Tobler, in press, </p>

<p> 1994). In addition, to ensure the comparability of </p>

<p> results, we used only results based on immediate </p>

<p> posttest. There were an insufficient number of long-term </p>

<p> evaluation studies to adequately assess the longer-term </p>

<p> effects of the core curriculum. </p>

<p> We selected these criteria because they help to </p>

<p> ensure confidence in the study results by removing a </p>

<p> number of alternative explanations, other than true </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. impact, that could account for outcomes </p>

<p> observed. For example, the first criterion, a comparison </p>

<p> group made up of schools and/or subjects that did not </p>

<p> receive the curriculum, makes it possible to determine </p>

<p> whether changes in the D.A.R.E. youth are unique to them </p>

<p> or are shared by other youth. If youth receiving and not </p>

<p> receiving D.A.R.E. change on some outcome of interest, </p>

<p> then the cause is due to some other factor, such as </p>

<p> maturation, rather than to D.A.R.E. Pretest measures </p>

<p> (the second criterion) are neededExhibit 7.1 D.A.R.E.

<p> *Study selected for further review (with State </p>

<p> for testing the assumption that the D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> comparison groups are equivalent at the outset. In the </p>

<p> absence of random assignment, this assumption must be </p>

<p> tested. In addition, pretest measures provide a </p>

<p> benchmark for evaluating changes in outcome measures </p>

<p> after program implementation. Reliably operationalized </p>

<p> measures of the outcomes of interest (the third </p>

<p> criterion) are important for ensuring that the constructs </p>

<p> intended to be measured are the ones actually measured.=20 </p>

<p> For example, for assessing outcomes related to knowledge, </p>

<p> attitudes, and skills, we considered multiple item scales </p>

<p> to be more reliable than single-item measures. </p>

<p> We also examined a number of other methodological </p>

<p> features, such as the correspondence between the unit of </p>

<p> assignment and unit of analysis, whether a panel design </p>

<p> was used, whether schools in the intervention and </p>

<p> comparison conditions were matched, and whether attrition </p>

<p> rates were reported and examined. Although these factors </p>

<p> were considered in assessing the overall methodological </p>

<p> rigor of the studies, no evaluations were eliminated on </p>

<p> the basis of these criteria. </p>

<p> Studies Selected </p>

<p> Eight of the original 18 evaluation studies met the </p>

<p> criteria for inclusion in the review. One additional </p>

<p> study met the methodological criteria but did not </p>

<p> administer the first posttest until 1 year after D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> implementation and so could not be included in the </p>

<p> analysis of immediate effects (Nyre &amp; Rose, 1987; Nyre, </p>

<p> Rose, &amp; Bolus, 1987). The eight evaluations are </p>

<p> indicated by an asterisk (*) in Exhibit 7.1.=20 </p>

<p> Characteristics of the studies are summarized in Exhibit </p>

<p> 7.2. A more complete description of each study is </p>

<p> provided in Appendix B. </p>

<p> Each of the evaluations represented a State or </p>

<p> local (e.g., city, school district) effort using either </p>

<p> the entire population of schools in a locale or a </p>

<p> convenience sample. The number of student subjects in </p>

<p> all studies was large; each study included at least 10 </p>

<p> schools and approximately 500 to 2000 students in the </p>

<p> combined D.A.R.E. and control groups. Demographic </p>

<p> information about each sample, including gender, </p>

<p> race/ethnicity, SES, and metropolitan status, was not </p>

<p> consistently given across studies. Based on the </p>

<p> information available, the samples were about equally </p>

<p> divided between girls and boys; included white, </p>

<p> black/African American, Hispanic, and Asian-American </p>

<p> youth, with whites usually in the majority; and </p>

<p> represented urban, suburban, and rural areas.=20 </p>

<p> Information was generally not given on the SES of the </p>

<p> sample. </p>

<p> Assignment of D.A.R.E. to intervention and control </p>

<p> groups was by school for all eight studies. In one </p>

<p> study, D.A.R.E. was also assigned by classroom in certain </p>

<p> schools (Manos et al., 1986). Because the control group </p>

<p> classrooms in that study were potentially contaminated by </p>

<p> their close proximity to D.A.R.E. classrooms, these </p>

<p> control classrooms were eliminated; only control schools </p>

<p> with no D.A.R.E. classes were included. Two of the </p>

<p> studies used a true experimental design in which schools </p>

<p> were randomly assigned to D.A.R.E. or control conditions; </p>

<p> a third study used random assignment for two-thirds of </p>

<p> the schools. The remaining five evaluations used a </p>

<p> nonequivalent control group quasi-experimental design.=20 </p>

<p> For these, assignment was based on some other criterion; </p>

<p> if the criterion was stated, usually it was the </p>

<p> administrative convenience of either the school district </p>

<p> or law enforcement agency.=20 </p>

<p> A fundamental consideration in reviewing the </p>

<p> studies was the equivalence of the D.A.R.E. and control </p>

<p> groups before the intervention. Because there were </p>

<p> relatively few sampling units across studies (ranging </p>

<p> from 11 to 63 schools, with under 40 schools in all </p>

<p> except one study), it is unlikely that equivalence </p>

<p> between groups was obtained without prior matching or </p>

<p> blocking of schools, even with randomization. Only half </p>

<p> the studies matched comparison schools on selected </p>

<p> demographic characteristics. The majority of studies </p>

<p> (75%), however, assessed the equivalency of the </p>

<p> comparison groups at pretest and made adjustments for </p>

<p> pretest differences on demographic characteristics. All </p>

<p> studies adjusted for pretest differences on outcome </p>

<p> measures. </p>

<p> 3Attrition rates reported only. All but one of the studies
used a pan= </p>

<p> el </p>

<p> design that </p>

<p> matched subjects from pretest to posttest using a unique </p>

<p> identification code. </p>

<p> Outcome measures used in the studies were based on </p>

<p> responses to self-administered questionnaires. Seven of </p>

<p> the eight studies used measures that were standardized </p>

<p> scales or derived from existing measures; six studies </p>

<p> reported scale reliabilities (usually Cronbach's alpha) </p>

<p> that were generally high. Validity information, however, </p>

<p> was rarely reported, and none of the studies used either </p>

<p> a biochemical indicator or &quot;bogus pipeline&quot;
technique to </p>

<p> validate self-reports of drug use. Informing youth that </p>

<p> their self-reports of drug use will be verified by a </p>

<p> biological specimen (e.g., saliva) or a purported lie </p>

<p> detector (i.e., bogus pipeline) is believed to enhance </p>

<p> the validity of their responses (Bauman &amp; Dent, 1982). </p>

<p> As is unfortunately typical of school-based </p>

<p> evaluation studies, most (75%) of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations did not use a data analysis strategy </p>

<p> appropriate to the unit of assignment. Because schools, </p>

<p> not students, were assigned to D.A.R.E. and control </p>

<p> conditions, it would have been appropriate to analyze the </p>

<p> data by schools with subjects' data aggregated within </p>

<p> each school or to use an analysis strategy that accounts </p>

<p> for clustered data (Moskowitz, 1993; Murray &amp; Hannan, </p>

<p> 1990). Six of the studies ignored schools altogether and </p>

<p> analyzed individual subjects' data, thereby violating the </p>

<p> statistical assumption of independence of observations.=20 </p>

<p> The result of ignoring schools as the unit of analysis is </p>

<p> a positive bias toward finding statistically significant </p>

<p> program effects (Murray &amp; Hannan, 1990). </p>

<p> Five of the studies reported attrition rates, which </p>

<p> generally were small. None of the three studies that </p>

<p> analyzed attrition rates found that attrition differed </p>

<p> significantly across experimental and control conditions.=20 </p>

<p> In addition, subjects absent from the posttest were not </p>

<p> more likely to be drug users or at risk for drug use.=20 </p>

<p> Although attrition usually is greater among drug users </p>

<p> (Biglan &amp; Ary, 1985), given the young age of the sample, </p>

<p> when dropping out of school is unlikely and drug use </p>

<p> prevalence is low, these results are not surprising. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Effect Sizes </p>

<p> To assess the impact of the original D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum on youth drug use, as well as on other </p>

<p> outcomes targeted by the curriculum, we calculated effect </p>

<p> sizes. An effect size (ES) is defined as the difference </p>

<p> between the mean for the intervention group (MeanI) and </p>

<p> the mean for the control group (MeanC), standardized by </p>

<p> dividing by the pooled standard deviation (SD): [ES =3D </p>

<p> (MeanI - MeanC)/ SD] (Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985; Perry &amp; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1992; Rosenthal, 1991). If means and standard </p>

<p> deviations are not available, effect sizes can be </p>

<p> calculated using formulae developed to convert other test </p>

<p> statistics (such as, t or F), as well as percentages, to </p>

<p> effect sizes (Perry &amp; Tobler, 1992). </p>

<p> Effect sizes are expressed as standard deviation </p>

<p> units and may be positive or negative. A positive effect </p>

<p> size indicates an effect in the desired direction as a </p>

<p> result of the intervention. An effect size of 1, for </p>

<p> example, indicates that the intervention group performed </p>

<p> one standard deviation unit better than the control group </p>

<p> on some outcome of interest. Although there are no clear </p>

<p> conventions for defining &quot;small,&quot;
&quot;medium,&quot; and &quot;large&quot; </p>

<p> effect sizes in the context of drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, review of several meta-analyses of adolescent </p>

<p> drug use prevention programs (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; </p>

<p> Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; Tobler, 1986, in </p>

<p> press, 1992 ) suggests that effect sizes below .15 </p>

<p> reflect a small effect; effect sizes between .15 and .30 </p>

<p> indicate a modest effect; and effect sizes above .30 </p>

<p> reflect stronger program effects. </p>

<p> For each of the eight D.A.R.E. studies, we </p>

<p> calculated effect sizes to quantify the magnitude of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with respect to six outcomes </p>

<p> that reflect the aims of the D.A.R.E. curriculum. The </p>

<p> six outcomes were knowledge about drugs, attitudes about </p>

<p> drug use, social skills, self-esteem, attitude toward </p>

<p> police, and self-reported drug use. We calculated effect </p>

<p> sizes using the procedure appropriate for the summary </p>

<p> statistics reported. In all cases, we used statistics </p>

<p> reflecting covariance-adjusted means, with pretest values </p>

<p> as covariates, rather than unadjusted means so that any </p>

<p> differences between the comparison groups prior to the </p>

<p> intervention would not be reflected in the effect sizes </p>

<p> (Tobler, in press, 1994). Where possible, we used </p>

<p> statistics that also were adjusted for sample demographic </p>

<p> characteristics (six of eight studies). </p>

<p> Some studies did not include all six outcomes of </p>

<p> interest, and some outcomes were measured by more than </p>

<p> one indicator. When multiple indicators were used, such </p>

<p> as two measures of social skills, we calculated separate </p>

<p> effect sizes and then averaged them. This procedure </p>

<p> yielded one effect size per study for each type of </p>

<p> measured outcome. In the one study that reported only </p>

<p> that a measured outcome was not statistically significant </p>

<p> and did not provide any further statistics, we assigned a </p>

<p> value of zero to that effect size. To calculate effect </p>

<p> sizes for reported drug use, we considered only alcohol, </p>

<p> tobacco, and marijuana use; we averaged effect sizes </p>

<p> across these substances. In a supplementary analysis, we </p>

<p> also considered use of these substances separately. Use </p>

<p> of other drugs, such as cocaine, was measured by some </p>

<p> studies, but the prevalence of use was too small to </p>

<p> produce meaningful effects. </p>

<p> The unweighted effect sizes at immediate posttest </p>

<p> for each outcome for each study are shown in Exhibit 7.3.=20 </p>

<p> Several of the effect sizes are .30 or higher, although </p>

<p> most are less than .20. The largest effect sizes are for </p>

<p> knowledge (that was only measured by three of the eight </p>

<p> studies) and social skills. The effect sizes for self- </p>

<p> esteem, attitudes about drug use, and attitude toward </p>

<p> police tend to be smaller. The smallest effect sizes are </p>

<p> for drug use, with none being greater than .11. The </p>

<p> higher effect sizes for knowledge compared with drug use </p>

<p> is consistent with other studies and supports the </p>

<p> conclusion that knowledge is easier to change than </p>

<p> behavior (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1986). </p>

<p> In addition to calculating one effect size for each </p>

<p> outcome for each study, we calculated the weighted mean </p>

<p> effect size and 95% confidence interval for each type of </p>

<p> outcome across the eight studies. The weighted mean </p>

<p> provides a summary measure across the eight studies that </p>

<p> is useful for indicating D.A.R.E.'s general effectiveness </p>

<p> with respect to each outcome. The weighted mean provides </p>

<p> a less biased estimate than the simple unweighted mean </p>

<p> because estimates from larger samples are given more </p>

<p> weight. It is computed by weighting each effect size by </p>

<p> the inverse of its variance, which is a reflection of the </p>

<p> sample size (Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985). The effect size </p>

<p> estimates from larger studies are generally more precise </p>

<p> than those from smaller studies (Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985). </p>

<p> The 95% confidence interval provides an upper and </p>

<p> lower bound for the estimate; in 95% of samples drawn, </p>

<p> the estimate would fall within these bounds. To </p>

<p> calculate the 95% confidence interval, 1.96 multiplied by </p>

<p> the square root of one divided by the sum of the study </p>

<p> weights is added to or subtracted from the mean (Hedges &amp;
</p>

<p> Olkin, 1985). </p>

<p> The weighted mean effect size at immediate posttest </p>

<p> and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome are </p>

<p> depicted in Exhibit 7.4. The largest weighted mean </p>

<p> effect size is for knowledge about drugs (0.42), followed </p>

<p> by social skills (0.19), attitude toward police (0.13), </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use (0.11), self-esteem (0.06), and </p>

<p> drug use (0.06). The weighted mean effect sizes for </p>

<p> knowledge, social skills, attitude toward police, </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use, and self-esteem are </p>

<p> statistically significant. The statistical significance </p>

<p> of these D.A.R.E. effect sizes, however, should be </p>

<p> interpreted cautiously because the significance may be </p>

<p> positively influenced by the failure of most studies to </p>

<p> account for data Exhibit 7.4 Magnitude of D.A.R.E.'s Weighted
Mean </p>

<p> Effect Size (and 95% Confidence </p>

<p> Interval), by Outcome Measures at Imme- </p>

<p> diate Posttest </p>

<p> clustered by school. The confidence interval for the </p>

<p> weighted mean effect size for drug use overlaps with </p>

<p> zero, meaning than it is not significantly different from </p>

<p> zero. </p>

<p> Because averaging alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana </p>

<p> use for the drug use effect size could obscure </p>

<p> substantial differences among substances, we calculated </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s weighted mean effect sizes separately for </p>

<p> alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. None of the </p>

<p> individual effect sizes for any of the three substances </p>

<p> from any study is larger than 0.15. The mean immediate </p>

<p> effect size for alcohol use is 0.06 (95% CI: .00, .12); </p>

<p> for tobacco use, 0.08 (95% CI: .02, .14); and for </p>

<p> marijuana use, =FE0.01 (95% CI: =FE.09, .07). Only the mean </p>

<p> for tobacco use is statistically significant. =20 </p>

<p> The range of effect sizes, both individually by </p>

<p> study and averaged across studies, suggests that D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> has been more effective at immediate posttest in </p>

<p> influencing some outcomes than others. The core </p>

<p> curriculum has been most effective in increasing </p>

<p> knowledge about drug use and in enhancing social skills.=20 </p>

<p> Although some studies reported fairly large effect sizes </p>

<p> for attitudes about drugs and attitude toward police, </p>

<p> overall the studies show less D.A.R.E. success in </p>

<p> influencing these factors and self-esteem. Based on </p>

<p> these eight studies, the core curriculum has been least </p>

<p> effective at immediate posttest at influencing drug use </p>

<p> outcomes: alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. The </p>

<p> small effect sizes for drug use and attitudes about drugs </p>

<p> Comparison of D.A.R.E.'s Effectiveness to Other </p>

<p> Drug Use Prevention Programs for Youth </p>

<p> To see how D.A.R.E. compares with other school- </p>

<p> based drug use prevention programs, we compared the </p>

<p> weighted mean D.A.R.E. effect sizes with weighted mean </p>

<p> effect sizes computed for similar programs. For </p>

<p> comparison, we used the effect sizes reported in Tobler's </p>

<p> recent meta-analysis of school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs (Tobler, in press, 1994). To allow the most </p>

<p> appropriate comparisons with D.A.R.E. effect sizes, we </p>

<p> obtained Tobler's results for only those programs, </p>

<p> excluding D.A.R.E., aimed at fifth and sixth graders.=20 </p>

<p> Although pupils in the comparison programs were in the </p>

<p> fifth and sixth grade, some sixth graders were in middle </p>

<p> school, whereas all D.A.R.E. sixth graders were in </p>

<p> elementary school. Like the D.A.R.E. studies, the </p>

<p> interventions analyzed by Tobler were implemented in </p>

<p> geographically diverse areas. Also similar to the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies, demographic information was not </p>

<p> reported across all studies. The available data suggest </p>

<p> that the studies in Tobler's review represented both </p>

<p> white and minority populations and included urban, </p>

<p> suburban, and rural areas with urban areas predominating.=20 </p>

<p> These programs are a subset of 25 from the 114 programs </p>

<p> included in Tobler's meta-analysis. The studies from </p>

<p> Tobler's meta-analysis are referenced in Exhibit 7.5 and </p>

<p> listed in Appendix C. </p>

<p> We selected Tobler's meta-analysis for comparison </p>

<p> because it is more similar to our review than other meta- </p>

<p> analyses of drug use prevention programs (Bangert-Drowns, </p>

<p> 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; Tobler, </p>

<p> 1986). Tobler's meta-analysis and ours used similar </p>

<p> processes and criteria to identify and select program </p>

<p> evaluations for examination and included both published </p>

<p> and unpublished studies. Like the D.A.R.E. criteria, </p>

<p> Tobler selected student-based quantitative evaluations </p>

<p> that included a control or comparison group and used a </p>

<p> pretest-posttest sign or posttest only with random </p>

<p> assignment. In addition, Tobler reported separate </p>

<p> weighted mean effect sizes for four categories of outcome </p>

<p> measures that are comparable to four of our outcome </p>

<p> measurements: knowledge, attitudes toward drugs, social </p>

<p> skills, and drug use. The meta-analyses differed, </p>

<p> however, in that Tobler excluded studies that did not </p>

<p> measure drug use and that included results from later </p>

<p> posttests. In addition, some of Tobler's programs </p>

<p> focused on a single drug rather than on multiple drugs as </p>

<p> in D.A.R.E. The collective impact of these Exhibit 7.5

<p> tions. Some publications reported on more than </p>

<p> one type of program. See Appendix C for a listing </p>

<p> of these references. </p>

<p> differences should be minimal, however. Overall, the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and Tobler studies are highly comparable in </p>

<p> terms of program focus, study methodology, and target </p>

<p> audience. In assessing the magnitude of the effect sizes </p>

<p> reported for the Tobler studies, it should be noted that </p>

<p> the studies typically did not correct for the correlation </p>

<p> among students in the same school. As explained for the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies, this may produce inflated effect sizes.=20 </p>

<p> Because neither the D.A.R.E. nor Tobler studies generally </p>

<p> made adjustments for this interdependence of </p>

<p> observations, the net effect on the comparison of effect </p>

<p> sizes should be minimal. </p>

<p> The evaluation studies included in Tobler's meta- </p>

<p> analysis are classified into two broad categories based </p>

<p> on typical combinations of program content and program </p>

<p> process (process describes the teaching approach, or how </p>

<p> the content is delivered): noninteractive (N=3D9) and </p>

<p> interactive programs (N=3D16). =20 </p>

<p> Noninteractive programs emphasize intrapersonal </p>

<p> factors and use more traditional teaching approaches.=20 </p>

<p> Activities typically are designed to increase knowledge </p>

<p> about drugs, boost self-esteem, promote self-awareness, </p>

<p> increase problem-solving skills, and promote values </p>

<p> clarifications. These activities, in turn, are expected </p>

<p> to encourage youth to make a personal decision to abstain </p>

<p> from using drugs. Program content is usually introduced </p>

<p> by the teacher in a didactic manner, and participatory </p>

<p> activities often involve teacher-led discussions. </p>

<p> Interactive programs emphasize interpersonal </p>

<p> factors and use a participatory teaching approach.=20 </p>

<p> Activities are designed to counter peer pressure to use </p>

<p> drugs through developing drug refusal skills, promoting </p>

<p> general social competencies, and correcting beliefs about </p>

<p> the prevalence of drug use among peers. Program process </p>

<p> emphasizes the interaction and exchange of ideas among </p>

<p> peers, and it encourages active participation of all </p>

<p> students in the classroom, particularly in small groups. </p>

<p> Consistent with other meta-analyses showing that </p>

<p> programs emphasizing social skills tend to be the most </p>

<p> effective at achieving their outcomes (Bangert-Drowns, </p>

<p> 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; Tobler, </p>

<p> 1986), Tobler's interactive programs produced larger </p>

<p> effect sizes in all four outcome measures than </p>

<p> noninteractive programs. Because D.A.R.E. has features </p>

<p> of both noninteractive and interactive programs, we </p>

<p> compared D.A.R.E. with both categories of programs.=20 </p>

<p> The weighted mean effect sizes and 95% confidence </p>

<p> intervals by outcome for the D.A.R.E. studies and the two </p>

<p> types of comparison programs are shown in Exhibit 7.6.=20 </p>

<p> To test whether the mean effect sizes differed </p>

<p> significantly between D.A.R.E. and the noninteractive </p>

<p> programs and between D.A.R.E. and the interactive </p>

<p> programs, we also calculated the 95% confidence interval </p>

<p> around the difference between the means. If the </p>

<p> confidence interval spans zero, this indicates that the </p>

<p> difference between the two effect size means is not </p>

<p> statistically significant. Conversely, if the confidence </p>

<p> interval does not include zero, then the means are </p>

<p> determined to be significantly different; that is, the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. mean is significantly greater or less than the </p>

<p> mean for the comparison programs. The difference between </p>

<p> the weighted mean effect sizes for D.A.R.E. and both </p>

<p> noninteractive and interactive programs and 95% </p>

<p> A comparison of D.A.R.E. effect sizes with effect </p>

<p> sizes of noninteractive and interactive drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs for fifth and sixth graders reviewed </p>

<p> by Tobler suggests that D.A.R.E. has been more effective </p>

<p> in influencing knowledge, attitudes, and skills outcomes </p>

<p> than noninteractive programs, although only the knowledge </p>

<p> difference is statistically significant. D.A.R.E. has </p>

<p> been less effective, however, than interactive programs </p>

<p> across all outcome measures, most prominently for social </p>

<p> skills and drug use. The only difference in effect size </p>

<p> means between D.A.R.E. and interactive programs that was </p>

<p> not statistically significant was for knowledge. For </p>

<p> drug use, the average effect size for interactive </p>

<p> programs was three times greater than the average </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. effect size; for social skills, four times </p>

<p> greater than D.A.R.E.; and for attitudes, three times </p>

<p> greater. These findings suggest that greater </p>

<p> effectiveness is possible with school-based drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs for fifth- and sixth-grade pupils </p>

<p> than is achieved by the original D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum. </p>

<p> Methodological Considerations </p>

<p> Several methodological considerations relating to </p>

<p> the evaluations included in our review and to the </p>

<p> approach we used in conducting our review bear on the </p>

<p> interpretation of the results. </p>

<p> Fundamental considerations are whether the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations selected for review are methodologically </p>

<p> strong and are sufficient in number. As is appropriate </p>

<p> for meta-analysis, we used stated and objective criteria </p>

<p> to select D.A.R.E. evaluations for review. Because the </p>

<p> evaluations we selected had a comparison group, </p>

<p> administered both pretests and posttests, used </p>

<p> quantifiable outcome measures, and made statistical </p>

<p> adjustments for pretest differences on outcome measures, </p>

<p> we can be reasonably confident in their findings. </p>

<p> Eight evaluations were included in the review; this </p>

<p> is not a large number compared with the vast number of </p>

<p> sites where D.A.R.E. has been implemented. It far </p>

<p> exceeds, however, the number of evaluations of any other </p>

<p> widely available drug use prevention program. Most </p>

<p> prevention programs developed and evaluated by </p>

<p> researchers have been much less widely implemented, and </p>

<p> have received less scrutiny, than D.A.R.E. More </p>

<p> important, however, when considering the adequacy of the </p>

<p> number of studies, are the uniformity of D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> curriculum content and method of delivery across </p>

<p> implementation sites, and the consistent results found </p>

<p> across geographically heterogeneous studies. This </p>

<p> uniformity and consistency suggest that a sufficient </p>

<p> number of evaluations were identified for assessment of </p>

<p> the original core curriculum's immediate effects. Even </p>

<p> so, we would have preferred a full set of eight effect </p>

<p> sizes for each outcome. </p>

<p> The immediate effect sizes for the D.A.R.E. studies </p>

<p> may have been attenuated compared with the comparison </p>

<p> drug use prevention programs because the control groups </p>

<p> were not pure &quot;no treatment&quot; groups. As documented
by </p>

<p> Tobler (1986, in press, 1994), effect sizes are lower </p>

<p> when the control group receives some sort of drug </p>

<p> education. Information generally was lacking from the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. evaluations on alternative interventions </p>

<p> received by the control groups, but it is likely that </p>

<p> most control groups received some drug education because </p>

<p> the studies occurred after the passage of the 1986 DFSCA.=20 </p>

<p> However, approximately half (54%) of the comparison </p>

<p> programs used for Tobler's study also were conducted </p>

<p> between 1986 and 1990, suggesting that they also may </p>

<p> suffer from the same effect. Nevertheless, the lower </p>

<p> effect sizes of the D.A.R.E. programs compared with the </p>

<p> interactive programs in Tobler's study could be due in </p>

<p> part to the likelihood that the control groups for the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies received a stronger intervention than </p>

<p> did the control groups in the studies reviewed by Tobler. </p>

<p> Most of the drug use prevention programs evaluated </p>

<p> by Tobler are smaller-scale university research-based </p>

<p> evaluation studies, while D.A.R.E. is a widely available </p>

<p> curriculum. In both cases, however, the interventions </p>

<p> were implemented by service providers and the evaluations </p>

<p> were conducted by researchers. Even so, the intensity of </p>

<p> efforts devoted to interventions conducted for evaluation </p>

<p> research may be greater, the implementation conditions </p>

<p> more optimal, and the possibility for scrutiny and </p>

<p> control greater than would be the case for a program that </p>

<p> is widely disseminated. Some diminished effectiveness </p>

<p> may be inevitable once programs are implemented under </p>

<p> real-world conditions. This could be an important factor </p>

<p> in explaining some of the differences in effect sizes </p>

<p> between D.A.R.E. and the comparison programs. </p>

<p> Differences in the studies selected for our </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. review and selected by Tobler could also </p>

<p> contribute to the relative differences in effect sizes </p>

<p> between these programs. The differences include the </p>

<p> exclusion of studies by Tobler that did not evaluate drug </p>

<p> use behavior and the inclusion of outcomes from later </p>

<p> posttests. In addition, some sixth graders in the </p>

<p> programs reviewed by Tobler were in middle rather than </p>

<p> elementary school, and some programs focused on a single </p>

<p> drug, such as tobacco, rather than multiple drugs as is </p>

<p> the case with D.A.R.E. It is possible that these </p>

<p> differences could decrease, increase, or not change the </p>

<p> relative differences in effect sizes. For example, </p>

<p> differences might have been less if programs focused on a </p>

<p> single substance were not included in Tobler's meta- </p>

<p> analysis. It is possible that single substance programs </p>

<p> have greater impact on use of that substance than generic </p>

<p> drug education programs, although study of this </p>

<p> possibility is limited and findings are mixed (Tobler, </p>

<p> 1994). On the other hand, differences might have been </p>

<p> greater had Tobler excluded results from posttests beyond </p>

<p> immediate follow-up because curriculum effects tend to </p>

<p> decay rather than increase with time (Ellickson, Bell, &amp; </p>

<p> McGuigan, 1993; Murray, Pirie, Luepker, &amp; Pallonen, </p>

<p> 1989). The limited number of programs precluded </p>

<p> assessment of these possibilities, as well as whether </p>

<p> program effects differ, and in what direction, for sixth </p>

<p> graders in elementary versus middle school. </p>

<p> Finally, it is possible that our results might have </p>

<p> differed if there had been sufficient numbers of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations and studies in Tobler's analysis to analyze </p>

<p> effect sizes while controlling the effects of other </p>

<p> factors. In addition to the differences between the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and Tobler studies described above, it is </p>

<p> possible that other factors may have varied across the </p>

<p> intervention programs and associated evaluation studies </p>

<p> that contributed to the observed differences in effect </p>

<p> sizes. For example, substantial variation in </p>

<p> characteristics of the students (e.g., in </p>

<p> race/ethnicity), features of the interventions (e.g., </p>

<p> variations in program intensity), and features of the </p>

<p> research design (e.g., experimental versus quasi- </p>

<p> experimental design) could have contributed to the </p>

<p> differences in program effects. In other words, some of </p>

<p> the differences in effect sizes observed between the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies and Tobler's studies could have been due </p>

<p> to other factors than the type of program.=20 </p>

<p> Unfortunately, these possibilities could not be tested </p>

<p> because of the small number of studies. Further testing </p>

<p> is warranted when larger samples of D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> comparison studies are available. </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> From a pool of 18 quantitative D.A.R.E. evaluation </p>

<p> studies identified by this review, eight met specified </p>

<p> methodological criteria and were selected for further </p>

<p> review. Each of these eight evaluations had a control </p>

<p> group, administered both pretests and posttests, used </p>

<p> quantifiable outcome measures, and made statistical </p>

<p> adjustments for pretest differences on outcome measures.=20 </p>

<p> Effect sizes for these studies at immediate posttest, </p>

<p> both individually by study and averaged across studies, </p>

<p> showed that the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum had </p>

<p> strong and statistically significant effects on knowledge </p>

<p> about drugs. The curriculum also had a positive and </p>

<p> significant impact on social skills. The core curriculum </p>

<p> had smaller, although statistically significant, effects </p>

<p> on attitudes about drug use, attitude toward the police, </p>

<p> and self-esteem. The curriculum had limited immediate </p>

<p> effects on use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana.=20 </p>

<p> Although the effect on tobacco use was small, it was </p>

<p> statistically significant. </p>

<p> Weighted mean effect sizes were used to compare </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. with other school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs targeted at same-age youth. The original </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. core curriculum compared favorably with </p>

<p> noninteractive drug use prevention programs, which </p>

<p> emphasize intrapersonal factors and use more traditional </p>

<p> teaching methods. The original core curriculum compared </p>

<p> less favorably, however, with interactive drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs. Interactive drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, which emphasize interpersonal skills and an </p>

<p> interactive teaching style, have been shown to be the </p>

<p> most successful drug use prevention programs (Tobler, in </p>

<p> press, 1994). </p>

<p> Several methodological considerations should be </p>

<p> noted in interpreting the results of this review. These </p>

<p> include the number of methodologically rigorous D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> studies in our review; the purity of the control groups </p>

<p> in the D.A.R.E. evaluations compared with those in the </p>

<p> comparison programs; and the relative impacts of </p>

<p> commercial programs such as D.A.R.E. and smaller scale </p>

<p> research-based interventions; and the small number of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and comparison studies available for assessing </p>

<p> other potential explanations for differences in program </p>

<p> effectiveness. </p>

<p> The findings of the D.A.R.E. outcome assessment are </p>

<p> discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 8 </p>

<p> DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS </p>

<p> In preceding chapters, we presented data acquired </p>

<p> from our implementation and outcome assessments of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Information about D.A.R.E.'s operations, </p>

<p> prevalence, and effectiveness was collected from a </p>

<p> variety of sources. Given the complex nature of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. organization, it is not surprising that the </p>

<p> findings are voluminous. Nor is it surprising that </p>

<p> although some findings attest to the strengths and </p>

<p> robustness of D.A.R.E., others indicate limitations.=20 </p>

<p> This final chapter presents a discussion of these </p>

<p> findings. In the course of this discussion, we highlight </p>

<p> the key findings and, where appropriate, make </p>

<p> recommendations for programmatic changes and additional </p>

<p> research. =20 </p>

<p> This chapter is organized into three sections.=20 </p>

<p> Highlights from the implementation assessment are </p>

<p> presented in the first section, followed by key findings </p>

<p> from the outcome assessment. To facilitate a review of </p>

<p> the study's many and sometimes disparate findings, our </p>

<p> discussion is organized by some of the questions that </p>

<p> guided these study components. In the final section, we </p>

<p> attempt to synthesize the most important findings and </p>

<p> present overall conclusions derived from the study. </p>

<p> Implementation Assessment </p>

<p> As discussed in Chapter 1, we conducted an </p>

<p> implementation assessment of D.A.R.E. that had two </p>

<p> primary objectives. These were, first, to conduct an </p>

<p> assessment of the organizational structure and operation </p>

<p> of representative D.A.R.E. programs nationwide to learn </p>

<p> what factors contribute to the effective implementation </p>

<p> of D.A.R.E. programs nationwide and, second, to determine </p>

<p> how D.A.R.E. is tailored to meet the needs of specific </p>

<p> populations. </p>

<p> To address these issues, we collected data from </p>

<p> sources at all levels of the multi-layered D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> institution. We presented information concerning </p>

<p> operations at the national and regional level of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> in Chapter 3, State-level operations in Chapter 4, and </p>

<p> local-level operations in Chapters 5 and 6. We obtained </p>

<p> information from interviews with Glenn Levant of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America and with coordinators and/or educational advisors </p>

<p> from each of the five Regional Training Centers (RTCs), a </p>

<p> review of available BJA documents, a survey of the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinators, a survey of a nationally </p>

<p> representative sample of school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators, and site visits to four purposively </p>

<p> selected schools (two with D.A.R.E. and two without). </p>

<p> How extensively is D.A.R.E. implemented nationwide, and </p>

<p> how does D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> prevalence compare with that of other curricula? </p>

<p> One of the most important findings of this study </p>

<p> was the extraordinary prevalence of D.A.R.E. In the </p>

<p> 1991-1992 school year, 44 of the 50 States had State </p>

<p> coordinators fortheir D.A.R.E. programs. Based on our sample
of school </p>

<p> districts, we estimate that over half the districts in </p>

<p> the country implemented at least one of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curricula in one or more of their schools. In </p>

<p> comparison, the two other most prevalent prevention </p>

<p> programs, Quest and Here's Looking at You (HLY), were </p>

<p> used in at least one school in about 27% and 24% of the </p>

<p> districts, respectively. </p>

<p> Another important finding is that the demand for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. over the next 5 years is going to increase </p>

<p> substantially. Over 40% of the districts with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> planned to expand its use. Of those districts without </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., 21% expressed the intention to institute it, </p>

<p> and 20% reported that they were as yet undecided about </p>

<p> using D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Slightly over half of all school districts </p>

<p> implemented D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum, which is targeted </p>

<p> at 5th- and 6th-grade pupils; around 17% implemented the </p>

<p> K-4 curriculum, 11% the junior high school curriculum, </p>

<p> and 3% the senior high curriculum. Around 12% of the </p>

<p> school districts used Quest at the elementary level, 22% </p>

<p> at the middle/junior high school level, and 3% at the </p>

<p> senior high school level. Around 22% of the school </p>

<p> districts used HLY at the elementary level, 14% at the </p>

<p> middle/junior high school level, and 9% at the senior </p>

<p> high level. =20 </p>

<p> Does the extent of D.A.R.E. implementation vary by </p>

<p> demographic </p>

<p> characteristics of school districts, such as geographic </p>

<p> region, urbanicity, SES, </p>

<p> and minority status? How does D.A.R.E. compare with </p>

<p> other curricula in this </p>

<p> regard? </p>

<p> The Midwest region had the highest percentage of </p>

<p> districts using D.A.R.E. (59.9%) , followed by the </p>

<p> Southeast (56.8%), East (55.8%), West (48.8%), and </p>

<p> Southwest (37.1%). Use of Quest was highest in the </p>

<p> Midwest region (35.8%) and use of HLY was highest in the </p>

<p> East (46.4%). Use of all three prevention programs was </p>

<p> lowest in the Southwest region. The lower rates of </p>

<p> program use in the Southwest can probably be largely </p>

<p> attributed to its rural nature, and thus the greater </p>

<p> difficulties in fielding D.A.R.E. officers to </p>

<p> geographically dispersed schools. </p>

<p> There were no statistically significant differences </p>

<p> in the use of D.A.R.E., Quest, or HLY by either the </p>

<p> minority status or SES of the school districts.=20 </p>

<p> Urban/suburban school districts were, however, </p>

<p> significantly more likely to use D.A.R.E. and HLY than </p>

<p> rural districts. Further, large districts were </p>

<p> significantly more likely than small districts to use </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. We suspect that these findings may be </p>

<p> attributed to the relatively greater resources available </p>

<p> to urban and large law enforcement agencies. In the case </p>

<p> of D.A.R.E., these agencies may be at greater liberty to </p>

<p> free up their officers' time to teach D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> It is difficult to determine what adjustments might </p>

<p> make D.A.R.E. more accessible to rural and small school </p>

<p> districts. We believe that ways of improving access to </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in rural and small districts should be examined.=20 </p>

<p> For example, methods for distributing DFSCA funds to </p>

<p> favor rural and small school districts instead of </p>

<p> distribution solely on a per capita basis could be </p>

<p> explored. =20 </p>

<p> How well integrated is D.A.R.E. with other drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs </p>

<p> offered in schools? </p>

<p> Neither D.A.R.E. nor any other drug prevention </p>

<p> program can or should stand alone in a school district; </p>

<p> instead, such programs should be integrated into a </p>

<p> comprehensive curriculum that is developmentally </p>

<p> appropriate and implemented at every grade level.=20 </p>

<p> Indeed, all school districts receiving DFSCA funds must </p>

<p> implement a comprehensive K-12 drug prevention program.=20 </p>

<p> Even were a school district to implement all four of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s student curricula, additional drug prevention </p>

<p> programming would still be required in the grades to </p>

<p> which D.A.R.E. was not directed. Our survey showed that </p>

<p> only 2% of the school districts used only D.A.R.E. and no </p>

<p> other drug prevention program. Almost two-thirds of the </p>

<p> school district coordinators with D.A.R.E. reported that </p>

<p> the program was &quot;very well&quot; integrated with other </p>

<p> prevention programs. </p>

<p> How does D.A.R.E. compare with other alcohol and other </p>

<p> drug (AOD) programs </p>

<p> in terms of support and satisfaction for the programs? </p>

<p> The school district drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> indicated that support for D.A.R.E. is very strong not </p>

<p> only among students and school staff=FEwhose support the </p>

<p> coordinators rated as very high=FEbut also among parents </p>

<p> and the community. These ratings were also markedly </p>

<p> higher than those for other AOD programs.=20 </p>

<p> The responses of the coordinators also indicated </p>

<p> the high regard in which the D.A.R.E. curricula are held.=20 </p>

<p> Two-thirds of the school district coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. rated the curricula, as well as how it is </p>

<p> taught, as &quot;very satisfactory&quot;; over three-quarters
gave </p>

<p> the same rating to how students receive it. This </p>

<p> endorsement is all the more vivid when contrasted with </p>

<p> coordinators' ratings of other AOD prevention programs; </p>

<p> only one-third of coordinators with other AOD programs </p>

<p> rated these programs as highly. =20 </p>

<p> A close examination of these findings reveals that </p>

<p> coordinators in districts with a high percentage of </p>

<p> minority students were more likely to rate students' </p>

<p> receptivity to D.A.R.E. as very high than those in </p>

<p> districts serving predominantly white students. This </p>

<p> finding is not confounded by the district's urbanicity or </p>

<p> SES because comparisons between coordinators from these </p>

<p> pairs of districts (i.e., by high and low SES and by </p>

<p> rural and urban/surburban) were not statistically </p>

<p> significant. =20 </p>

<p> Of even greater importance are the satisfaction </p>

<p> ratings that the prevention coordinators gave to </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s effects on students. Almost two-thirds of the </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. indicated that they were very </p>

<p> satisfied with D.A.R.E.'s effects; less than one-quarter </p>

<p> of those with other AOD programs reported that they were </p>

<p> very satisfied with the effects of these AOD programs.=20 </p>

<p> Are D.A.R.E. and other drug prevention programs adapted </p>

<p> to a community's </p>

<p> particular needs? </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is distinguished by the integrity and </p>

<p> consistency with which its curricula are administered.=20 </p>

<p> During their training, D.A.R.E. officers are instructed </p>

<p> not to deviate in any substantive fashion from the </p>

<p> curriculum. The D.A.R.E. core curriculum allows only one </p>

<p> modification--a gang activity lesson that can be added in </p>

<p> schools where gangs are perceived to be a problem. </p>

<p> Over two-fifths of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and over half of the coordinators with other AOD programs </p>

<p> reported that the curriculum had been adapted at least to </p>

<p> some degree, however modest. The most frequently </p>

<p> mentioned reason for adaptation of both D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs was drug availability at their </p>

<p> schools. Coordinators with D.A.R.E. provided some hints </p>

<p> as to the types of topics introduced, which included </p>

<p> discussing specific locally prevalent drugs, drug abuse </p>

<p> at home, and local drug arrests. During the site visit </p>

<p> to the urban school district, we learned that some police </p>

<p> officers incorporate their own street experiences into </p>

<p> their lessons. The second and third most frequently </p>

<p> mentioned reasons for adaptation for D.A.R.E. and other </p>

<p> AOD programs were student/community poverty and </p>

<p> racial/ethnic composition. </p>

<p> Although we recognize that some tailoring of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. to the needs of a particular audience may be </p>

<p> appropriate, we encourage fidelity to the curricula and </p>

<p> careful monitoring of officer presentation. We strongly </p>

<p> suggest that current procedures of notifying the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board curriculum committee of </p>

<p> limitations in the curricula and of substantive </p>

<p> modifications of the curricula originating from that </p>

<p> agency be continued. Allowing officers to modify the </p>

<p> program at will would quickly result in disintegration of </p>

<p> the curriculum and the program. </p>

<p> To what extent are classroom teachers and other community </p>

<p> members or </p>

<p> agencies involved in D.A.R.E.? </p>

<p> The original core curriculum, which was in use when </p>

<p> the survey was conducted, encouraged classroom teachers </p>

<p> to remain in the classroom and to communicate D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> objectives to students. However, teachers played little </p>

<p> active part in the actual instruction. Teachers and </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers together teach the junior and senior </p>

<p> high curricula; at the senior high level, they are even </p>

<p> trained together. According to the drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators, teachers in almost 90% of the districts </p>

<p> remained in the classroom during D.A.R.E. lessons, and in </p>

<p> 84% teachers were reported as &quot;actively involved&quot;
in </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. The revised core curriculum encourages </p>

<p> classroom teachers to take a more active role. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers already are expected to meet for </p>

<p> an hour or so with the classroom teachers in a brief, </p>

<p> structured orientation and discussion. To the extent </p>

<p> that time and resources permit, we encourage the </p>

<p> co-training of teachers and officers at every curricular </p>

<p> level because we believe that such training would enhance </p>

<p> effective communication and coordination between the two.=20 </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> One of D.A.R.E.'s strengths is the active </p>

<p> involvement of individuals in D.A.R.E., both within and </p>

<p> outside of the school. Half of the prevention </p>

<p> coordinators reported that school staff, other than </p>

<p> classroom teachers, were actively involved in D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> and almost one-quarter reported that civic groups were </p>

<p> actively involved. This level of involvement surely </p>

<p> makes a major contribution to the high level of </p>

<p> enthusiasm that D.A.R.E. generates. We note that only a </p>

<p> relatively few coordinators reported that &quot;youth
groups&quot; </p>

<p> were involved in D.A.R.E. We recommend increasing the </p>

<p> involvement of both youth and church groups as a way to </p>

<p> reinforce D.A.R.E.'s message and to help establish </p>

<p> anti-drug use norms throughout the school and community.=20 </p>

<p> About half of the coordinators reported that </p>

<p> parents were actively involved in D.A.R.E. Our site </p>

<p> visits, however, suggested that parents tend to be rather </p>

<p> detached. D.A.R.E.'s efforts to reach out to parents </p>

<p> through the parent curriculum are commendable and, we </p>

<p> hope, will prove successful. Many such efforts in the </p>

<p> past have proved futile because the parents who are most </p>

<p> in need of educational intervention are also the most </p>

<p> difficult to reach and most resistant to attending </p>

<p> meetings. One additional method to involve parents more </p>

<p> directly in D.A.R.E. is to assign specific parent-child </p>

<p> homework exercises that, at the very least, will open </p>

<p> vital lines of communication between parent and child </p>

<p> concerning drug use. A second method that could </p>

<p> supplement the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum would be to </p>

<p> develop a freestanding, 1-hour video. This video could </p>

<p> be used to provide an introduction to D.A.R.E. and a </p>

<p> synopsis of the D.A.R.E. curriculum, as to well as </p>

<p> provide information about how to effectively reinforce </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s message. It might, for instance, include </p>

<p> advice about how to talk to youth about drugs and stress </p>

<p> the importance of serving as a model for a drug-free </p>

<p> life. We, thus, recommend that D.A.R.E. consider and </p>

<p> weigh the relative merits of a variety of strategies </p>

<p> designed to reach parents who may not respond to the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. parent curriculum. </p>

<p> What role, if any, do D.A.R.E. officers have in treatment </p>

<p> referral for students </p>

<p> who already have substance abuse problems? </p>

<p> An additional role that D.A.R.E. officers can </p>

<p> undertake is to serve as members of student assistance </p>

<p> program (SAP) teams. Of the school districts that had </p>

<p> both SAPs and D.A.R.E., 37% had D.A.R.E. officers who had </p>

<p> been trained to participate in the district's SAP. Most </p>

<p> of the coordinators rated D.A.R.E. officers as highly as </p>

<p> they did guidance counselors (and much higher than </p>

<p> teachers) in effectiveness in implementing SAPs. We </p>

<p> recommend that D.A.R.E. officers become familiar with </p>

<p> SAPs in their schools and, when feasible, become involved </p>

<p> in these programs. We also recommend that the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board establish procedures for </p>

<p> officers to follow when their work with SAPs comes in </p>

<p> conflict with their duties as a police officer, so that </p>

<p> the confidentiality of youth and their parents who have </p>

<p> drug problems may be maintained. </p>

<p> How is D.A.R.E. managed at the national, regional, and </p>

<p> State level, and what </p>

<p> are the major responsibilities of the governing bodies? </p>

<p> At the national level, all D.A.R.E. operations are </p>

<p> overseen by D.A.R.E. America, a nonprofit organization </p>

<p> that bears ultimate responsibility for promoting, </p>

<p> monitoring, and overseeing the program. In this </p>

<p> capacity, D.A.R.E. America is assisted by a number of </p>

<p> regional and State organizations. These include five </p>

<p> RTCs that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory </p>

<p> Board and make recommendations to D.A.R.E. America </p>

<p> concerning the accreditation of State-level training </p>

<p> centers and monitor the fidelity with which the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum is taught at the local level. Educational </p>

<p> specialists representing the RTCs, together with staff </p>

<p> from the Los Angeles United School District (LAUSD) and </p>

<p> assisted by a Scientific Advisory Committee, also make </p>

<p> recommendations to D.A.R.E. America concerning </p>

<p> modifications to the various D.A.R.E. curricula. </p>

<p> State-level D.A.R.E. entities include chartered </p>

<p> nonprofit D.A.R.E. organizations designed to support the </p>

<p> program in that State; such organizations currently exist </p>

<p> in over one-third of the States, and it is expected that </p>

<p> they will be chartered in all 50. In those States that </p>

<p> currently lack such an organization, there is typically a </p>

<p> State employee designated as a D.A.R.E. coordinator. In </p>

<p> addition, 42 States currently have developed State </p>

<p> Training Centers (STCs), the purpose of which is to </p>

<p> conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. officers. </p>

<p> Updating and improving curricular materials and </p>

<p> teaching strategies is a difficult task. We commend </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America for convening a Scientific Advisory </p>

<p> Committee, and for choosing Dr. Kleber as committee </p>

<p> chair. It is our understanding that the committee's </p>

<p> charge is an expansive one and includes reviewing current </p>

<p> and ongoing D.A.R.E. evaluations, and integrating </p>

<p> relevant findings from other evaluations of school-based </p>

<p> drug prevention programs. We recognize the constraints </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. faces in updating the curricula, given the </p>

<p> considerable costs required to retrain D.A.R.E. officers </p>

<p> appropriately. Hence, it is probably not feasible to </p>

<p> make substantive changes to the curricula more frequently </p>

<p> than once every 5 years, at a minimum. </p>

<p> Another source of expertise that should be tapped </p>

<p> as input for curricular changes is the U.S. Department of </p>

<p> Education. Various D.A.R.E. materials encourage the </p>

<p> establishment of strong ties between D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> education at both the State and local levels. At the </p>

<p> national level, an educational consultant from each of </p>

<p> the five RTCs make suggestions concerning the curricula.=20 </p>

<p> However, it is our understanding that this group lacks </p>

<p> representation from a national-level education agency.=20 </p>

<p> We thus recommend thatthe D.A.R.E. America request an
appropriate member of= </p>

<p> the </p>

<p> U.S. Department of Education to serve as an ex officio </p>

<p> member, who should represent the department's extensive </p>

<p> drug prevention program. Such an individual would be </p>

<p> able to provide D.A.R.E. America with guidance as to how </p>

<p> effectively to integrate D.A.R.E. into the Department of </p>

<p> Education's comprehensive, K-12 drug prevention strategy.=20 </p>

<p> Furthermore, the inclusion of a U.S. Department of </p>

<p> Education staff member seems particularly appropriate as </p>

<p> long as D.A.R.E. continues to be mentioned as a specific </p>

<p> line item on the DFSCA budget. =20 </p>

<p> State coordinators informed us that over one-third </p>

<p> of the States had policy advisory boards (PABs), a </p>

<p> proportion that may have increased in the 2 years since </p>

<p> our survey. Because PABs can be instrumental in </p>

<p> developing and maintaining communications and positive </p>

<p> relationships among the various agencies involved in </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., we recommend that all States establish such </p>

<p> boards. </p>

<p> The great majority of the PABs comprise </p>

<p> representatives of both State and local law enforcement </p>

<p> and education. Other key individuals from the community </p>

<p> who have a stake in the success of D.A.R.E. or who could </p>

<p> provide different and valuable perspectives on D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> were less well represented. These include parents, </p>

<p> members of community-based organizations, citizens-at- </p>

<p> large, members of associations of educators, and business </p>

<p> representatives. The latter could be particularly </p>

<p> helpful in securing resources for D.A.R.E. We thus </p>

<p> recommend that State-level PABs systematically examine </p>

<p> their representation and seek ways to reach out to new </p>

<p> and potentially useful constituencies by expanding their </p>

<p> membership. </p>

<p> Because of the unique partnership between D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and education, it is critical that State-level D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> operations have strong ties to education at the State </p>

<p> level. Around one-third of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators reported a great deal of communication with </p>

<p> the State Department of Education, and another 50% </p>

<p> reported having at least some communication. We also </p>

<p> note that one State D.A.R.E. coordinator was affiliated </p>

<p> with a State Department of Education, and that three PABs </p>

<p> were chaired by staff members from State or local </p>

<p> education departments. The need to improve communication </p>

<p> with their State's education departments was mentioned by </p>

<p> several State D.A.R.E. coordinators. </p>

<p> One way to improve communication between D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and education is for State D.A.R.E. programs to retain </p>

<p> educational consultants to act as liaisons. Two-thirds </p>

<p> of the State coordinators reported employing such a </p>

<p> consultant, and almost all of the States without </p>

<p> educational consultants considered acquiring a full-time </p>

<p> educational consultant to be priority. We recommend that </p>

<p> all State D.A.R.E. programs secure educational </p>

<p> consultants. </p>

<p> In a few States, the State D.A.R.E. programs </p>

<p> employed their own educational consultants. In most </p>

<p> States, however, educational consultants were employed by </p>

<p> education departments. We believe the liaison between </p>

<p> law enforcement and education will be most effective if </p>

<p> the consultants are based in the State Departments of </p>

<p> Education. Ideally, to ensure a maximum level of </p>

<p> coordination both with the State Departments of Education </p>

<p> as a whole and with their drug-free schools program in </p>

<p> particular, these consultants should be members of the </p>

<p> departments' alcohol and drug prevention offices.=20 </p>

<p> Certainly, regardless of whether the education </p>

<p> consultants are employed by education or directly by the </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. program, they should seek all appropriate </p>

<p> means to establish meaningful affiliations with State- </p>

<p> level educational agencies. By the same token, education </p>

<p> agencies should be apprised of=FEand take seriously=FEtheir </p>

<p> responsibility to include D.A.R.E. representatives in </p>

<p> planning statewide drug prevention activities. To be </p>

<p> truly effective, education and law enforcement need to </p>

<p> work together in a partnership at the national and State </p>

<p> levels as well as at the local level. </p>

<p> Educational consultants' roles may vary, but </p>

<p> besides providing a &quot;bridge&quot; between the two </p>

<p> organizations, the consultants should help ensure that </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s multiple curricula fit into a comprehensive, </p>

<p> developmentally appropriate drug prevention program.=20 </p>

<p> Several coordinators mentioned that consultants could </p>

<p> assist with program evaluation and with monitoring </p>

<p> officer performance in the classroom. It may be </p>

<p> appropriate to consider expanding the roles of </p>

<p> educational consultants further, perhaps to provide </p>

<p> assistance in these areas. =20 </p>

<p> How is D.A.R.E. managed at the local level? </p>

<p> At the local level, the majority of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> programs were managed by a single law enforcement agency, </p>

<p> primarily the sheriff's or city/town police department.=20 </p>

<p> Officer selection and classroom activities was most </p>

<p> frequently mentioned as the responsibility of the police </p>

<p> department, selection of D.A.R.E. classrooms was the </p>

<p> responsibility of the school administration and staff, </p>

<p> and responsibility for selection of D.A.R.E. schools was </p>

<p> shared by the police department, school administration </p>

<p> and staff, and the school superintendent.=20 </p>

<p> In a number of places throughout this report, we </p>

<p> have mentioned that D.A.R.E. is a collaborative venture </p>

<p> between a local school district and a law enforcement </p>

<p> agency, and we have emphasized the importance of </p>

<p> developing a positive relationship between the two from </p>

<p> the outset. One way to foster this relationship at the </p>

<p> local level is with written agreements that clearly state </p>

<p> the roles and responsibilities of each. Less than half </p>

<p> of the drug prevention coordinators mentioned that their </p>

<p> districts had such an agreement. We recognize that some </p>

<p> of the coordinators responding to our survey may simply </p>

<p> not have known that a written agreement existed, </p>

<p> particularly if they were new in their position and the </p>

<p> agreement had been written before they were employed. We </p>

<p> recommend that the law enforcement agencies without such </p>

<p> agreements secure them. Furthermore, we recommend that </p>

<p> the agreements be reviewed with school administration/ </p>

<p> staff at least every other year. This biennial review </p>

<p> would ensure that all parties are aware of their </p>

<p> responsibilities and could also serve as forums to </p>

<p> discuss issues relating to D.A.R.E.'s implementation and </p>

<p> to develop additional ways in which the D.A.R.E. officer </p>

<p> can serve the schools. They could also provide </p>

<p> opportunities for the school district to recognize the </p>

<p> officer's contribution. </p>

<p> Another way to engender a positive collaboration </p>

<p> between law enforcement and education is by developing </p>

<p> close liaisons between the D.A.R.E. officer and classroom </p>

<p> teacher. Such liaisons have obvious benefits, including </p>

<p> providing a role model for new officers, sharing the </p>

<p> burden of difficult classes or difficult students, and </p>

<p> increasing the likelihood that the teacher will reinforce </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. message in other areas of instruction. We </p>

<p> learned from the drug prevention coordinators' survey </p>

<p> that classroom teachers in almost three-quarters of the </p>

<p> school districts with D.A.R.E. now integrate the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> message into their other activities in the classroom, so </p>

<p> that the program has a strong foundation in this area on </p>

<p> which to build. We thus recommend that D.A.R.E. officers </p>

<p> spend more time consulting with classroom teachers, both </p>

<p> formally at the beginning of the semester and informally </p>

<p> as the semester progresses. Topics for conversation </p>

<p> should include both the content of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum and how teachers can effectively articulate an </p>

<p> anti-drug message. </p>

<p> What funding mechanisms are at the national/regional, </p>

<p> State, and local levels? </p>

<p> At the national/regional level, funding is received </p>

<p> primarily from BJA. The RTC coordinators mentioned the </p>

<p> need to find permanent funding sources that will </p>

<p> supplement Federal support and make D.A.R.E. less </p>

<p> vulnerable to the vicissitudes of such funding. One </p>

<p> solution to this issue is to establish or strengthen </p>

<p> reliance on State or local support, particularly the </p>

<p> latter. =20 </p>

<p> The majority of State D.A.R.E. programs receive </p>

<p> funding from BJA grants; around one-fourth of the States </p>

<p> received funding from governors' grants, grants from </p>

<p> other State agencies, and legislative funds. Four States </p>

<p> reported that they received no funding for their State- </p>

<p> level operations, and around one-third mentioned that </p>

<p> maintaining and increasing their funding or locating new </p>

<p> funding sources were among the most significant issues </p>

<p> facing them. If they are to discharge multiple </p>

<p> responsibilities for developing and managing their </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs successfully, the States must have </p>

<p> sufficient support. We recommend that the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board explore further the various </p>

<p> sources of support used by the State programs, and how </p>

<p> these have been obtained, and then provide technical </p>

<p> assistance to those States that currently operate with </p>

<p> either no funding or whose funding is precariously low.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America could perhaps play a role in assisting </p>

<p> the development and maintenance of the STCs by providing </p>

<p> modest grant programs to assist States. =20 </p>

<p> At the local level, the cost of assigning a police </p>

<p> officer to deliver D.A.R.E. is assumed by the local city </p>

<p> or county law enforcement agency, and thus, ultimately, </p>

<p> by the community. Only a small minority of prevention </p>

<p> coordinators (one in six) indicated that program costs </p>

<p> were a barrier to implementation. D.A.R.E. America </p>

<p> assumes the costs of program curriculum materials. The </p>

<p> coordinators also informed us that primary support for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. came from law enforcement, but that DFSCA funds </p>

<p> also played a major role in supporting D.A.R.E., as did </p>

<p> (to a lesser extent) school district funds. We note that </p>

<p> non-D.A.R.E. drug prevention programs appear much more </p>

<p> dependent on DFSCA funds than does D.A.R.E. Given </p>

<p> projected cuts in the DFSCA budget, which we understand </p>

<p> may amount to as much as 25% in the near future, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s relative lack of reliance on DFSCA funds will </p>

<p> prove beneficial. We also note that D.A.R.E. is </p>

<p> relatively less dependent on local funds than are non- </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs, which also decreases D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> vulnerability to cuts as competing demands increase ever </p>

<p> tighter budgets. </p>

<p> How adequately does D.A.R.E. training meet the needs of </p>

<p> an expanding and changing program? </p>

<p> As noted earlier, the core curriculum has recently </p>

<p> been revised, and the new version is currently being </p>

<p> implemented. Because of D.A.R.E.'s magnitude, curricular </p>

<p> changes are far-reaching and, thus, expensive and time- </p>

<p> consuming to implement. Therefore, modifications to any </p>

<p> of the D.A.R.E. curricula must necessarily be weighed </p>

<p> against the substantial costs associated with updating </p>

<p> and distributing material, as well as retraining D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers. Nevertheless, modifications to the curricula </p>

<p> will need to be made periodically if D.A.R.E. is to </p>

<p> remain on the &quot;cutting edge&quot; of drug prevention </p>

<p> programming.=20 </p>

<p> To reduce the burden on D.A.R.E. of keeping </p>

<p> officers up-to-date with modifications to the curriculum, </p>

<p> the RTCs should explore novel means to provide officers </p>

<p> with curriculum and teaching updates and to provide </p>

<p> formal in-service training on a periodic basis. One in- </p>

<p> service training method that should be considered is the </p>

<p> use of the Law Enforcement Television Network (LETN).=20 </p>

<p> Because a substantial and growing number of police and </p>

<p> sheriffs' departments are linked to this network, it </p>

<p> could be an effective and cost-efficient means of </p>

<p> providing high-quality in-service programming to D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers around the country. Ideally, such a system </p>

<p> should be interactive to allow for discussions between </p>

<p> officers and trainers. Another less costly and more </p>

<p> accessible method that could be explored is the use of </p>

<p> videotaped programs to explain and demonstrate changes to </p>

<p> curricula and teaching methods. Still another </p>

<p> alternative is to use an on-line computer billboard to </p>

<p> distribute the latest D.A.R.E. information. This method </p>

<p> could be made available at very low cost to all police </p>

<p> departments with computers and modems. We learned from </p>

<p> the January 1992 D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board </p>

<p> minutes that such a system was being developed by </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America and indeed may now be in place. </p>

<p> In-service training should clearly not be </p>

<p> restricted to teaching D.A.R.E. officers how to implement </p>

<p> modifications to existing curricula. Such training could </p>

<p> also serve to increase the competence of newly minted </p>

<p> officers over their first semester. Regardless of how </p>

<p> powerful and effective the initial 80-hour introduction </p>

<p> to D.A.R.E. is, D.A.R.E. officers are bound to forget </p>

<p> some of what they have been taught when, 3 months later, </p>

<p> they are teaching one of the final D.A.R.E. lessons for </p>

<p> the first time. One potentially useful device would be </p>

<p> to develop and distribute taped versions of an expert </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officer delivering the curriculum to real </p>

<p> classrooms, which new officers could be encouraged to </p>

<p> review immediately prior to the first time they teach the </p>

<p> lesson. Such tapes could serve several purposes: to </p>

<p> reinforce the content of what should be taught, to model </p>

<p> how the lesson should be taught, and to teach classroom </p>

<p> management techniques. Each videotape might highlight </p>

<p> dealing with a special problem (e.g., how to generate a </p>

<p> discussion when students tend to be silent; how to draw </p>

<p> out a shy or largely silent child; and how to respond </p>

<p> when a child discloses drug use by a peer, friend, or </p>

<p> family member). Each of these tapes should be relatively </p>

<p> short (or they will not be viewed) but could be followed </p>

<p> by a summary of the key points the officer should keep in </p>

<p> mind in teaching the next lesson. The tapes would also </p>

<p> help ensure that a primary goal of D.A.R.E. be reached-- </p>

<p> that lessons be taught uniformly. </p>

<p> Another training issue confronting the RTCs is the </p>

<p> development and maintenance of STCs. As D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> continues to grow=FEand our study has demonstrated that </p>

<p> demand for D.A.R.E. shows no signs of abatement=FEthe RTCs </p>

<p> will become increasingly challenged to meet the training </p>

<p> and monitoring needs of their constituent States. The </p>

<p> development and maintenance of STCs is critical because </p>

<p> the RTCs cannot assume the multiple burdens of training, </p>

<p> mentoring, and monitoring D.A.R.E. officers, as well as </p>

<p> assisting local law enforcement in developing and </p>

<p> maintaining effective ties with school districts. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators indicated that training and monitoring </p>

<p> officers already strain the capacities of the RTCs. We </p>

<p> recommend that sufficient funding be appropriated to </p>

<p> establish and/or maintain an STC in every State. =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers are not the only D.A.R.E. staff </p>

<p> in need of ongoing training and technical assistance; </p>

<p> several RTC coordinators indicated that many of the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinators have a similar need. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators also indicated that State coordinators need </p>

<p> support in developing lines of communication and </p>

<p> authority with local-level law enforcement agencies and </p>

<p> school districts, many of which have been operating with </p>

<p> a fair degree of autonomy or have been used to dealing </p>

<p> directly with the RTCs. It might be helpful if the RTCs </p>

<p> brought together their constituent State coordinators at </p>

<p> least yearly to discover and discuss common needs and </p>

<p> concerns and provide technical assistance to the </p>

<p> coordinators as a group as appropriate. However, the </p>

<p> need will still exist for resources to support individual </p>

<p> consultation between the RTCs and their respective State </p>

<p> coordinators. </p>

<p> As we mentioned earlier, the demand for D.A.R.E. in </p>

<p> school districts that currently lack the program is </p>

<p> likely to be exacerbated by the lack of available </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers. Fully 60% of the school districts </p>

<p> indicated that they want either to begin or increase </p>

<p> their use of D.A.R.E. Some of the RTC staff indicated </p>

<p> training may not be able to keep up with the demand for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Almost 15% of the drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> identified lack of sufficient officers as a barrier to </p>

<p> implementing D.A.R.E. This problem was illustrated in </p>

<p> the urban D.A.R.E. school district we visited, where lack </p>

<p> of available officers led to dissatisfaction on the part </p>

<p> of school officials as officers were moved from one </p>

<p> school to another to accommodate demand. Clearly, those </p>

<p> communities in which D.A.R.E. is a high priority but </p>

<p> which lack sufficient D.A.R.E. instructors should provide </p>

<p> greater support to their law enforcement agencies to </p>

<p> recruit and train additional officers. Further, the </p>

<p> surprisingly high prevalence of the relatively new junior </p>

<p> and high school D.A.R.E. curricula suggests that each </p>

<p> community should examine the extent of the perceived need </p>

<p> for each D.A.R.E. curriculum and develop a long-range </p>

<p> plan to identify and fund additional officers as </p>

<p> necessary. </p>

<p> Any substantive curricular changes affecting what, </p>

<p> and especially how, D.A.R.E. officers teach, should be </p>

<p> accompanied by a determined effort to ensure that these </p>

<p> changes are fully reflected in officer behavior in the </p>

<p> classroom. The RTC coordinators clearly stressed the </p>

<p> need for increasing officer monitoring in the field as </p>

<p> well. Monitoring officers, however, is only part of the </p>

<p> task. Adequate resources should also be made available </p>

<p> to allow mentors to work closely with officers whose </p>

<p> performance needs improvement. </p>

<p> Outcome Assessment </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. outcome assessment, described in </p>

<p> Chapter 7, had four primary objectives. These were </p>

<p> (a) to identify prior studies of D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness </p>

<p> as a drug use prevention program, (b) to assess the </p>

<p> quality and adequacy of the methodologies of these </p>

<p> studies, (c) to summarize D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness based </p>

<p> on this research, and (d) to compare D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness with that of other school-based drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs. </p>

<p> We focused our assessment on the original D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum, which is the heart of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program. We did not include the junior high school, </p>

<p> senior high school, and other D.A.R.E. curricula in the </p>

<p> outcome assessment because they are more recent, not as </p>

<p> prevalent, and generally have yet to be evaluated.=20 </p>

<p> Future evaluation efforts should focus on these </p>

<p> curricula, as well as on the revised core curriculum </p>

<p> implemented in September 1994. </p>

<p> Questions that guided the outcome assessment are </p>

<p> discussed in this section. </p>

<p> What were the scope, reliability, and technical quality </p>

<p> of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> assessments? </p>

<p> A number of States and smaller localities have been </p>

<p> actively involved in assessing the D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum since 1983, when the program was initiated in </p>

<p> Los Angeles. By using multiple sources to identify </p>

<p> studies, we obtained reports of 18 outcome studies in </p>

<p> twelve States and one Canadian province. These studies </p>

<p> collected data from students concerning D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness in influencing outcomes the curriculum </p>

<p> seeks to change. </p>

<p> We defined a set of methodological criteria to use </p>

<p> in assessing the quality and adequacy of the study </p>

<p> methodologies. The criteria, based on review of the </p>

<p> evaluation methodology literature, were (a) that the </p>

<p> study compared students who received D.A.R.E. to students </p>

<p> in a control or comparison group who did not receive </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.; (b) that outcomes of interest, such as drug </p>

<p> use, were measured both before D.A.R.E. was implemented </p>

<p> and after the program ended; (c) that measures of the </p>

<p> outcomes were constructed so as to ensure reasonable </p>

<p> certainty that they were measured accurately; and </p>

<p> (d) that in the absence of random assignment, the </p>

<p> analysis strategy adjusted for any initial differences on </p>

<p> outcome variables between D.A.R.E. and comparison </p>

<p> students. </p>

<p> Half of the 18 studies met these methodological </p>

<p> criteria; however, one study was not considered further </p>

<p> because the children were tested 1 year later rather than </p>

<p> immediately after the program. That 50% of the studies </p>

<p> were of this technical quality suggests that a high level </p>

<p> of effort has been invested in carefully evaluating </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Because these studies avoid many of the </p>

<p> problems that commonly undermine evaluation studies, </p>

<p> reasonable confidence can be placed in their findings.=20 </p>

<p> Some of the studies exceeded our criteria, for example, </p>

<p> by randomly assigning D.A.R.E. to schools, by analyzing </p>

<p> attrition effects, by statistically adjusting differences </p>

<p> in students' background characteristics, or by using an </p>

<p> analysis strategy appropriate to the research design. We </p>

<p> recommend that these features be incorporated into future </p>

<p> studies. </p>

<p> In assessing the findings of the eight </p>

<p> methodologically rigorous D.A.R.E. studies, it should be </p>

<p> noted that the studies are not a national sample of </p>

<p> representatively selected sites. It is reassuring, </p>

<p> however, that the findings tended to be consistent across </p>

<p> studies, indicating that the conclusions they suggest </p>

<p> about the effectiveness of the D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> are reliable. </p>

<p> What gaps in the D.A.R.E. assessments merit attention? </p>

<p> Our review of studies suggested several </p>

<p> methodological issues that should be addressed directly </p>

<p> and critically by future studies. These include the </p>

<p> complete and careful reporting of the research design and </p>

<p> results, contamination of the comparison group, the </p>

<p> appropriateness of the analysis strategy, and the control </p>

<p> and analysis of attrition. </p>

<p> Although most of the studies we reviewed documented </p>

<p> the research procedures and methods, some did not provide </p>

<p> sufficient detail. Thorough documentation is needed for </p>

<p> assessing and interpreting the results; information was </p>

<p> most often lacking in the description of the study </p>

<p> sample. In addition to the exact sample sizes of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and comparison groups, sociodemographic </p>

<p> information such as whether recipients live in urban, </p>

<p> suburban, or rural areas, their racial/ethnic </p>

<p> composition, and their SES, should all be reported. This </p>

<p> information is needed for assessing the degree to which </p>

<p> study results may be generalized. It also can be used to </p>

<p> test whether D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness varies by </p>

<p> characteristics of the sample. For example, is D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> equally effective among inner-city, suburban, and rural </p>

<p> students and among white, African American, and Hispanic </p>

<p> students? Almost none of the studies we reviewed made </p>

<p> these sorts of assessments. Sociodemographic information </p>

<p> also is relevant when making comparisons between studies </p>

<p> (as we did between D.A.R.E. and other school-based drug </p>

<p> use prevention programs) in order to assess the </p>

<p> similarity of the recipients of programs being compared. </p>

<p> An issue related to the completeness of reporting </p>

<p> is the need for reports of research to be accessible to </p>

<p> all those interested in D.A.R.E., including sponsors, </p>

<p> educators, parents, police officers, other researchers, </p>

<p> and concerned citizens. Most of the studies we </p>

<p> identified were not reported in the published literature, </p>

<p> and therefore are not easily accessible. It is vitally </p>

<p> important that reports be made quickly and widely </p>

<p> available. As we have suggested earlier, we recommend </p>

<p> that a library of D.A.R.E. evaluation reports and </p>

<p> associated summaries of key findings be maintained by the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board. The extensive </p>

<p> communication channels between local, state, and national </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. entities should facilitate the prompt </p>

<p> identification and dissemination of evaluation studies. </p>

<p> One of the most important methodological issues </p>

<p> raised by our review is the potential contamination of </p>

<p> the control group by exposure to D.A.R.E. or to other </p>

<p> drug use prevention programs. Although none of the </p>

<p> comparison groups in the methodologically rigorous </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies was exposed to D.A.R.E. between pretest </p>

<p> and immediate posttest, contamination was an issue for </p>

<p> some studies conducting longer-term evaluations. This </p>

<p> contributed to our inability to evaluate D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness beyond immediate posttest. Ironically, </p>

<p> contamination is particularly problematic for D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations because of the rapid dissemination of the </p>

<p> program and because of the various curricula now </p>

<p> prevalent for students at different grade levels. It is </p>

<p> increasingly possible, for example, for a control group </p>

<p> not receiving the D.A.R.E. core curriculum to receive the </p>

<p> junior high school curriculum, effectively reducing its </p>

<p> utility as a control group. </p>

<p> A larger, but more subtle comparison group problem </p>

<p> is that the prevalence of school-based drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs in general makes it virtually </p>

<p> impossible to find a true &quot;no treatment&quot; control
group.=20 </p>

<p> Hence, when comparing D.A.R.E. to another drug education </p>

<p> program, effectiveness is determined on a comparative </p>

<p> rather than an absolute basis. For example, a finding of </p>

<p> little difference in effectiveness may indicate that both </p>

<p> programs are effective rather than that D.A.R.E. is of </p>

<p> limited effectiveness or both programs are ineffective.=20 </p>

<p> None of the studies we reviewed indicated whether the </p>

<p> control group received any drug use prevention </p>

<p> programming, much less provided information about it.=20 </p>

<p> Future studies should describe any prevention </p>

<p> interventions being delivered to the comparison group and </p>

<p> discuss the implications for the results. </p>

<p> An increasingly recognized methodological concern </p>

<p> in the evaluation of school-based interventions is the </p>

<p> importance of following an analysis strategy that is </p>

<p> appropriate to the study design (Moskowitz, 1993; Murray </p>

<p> &amp; Hannan, 1990). Only two of the methodologically </p>

<p> rigorous studies addressed this issue in the statistical </p>

<p> analyses. When D.A.R.E. is assigned by schools, which is </p>

<p> usually the case, or by classrooms rather than by </p>

<p> individuals, the analysis strategy must take into account </p>

<p> the correlations among students in the same school or </p>

<p> classroom. This requires performing analyses at the </p>

<p> aggregate level (e.g., through comparison of school or </p>

<p> classroom means) or by statistically correcting for </p>

<p> within-school or within-classroom correlations. Analyses </p>

<p> that do not account for the correlations among subjects </p>

<p> tend to underestimate the variability in outcomes across </p>

<p> schools and therefore overstate the statistical </p>

<p> significance of treatment effects (i.e., the difference </p>

<p> between the D.A.R.E. and control schools). Because </p>

<p> statistical significance is often used as an indicator of </p>

<p> effectiveness, this can artificially inflate the effects </p>

<p> and thus unfairly bias interpretation of the results. </p>

<p> Related to this issue is the need for sufficiently </p>

<p> large samples to provide adequate statistical power for </p>

<p> detecting significant differences between D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> comparison groups. Most of the D.A.R.E. studies reviewed </p>

<p> had large numbers of students. However, because the </p>

<p> sample of interest, as described above, usually revolves </p>

<p> around schools as opposed to students, it is important </p>

<p> that sample size determinations in future studies be </p>

<p> based on analysis of the number of schools needed in </p>

<p> treatment and control conditions. </p>

<p> The final methodological issue raised by our review </p>

<p> of studies concerns the careful control and analysis of </p>

<p> study attrition. Attrition can affect both the external </p>

<p> and internal validity of the study. Attrition rates were </p>

<p> usually reported in the D.A.R.E. studies selected for </p>

<p> review. However, data on demographic and pretest </p>

<p> differences in drug use and other predictor measures </p>

<p> between those who remained in and those who dropped out </p>

<p> of the study were less frequently reported. Attrition </p>

<p> analyses can reveal whether subjects who were lost to </p>

<p> follow-up disproportionately represent drug users or </p>

<p> those at risk of drug use. When this is the case, it </p>

<p> compromises the external validity of the study by </p>

<p> limiting the population to which the study results may be </p>

<p> generalized. When differential attrition occurs by </p>

<p> experimental condition, for example, such that a larger </p>

<p> proportion of drug users is lost from the intervention </p>

<p> than the control group, the internal validity of the </p>

<p> study is undermined. That is, the extent to which either </p>

<p> positive or negative outcomes can be attributed to the </p>

<p> intervention is limited. </p>

<p> We recommend that all future D.A.R.E. evaluations </p>

<p> not only meet, but also exceed each of the methodological </p>

<p> criteria used for our review by addressing these </p>

<p> methodological issues. Specifically, in addition to </p>

<p> meeting the criteria used for this review, we recommend </p>

<p> that studies report sample demographics, draw a sample </p>

<p> with sufficient statistical power to detect differences </p>

<p> in outcomes, use an analysis strategy appropriate to the </p>

<p> way D.A.R.E. is assigned, minimize attrition, and analyze </p>

<p> differential attrition across treatment groups. In </p>

<p> addition, we strongly recommend the use of an </p>

<p> experimental research design, in which schools are </p>

<p> randomly assigned to either D.A.R.E. or control </p>

<p> conditions. It is probably insufficient to assign </p>

<p> classrooms at random within schools, because the </p>

<p> activities of D.A.R.E. officers outside the classroom may </p>

<p> affect (or &quot;contaminate&quot;) other classes. Although
there </p>

<p> frequently are difficulties inherent in using an </p>

<p> experimental design, results from experimental studies </p>

<p> always will be subject to fewer questions about validity </p>

<p> than those of quasi-experimental studies. A small set of </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. evaluations studies we reviewed used an </p>

<p> experimental study design and incorporated other </p>

<p> methodological features into the design. This level of </p>

<p> rigor is needed if future D.A.R.E. evaluation research is </p>

<p> to contribute further to knowledge about D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness. </p>

<p> What overall assessment of D.A.R.E. do the study findings </p>

<p> suggest? </p>

<p> As described in Chapter 7, we used meta-analytic </p>

<p> techniques to synthesize and assess the findings of eight </p>

<p> methodologically rigorous studies of the original </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. core curriculum. Our approach required </p>

<p> calculating individual study effect sizes for drug use </p>

<p> and other outcomes targeted by the core curriculum and </p>

<p> then averaging effect sizes across studies. Effect sizes </p>

<p> facilitate comparing and summarizing results across </p>

<p> studies because they transform the results of the </p>

<p> studies, which may have been derived from a wide variety </p>

<p> of statistical tests, to a common metric. Hence, in </p>

<p> terms of statistical output, the results of one study are </p>

<p> comparable with those of another study. Furthermore, </p>

<p> effect sizes are a more useful indicator of effectiveness </p>

<p> than comparing whether results are statistically </p>

<p> significant from one study to another. This is because </p>

<p> statistical significance can be influenced by such </p>

<p> factors as sample size and analysis strategy, making </p>

<p> comparisons problematic. </p>

<p> The magnitude of the effect sizes, when considered </p>

<p> both within each study and averaged across studies, </p>

<p> indicated that D.A.R.E. was most effective at immediate </p>

<p> posttest in increasing knowledge about drug use and in </p>

<p> enhancing social skills. The average effect sizes </p>

<p> reported for these outcomes were statistically </p>

<p> significant and larger than for other outcomes. It is </p>

<p> consistent with other meta-analyses for the largest </p>

<p> effect sizes to be associated with knowledge change, </p>

<p> supporting the general observation that knowledge is more </p>

<p> amenable to change than attitudes or behavior. Averaged </p>

<p> across studies, D.A.R.E. also had statistically </p>

<p> significant effects on attitudes about drugs, attitude </p>

<p> toward the police, and self-esteem. The effect sizes </p>

<p> were smaller, however, than for knowledge and social </p>

<p> skills, indicating fewer meaningful changes in these </p>

<p> areas. </p>

<p> The smallest immediate effect sizes were for drug </p>

<p> use (alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana separately and </p>

<p> averaged together), and except for tobacco use, none was </p>

<p> statistically significant. In interpreting the small </p>

<p> magnitude of D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with respect to </p>

<p> drug use behavior, it is important to note that the </p>

<p> immediate effect sizes may reflect, at least in part, the </p>

<p> relatively low frequency of drug use by the elementary </p>

<p> school pupils targeted by the original core curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> The effect sizes probably also reflect the short time </p>

<p> interval from pretest to immediate posttest for behavior </p>

<p> change to occur. D.A.R.E. was more effective at </p>

<p> influencing factors believed to mediate drug use. It is </p>

<p> most noteworthy that D.A.R.E. had positive effects on </p>

<p> social skills because it is widely believed that children </p>

<p> with greater social competencies are more able to resist </p>

<p> social pressures to use drugs. Long-term impact of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., therefore, may result from D.A.R.E.'s immediate </p>

<p> impact on social skills. As described earlier, few </p>

<p> longer-term longitudinal studies have been conducted, and </p>

<p> some have been compromised by contamination of the </p>

<p> control group. However, based on two experimental </p>

<p> studies for which reliable information 1 and 2 years </p>

<p> after implementation is available, there is no evidence </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E.'s effects are activated when subjects are </p>

<p> older (Clayton et al., 1991b; Ennett et al., 1994). Most </p>

<p> long-term evaluations of drug use prevention programs </p>

<p> have shown that curriculum effects decay rather than </p>

<p> appear or increase with time (Ellickson et al., 1993; </p>

<p> Murray et al., 1989). </p>

<p> Future D.A.R.E. evaluation studies should continue </p>

<p> to assess drug use, attitudes about drug use, social </p>

<p> skills, and attitude toward police. Drug use indicators </p>

<p> should include tobacco (cigarettes and smokeless </p>

<p> tobacco), alcohol (particularly beer, wine, and wine </p>

<p> coolers), and marijuana. In addition, use of inhalants </p>

<p> and any other drugs that are locally prevalent should be </p>

<p> monitored. It is also important to continue to measure </p>

<p> outcomes targeted by the D.A.R.E. curriculum, such as </p>

<p> social skills, that are believed to indirectly influence </p>

<p> drug use. This requires linking outcome measures to </p>

<p> specific objectives addressed by the various lessons of </p>

<p> the curriculum. These data are needed for measuring a </p>

<p> variety of potentially important program effects other </p>

<p> than drug use behavior, and for testing assumptions about </p>

<p> the means by which the D.A.R.E. curriculum influences </p>

<p> drug use.=20 </p>

<p> For maximal usefulness, we further recommend that </p>

<p> effect sizes be routinely reported with the study results </p>

<p> to facilitate comparison both to the results of this </p>

<p> meta-analysis and those of future studies. As </p>

<p> demonstrated by this meta-analysis, effect sizes can be </p>

<p> readily calculated from a variety of statistical tests, </p>

<p> so this should not place an undue burden on researchers. </p>

<p> When the results of future D.A.R.E. evaluation </p>

<p> studies become available, they should be carefully </p>

<p> studied and compared with the results of the studies </p>

<p> reviewed here. As we recommended earlier, the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board could coordinate periodic </p>

<p> reviews of the evaluations. It is likely that ongoing </p>

<p> review of evaluation results will suggest areas where the </p>

<p> curriculum might need modification. </p>

<p> How well does D.A.R.E. address drug involvement by youth </p>

<p> in general? </p>

<p> The effect sizes discussed above indicate the </p>

<p> extent to which the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> influenced drug use by youth and other outcomes at </p>

<p> immediate posttest. To put the D.A.R.E. results in </p>

<p> context, we compared D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with that </p>

<p> of other school-based drug use prevention programs to </p>

<p> determine whether D.A.R.E. had greater, smaller, or </p>

<p> similar effects. Hence, we compared the average D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> effect sizes for drug use, knowledge, attitudes, and </p>

<p> skills to average effect sizes calculated for other </p>

<p> methodologically strong school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs. We restricted the comparison programs to those </p>

<p> for upper elementary school pupils to make the </p>

<p> comparisons most meaningful. </p>

<p> We compared D.A.R.E. to two broad categories of </p>

<p> prevention programs, namely &quot;interactive&quot; and </p>

<p> &quot;noninteractive&quot; programs (Tobler, in press,
1994).=20 </p>

<p> These two program categories cover most types of current </p>

<p> school-based prevention efforts described in Chapter 2.=20 </p>

<p> Interactive programs generally are the same as the social </p>

<p> competence programs described in that chapter. These </p>

<p> programs represent the most recent advances in drug use </p>

<p> prevention strategies, and emphasize social competencies </p>

<p> and interactive teaching methods. Noninteractive </p>

<p> programs generally include knowledge and affective </p>

<p> programs, also described in Chapter 2. These programs </p>

<p> represent earlier approaches to drug education that </p>

<p> emphasize changing knowledge and attitudes about drug use </p>

<p> through more traditional learning styles. Interestingly, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. shares similarities with both noninteractive and </p>

<p> interactive programs. The original core curriculum was </p>

<p> developed when prevention efforts were in transition </p>

<p> between noninteractive programs (knowledge and affective </p>

<p> education programs) and the emergence of interactive </p>

<p> programs (these emphasizing social influence). </p>

<p> Average D.A.R.E. immediate effect sizes were </p>

<p> greater, except for drug use, than the comparable average </p>

<p> effect sizes for noninteractive programs. The D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> effect sizes were smaller, however, than the effect sizes </p>

<p> for interactive programs. For drug use, the average </p>

<p> effect size for interactive programs was three times </p>

<p> greater than the average D.A.R.E. effect size; for social </p>

<p> skills, four times greater than for D.A.R.E.; and for </p>

<p> attitudes, three times greater. </p>

<p> Interactive programs have been shown to be the most </p>

<p> promising drug use prevention programs; noninteractive </p>

<p> programs generally have been shown to be less effective </p>

<p> (Botvin, 1990; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Because D.A.R.E. shares </p>

<p> features of both interactive and noninteractive programs, </p>

<p> it is perhaps not surprising that the effect sizes we </p>

<p> reported should fall somewhere between. </p>

<p> In Chapter 7, we described several methodological </p>

<p> reasons that could help account for the differences in </p>

<p> effect sizes between the D.A.R.E. studies and the </p>

<p> interactive comparison programs. These included the </p>

<p> possibility that the control groups in the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> studies were exposed to some sort of alternative drug </p>

<p> education programs, whereas the control groups for the </p>

<p> various interactive studies were not. Another possibil- </p>

<p> ity is that because the interactive programs were </p>

<p> primarily university research-based evaluation studies, </p>

<p> the evaluations--and programs themselves--may have been </p>

<p> more stringently implemented and more closely monitored.=20 </p>

<p> Under these conditions, greater effectiveness might be </p>

<p> expected than in real-world conditions, such as those </p>

<p> surrounding D.A.R.E. Other possibilities include factors </p>

<p> that may have varied across the intervention programs and </p>

<p> associated evaluation studies that contributed to the </p>

<p> observed differences in effect sizes. For example, </p>

<p> substantial variation in characteristics of the studients </p>

<p> (e.g., in race/ethnicity), features of the interventions </p>

<p> (e.g., variations in program intensity), and features of </p>

<p> the research design (e.g., experimental versus quasi- </p>

<p> experimental design) could have contributed to </p>

<p> differences in program effects. Such possibilities could </p>

<p> not be tested because of the small number of studies.=20 </p>

<p> Further testing is warranted when larger samples of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and comparison studies are available. </p>

<p> It is also important to consider substantive </p>

<p> reasons that could account for the differences. Possible </p>

<p> explanations include the content of the original core </p>

<p> curriculum, the use of law enforcement officers as </p>

<p> instructors, and the more didactic approach of the </p>

<p> instruction. Consideration of each of these explanations </p>

<p> suggests areas for future research and possibly for </p>

<p> programmatic change. </p>

<p> As we have indicated, D.A.R.E.'s curriculum content </p>

<p> has similarities with both noninteractive and interactive </p>

<p> programs, although it has more of an intrapersonal focus </p>

<p> than most interactive programs and, conversely, more of a </p>

<p> skills focus than most noninteractive programs. Perhaps </p>

<p> greater emphasis in the D.A.R.E. core curriculum on </p>

<p> social influences, and less emphasis on affective </p>

<p> factors, might result in effect sizes nearer to those </p>

<p> reported from interactive programs. However, it is </p>

<p> difficult to speculate on the effect of altering the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. curriculum by adding or subtracting particular </p>

<p> lessons. Most evaluations of school-based prevention </p>

<p> programs have assessed the effectiveness of overall </p>

<p> programs rather than of the various program components or </p>

<p> combinations of components. Future research in this area </p>

<p> might suggest particular curriculum changes. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. instruction offers another possible area </p>

<p> of explanation for D.A.R.E.'s relatively poorer </p>

<p> performance compared with interactive programs. Although </p>

<p> instruction by police officers is the sine qua non of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. curriculum, their effectiveness may be less than </p>

<p> other possible program providers. For example, despite </p>

<p> the extensive D.A.R.E. training received by law </p>

<p> enforcement officers, they may not be as well equipped to </p>

<p> lead the curriculum as classroom teachers are. No </p>

<p> studies have been reported in which the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum was offered by anyone other than a police </p>

<p> officer; examination of the results from such a study </p>

<p> might suggest whether police officers are as effective as </p>

<p> other possible instructors. </p>

<p> Regardless of the leader, however, the generally </p>

<p> more traditional teaching style used by D.A.R.E. has not </p>

<p> been shown to be as effective as an interactive teaching </p>

<p> mode (Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Traditional </p>

<p> didactic approaches that involve teachers delivering </p>

<p> information, with little response from students, are </p>

<p> increasingly recognized as undesirable. More effective </p>

<p> are strategies that engage students in a dialogue with </p>

<p> the teacher; more effective still are cooperative or </p>

<p> participatory learning approaches in which the teacher </p>

<p> serves as a facilitator or catalyst to generate </p>

<p> discussions and other interactions among students.=20 </p>

<p> Although some D.A.R.E. activities encourage pupil </p>

<p> interaction, the original core curriculum relies heavily </p>

<p> on the officer as expert and makes frequent use of </p>

<p> lectures and question-answer sessions between the officer </p>

<p> and pupils. In fact, it is in teaching style, not </p>

<p> curriculum content, that D.A.R.E. differs most from the </p>

<p> interactive programs examined by Tobler. In the revised </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. core curriculum, there is greater emphasis on </p>

<p> such cooperative learning experiences. We recommend that </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. training programs urge officers to employ </p>

<p> more interactive methods and provide specific guidance on </p>

<p> how they can do so. </p>

<p> What are the intended and unintended consequences of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s approach to </p>

<p> drug abuse prevention? </p>

<p> None of the studies we reviewed examined </p>

<p> consequences of the D.A.R.E. program, either intended or </p>

<p> unintended, other than those related directly to the </p>

<p> curriculum. However, a number of consequences can be </p>

<p> envisioned. These include effects related to other </p>

<p> behaviors than drug use (e.g., effects on violent and </p>

<p> delinquent behavior). More likely, perhaps, may be </p>

<p> consequences related to the relationship that develops </p>

<p> between the D.A.R.E. officers and students, which may in </p>

<p> turn have positive consequences for police and community </p>

<p> relations in general. Research indicates that the </p>

<p> effects on police officers through their exposure to </p>

<p> students and the problems they face may also be </p>

<p> substantial and beneficial (D.A.R.E. Southeast Regional </p>

<p> Training Center, 1992). It is possible, in fact, that </p>

<p> some of D.A.R.E.'s most important effects are related to </p>

<p> the relations between students and police officers. The </p>

<p> studies we reviewed provided little insight into these </p>

<p> areas. This suggests the importance of research to </p>

<p> explore other consequences related to D.A.R.E.'s approach </p>

<p> to drug use prevention. </p>

<p> Conclusion </p>

<p> As might be expected of an institution as large as </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., our implementation and outcome assessments </p>

<p> present an array of findings and raise a number of issues </p>

<p> deserving of consideration by the D.A.R.E. organization </p>

<p> and all those concerned with this program. Perhaps most </p>

<p> prominently, the findings show a program that has been </p>

<p> extremely successful at placing drug education in our </p>

<p> Nation's schools. Indeed, D.A.R.E. is now implemented in </p>

<p> the majority of school districts in the country and is </p>

<p> expected to grow substantially in coming years. At the </p>

<p> same time, however, as our findings confirm D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> prevalence and popularity, they also suggest that the </p>

<p> original D.A.R.E. core curriculum has not been as </p>

<p> successful in accomplishing its mission to prevent drug </p>

<p> use among fifth and sixth graders as have interactive </p>

<p> programs. Review of the rigorous evaluations of the </p>

<p> original core curriculum, the heart of D.A.R.E., showed </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. had only limited immediate effects on </p>

<p> students' drug use. Although the curriculum was more </p>

<p> successful in influencing other outcomes, such as social </p>

<p> skills, more work is needed to make D.A.R.E. more </p>

<p> effective as a drug use prevention program. </p>

<p> Given D.A.R.E.'s strengths, the task of increasing </p>

<p> the effectiveness of the core curriculum is feasible.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. has achieved its accomplishments to date through </p>

<p> building a complex and solid organizational structure </p>

<p> that reaches from local to national levels, by forging </p>

<p> close partnerships between education and law enforcement, </p>

<p> and by winning substantial community support for the </p>

<p> program. In no other program of this magnitude have </p>

<p> school districts welcomed into the classroom outsiders </p>

<p> who lack traditional educational credentials to replace </p>

<p> teachers as instructors of a major curriculum. These </p>

<p> resources, as well as the dedication of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers in the classroom, should enable D.A.R.E. to move </p>

<p> forward more effectively to meet the challenges of drug </p>

<p> use prevention. In this final section of our assessment, </p>

<p> we briefly recapitulate our major findings and </p>

<p> recommendations. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. 's prevalence. D.A.R.E. is now </p>

<p> implemented in over half the school districts in the </p>

<p> country and is expected to grow substantially in the </p>

<p> coming years. Because it is least prevalent in small and </p>

<p> rural school districts, we believe that ways for these </p>

<p> school districts to increase access to D.A.R.E. should be </p>

<p> examined. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. 's organization. D.A.R.E. is at once </p>

<p> both hierarchical and community-based. Although it is </p>

<p> carefully controlled, monitored, and overseen at the </p>

<p> national, regional, and State levels, it is also very </p>

<p> much a grass-roots movement, dependent on local </p>

<p> initiatives to form partnerships and secure support. At </p>

<p> the State level and above, we suggest that sufficient </p>

<p> resources be made available to support this burgeoning </p>

<p> organization to ensure adequate authority, communication, </p>

<p> technical assistance, and oversight. At the local level, </p>

<p> we believe that alternative sources of support should be </p>

<p> explored so that D.A.R.E. can be freed as much as </p>

<p> possible from dependence on public funds. =20 </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. 's partnership with education. Law </p>

<p> enforcement's relationship with education is the </p>

<p> cornerstone of D.A.R.E. We believe that at all levels a </p>

<p> variety of mechanisms could be instituted to strengthen </p>

<p> this critical partnership. This includes improving </p>

<p> methods for co-teaching D.A.R.E. at the local level, as </p>

<p> well as increasing where possible the already </p>

<p> multifaceted involvement of D.A.R.E. officers in school </p>

<p> life. We also suggest ensuring adequate representation </p>

<p> on advisory boards by staff of departments of education </p>

<p> at the State and national levels. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> Popular support for D.A.R.E. Anecdotal evidence </p>

<p> of grass-roots support for D.A.R.E. is abundant and is </p>

<p> fully confirmed in our study. School-based drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators tended to rate school staff's </p>

<p> attitudes toward D.A.R.E. as well as those of students, </p>

<p> the parents, and the community as very supportive. The </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. curriculum and students' receptivity to the </p>

<p> program, and perhaps most important, D.A.R.E.'s effects </p>

<p> on students were rated as very satisfactory. This </p>

<p> persuasive evidence suggests that whatever modifications </p>

<p> and enhancements may be made to the D.A.R.E. curriculum </p>

<p> and how the program is taught, D.A.R.E.'s organization </p>

<p> and structure at the local level is sound and should be </p>

<p> preserved. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> The original D.A.R.E. core curricula. Drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators' endorsements of D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> positive effects on students are generally not supported </p>

<p> by the results of the methodologically sound short-term </p>

<p> evaluations of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum we </p>

<p> summarized. As indicated earlier, D.A.R.E. demonstrated </p>

<p> somewhat greater effects than those of didactic </p>

<p> school-based drug prevention methods that are based on </p>

<p> affective approaches, but considerably fewer effects than </p>

<p> those of interactive methods that use social influence </p>

<p> approaches. </p>

<p> Because D.A.R.E. already incorporates many </p>

<p> interactive features, we believe that appropriate </p>

<p> modifications can be made both to the core curriculum and </p>

<p> to the way D.A.R.E. is taught that are well within the </p>

<p> context of the institution as a whole. These </p>

<p> modifications should be made periodically (perhaps every </p>

<p> 2 years), as refinements are suggested by evaluations of </p>

<p> drug prevention programs in general, and of D.A.R.E.
inparticular. We comm= </p>

<p> end </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. for convening a </p>

<p> Scientific Advisory Committee that comprises drug </p>

<p> prevention specialists who will review relevant drug </p>

<p> prevention research findings and make recommendations </p>

<p> concerning improvements to the curricula.=20 </p>

<p> In conclusion, D.A.R.E. represents an institution </p>

<p> that is unique in the area of drug use prevention: a </p>

<p> partnership between law enforcement and education that </p>

<p> has the substantial support of children, parents, and the </p>

<p> community at large. Not unexpectedly, along with this </p>

<p> highly visible profile come high expectations. Our </p>

<p> report demonstrates D.A.R.E.'s success in meeting many of </p>

<p> these expectations, as well as challenges that lie ahead.=20 </p>

<p> Key to the continued growth of D.A.R.E. will be careful </p>

<p> monitoring of the effectiveness of the various curricula, </p>

<p> coupled with the willingness to make and assess </p>

<p> modifications that could enhance effectiveness. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> has already demonstrated its responsiveness to change by </p>

<p> the introduction of new curricula, revisions to the core </p>

<p> curriculum, and expanded roles for D.A.R.E. officers.=20 </p>

<p> Equally important to D.A.R.E.'s viability will be its </p>

<p> continued coordination of the roles and responsibilities </p>

<p> of the many D.A.R.E. players. In both of these efforts, </p>

<p> we recommend that D.A.R.E. seek to strengthen its </p>

<p> partnerships with individuals and institutions outside </p>

<p> its bounds. The advice, support, and perspectives of </p>

<p> those who are not part of the D.A.R.E. structure but who </p>

<p> are equally committed to drug use prevention will enhance </p>

<p> the vitality and integrity of the program. We believe </p>

<p> these efforts will result in a program that maintains its </p>

<p> unique identity and place in drug education, while </p>

<p> meeting more effectively the challenge of reducing drug </p>

<p> use among youth. </p>

<p> Individual Study Descriptions </p>

<p> Brief descriptions of the eight methodologically rigorous
studies </p>

<p> selected for the meta-analysis are given below in </p>

<p> alphabetical order by the location of the study. The </p>

<p> research design, sample size and characteristics, and </p>

<p> results for drug use knowledge, attitudes about drug use, </p>

<p> social skills, self-esteem, attitude toward police, and </p>

<p> drug use behavior are reported. Additional information </p>

<p> and greater detail about the study methodologies and </p>

<p> results are available in the reports or papers issued by </p>

<p> each study. </p>

<p> 1.British Columbia </p>

<p> The British Columbia evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Walker, 1990)
used a </p>

<p> quasi-experimental design in which seven schools were </p>

<p> assigned to receive D.A.R.E. and four schools with </p>

<p> similar demographic characteristics were selected for the </p>

<p> comparison condition. The study administered an </p>

<p> anonymous pretest and immediate posttest; assessed </p>

<p> pretest equivalence on some demographic variables and all </p>

<p> outcome variables; and controlled for pretest values on </p>

<p> outcome variables by analyzing change scores at the </p>

<p> aggregate level. The sample included 463 fifth-, sixth-, </p>

<p> and seventh-grade pupils. No information was given on </p>

<p> the ethnic composition of the sample. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statistically
significant </p>

<p> effect on subjects' knowledge about drugs. D.A.R.E. did </p>

<p> not have a statistically significant effect on attitudes </p>

<p> about drug use or on drug use behavior (use of tobacco, </p>

<p> beer, pop, marijuana, acid, valium, wine, aspirin, </p>

<p> uppers, downers, heroin, crack, liquor, candy, glue, and </p>

<p> PCP). </p>

<p> 2. Hawaii </p>

<p> The Hawaii evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Manos, Kameoka, &amp;
Tanji, 1986) </p>

<p> used a quasi-experimental research design in which 23 </p>

<p> schools were assigned to either D.A.R.E. or comparison </p>

<p> conditions. In three other schools, some classrooms were </p>

<p> assigned to D.A.R.E. and other classrooms to the </p>

<p> comparison condition; data from these comparison </p>

<p> classrooms were not included in our analysis. The study </p>

<p> administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched </p>

<p> subjects from pretest to posttest; used some measures </p>

<p> that were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; and controlled for pretest values on outcome </p>

<p> variables. The sample included 2,009 fifth-grade pupils </p>

<p> (not including the pupils in comparison classrooms in the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. schools). No information was given on the </p>

<p> ethnic composition of the sample. Attrition was not </p>

<p> analyzed but was approximately 6%. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statistically
significant </p>

<p> effect in the desired direction on one social skills </p>

<p> indicator (choices in a risk situation). D.A.R.E. did </p>

<p> not have statistically significant effects on another </p>

<p> social skills indicator (assertiveness) or on subjects' </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use. </p>

<p> 3. Illinois-C </p>

<p> The Illinois-C evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Ennett, Rosenbaum, </p>

<p> Flewelling, Bieler, Ringwalt, &amp; Bailey, 1994) used both </p>

<p> an experimental and quasi-experimental design: 12 pairs </p>

<p> of schools serving urban and suburban areas were randomly </p>

<p> assigned to D.A.R.E. and control conditions, while 6 </p>

<p> pairs serving rural areas were assigned using a nonrandom </p>

<p> procedure. The study matched schools on metropolitan </p>

<p> status, ethnic composition, number of students with </p>

<p> English proficiency, and percentage of pupils from low- </p>

<p> income families; administered a pretest and three </p>

<p> posttests (immediately, 1 year, and 2 years after </p>

<p> implementation); matched subjects from pretest to </p>

<p> posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or </p>

<p> derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest </p>

<p> values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence </p>

<p> between the comparison groups; adjusted for school </p>

<p> effects with a nested cohort strategy; and assessed </p>

<p> attrition. The sample included 1,323 subjects who were </p>

<p> fifth and sixth graders at pretest; 54% were white, 22% </p>

<p> were African American, 9% Hispanic, and 15% were American </p>

<p> Indian, Asian American, or &quot;other.&quot; The attrition
rate </p>

<p> over the three posttests was 26% and did not differ </p>

<p> across experimental conditions. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statistically
significant </p>

<p> effects in the desired direction on subjects' self- </p>

<p> esteem, attitude toward police, and increased use of </p>

<p> cigarettes at immediate posttest. D.A.R.E. did not have </p>

<p> statistically significant effects on subjects' attitudes </p>

<p> about drugs (general attitude toward drugs, attitude </p>

<p> toward use of specific drugs, perceived benefits of </p>

<p> cigarette use and alcohol use; perceived costs of </p>

<p> cigarette use and alcohol use; perceived media influence </p>

<p> on smoking and beer drinking); social skills </p>

<p> (assertiveness and peer refusal skills); or on other drug </p>

<p> use behavior (initiation of alcohol, cigarettes, or heavy </p>

<p> drinking; increased use of alcohol or heavy drinking; or </p>

<p> quitting alcohol). </p>

<p> 4. Kentucky-A </p>

<p> The Kentucky-A evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Clayton, Cattarello,
Day, </p>

<p> &amp; Walden, 1991a; Clayton, Cattarello, &amp; Walden,
1991b) </p>

<p> used an experimental design employing random assignment </p>

<p> of 31 schools to either D.A.R.E. or control conditions.=20 </p>

<p> The study administered a pretest and three posttests </p>

<p> (immediately, 1 year, and 2 years after implementation); </p>

<p> matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures </p>

<p> that were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; controlled for pretest values on outcome </p>

<p> variables and initial nonequivalence between the </p>

<p> comparison groups; and assessed attrition. The sample </p>

<p> included 1,925 subjects who were sixth graders at </p>

<p> pretest; 76% were white and 21% were African American.=20 </p>

<p> The attrition rate over the three posttests was </p>

<p> approximately 21% and did not differ across experimental </p>

<p> conditions. </p>

<p> The results showed that, at immediate posttest, D.A.R.E. had </p>

<p> statistically significant effects in the desired </p>

<p> direction on some indicators of subjects' attitudes about </p>

<p> drugs (general attitudes about drugs and negative </p>

<p> attitudes about alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana).=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects </p>

<p> at immediate posttest on other indicators of subjects' </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use (positive attitudes about </p>

<p> alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana), social skills, self- </p>

<p> esteem, or drug use behavior (use of alcohol, cigarettes, </p>

<p> and marijuana). </p>

<p> 5. Kentucky-B </p>

<p> The Kentucky-B evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Faine &amp; Bohlander
1988, </p>

<p> 1989) used a quasi-experimental research design in which </p>

<p> 16 schools, stratified by school type (rural, inner-city, </p>

<p> suburban, and parochial), were randomly selected among </p>

<p> schools assigned to receive D.A.R.E. immediately or at a </p>

<p> later semester (a delayed intervention comparison group).=20 </p>

<p> The study administered a pretest and two posttests </p>

<p> (immediately and one year after implementation); matched </p>

<p> subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that </p>

<p> were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; and controlled for pretest values on outcome </p>

<p> variables and type of school. The sample in the first </p>

<p> year included 783 fifth-grade pupils; sample demographic </p>

<p> characteristics were not given. Attrition information </p>

<p> was not given. By year 2, all the comparison groups had </p>

<p> received the D.A.R.E. program. </p>

<p> The immediate posttest results showed that D.A.R.E. had </p>

<p> statistically significant effects in the desired </p>

<p> direction on subjects' knowledge about drugs, attitudes </p>

<p> about drug use, social skills, self-esteem, and attitude </p>

<p> toward police. </p>

<p> 6. Minnesota </p>

<p> The Minnesota evaluation of D.A.R.E. (McCormick &amp;
McCormick, </p>

<p> 1992) used a quasi-experimental research design in which </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was implemented by semester in 63 schools; </p>

<p> random samples of D.A.R.E. participants and pupils who </p>

<p> would receive D.A.R.E. in the next semester (a delayed </p>

<p> intervention comparison group) were drawn. The study </p>

<p> administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched </p>

<p> subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that </p>

<p> were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; assessed pretest equivalence on selected </p>

<p> demographic variables; and controlled for pretest values </p>

<p> on outcome variables. The sample included 943 fifth </p>

<p> graders; 62% of the D.A.R.E. group participants were </p>

<p> white; 18% Asian Americans, 12% African American, and 7% </p>

<p> Native American or Hispanic (demographic information on </p>

<p> the comparison group was not given). The attrition rate </p>

<p> was 9%. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statistically
significant </p>

<p> effect in the desired direction on subjects' knowledge </p>

<p> about drugs. D.A.R.E. did not have statistically </p>

<p> significant effects on subjects' attitudes about drug </p>

<p> use, social skills, self-esteem, or attitude toward </p>

<p> police. </p>

<p> 7. North Carolina </p>

<p> The North Carolina evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Ringwalt, Ennett,
&amp; </p>

<p> Holt, 1991) used an experimental research design </p>

<p> employing random assignment of 20 schools to either </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. or control conditions. The study administered a </p>

<p> pretest and immediate posttest; matched subjects from </p>

<p> pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized </p>

<p> scales or derived from existing measures; controlled for </p>

<p> pretest values on outcome variables and initial </p>

<p> nonequivalence between the comparison groups; adjusted </p>

<p> for school effects; and assessed attrition. The sample </p>

<p> included 1,270 fifth- and sixth-grade students; 50% were </p>

<p> African American, 40% were white, and 10% were American </p>

<p> Indian, Asian American, or Hispanic. The attrition rate </p>

<p> was 9% and did not differ across experimental conditions. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statistically
significant </p>

<p> effects in the desired direction on subjects' attitudes </p>

<p> about drugs (general attitude toward drugs, attitude </p>

<p> toward use of specific drugs, perceived peer attitude </p>

<p> toward drug use, perceived costs of using alcohol and </p>

<p> cigarettes, and perceptions of the media portrayal of </p>

<p> beer drinking and cigarette smoking) and social skills </p>

<p> (assertiveness). D.A.R.E. did not have statistically </p>

<p> significant effects on subjects' drug use behavior </p>

<p> (alcohol, cigarettes, or inhalant use). </p>

<p> 8. South Carolina </p>

<p> The South Carolina evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Harmon, 1993) used
a </p>

<p> quasi-experimental research design in which five schools </p>

<p> were assigned to receive D.A.R.E. and six schools matched </p>

<p> on demographic characteristics were selected for the </p>

<p> comparison condition. The study administered a pretest </p>

<p> and immediate posttest; matched subjects from pretest to </p>

<p> posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or </p>

<p> derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest </p>

<p> values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence </p>

<p> between the comparison groups; and assessed attrition.=20 </p>

<p> The sample included 602 fifth-grade pupils. The </p>

<p> attrition rate was 13.5% in the D.A.R.E. group and 16.3% </p>

<p> in the comparison groups. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statistically
significant </p>

<p> effects in the desired direction on subjects' attitudes </p>

<p> about drugs, social skills (assertiveness), and </p>

<p> initiation of alcohol use in the past year. D.A.R.E. did </p>

<p> not have statistically significant effects on subjects' </p>

<p> self-esteem, attitude toward police, or other drug use </p>

<p> behavior indicators (previous year tobacco and marijuana </p>

<p> use, and previous month cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana </p>

<p> use). </p>

<p> PREVENTING ILLEGAL DIVERSION OF CHEMICALS: </p>

<p> A MODEL STATUTE </p>

<p> BY SHERRY GREEN </p>

<p> Letter from Michael J. Russell, Acting Director, National
Institute of </p>

<p> Justice: </p>

<p> Chemicals diverted from legitimate commerce are used in the
production of </p>

<p> illicit drugs such as cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, PCP,
and LSD. </p>

<p> Controlling illegal diversion and use of such chemicals is
essential to </p>

<p> limiting illicit drug production. Recent efforts to address
this problem are </p>

<p> based on the belief that illicit drug production can be
traced from the </p>

<p> records of chemical manufacturers and dealers of raw
materials in the same </p>

<p> way that laundered money can be traced through financial
records. </p>

<p> The principal U.S. statute to control chemical diversion is
the Chemical </p>

<p> Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988, which established
record keeping </p>

<p> requirements and enforcement activities, initially for 20
chemicals. </p>

<p> The Act has already proven effective in limiting the
international illicit </p>

<p> diversion of the identified chemicals and controlling some
domestic </p>

<p> manufacturing. However, illicit drug production in the United
States has been </p>

<p> rising at an alarming rate, with illegal domestic
laboratories now capable of </p>

<p> producing enough stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and
narcotics to </p>

<p> satisfy demand for these substances. </p>

<p> Adequate record-keeping ensures that there are paper trails
on chemicals sent </p>

<p> to illegal laboratories that make drugs. Thirty-two States,
however, do not </p>

<p> require record-keeping of transactions involving chemicals
identified as </p>

<p> necessary for producing illegal drugs. Criminals camouflage
diversion of </p>

<p> chemicals by moving shipments through States without
record-keeping </p>

<p> requirements. </p>

<p> To focus attention on the need for all State law enforcement
agencies to </p>

<p> supplement Federal controls over chemical traffic and its
diversion into </p>

<p> illicit drug manufacturing, the National Institute of Justice
sponsored a </p>

<p> project to create a Model State Chemical Control Act. The
Model Act seeks to </p>

<p> balance and accommodate the interests of law enforcement and
legitimate </p>

<p> commerce. This Research in Brief explains how the Model Act
can be used to </p>

<p> help halt the growth of illegal domestic drug manufacturing
by stopping the </p>

<p> diversion of chemicals from legitimate to illegitimate
purposes. </p>

<p> [End letter] </p>

<p> Law enforcement agencies around the world are using a variety
of methods to </p>

<p> attack the illegal and deadly &quot;industry&quot; of illicit
drugs. Enforcement </p>

<p> officials seize contraband substances, break up distribution
networks, </p>

<p> disrupt money-laundering operations, and destroy crops. A
critical part of </p>

<p> this multifaceted attack on drug trafficking is the control
of specific </p>

<p> chemicals that are necessary to produce illegal drugs. </p>

<p> The United States is one of the world's leading producers and
distributors of </p>

<p> the chemicals that are used to make controlled substances.
Each year our </p>

<p> Nation exports more than 50,000 metric tons of chemicals to
Latin America, </p>

<p> many of which find their way into the clandestine
laboratories of cocaine- </p>

<p> and heroin-producing countries. In fact, seizures of illegal
labs in Colombia </p>

<p> and other Latin American countries often uncover chemical
containers with US. </p>

<p> company logos. Until 1989 much of the cocaine entering our
country was </p>

<p> produced using chemicals originating in the United States. </p>

<p> Although there has been a decline in the export of chemicals
for </p>

<p> manufacturing illegal drugs, there has been an increase in
the chemicals' </p>

<p> distribution at home. Illegal domestic laboratories are now
capable of </p>

<p> producing enough illicit drugs to satisfy U.S. consumers'
demand. </p>

<p> In 1991 the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) supported a
project to help </p>

<p> the States develop a legislative response to the problem of
distribution of </p>

<p> chemicals and their manufacture into illegal drugs. To
prepare the Model </p>

<p> State Chemical Control Act of 1992 (the Model), the American
Prosecutors </p>

<p> Research Institute (APRI), the research arm of the National
District </p>

<p> Attorneys Association, brought together investigators and
prosecutors from </p>

<p> Arizona, California, Oklahoma, Texas, and Washington State.
In addition, APRI </p>

<p> solicited comments from the Department of Justice and the
Drug Enforcement </p>

<p> Administration (DEA) on the lessons they had learned at the
Federal level and </p>

<p> sought to understand the concerns of the chemical and
pharmaceutical </p>

<p> industries. </p>

<p> This Research in Brief describes how chemicals are used to
make illicit </p>

<p> drugs, discusses existing Federal and State legislation to
curtail the </p>

<p> diversion of chemicals for illicit drug production, and
reviews the Model </p>

<p> statute. </p>

<p> DOMESTIC ILLICIT DRUG PRODUCTION </p>

<p> --Essential and precursor chemicals: All major illicit drugs
except marijuana </p>

<p> are either extracted or synthesized in a process requiring
chemicals that are </p>

<p> categorized as either &quot;essential&quot; or
&quot;precursor.&quot; Essential chemicals are </p>

<p> used to extract drugs, such as cocaine, from plants. Although
these chemicals </p>

<p> do not become part of the drug's molecular structure, they
are crucial to the </p>

<p> manufacturing process. Precursor chemicals are used to
synthesize drugs (such </p>

<p> as PCP), which are not naturally derived. These chemicals do
become part of </p>

<p> the drug's molecular structure. </p>

<p> --Clandestine Labs: Highly sophisticated laboratory
operations are sometimes </p>

<p> necessary to manufacture drugs. For example, producing
marketable quantities </p>

<p> of cocaine requires large-scale operations to handle the
enormous amounts of </p>

<p> coca leaves and solvents required. On the other hand, illegal
drug production </p>

<p> is often a simple process, without need of complex
technology, sophisticated </p>

<p> education, or training. Many synthetic drugs such as
methamphetamine and PCP </p>

<p> can be produced in someone's home with readily available
laboratory </p>

<p> equipment. In fact, with equipment and precursor chemicals
worth $200, a </p>

<p> criminal can in 18 hours produce a batch of methamphetamine
with a street </p>

<p> value of $98,000.(ref. 1) </p>

<p> In the 1980's States faced an outbreak of clandestine
laboratories because </p>

<p> chemicals were readily available on the open market or were
easily diverted </p>

<p> from legitimate commerce. In 1986 the Oklahoma Bureau of
Narcotics (OBN) </p>

<p> seized 28 labs, an almost 100 percent increase over the 16
labs seized in </p>

<p> 1985. Another 100 percent increase in seizures occurred in
1988 when OBN </p>

<p> seized 62 laboratories, compared to the 30 labs seized the
previous year. </p>

<p> From 1985 to 1987, Texas narcotics officers seized more than
twice the number </p>

<p> of labs as OBN. </p>

<p> Clandestine laboratories range from small crude operations in
sheds, </p>

<p> bathtubs, mobile homes, boats, and motel rooms to highly
sophisticated </p>

<p> operations with professional quality laboratory glassware and
equipment. </p>

<p> More than 80 percent of the clandestine labs in the United
States produce </p>

<p> methamphetamines.(ref. 2) With a knowledge of chemistry
equivalent to that </p>

<p> learned in high school, illicit lab operators are believed to
produce 25 tons </p>

<p> of methamphetamines annually with a street value of $3
billion. Less than 1 </p>

<p> percent of that amount is spent on the chemicals needed for
production.(ref. </p>

<p> 3) </p>

<p> CHEMICAL DIVERSION AND TRAFFICKING ACT </p>

<p> In 1988 Congress enacted the Chemical Diversion and
Trafficking Act (CDTA), </p>

<p> Subtitle A of the Anti-Drug Abuse Amendments of 1988
(codified as amendments </p>

<p> to the Federal Controlled Substances Act). CDTA established
record-keeping </p>

<p> and reporting requirements and authorized enforcement
activities for domestic </p>

<p> and international transactions in designated precursor and
essential </p>

<p> chemicals. Originally CDTA regulated machines for making the
drugs into </p>

<p> tablets or capsules, 12 precursor chemicals, and 8 essential
chemicals. Now, </p>

<p> 27 precursor and 7 essential chemicals are on the CDTA list.
Chemicals may be </p>

<p> added or deleted under standard Federal rule making
procedures. </p>

<p> CDTA applies to any individual or legal entity that
manufactures, distributes </p>

<p> domestically, imports, or exports any of the listed
chemicals. The Act makes </p>

<p> the unauthorized trade in these listed chemicals equivalent
to trafficking in </p>

<p> illegal drugs. </p>

<p> Each chemical has been assigned a threshold amount, by volume
or weight, or a </p>

<p> threshold number of monthly transactions. Once the threshold
has been reached </p>

<p> or exceeded, regulated individuals and entities must comply
with Federal </p>

<p> record-keeping, reporting, and identification requirements.
However, </p>

<p> threshold quantities do not apply to machinery; distribution
of a single </p>

<p> tableting or encapsulating machine triggers CDTA provisions. </p>

<p> Among the provisions are requirements that purchasers supply
proof of </p>

<p> identity in all regulated transactions. The type of
identification required </p>

<p> depends on whether the customer is new, is an individual or
established </p>

<p> business, is paying in cash, or is exporting the chemical to
another country. </p>

<p> Records of regulated domestic transactions involving a
precursor chemical or </p>

<p> a tableting or encapsulating machine must be kept for 4
years. For an </p>

<p> essential chemical, the record must be kept 2 years. Records
must be readily </p>

<p> retrievable either at the business where the transaction
occurred or some </p>

<p> other central location. Each record must contain specific
information about </p>

<p> the transaction and is subject to inspection and photocopying
by the Drug </p>

<p> Enforcement Administration. </p>

<p> CDTA requires that regulated individuals and entities report
some </p>

<p> circumstances both orally and in writing to DEA. These
include uncommon </p>

<p> methods of payment, loss or disappearance of a chemical, and
suspicion that a </p>

<p> chemical has been diverted for illegal purposes. As with
records, reports </p>

<p> must contain the date of the transaction, quantity of the
chemical purchased, </p>

<p> name and address of each party, method of transfer, and other
descriptive </p>

<p> details. On the basis of the reports or a lapse in
record-keeping, DEA has </p>

<p> the authority to stop chemical shipments. Receipt of the
required advance </p>

<p> notice of shipments can trigger DEA suspension when an
illicit transfer is </p>

<p> suspected. </p>

<p> --The effect of Federal control: Shortly after implementation
of CDTA, DEA </p>

<p> noted a downward trend in domestic illegal lab activity as
measured by the </p>

<p> number of lab seizures. Of the 1,000 projected DEA lab
seizures for 1989, 807 </p>

<p> materialized. A sharper decline occurred the following year
when DEA seized </p>

<p> 521 laboratories. This decline was the first time seizures
had dropped </p>

<p> significantly since 1981. </p>

<p> CDTA has also been successful in controlling exports of
essential chemicals </p>

<p> to Latin America. But as the pathways to foreign buyers have
narrowed, some </p>

<p> U.S. exporters have turned their attention to the domestic
market. </p>

<p> Opportunities for diversion exist all along the domestic
commercial chain. </p>

<p> Although CDTA's strict requirements help safeguard the legal
transfer of </p>

<p> chemicals above the threshold levels, illicit operators are
restructuring </p>

<p> their businesses to avoid Federal regulations. They are
focusing their </p>

<p> efforts on States that do not have effective mechanisms for
controlling </p>

<p> chemicals. </p>

<p> --Closing the door: The Office of National Drug Control
Policy has estimated </p>

<p> that the world supply of cocaine in 1990 was 1,000 metric
tons, or about 2.2 </p>

<p> million pounds. To produce this amount of cocaine, millions
of pounds of </p>

<p> essential chemicals were required for processing. But many of
these chemicals </p>

<p> such as hydrochloric acid also have hundreds of legitimate
uses, and for this </p>

<p> reason, they are common substances in international trade. </p>

<p> Criminals obtain these substances from manufacturers through
theft, bribery </p>

<p> of employees, or even legal purchase, especially in areas
that lack chemical </p>

<p> control laws or do not enforce them. Poor plant security can
increase theft, </p>

<p> and some retail purchasers are actually &quot;front
companies&quot; set up by producers </p>

<p> to disguise the illicit drug trade. </p>

<p> In addition, the vast international network of freight
forwarders, brokers, </p>

<p> and agents provides access to chemicals through multiple
sales transactions, </p>

<p> similar to money-laundering operations. In ports and free
trade zones, </p>

<p> criminals can obtain the desired chemicals by repacking or
re-labeling </p>

<p> materials. </p>

<p> CDTA has greatly decreased U.S. exports of essential
chemicals to Latin </p>

<p> America. This Federal statute has added to costs borne by
criminals, and the </p>

<p> new regulation and record-keeping requirements of the Act
make it </p>

<p> increasingly likely that illicit operators are restructuring
their businesses </p>

<p> to avoid Federal regulations. They are focusing their efforts
on States that </p>

<p> do not have effective mechanisms for controlling chemicals. </p>

<p> THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE STATE CONTROLS </p>

<p> State regulatory and enforcement efforts are needed to
supplement Federal </p>

<p> controls over the movement of chemicals into illegal
channels. If State </p>

<p> officials can follow the trail of precursor and essential
chemicals from the </p>

<p> chemical manufacturer to the illicit drug producer, then
producers can be </p>

<p> identified and apprehended before they manufacture illegal
drugs. Controlling </p>

<p> these chemicals, therefore, is a potent strategy that can
help identify drug </p>

<p> criminals and interfere with their operations. </p>

<p> Effective regulation of chemical transactions could dry up
the sources that </p>

<p> supply illegal labs. However, clandestine drug production is
a nomadic </p>

<p> business. When chemicals become difficult to obtain in one
locale, illegal </p>

<p> lab operators simply move their operations to a location
where acquisition of </p>

<p> chemicals is less complicated. Differences in the extent of
control exercised </p>

<p> by the States currently make that a fairly easy process. More
consistent </p>

<p> State laws could curtail movement of illegal labs from State
to State. </p>

<p> EXISTING VARIATIONS IN STATE CONTROLS </p>

<p> To date 18 States have sought to control the existence of
clandestine labs by </p>

<p> enacting their own detailed chemical tracking requirements.
Some </p>

<p> jurisdictions have incorporated these requirements into their
controlled </p>

<p> substances acts already on the books, while others have
adopted new, distinct </p>

<p> statutes. </p>

<p> --Number of chemicals: Colorado controls the largest number
of chemicals (35) </p>

<p> while Montana regulates 9. The differences reflect each
State's experience or </p>

<p> policy regarding diversion, abuse, and the potential illicit
use of a </p>

<p> chemical. Nearly all of the States that have controls exclude
prescription or </p>

<p> over-the-counter drugs, or both, from chemical requirements,
with special </p>

<p> exemptions for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine,
norpseudoephedrine, and </p>

<p> phenylpropanolamine. </p>

<p> --Registration: All 18 States require a license or permit to
lawfully </p>

<p> manufacture or transfer a regulated chemical. Only a few
regulate the </p>

<p> purchase or possession of chemicals. Registration renewal
generally happens </p>

<p> annually and involves a reasonable fee; the definition of
reasonable varies </p>

<p> from a maximum of $25 in Arkansas to a minimum of $250 in New
Mexico. Grounds </p>

<p> for denial, suspension, or revocation include fraud; drug law
violations and </p>

<p> convictions; and denial, suspension, or revocation of Federal
registrations. </p>

<p> --Record-keeping: Differences also occur in the requirements
for </p>

<p> record-keeping. For example, several jurisdictions mandate
that chemical </p>

<p> transfer records be kept for 2 years after the transaction
date, but </p>

<p> Minnesota requires that records be kept for 5 years. Texas
requires that </p>

<p> records of sales of laboratory apparatus also be kept. Hawaii
and Missouri </p>

<p> maintain the confidentiality of information obtained through
records. </p>

<p> Pennsylvania penalizes wrongful use of the information. </p>

<p> --Reporting: Required reporting of intrastate transfers and
out-of-State </p>

<p> purchases also varies among States. In several States the
regulatory agency </p>

<p> must be given 21 days advance notice of any chemical
delivery. Some States </p>

<p> provide a monthly reporting alternative for individuals and
entities with a </p>

<p> history of lawful use, a regular relationship with a
recipient, or both. </p>

<p> While California and Montana require notice of receipt of
chemicals within 3 </p>

<p> days after delivery, Oregon allows 10 days. Ten States
require that special </p>

<p> reports be submitted within 3 days after discovery of a theft
or loss of </p>

<p> chemicals, and eight require reports within 3 days for a
discrepancy in </p>

<p> quantities shipped and received. Iowa and Washington extend
these deadlines </p>

<p> to 7 days. </p>

<p> --Exemptions: Medical professionals, agents, and licensed
entities such as </p>

<p> common carriers are traditionally exempt from licensing or
reporting </p>

<p> obligations. Some States expand the exemptions to include
college chemistry </p>

<p> students, government employees, or researchers. </p>

<p> --Purchaser identification: Most jurisdictions mandate that
individual </p>

<p> purchasers identify themselves with a photograph, proof of
street or </p>

<p> residential mailing address, and signature. Some
jurisdictions ask for the </p>

<p> purchaser's birth date, driver's license or other
State-issued identification </p>

<p> number, year in which the purchaser's vehicle was
manufactured, and vehicle </p>

<p> license tag number. Most business recipients must furnish an
authorization </p>

<p> letter listing an identification number, an address, a phone
number, and a </p>

<p> description of the chemical's intended use. </p>

<p> --Responsibility: Finally, there is no consensus among the
States on which </p>

<p> government agency should be given regulatory responsibility.
The 18 States </p>

<p> assign this duty to a wide variety of health, pharmaceutical,
commerce, and </p>

<p> enforcement agencies. </p>

<p> ILLEGITIMATE USES FOR LEGITIMATE PRODUCTS </p>

<p> Many people recognize ephedrine as an ingredient in sinus
medications. </p>

<p> However, consumers are often unaware that ephedrine is also
the primary </p>

<p> precursor used to illegally produce methamphetamine (meth).
In 1990, 53 </p>

<p> percent of the clandestine meth labs seized by the Drug
Enforcement </p>

<p> Administration used the ephedrine reduction method to produce
the drug.(ref. </p>

<p> 4) </p>

<p> State officials report that illicit meth laboratories in the
West and </p>

<p> Southwest began using ephedrine after phenylacetic acid came
under State </p>

<p> regulation. In northern California 85 percent of the seized
meth labs used </p>

<p> single-ingredient ephedrine tablets. In Oregon officials
discovered that </p>

<p> over-the-counter ephedrine tablets sold in the Portland area
had become a </p>

<p> source of ephedrine for northwest meth lab operators.(ref. 5)
</p>

<p> For this reason, ephedrine has been included in the list of
chemicals </p>

<p> targeted for regulation under the Model State Chemical
Control Act. </p>

<p> MODEL STATE CHEMICAL CONTROL ACT </p>

<p> In developing the Model State Chemical Control Act of 1992,
the drafters </p>

<p> sought to close loopholes in existing Federal and State
legislation and to </p>

<p> foster greater consistency among State regulations. Unlike
most criminal </p>

<p> laws, the Model is a preventive measure. Its goal is to stop
drug offenses </p>

<p> before they occur by preventing precursor and essential
chemicals from being </p>

<p> diverted to illegal channels. It seeks to protect the
interests of legitimate </p>

<p> commerce without limiting the ability of law enforcement to
stop illicit </p>

<p> chemical transactions. </p>

<p> Monitoring every transaction involving a regulated chemical.
The Model </p>

<p> creates a monitoring system that tracks 35 chemicals from
source to use. It </p>

<p> covers a comprehensive range of chemicals controlled by
States and the </p>

<p> Federal Government. </p>

<p> The Model's reporting and record-keeping requirements apply
to every </p>

<p> transaction involving a regulated chemical, not just those
exceeding a legal </p>

<p> threshold. Under Federal law, manufacturers and distributors
do not have to </p>

<p> report or keep records on individuals or businesses who buy
chemicals in </p>

<p> amounts below the legal threshold. Individuals can circumvent
the law by </p>

<p> making multiple purchases of small quantities, thereby
accumulating large </p>

<p> amounts of chemicals for clandestine production.
Unfortunately, Federal </p>

<p> officials have no way of obtaining information about such
transactions. The </p>

<p> Model permits State and local officials to address this type
of diversion </p>

<p> activity, which would otherwise escape detection until after
illegal use of </p>

<p> the chemicals. </p>

<p> The list of regulated chemicals can be modified by rule in
response to </p>

<p> changes in diversion or use. Under the Model, State officials
may regulate a </p>

<p> chemical on an emergency basis while awaiting completion of
normal </p>

<p> rule-making procedures. </p>

<p> Emergency regulation is sometimes necessary to prevent
imminent hazards to </p>

<p> public health and safety. Some chemicals are flammable or
toxic and their use </p>

<p> must be controlled as soon as possible to prevent explosions,
environmental </p>

<p> damage, or illness. </p>

<p> Registering manufacturers and distributors. Responsibility
for the control of </p>

<p> regulated chemicals rests primarily with manufacturers and
distributors. </p>

<p> Therefore, the Model requires that they annually furnish law
enforcement with </p>

<p> detailed information about the sources, location, and amount
of chemicals </p>

<p> available for sale. The purpose of annual registration is
threefold: </p>

<p> --To convey to manufacturers and distributors an
understanding of the </p>

<p> critical role they play in eliminating illegal chemical
transfers. </p>

<p> --To help government officials determine if the chemicals
found at </p>

<p> clandestine lab sites have been supplied by a legal or
&quot;underground&quot; source. </p>

<p> --To help government officials more accurately assess the
extent of illegal </p>

<p> diversion. </p>

<p> The drafters anticipate that the number of annual
registrations to be </p>

<p> processed will be manageable. For example, in California
officials currently </p>

<p> register only 40 to 45 companies per year. </p>

<p> Requiring permits to possess a regulated chemical. Permits
identify which </p>

<p> persons intend to use specific quantities of chemicals for a
specific </p>

<p> purpose. </p>

<p> With certain exceptions, every applicant for a permit must
provide detailed </p>

<p> personal information, including a criminal history and
notarized fingerprint </p>

<p> card. Based on this information, government officials
ascertain the fitness </p>

<p> of a potential chemical recipient and ensure that the
intended use is lawful. </p>

<p> The permit provision is modeled after Oklahoma's chemical
control statute, </p>

<p> which extends the law beyond the traditional
&quot;receiving&quot; category of </p>

<p> purchasers to individuals who want to &quot;possess&quot; a
regulated chemical. By </p>

<p> requiring that they obtain a permit each time they seek to
possess a </p>

<p> regulated chemical, the Model eliminates a significant
loophole in many </p>

<p> existing statutes. For example, some illegal
&quot;cookers&quot; manufacture controlled </p>

<p> substances using chemicals produced in their own clandestine
laboratories. </p>

<p> They are not subject to existing regulation and liability
provisions, which </p>

<p> apply solely to purchasers, because they do not buy the
chemical from an </p>

<p> outside source. Under the Model statute, &quot;cookers&quot;
would be subject to the </p>

<p> law because although they do not &quot;receive&quot; the
chemicals, they nonetheless </p>

<p> &quot;possess&quot; them. </p>

<p> The Model's permit process protects legitimate commerce in
two ways. First, </p>

<p> it exempts the owners and officers of publicly held
corporations (those with </p>

<p> 35 shareholders or more) from the disclosure requirements of
permit </p>

<p> applications. These corporations are often fairly sizable
businesses or are </p>

<p> headquartered out-of-State. Their shareholders and officers
lack the personal </p>

<p> access necessary to illegally use or transfer regulated
chemicals. The Model </p>

<p> assumes that there is no need for detailed background
information or </p>

<p> fingerprint cards for such persons. </p>

<p> Second, the Model includes a reporting alternative for
possessors who </p>

<p> demonstrate a history of regular, legitimate use. The risk of
these </p>

<p> possessors diverting chemicals for unlawful purposes is less
than with other </p>

<p> possessors. Therefore, they may submit retrospective monthly
reports of </p>

<p> actual chemical use in lieu of obtaining permits. The Model
prevents </p>

<p> unnecessary duplication by accepting copies of Federal
reports containing </p>

<p> information about threshold amounts of regulated chemicals. </p>

<p> --Exempting individuals from regulation: The Model exempts
common carriers </p>

<p> pharmacists, physicians, and other authorized practitioners
from the </p>

<p> statute's requirements. Manufacturers can obtain a special
exemption to </p>

<p> continue marketing bona fide drug products such as over-the
counter sinus and </p>

<p> asthma medications. A special exemption is granted upon a
finding by State </p>

<p> officials that a product is manufactured and distributed in a
manner that </p>

<p> prevents its diversion. In making the finding, State
officials consider the </p>

<p> product's packaging, advertising, and actual or potential for
diversion.(ref. </p>

<p> 6) </p>

<p> --Safeguarding possession of regulated chemicals: The Model
contains a number </p>

<p> of safeguards to prevent unauthorized or unscrupulous persons
from gaining </p>

<p> access to regulated chemicals. It specifies that the
following persons are </p>

<p> ineligible to apply for a registration or permit: </p>

<p> Convicted drug offenders. </p>

<p> Persons who have had a prior registration or permit </p>

<p> Minors </p>

<p> Because juveniles are subject to milder penalties than
adults, they </p>

<p> frequently have been recruited to become participants in
criminal activity. </p>

<p> Therefore, making minors ineligible should preclude drug
balers from using </p>

<p> juveniles to acquire chemicals for illegal purposes. </p>

<p> The Model also provides for denial, suspension, or revocation
of a </p>

<p> registration or permit. Violation of the statutory rules,
falsification of a </p>

<p> document, and similar acts are grounds for denial of
authorized access to </p>

<p> regulated chemicals. </p>

<p> Spotting discrepancies in the flow of chemicals. The Model
establishes four </p>

<p> information-gathering mechanisms to help State officials spot
possible </p>

<p> diversion activities. </p>

<p> First, the Model requires manufacturers, distributors, and
possessors to </p>

<p> report any suspicious transaction or circumstance. cash
payments, </p>

<p> discrepancies between quantities shipped and received, and
theft or loss of </p>

<p> chemicals are all examples of suspicious circumstances. </p>

<p> Second, the Model requires manufacturers, distributors,
brokers, and traders </p>

<p> to provide monthly reports detailing every transaction
involving a regulated </p>

<p> chemical. The reports allow officials to identify the true
purchaser of </p>

<p> chemicals and ascertain whether the actual chemical use is
consistent with </p>

<p> the stated intended use. </p>

<p> Third, the Model requires purchasers to submit information
about themselves, </p>

<p> their permit or other authorization, and their vehicles prior
to receiving or </p>

<p> distributing a regulated chemical. This provision, which
incorporates </p>

<p> California's purchaser identification requirements, also
facilitates </p>

<p> determination of the ultimate purchaser and the chemical's
use. </p>

<p> Fourth, manufacturers and distributors are required to take
inventory </p>

<p> annually and to keep all transaction records readily
accessible for 4 years. </p>

<p> --Providing for enforcement: The Model vests State officials
with the </p>

<p> authority to identify and respond to situations of
noncompliance. It </p>

<p> authorizes limited warrantless inspections during regular
business hours and </p>

<p> allows State officials to routinely inspect inventories,
storage facilities, </p>

<p> records, papers, files, and equipment.(ref. 9) It also grants
State officials </p>

<p> the power to subpoena witnesses and require document
production. The Model </p>

<p> provides for stiff fines and terms of imprisonment for
noncompliance. </p>

<p> To eliminate the economic incentive for this type of criminal
activity, the </p>

<p> Model applies a State's drug forfeiture procedures to money
and property used </p>

<p> in violation of the chemical diversion statute. </p>

<p> --Recovering expenses: As with any proactive regulatory
scheme, the Model </p>

<p> requires a continuing investment of time and money. To
prevent financial </p>

<p> strain on scarce State resources, a system of nonrefundable
application fees </p>

<p> is recommended to help offset the cost of administering the
program. </p>

<p> In addition, the Model imposes a special civil assessment on
violators of the </p>

<p> statute to be used for cleanup of illegal laboratory sites.
Seizure of </p>

<p> clandestine laboratories often reveals significant amounts of
hazardous or </p>

<p> toxic waste and other byproducts that have been found. Under
Federal law, law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies become liable for various cleanup and
transporting </p>

<p> operations, damage to natural resources, and subsequent
health risks that </p>

<p> remain after the lab is dismantled.(ref. 10) </p>

<p> Last year Oklahoma spent approximately $6,000 to clean up
illegal labs, and </p>

<p> for several years California has spent more than $1 million a
year for </p>

<p> similar tasks. However, these expenses were only for removing
bulk </p>

<p> contamination. In the future site restoration through
hazardous waste removal </p>

<p> may require even larger sums of money. The civil assessment
will prevent </p>

<p> violators from escaping financial liability for the
environmental damage they </p>

<p> cause and help States address the issue of long-term
hazardous waste or </p>

<p> residual contamination. </p>

<p> APPLYING THE MODEL </p>

<p> The chemical control legislation in California, Oklahoma,
Texas, and </p>

<p> Washington served as guides for creating the Model. Oklahoma
and Texas </p>

<p> officials have already noted the positive effect of their
legislation on the </p>

<p> struggle to eliminate illegal drug production. The Oklahoma
Bureau of </p>

<p> Narcotics and Texas Department of Public Safety indicate that
their States' </p>

<p> precursor laws significantly reduced the availability of
chemicals throughout </p>

<p> Oklahoma and Texas. The reduction in supply has led to a
decrease in </p>

<p> clandestine laboratory activity in both States. The Texas
Department of </p>

<p> Public Safety reports that the availability of illicit
amphetamine and </p>

<p> methamphetamine in Texas decreased about 50 percent during
the 3-year period </p>

<p> since passage of its statute.&quot; </p>

<p> Despite the success of these States' efforts, the lack of
adequate chemical </p>

<p> controls in many states provides illegal drug manufacturers
with </p>

<p> opportunities to expand their production of controlled
substances. The toll </p>

<p> in health, welfare, enforcement, and safety costs as well as
human suffering </p>

<p> is incalculable. The Model is designed to help State
policymakers and </p>

<p> criminal justice professionals develop legislation that will
severely curtail </p>

<p> domestic illegal drug production while protecting legitimate
commercial </p>

<p> interests. </p>

<p> COPING WITH CHEMICAL HAZARDS </p>

<p> Seizures of clandestine labs pose special problems for law
enforcement </p>

<p> officers because many of the chemicals used in drug
manufacturing are </p>

<p> dangerous. For example, acids and solvents are corrosive and
flammable, and </p>

<p> some are highly explosive. About one-fifth of clandestine lab
seizures result </p>

<p> from reports of fires caused by chemical processes.(ref. 7) </p>

<p> In addition, many precursor and essential chemicals are
corrosive and can </p>

<p> cause lung and eye damage, even upon exposure to vapors
emanating from the </p>

<p> lab. Furthermore, according to a study in California,
one-tenth of seized </p>

<p> labs were booby-trapped with explosives or with disfiguring
and poisonous </p>

<p> chemical devices.(ref. 8) </p>

<p> For these reasons, law enforcement experts recommend that
police officers in </p>

<p> all areas of the criminal justice system be given special
training in </p>

<p> handling these substances. They note that rural police
agencies are just as </p>

<p> likely to encounter clandestine labs as urban police. Highway
patrols and </p>

<p> other agencies in jurisdictions with large railroad and other
transportation </p>

<p> hubs are likely to find such substances en route to a
clandestine location. </p>

<p> This briefing report provides information on drug courts,\1 a
new </p>

<p> approach used by state and local governments to address
drug-related </p>

<p> crime. These courts monitor the treatment and behavior of
drug-using </p>

<p> defendants. </p>

<p> Title V of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act
of 1994 </p>

<p> (the 1994 Crime Act) authorizes the award of federal grants
for drug </p>

<p> courts. The act requires that we assess the effectiveness and
impact </p>

<p> of these grants and report to Congress by January 1, 1997. To
assist </p>

<p> Congress in its deliberations on whether to fund drug courts,
we </p>

<p> developed this preliminary report. Specifically, we gathered </p>

<p> information on drug courts in existence prior to the awarding
of </p>

<p> grants under the 1994 Crime Act, assessed evaluations of
these </p>

<p> courts, and reviewed the Department of Justice's (DOJ) </p>

<p> responsibilities and plans for implementing the federal drug
court </p>

<p> grant program. </p>

<p> During April and on May 11, 1995, we briefed the Committees
on the </p>

<p> results of our work. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \1 Throughout this briefing report, we use the terms drug
courts and </p>

<p> drug court programs interchangeably. </p>

<p> RESULTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :1 </p>

<p> In response to the deluge of drug cases since the late 1980s
and the </p>

<p> cycle of recidivism (rearrest rates) common to drug
offenders, some </p>

<p> state and local jurisdictions created drug courts, the
majority of </p>

<p> which have been operating since 1993. The main purpose of
drug </p>

<p> courts is to use the authority of the court to reduce crime
by </p>

<p> changing defendants' drug-using behavior. In exchange for the
</p>

<p> possibility of dismissed charges or reduced sentences,
defendants are </p>

<p> diverted to drug courts. Judges preside over drug court
proceedings, </p>

<p> monitor the progress of defendants through frequent status
hearings, </p>

<p> and prescribe sanctions and rewards as appropriate in
collaboration </p>

<p> with prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment providers, and
others. </p>

<p> Although there are basic elements common to many drug court
programs, </p>

<p> they vary in terms of participant eligibility, length of the
program, </p>

<p> penalties and rewards, and other practices. The courts are
supported </p>

<p> by a variety of local, state, federal, and private funds and </p>

<p> participant fees, according to the Drug Court Resource
Center.\2 </p>

<p> As of March 1995, there were at least 37 drug courts
operating </p>

<p> nationwide, most of which had been fully operational for at
least 9 </p>

<p> months. Thirty-three drug courts responding to our
questionnaire </p>

<p> reported having accepted over 20,000 defendants, of whom a
third had </p>

<p> completed their programs. According to the Project Director
of the </p>

<p> Drug Court Resource Center, none of the drug courts accept
defendants </p>

<p> currently charged with a violent offense, and most do not
accept </p>

<p> defendants with prior violent convictions. However, at least
one </p>

<p> drug court accepts defendants regardless of prior offenses.
(See </p>

<p> sect. I for more general information on drug courts.) </p>

<p> We assessed six evaluations of five drug courts completed as
of March </p>

<p> 1995. Although some evaluation results indicated that drug
courts </p>

<p> may have some beneficial effects, limitations in their
designs and </p>

<p> methodologies, as well as the relative newness of drug
courts, </p>

<p> precluded firm conclusions about the overall impact of these </p>

<p> programs. The evaluations showed mixed results in recidivism
and </p>

<p> other defendant outcomes. For example, two evaluations showed
less </p>

<p> recidivism by drug court defendants. However, three other </p>

<p> evaluations showed no significant differences in recidivism. </p>

<p> Additionally, two evaluations of the same drug court showed </p>

<p> contrasting recidivism results. (See sect. II and app. III
for </p>

<p> more information on the evaluations we assessed.) </p>

<p> The 1994 Crime Act authorized the Attorney General to award
and </p>

<p> administer discretionary grants for drug court programs. A
key </p>

<p> requirement of the act is that violent offenders are
prohibited as </p>

<p> drug court participants. The act authorized $1 billion from
fiscal </p>

<p> years 1995 through 2000 to support drug court programs. For
fiscal </p>

<p> year 1995, $29 million was appropriated. However, Congress
has </p>

<p> proposed fiscal year 1995 budget cuts in a pending rescission
bill. </p>

<p> In addition, the House has passed legislation repealing the
drug </p>

<p> court grant program authorized in the 1994 Crime Act. </p>

<p> DOJ expects to award grants beginning in the summer of 1995.
The </p>

<p> 1994 Crime Act also authorizes the Attorney General to
provide for a </p>

<p> national evaluation of drug courts supported by federal
grants. DOJ </p>

<p> expects to complete the evaluation to assess the impact and </p>

<p> effectiveness of drug court grants in about 2 years. (See
sect. III </p>

<p> for more information.) </p>

<p> \2 The Bureau of Justice Assistance funds the Drug Court
Resource </p>

<p> Center. The Resource Center began operating October 1, 1994,
under </p>

<p> the direction of The American University in partnership with
the </p>

<p> National Center for State Courts and the National Consortium
of </p>

<p> Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime Programs. The Resource
Center </p>

<p> assists state and local justice system officials in planning,
</p>

<p> implementing, managing, and evaluating drug courts. It also
acts as </p>

<p> a clearinghouse and provides technical assistance and other
services </p>

<p> to jurisdictions interested in developing or expanding drug
courts. </p>

<p> OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND </p>

<p> METHODOLOGY </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :2 </p>

<p> In preparation for our 1997 mandated study, we initiated a </p>

<p> preliminary review of drug court programs. Our objectives
were to </p>

<p> determine </p>

<p> the number, location, and key elements of drug courts; </p>

<p> the results and validity of evaluations of drug courts; and </p>

<p> DOJ's responsibilities and plans for implementing statutory </p>

<p> requirements for the federal drug court grant program. </p>

<p> The Drug Court Resource Center, which is based at The
American </p>

<p> University, Washington, D.C., provided us with general
information on </p>

<p> drug courts. To obtain more current information, we sent a </p>

<p> questionnaire to 37 drug courts. We received responses from
33 drug </p>

<p> courts as of March 31, 1995. We did not verify the accuracy
of the </p>

<p> data provided to us by the Drug Court Resource Center and
drug </p>

<p> courts. In addition, we attended a January 1995 national
training </p>

<p> conference for drug court professionals in Las Vegas, NV, and
visited </p>

<p> drug courts in Las Vegas and Washington, D.C. </p>

<p> To determine the results and assess the validity of
evaluations of </p>

<p> drug courts, we obtained 11 drug court evaluations completed
as of </p>

<p> March 1, 1995, from the Drug Court Resource Center. These </p>

<p> evaluations were done by a variety of sources, including
independent </p>

<p> researchers, county officials, and court representatives. We </p>

<p> reviewed them and assessed the evaluative methodology used
and the </p>

<p> validity of reported findings. We did not analyze the
reported </p>

<p> results of three of them because they reported outcome data
for drug </p>

<p> court defendants without any reference to comparison or
control </p>

<p> groups. We were unable to assess the validity of one because
it did </p>

<p> not include a description of the methodology used. Two dealt
with </p>

<p> one drug court and were assessed as one evaluation because
one was a </p>

<p> follow-up to the other and contained the same methodology and
</p>

<p> findings. </p>

<p> To determine DOJ's responsibilities and plans for
implementing the </p>

<p> federal grant program, we met with representatives of the
Office of </p>

<p> Justice Programs, DOJ. We held discussions and reviewed
documents </p>

<p> regarding their responsibilities and plans for implementing
the </p>

<p> federally supported drug court program. We also obtained drug
court </p>

<p> funding information from the Department of Health and Human
Services' </p>

<p> Center for Substance Abuse Treatment. </p>

<p> Our review was done from January 1995 to April 1995 in
accordance </p>

<p> with generally accepted government auditing standards. </p>

<p> AGENCY COMMENTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :3 </p>

<p> In April 1995, we provided a draft of this report for comment
to the </p>

<p> Attorney General and the Project Director of the Drug Court
Resource </p>

<p> Center. </p>

<p> On April 21, 1995, we discussed the report with the Project
Director </p>

<p> of the Drug Court Resource Center. On May 5, 1995, we also
discussed </p>

<p> the report with the Deputy Assistant Attorney General and
other </p>

<p> officials from DOJ's Office of Justice Programs. These
officials </p>

<p> generally agreed with the information presented in the report
and </p>

<p> provided comments that we incorporated as appropriate. </p>

<p> DOJ officials said the report was positive, informative, and
will be </p>

<p> helpful to drug court professionals. They explained that
there is no </p>

<p> universal model for drug courts, and as a result, each drug
court </p>

<p> operates differently due to local needs and conditions.
Similarly, </p>

<p> the Project Director of the Drug Court Resource Center said
that the </p>

<p> information presented in the report was comprehensive,
accurate, and </p>

<p> objective. </p>

Letter </p>

<p> TYPES OF DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :4 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> In the late 1980s, state and local criminal courts were
inundated </p>

<p> with drug cases. One response to this challenge was the
creation of </p>

<p> drug courts, a relatively recent grassroots movement to deal
with </p>

<p> drug-related crime and drug-using defendants. </p>

<p> According to DOJ, two main types of drug courts have evolved,
those </p>

<p> that (1) expedite the processing of drug cases and (2) use </p>

<p> court-monitored drug treatment to attempt to achieve changes
in </p>

<p> defendants' drug-using behavior. In addition, some drug
courts </p>

<p> combine these two types. </p>

<p> The 1994 Crime Act authorizes grants for those drug courts
that have </p>

<p> programs offering court supervised drug treatment. The act
does not </p>

<p> authorize grants for courts designed solely to expedite the </p>

<p> processing of drug cases. This briefing report provides
information </p>

<p> on drug treatment courts. </p>

<p> Courts offering court-monitored drug treatment are referred
to as </p>

<p> &quot;drug treatment courts&quot; or simply &quot;drug
courts.&quot; Although there is no </p>

<p> standard definition applicable to drug treatment courts, the
National </p>

<p> Association of Drug Court Professionals\3 defines them as
follows: </p>

<p> &quot;A Drug Court is a special court given the
responsibility to </p>

<p> handle cases involving less serious drug using-offenders
through </p>

<p> a supervision and treatment program. These programs include </p>

<p> frequent drug testing, judicial and probation supervision,
drug </p>

<p> counseling, treatment, educational opportunities, and the use
of </p>

<p> sanctions and incentives.&quot; </p>

<p> One of the first drug courts to employ drug treatment as an
integral </p>

<p> part of the processing of drug felonies is located in Dade
County </p>

<p> (Miami), FL, and began operations in June 1989. This court
became a </p>

<p> model for other jurisdictions that implemented drug courts. </p>

<p> Although drug courts share certain common elements such as </p>

<p> court-monitored treatment, the courts are uniquely designed
to meet </p>

<p> local needs and can vary considerably in the way they
operate. </p>

<p> Organizationally, drug courts generally are distinct parts of
trial </p>

<p> courts. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \3 This is the principal organization of professionals
involved in </p>

<p> the development of treatment-oriented drug courts. Its
members </p>

<p> include judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment
service </p>

<p> providers, educators, researchers, and community leaders. </p>

<p> DRUG COURT APPROACHES </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> DRUG COURT APPROACHES </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :5.1 </p>

<p> According to a report provided by the Drug Court Resource
Center, </p>

<p> drug courts have generally taken two approaches to processing
cases: </p>

<p> (1) deferred prosecution and (2) postadjudication. In the
deferred </p>

<p> prosecution approach, shortly after being charged, defendants
waive </p>

<p> their right to a speedy trial and enter a treatment program. </p>

<p> Defendants who fail to complete the treatment program have
their </p>

<p> charges adjudicated. Defendants who complete the treatment
program </p>

<p> are not prosecuted further or have their charges dismissed.
This </p>

<p> approach is intended to capitalize on the trauma of arrest
and offers </p>

<p> defendants the opportunity to obtain treatment and avoid the </p>

<p> possibility of a felony conviction. </p>

<p> In the postadjudication approach, defendants are tried and
convicted, </p>

<p> but their sentences are deferred or pronounced and
incarceration is </p>

<p> suspended until they complete or withdraw from the treatment
program. </p>

<p> This approach provides an incentive for the defendant to
rehabilitate </p>

<p> because progress toward rehabilitation is factored into the </p>

<p> sentencing determination. </p>

<p> Appendix I presents examples of how cases are processed under
the two </p>

<p> drug court approaches. </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY </p>

<p> CRITERIA </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :6.1 </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center, drug courts
generally </p>

<p> accept defendants with substance abuse problems who are
currently </p>

<p> charged with drug possession and/or other nonviolent offenses
such as </p>

<p> property crimes. Some drug courts accept defendants who have
prior </p>

<p> convictions, and others do not. </p>

<p> The Project Director of the Drug Court Resource Center also
pointed </p>

<p> out that drug courts do not accept defendants currently
charged with </p>

<p> a violent offense. The Project Director further commented
that most </p>

<p> drug courts do not accept defendants with prior violent
offenses. </p>

<p> However, at least one drug court accepts defendants
regardless of </p>

<p> prior offenses possibly including defendants with prior
convictions </p>

<p> for violent crimes. Under the 1994 Crime Act, federal grants
cannot </p>

<p> be awarded to any drug court that allows either current or
past </p>

<p> violent offenders to participate in its program. </p>

<p> DRUG COURT PLAYERS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :7 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> DRUG COURT PLAYERS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :7.1 </p>

<p> According to a DOJ-funded report on the first national drug
court </p>

<p> conference,\4 judicial leadership is the foundation on which
the </p>

<p> overall drug court approach is most often built. A
jurisdiction's </p>

<p> trial court provides the leadership, authority, and
management </p>

<p> capacity to enable the drug court to operate. The drug court
is </p>

<p> headed by a judge whose role is generally expanded beyond
normal </p>

<p> court duties to include active involvement in monitoring the
status </p>

<p> of defendants in the treatment program. The judge's duties
may </p>

<p> include conducting hearings, reviewing treatment progress
reports, </p>

<p> issuing bench warrants, and deciding who may enter the
program and </p>

<p> who should be terminated considering recommendations of
prosecutors, </p>

<p> public defenders, and treatment providers. </p>

<p> The judiciary alone, however, cannot successfully implement
and </p>

<p> operate a drug court, according to the conference report.
Rather, a </p>

<p> drug court requires a special collaborative effort among
judges, </p>

<p> prosecutors, defense attorneys, and related criminal justice
agencies </p>

<p> along with treatment providers and other social services and </p>

<p> community organizations. This collaborative effort is based
on local </p>

<p> needs and the targeted population being served and may differ
</p>

<p> considerably among drug courts. </p>

<p> Specifically, drug courts create new and different roles for </p>

<p> prosecutors and defense attorneys. In most drug courts these
players </p>

<p> are not adversaries in the traditional sense but rather are
to work </p>

<p> in concert with the court for the sole purpose of helping
defendants </p>

<p> become drug free. This nonadversarial role is significant
because </p>

<p> the court does not arbitrate in the usual fashion and has the
</p>

<p> opportunity to address addiction-related issues. Further,
drug </p>

<p> courts place the defendant in the unique role of being held
publicly </p>

<p> accountable for his or her actions. </p>

<p> COMMON ELEMENTS OF DRUG COURT </p>

<p> PROGRAMS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :8 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> COMMON ELEMENTS OF DRUG </p>

<p> COURT PROGRAMS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :8.1 </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center, in most drug
courts, </p>

<p> treatment is designed to usually last at least 1 year and is </p>

<p> administered on an outpatient basis with limited inpatient
treatment </p>

<p> as needed to address special detoxification or relapse
situations.\5 </p>

<p> These courts operate with the philosophy that because drug
addiction </p>

<p> is a disease relapses can occur, and that the court must
respond with </p>

<p> progressive sanctions and/or enhance treatment rather than </p>

<p> immediately terminate a participant. </p>

<p> The central element of all drug court programs is attendance
at the </p>

<p> regularly scheduled status hearings at which the drug court
judge </p>

<p> monitors the progress of participants. Monitoring is based on
</p>

<p> treatment provider reports on urine test results that detect
drug </p>

<p> use, attendance at counseling, etc. The judge reinforces
progress </p>

<p> and addresses noncompliance with program requirements. The
primary </p>

<p> objective of the status hearing is to keep the defendant in </p>

<p> treatment. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \5 These programs recognize that some individuals will
require a </p>

<p> longer period to complete the program. </p>

<p> PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :9 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :9.1 </p>

<p> Overall, according to the Drug Court Resource Center,
treatment </p>

<p> program requirements are more demanding than the applicable
sanction </p>

<p> received through traditional adjudication. Most drug court
programs </p>

<p> require that defendants attend status hearings, participate
in </p>

<p> counseling sessions, and submit to urine tests with the goal
of </p>

<p> becoming drug free. Some programs focus on special classes of
</p>

<p> defendants such as women. Many programs also provide support </p>

<p> services such as public health services; assistance with
housing, </p>

<p> food, and child care; vocational training; and job placement.
</p>

<p> TREATMENT PHASES </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :10 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> TREATMENT PHASES </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :10.1 </p>

<p> Treatment services are generally divided into three phases:
(1) </p>

<p> detoxification, (2) stabilization, and (3) aftercare. First,
the </p>

<p> defendant's physical dependence on drugs is eliminated
through </p>

<p> detoxification. Acupuncture is sometimes used as an adjunct
to </p>

<p> treatment in the detoxification phase. According to the
Project </p>

<p> Director of the Drug Court Resource Center, 9 of 20 drug
courts </p>

<p> responding to the Center's 1994 survey indicated that they
used </p>

<p> acupuncture. Second, the defendant's psychological craving
for the </p>

<p> drugs is treated during stabilization. Frequent group and/or </p>

<p> individual counseling sessions are employed during this
phase. And </p>

<p> third, aftercare focuses on helping the defendant obtain
education or </p>

<p> job training, find a job, and remain drug free. </p>

<p> PROGRAM SANCTIONS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :11 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PROGRAM SANCTIONS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :11.1 </p>

<p> Sanctions for failing to abide by program rules can include
(1) </p>

<p> verbal admonition from the judge; (2) demotion to an earlier
stage of </p>

<p> the program; (3) incarceration for several days or weeks,
increasing </p>

<p> with the number and severity of the violations; and (4) more
frequent </p>

<p> status hearings, treatment sessions, or urine tests. Many
programs </p>

<p> also use graduated sanctions, increasing the severity of the
sanction </p>

<p> with subsequent violations of program rules. </p>

<p> DOJ also pointed out that most drug courts use sanctions not
to </p>

<p> simply punish inappropriate behavior but to augment the
treatment </p>

<p> process. For example, many drug courts will place a defendant
in </p>

<p> residential treatment if he or she is unable to achieve
satisfactory </p>

<p> progress in an outpatient setting. In addition, many drug
courts </p>

<p> incarcerate defendants for the purpose of detoxification
rather than </p>

<p> detain them for inappropriate behavior. </p>

<p> REASONS FOR TERMINATING </p>

<p> DEFENDANTS FROM THE PROGRAM </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :12 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> REASONS FOR TERMINATING </p>

<p> DEFENDANTS FROM THE PROGRAM </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :12.1 </p>

<p> Drug courts use various criteria for ending a defendant's </p>

<p> participation in the program before completion. These may
include a </p>

<p> new felony offense; multiple failures to comply with program </p>

<p> requirements, such as not attending status hearings or
treatment </p>

<p> sessions; and a pattern of positive urine tests. According to
DOJ, </p>

<p> many drug courts do not terminate defendants for a new drug </p>

<p> possession offense. </p>

<p> Before terminating a defendant for continuing to use drugs,
drug </p>

<p> courts will use an array of treatment services and available </p>

<p> sanctions. There are no uniform standards for the number of
failed </p>

<p> urine tests and failures to attend treatment sessions that
result in </p>

<p> a participant being terminated that apply to all programs.
Each drug </p>

<p> court sets its own standards. Relapses are expected and the
extent </p>

<p> to which noncompliance results in terminations varies from
program to </p>

<p> program. </p>

<p> Generally, the drug court judge makes the decision to
terminate, but </p>

<p> the prosecutor or treatment provider can recommend the
termination. </p>

<p> Once a defendant is terminated, he or she will be referred
for </p>

<p> adjudication or sentencing. </p>

<p> PROGRAM GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :13 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PROGRAM GRADUATION </p>

<p> REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :13.1 </p>

<p> Drug courts typically require defendants to complete a
treatment </p>

<p> program in order to graduate. Some impose other conditions </p>

<p> defendants must meet after treatment. These could include
remaining </p>

<p> drug free and not being arrested for a specified period of
time, </p>

<p> paying restitution, being employed full-time, or performing
community </p>

<p> service. </p>

<p> For example, the Seattle, WA, drug court requires that a
defendant </p>

<p> complete all phases of the program to graduate. However, the </p>

<p> Beaumont, TX, drug court requires that, in addition to
completing the </p>

<p> treatment program, the defendant maintain sobriety for a
specified </p>

<p> time and participate in education and vocational training
and/or be </p>

<p> working full-time. </p>

<p> EFFECTS OF PROGRAM GRADUATION </p>

<p> ON CASE OUTCOME </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :14 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> EFFECTS OF PROGRAM </p>

<p> GRADUATION ON CASE OUTCOME </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :14.1 </p>

<p> In many jurisdictions, completion of the drug court program
leads to </p>

<p> a dismissal of charges or cessation of prosecution. In
others, the </p>

<p> guilty plea can be stricken, the defendant can be sentenced
to </p>

<p> probation in lieu of incarceration, or the defendant's
probation can </p>

<p> be shortened. </p>

<p> DOJ pointed out that some drug courts will seal all case
records, </p>

<p> including arrests, when defendants complete the program. The
sealing </p>

<p> of records is particularly significant when attempting to
measure the </p>

<p> impact of drug court programs at a later date. </p>

<p> STARTED, 1989-1994 </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :15.1 </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center, as of March
1995, there </p>

<p> were at least 37 drug courts operating across the country.\6
Of these </p>

<p> drug courts, 29 had been fully operational for at least 9
months, and </p>

<p> 8 others had been operating for a lesser period. </p>

<p> The number of drug courts steadily increased from 1991 to
1994, with </p>

<p> substantial increases since 1993. As of March 1995, 24
jurisdictions </p>

<p> were developing drug courts. Another eight jurisdictions had </p>

<p> exhibited interest in starting drug courts by initiating
feasibility </p>

<p> studies. </p>

<p> Appendix II lists the number of drug courts in operation and
being </p>

<p> developed. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \6 Because of the absence of any official requirement to
report their </p>

<p> existence to a central organization, additional drug courts
may </p>

<p> exist. </p>

<p> DRUG COURT PARTICIPANTS' </p>

<p> STATUS AS OF MARCH 1995 </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :17.1 </p>

<p> Data obtained from 33 of 37 drug courts responding to our </p>

<p> questionnaire showed that since inception of the first drug
court in </p>

<p> 1989, 20,421 persons have participated in drug courts. Of
these, </p>

<p> 7,235 participants have graduated, and 7,595 are currently in
the </p>

<p> programs. The remaining participants did not complete the
programs. </p>

<p> Generally, when participants do not complete drug court
programs it </p>

<p> is because they were terminated, voluntarily withdrew, or
died. </p>

<p> Based on the data received, these totaled 5,591.\7 </p>

<p> The number of participants currently in each of these drug
court </p>

<p> programs varied widely, ranging from a low of 1 participant
in Santa </p>

<p> Ana, CA, a new drug court,\8 to a high of 1,200 participants
in </p>

<p> Miami, FL, one of the oldest drug courts. The median number
of </p>

<p> participants in these drug court programs is 105. </p>

<p> It should be noted that many of the drug courts have been
operating </p>

<p> for less than a year and would not yet have graduates. As
shown, </p>

<p> more than one-third of the total participants are currently
enrolled </p>

<p> in drug court programs. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \7 We calculated the number (5,591) of participants not
completing </p>

<p> the programs by subtracting the number (7,235) of graduates
and the </p>

<p> number (7,595) of participants currently in the programs from
the </p>

<p> total number (20,421) of participants in the programs since
their </p>

<p> inception. </p>

<p> \8 At the time of our review, Orange County, CA, had filed
for </p>

<p> bankruptcy and curtailed resources for its drug court. </p>

<p> FUNDING SOURCES </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :18 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center Project Director,
drug </p>

<p> courts generally piece together funding from a variety of
sources. </p>

<p> Information reported to the Drug Court Resource Center by 15
drug </p>

<p> courts showed that these sources included local taxes and
surcharges, </p>

<p> state alcohol and drug agency funds, private foundation
monies, </p>

<p> participant fees, and federal grants. </p>

<p> Some drug courts have developed innovative funding
approaches. For </p>

<p> example, a drug court judge from Orange County, CA, told us
that when </p>

<p> the county filed for bankruptcy, it cut back services
necessary for </p>

<p> the drug court operation. The judge said that he was forming
a </p>

<p> nonprofit corporation to try to provide funding for the drug
court </p>

<p> outside of the bankruptcy proceedings. </p>

<p> Until the 1994 Crime Act, there was no federal grant program </p>

<p> specifically designed for drug courts. However, some drug
courts </p>

<p> have received federal grants and technical assistance from
the </p>

<p> Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Substance
Abuse </p>

<p> Treatment (CSAT) and DOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance
(BJA). </p>

<p> According to CSAT, it has provided or plans to provide an
estimated </p>

<p> $15 million in assistance to some drug courts. Of the $15
million, </p>

<p> about $6 million is for a drug court demonstration project
for the </p>

<p> District of Columbia Superior Court. </p>

<p> BJA could not provide us with complete information on DOJ
grants used </p>

<p> in support of drug courts. According to a BJA official,
&quot;drug </p>

<p> courts&quot; was not a specific grant category that grantees
could </p>

<p> designate for funding. However, this official commented that
BJA is </p>

<p> aware that DOJ grant funds provided under other grant
categories such </p>

<p> as &quot;corrections options&quot; have been used in support
of drug courts, </p>

<p> and that three drug courts had received $2.5 million from the
</p>

<p> Corrections Options program.\9 </p>

<p> PARTICIPANT FEES </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :19.1 </p>

<p> We obtained data (based on our questionnaire and information
provided </p>

<p> by the Drug Court Resource Center) from 34 drug courts on
fees </p>

<p> charged to participants in drug court programs. Twenty-three
of the </p>

<p> 34 drug courts reported that they charged fees, and 11
reported that </p>

<p> they did not. Insufficient data on fee amounts actually
collected </p>

<p> precluded us from determining the extent to which drug courts
relied </p>

<p> on participant fees as a funding source. </p>

<p> Of the 23 drug courts charging participant fees, the amounts
charged </p>

<p> for the total cost of treatment ranged from $20 to $2,500.
One drug </p>

<p> court reported charging fees on a sliding scale from $60 to
$300 for </p>

<p> treatment based on a defendant's ability to pay, while
another </p>

<p> reported charging on a sliding scale from $500 to $2,500. At
least </p>

<p> nine courts responded that they charged fees ranging from
$200 to </p>

<p> $350. </p>

<p> Several drug courts reported applying participant fees to
counseling </p>

<p> and treatment costs, drug testing costs, and other program
expenses. </p>

<p> In addition, DOJ commented that many treatment providers
believe </p>

<p> participant fees are a useful therapeutic tool and should be
charged </p>

<p> regardless of the extent to which fees are needed to cover
program </p>

<p> costs. </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> COST SAVINGS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :20.1 </p>

<p> Drug courts have reported information to the Drug Court
Resource </p>

<p> Center on savings that they believe their programs have
achieved in </p>

<p> the costs of court and other criminal justice system
operations. </p>

<p> One of the larger categories of savings reported by drug
courts was </p>

<p> jail costs avoided, i.e., the estimated costs of
incarcerating a </p>

<p> typical drug court defendant that would be expected to incur
if </p>

<p> he/she were not participating in a drug court program. One
court </p>

<p> estimated savings of $5,400 per drug court participant, and
another </p>

<p> estimated savings of $2,566 to $5,185. </p>

<p> Another drug court claimed a savings of $2 million over a
3-year </p>

<p> period resulting from drug court participants spending fewer
days in </p>

<p> custody and the consequent ability of the county to rent
unused jail </p>

<p> cells to other law enforcement agencies. Still another drug
court </p>

<p> estimated it had saved about $875,500 in jail costs for its
program </p>

<p> but did not specify the time frame. </p>

<p> The National Association of Drug Court Professionals noted
that drug </p>

<p> court programs are much less costly than the incarceration of
</p>

<p> drug-using offenders. The Association reported that
incarceration of </p>

<p> drug-using offenders ranges from $20,000 to $50,000 annually,
and the </p>

<p> cost to build a prison cell is $80,000 to $90,000. It also
said that </p>

<p> drug courts cost less than $1,500 annually for each offender.
</p>

<p> Some drug courts identified savings such as reduced caseloads
of </p>

<p> other trial judges not in the drug court program. In
addition, some </p>

<p> drug courts claimed savings in court-appointed attorney fees,
reduced </p>

<p> probation office caseloads, and costs of prosecution,
arrests, and </p>

<p> police overtime. </p>

<p> We did not verify this information, and further analysis of
all drug </p>

<p> court costs is essential to fully understanding the benefits
of these </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> Briefing Section II EVALUATIONS OF </p>

<p> DRUG COURTS </p>

<p>
==============================================================
Letter </p>

<p> DO DRUG COURTS MAKE A </p>

<p> DIFFERENCE? </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :21 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> In evaluating the effectiveness of drug courts, the basic
question </p>

<p> is: Do drug courts make a difference? Specifically, do
defendants </p>

<p> who successfully complete drug court programs exhibit reduced
</p>

<p> recidivism, decreased drug use, and other socially beneficial
effects </p>

<p> as a result of participating in drug court programs when
compared to </p>

<p> their counterparts, i.e., control groups who were not exposed
to the </p>

<p> same drug court treatment? </p>

<p> Based on evaluations we reviewed, drug courts generally may
have some </p>

<p> beneficial effects. However, because of the nature of the
study </p>

<p> designs and the short periods of time elapsed between
treatment and </p>

<p> measurement of outcomes (drug courts are relatively new),
firm </p>

<p> conclusions cannot be drawn about the effects of drug courts.
</p>

<p> It is both difficult and costly to conduct program
evaluations that </p>

<p> can measure program effects. Although the strongest design
involves </p>

<p> assembling and randomly assigning defendants to control
groups </p>

<p> (comparing drug courts versus traditional courts, for
example), such </p>

<p> studies raise serious logistical and ethical issues.
Additionally, </p>

<p> according to the Project Director of the Drug Court Resource
Center, </p>

<p> control groups cannot be used properly unless a drug court is
</p>

<p> originally designed to define such groups. </p>

<p> An alternative approach is to design studies allowing the
researcher </p>

<p> to create comparable groups from existing programs, through
the use </p>

<p> of various analytical techniques. However, even such studies
are </p>

<p> often made more difficult by the fact that existing programs
change </p>

<p> over time, resulting in individuals at the end of the study
period </p>

<p> being exposed to different treatments than those at the
beginning. </p>

<p> Also, different locations of the same program may have very
different </p>

<p> implementation needs, making it more difficult to compare
such </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> GAO ASSESSED DRUG COURT </p>

<p> EVALUATIONS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :22 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> We assessed six evaluations that compared performance
outcomes for </p>

<p> drug court defendants to the experiences of other defendants,
i.e., </p>

<p> previous divertees or unsuccessful drug court defendants or </p>

<p> defendants who had never been in a drug court. In order to
determine </p>

<p> whether a drug court has an impact on its participants, an
evaluation </p>

<p> should compare outcomes of drug court defendants to those of
other </p>

<p> groups of similar defendants who are not in drug courts. </p>

<p> The six evaluations covered five drug courts and varied
considerably </p>

<p> in terms of the study designs, types of outcomes measured,
and scope </p>

<p> of analyses performed on the available information. Our
assessment </p>

<p> indicates that the evaluations differed particularly in terms
of the </p>

<p> validity of the designs, which determine the extent to which
the </p>

<p> reader is able to draw conclusions from any findings. Of the
six </p>

<p> studies: </p>

<p> two studies had fairly strong designs; of these, one provided
some </p>

<p> evidence of an effect of the drug court program, and the
other </p>

<p> study's results were too preliminary to draw any conclusions;
</p>

<p> two studies had designs with more serious problems; of these,
one </p>

<p> suggested possible effects of the program, and the other was </p>

<p> inconclusive; and </p>

<p> two studies had design weaknesses that prevented any
conclusions </p>

<p> about the effects of the program. </p>

<p> The major outcome measure used, in five of the six
evaluations, was </p>

<p> recidivism (rearrest rates). To a lesser degree,
recidivism-related </p>

<p> measures were also used, such as length of time before
rearrest and </p>

<p> days spent in custody for felony offenses. We focused on
these </p>

<p> measures in this report because they provided the strongest
evidence </p>

<p> for the long-term effect of the drug court programs, even
though </p>

<p> other measures were used in these studies. </p>

<p> EVALUATION OUTCOMES </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :23 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> Two of the six evaluations were well-designed. However, the
results </p>

<p> in terms of recidivism outcomes were mixed. One of the
evaluations </p>

<p> showed that drug court defendants had significantly lower
rearrest </p>

<p> rates than defendants not in drug court, and that they spent
fewer </p>

<p> days in custody for felony offenses (app. III, evaluation 1).
This </p>

<p> evaluation also showed that drug court defendants had a lower
rate of </p>

<p> failures-to-appear for required court hearings than did other
</p>

<p> defendants. However, the other evaluation, with preliminary </p>

<p> information only, showed no significant difference so far in
rearrest </p>

<p> rates between drug court defendants and defendants who were
not in </p>

<p> the drug court (app. III, evaluation 2). </p>

<p> Although these evaluations have strong study designs and one </p>

<p> indicates some beneficial effects on defendants resulting
from the </p>

<p> drug court programs, the evidence does not permit firm
conclusions </p>

<p> about the effects of the drug courts studied. Additionally,
for one </p>

<p> of the evaluations, insufficient time had elapsed to provide
firmer </p>

<p> evidence of program effect. </p>

<p> Of the next two evaluations, both of the same drug court, one
</p>

<p> provided some suggestive evidence of program effect. It
showed lower </p>

<p> recidivism by drug court defendants and longer time before
rearrest </p>

<p> (app. III, evaluation 3). The other generally showed no
difference </p>

<p> in recidivism rates (app. III, evaluation 4). Design problems
made </p>

<p> it difficult to attribute these findings to the programs.
There are </p>

<p> too many potential differences between the drug court
participants </p>

<p> and the groups to which they were compared to develop strong </p>

<p> conclusions. </p>

<p> The final two evaluations did not provide reliable evidence </p>

<p> concerning the effects of the programs. One showed no
substantial </p>

<p> difference in recidivism between drug court defendants and
defendants </p>

<p> who left the drug court (app. III, evaluation 5). The other </p>

<p> evaluation measured defendants' drug abstinence and
failure-to-appear </p>

<p> rates and showed positive results for drug court defendants
as </p>

<p> compared to defendants terminated from the drug court (app.
III, </p>

<p> evaluation 6). Because the study design did not control for a
number </p>

<p> of factors, such as motivation and susceptibility to
treatment, these </p>

<p> evaluations do not permit conclusions to be drawn about the
effects </p>

<p> of the programs. </p>

<p> Appendix III contains further information on each of these </p>

<p> evaluations. </p>

<p> THE 1994 CRIME ACT </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :24 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> THE 1994 CRIME ACT </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :24.1 </p>

<p> Beginning in fiscal year 1995, DOJ may provide jurisdictions
with </p>

<p> drug court grants. Title V of the Violent Crime Control and
Law </p>

<p> Enforcement Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-322) authorizes the
Attorney </p>

<p> General to award discretionary drug court grants to states,
units of </p>

<p> local government, Indian tribal governments, and state and
local </p>

<p> courts. Grants may be awarded to drug court programs when a
judge </p>

<p> continuously supervises the progress of nonviolent offenders
with </p>

<p> substance abuse problems. </p>

<p> The act requires the Attorney General to issue regulations to
ensure </p>

<p> that jurisdictions receiving drug court grants to support
their </p>

<p> programs do not allow violent offenders to participate. It
defines a </p>

<p> violent offender as a person who is charged with or convicted
of an </p>

<p> offense involving a firearm, dangerous weapon, death, serious
bodily </p>

<p> injury, or force; or who has one or more prior convictions
for a </p>

<p> violent felony crime. </p>

<p> Drug court programs must also integrate a number of judicial </p>

<p> sanctions and treatment services. Specifically, the act
requires </p>

<p> programs to include (1) mandatory periodic testing for the
use of </p>

<p> addictive substances; (2) substance abuse treatment; (3)
diversion, </p>

<p> probation, or other supervised releases with the possibility
of </p>

<p> prosecution, confinement, or incarceration when participants
do not </p>

<p> comply with program requirements or fail to show satisfactory
</p>

<p> progress; and (4) program and aftercare services, such as
relapse </p>

<p> prevention, health care, education, vocational training, job </p>

<p> placement, housing placement, and child care. </p>

<p> FEDERAL FUNDING FOR DRUG </p>

<p> COURTS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :25.1 </p>

<p> The 1994 Crime Act authorized a total of $1 billion for
fiscal years </p>

<p> 1995 through 2000 to support drug court programs. Although
the act </p>

<p> authorized $100 million for fiscal year 1995, DOJ's fiscal
year 1995 </p>

<p> Appropriations Act (Public Law 103-317) included only $29
million for </p>

<p> the drug court program. However, Congress has proposed fiscal
year </p>

<p> 1995 budget cuts for the drug court program. On March 16,
1995, the </p>

<p> House passed H.R. 1158, the Emergency Supplemental
Appropriations </p>

<p> Act of 1995, which rescinds $27.75 million for the drug court
</p>

<p> program. During its consideration of H.R. 1158, the Senate
reduced </p>

<p> the rescission to $17.1 million. On April 6, 1995, the Senate
passed </p>

<p> its version of the bill and requested a conference with the
House. </p>

<p> The House and Senate conferees began May 3, 1995, to try to
reconcile </p>

<p> the separate provisions of the bill. </p>

<p> The President's fiscal year 1996 budget requests $150 million
for </p>

<p> drug court grants. However, H.R. 667 (The Violent Crime </p>

<p> Incarceration Act of 1995) passed by the House of
Representatives on </p>

<p> February 10, 1995, would amend Title V of the 1994 Crime Act
and in </p>

<p> doing so would repeal the 1994 Crime Act's drug court
discretionary </p>

<p> grant provisions. On February 22, 1995, H.R. 667 was referred
to </p>

<p> the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. </p>

<p> DOJ'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR DRUG </p>

<p> COURTS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :26 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> DOJ recognizes that no single model exists for an effective
drug </p>

<p> court. Consequently, DOJ plans to maintain flexibility in
awarding </p>

<p> grants to programs that use a variety of approaches to
coordinate </p>

<p> drug treatment and persuade offenders to abstain from drugs
with the </p>

<p> goal of becoming drug free. In addition, given the great
diversity </p>

<p> in the structure and operation of state and local courts and
criminal </p>

<p> justice systems, DOJ plans to allow jurisdictions to tailor
local </p>

<p> initiatives to best suit their needs and local conditions. </p>

<p> DOJ's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) has overall
responsibility for </p>

<p> the new federal drug court program, including policy setting.
To </p>

<p> carry out this responsibility, OJP has hired an acting
director and </p>

<p> policy analyst to staff its Drug Court Program Office. In
addition, </p>

<p> BJA, an office of OJP, recently established a Drug Court
Program </p>

<p> Office to manage and monitor drug court program grants,
according to </p>

<p> an OJP official. BJA has hired four people to staff this
office. </p>

<p> Since November 1994, OJP and BJA staffs have worked together
to </p>

<p> develop program guidelines and application materials.\10 </p>

<p> Currently, these staffs are considering the most appropriate
and </p>

<p> effective ways of providing technical assistance to federally
</p>

<p> supported drug courts, operating drug courts, and related
federal </p>

<p> projects to be funded with other fiscal year 1995 resources.
The </p>

<p> level and source of funding to support this technical
assistance is </p>

<p> also under review. </p>

<p> OJP's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) is responsible for
funding </p>

<p> a national evaluation of drug court program impacts. This
evaluation </p>

<p> will assess whether federally supported drug court programs
have </p>

<p> helped their participants to break the cycle of substance
abuse and </p>

<p> crime. It will also assess the cost-effectiveness of these
programs. </p>

<p> NIJ is also responsible for ensuring that drug court programs
use </p>

<p> part of their grants to conduct process evaluations. These
are aimed </p>

<p> at determining, among other things, if the drug court is
achieving </p>

<p> its objectives, if it was implemented as originally intended,
and </p>

<p> whether major changes are appropriate. They will also examine
how </p>

<p> drug courts affect the rest of the court system and other
elements of </p>

<p> the criminal justice system. </p>

<p> FISCAL YEAR 1995 DRUG COURT </p>

<p> GRANT PROGRAM </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :27.1 </p>

<p> If Congress does not rescind the fiscal year 1995
appropriation, DOJ </p>

<p> plans to award grants for planning, implementing, and
improving or </p>

<p> enhancing drug court programs. Eligible applicants may apply
only </p>

<p> for one type of grant. Assuming no rescission is enacted, of
the $29 </p>

<p> million appropriated for fiscal year 1995, DOJ plans to award
up to </p>

<p> 100 planning grants for not more than $35,000 each to
jurisdictions </p>

<p> interested in establishing drug courts, </p>

<p> 10 implementation grants for not more than $1 million each to
</p>

<p> jurisdictions that have identified their target populations
and </p>

<p> case processing procedures, </p>

<p> 3 additional implementation grants for not more than $2
million to </p>

<p> larger jurisdictions with populations exceeding 1 million,
and </p>

<p> 20 improvement and enhancement grants for not more than $1
million </p>

<p> to jurisdictions that have already established drug courts. </p>

<p> Federal grants for each drug court program will be 75 percent
of </p>

<p> program costs. The grantees will be required to provide cash
to fund </p>

<p> the remaining 25 percent. </p>

<p> Applications are due by May 23, 1995. Then, OJP and BJA
staffs will </p>

<p> focus on screening and processing qualified applications for </p>

<p> potential grant awards, pending final congressional action on
the </p>

<p> fiscal year 1995 budget rescission. If the current deadline
for </p>

<p> filing drug court applications does not change, the first
grants are </p>

<p> expected to be awarded in the summer of 1995. </p>

<p> EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS FOR </p>

<p> FEDERALLY FUNDED DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :28 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> Evaluating effectiveness is a critical element of the federal
drug </p>

<p> court program. The 1994 Crime Act authorizes the Attorney
General to </p>

<p> carry out or make arrangements for evaluations of programs
that </p>

<p> receive discretionary program grants. The act also mandates
us to </p>

<p> study and assess the effectiveness and impact of these
discretionary </p>

<p> grants and report to the Congress by January 1, 1997. </p>

<p> OJP program guidelines require recipients of drug court
grants to </p>

<p> cooperate with a national evaluation team. The evaluation
will be </p>

<p> aimed at measuring program impact primarily through the use
of the </p>

<p> following criteria: </p>

<p> reduction in recidivism rates of program participants, </p>

<p> maintenance of acceptable treatment completion rates, </p>

<p> decreased participant drug use, and </p>

<p> maintenance of a cost-effective program. </p>

<p> NIJ is responsible for overseeing the national evaluation.
The </p>

<p> evaluation will focus on treatment and its impact and is
expected to </p>

<p> take at least 2 years to complete. At the time of our review,
NIJ </p>

<p> was developing the solicitation for proposals to conduct the </p>

<p> evaluation. </p>

<p> Program guidelines also require each drug court grant
recipient to </p>

<p> conduct process evaluations of their programs. For these </p>

<p> evaluations, grantees are expected to collect descriptive
information </p>

<p> on the role of drug court players, potential eligible
population, and </p>

<p> participant program characteristics. Grantees will also be
asked to </p>

<p> collect information on program procedures used to identify
and screen </p>

<p> eligible offenders, accept and assess offenders, respond to
relapses, </p>

<p> manage and monitor cases, and discharge and refer
participants. </p>

<p> OUTCOMES REPORTED IN AND GAO'S </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT OF EVALUATIONS OF FIVE </p>

<p> DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> =========================================================
Appendix III </p>

<p> EVALUATION 1: F.I.R.S.T. </p>

<p> OAKLAND </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:1 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.1 </p>

<p> Drug use defendants granted admission to a diversion program.
</p>

<p> Admission requirements changed during the course of the
study. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 110 defendants in a program with a similar
group of 110 </p>

<p> defendants in a different program a year earlier. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.3 </p>

<p> Drug court participants referred in January and February of
1991; </p>

<p> earlier group referred in January 1990 through March of 1990.
The </p>

<p> report contained a 3-year follow-up study. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Felony rearrests: Drug court defendants had a lower
average rate </p>

<p> of felony rearrests per defendants (0.75) than had previous
divertees </p>

<p> (1.33). </p>

<p> (2)Days in custody for felony offenses: Drug court
defendants, on </p>

<p> average, spent fewer days in custody per defendant (44) than
had </p>

<p> previous divertees (78). </p>

<p> (3)Bench warrants: Drug court defendants, on average, had
fewer </p>

<p> bench warrants issued for failures to appear at court
hearings (0.67) </p>

<p> than had previous divertees (1.1). </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.5 </p>

<p> There were some questions concerning the comparability of the
two </p>

<p> groups, as well as the eligibility requirements for the two
programs. </p>

<p> (The report stated that eligibility requirements were relaxed
for the </p>

<p> drug court program participants in order to obtain a broader
group </p>

<p> for comparative purposes.) In spite of these concerns, the
evaluation </p>

<p> suggested some fairly strong evidence of program success
after 3 </p>

<p> years. </p>

<p> EVALUATION 2: MARICOPA COUNTY </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:2 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.1 </p>

<p> Offenders sentenced to probation for first-time drug
possession </p>

<p> convictions. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.2 </p>

<p> Random assignment to four groups: </p>

<p> (1)No drug testing, frequent visits (n=approximately 154). </p>

<p> (2)Monthly random drug testing, occasional visits
(n=approximately </p>

<p> 154). </p>

<p> (3)Biweekly scheduled drug testing, limited visits
(n=approximately </p>

<p> 154). </p>

<p> (4)Drug court, with testing and treatment supervised by a
probation </p>

<p> officer (n=177). </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants in program between March 1992 and April 1993.
Current </p>

<p> data reported only preliminary findings after 6 months. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Rearrest rates: No statistically significant differences
(16.95 </p>

<p> percent for the drug court group vs. 15.37 percent for
others). </p>

<p> (2)Rates of technical probation violations: Drug court group
had </p>

<p> lower rates than those of others (7.9 percent vs. 11.9
percent). </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.5 </p>

<p> Although the evaluation design was quite strong, the results
were </p>

<p> preliminary; insufficient time had elapsed to provide a firm </p>

<p> indication of program effect. Future comparisons may be
complicated </p>

<p> by the fact that the drug court sample had lower rates of
reported </p>

<p> history of prior marijuana use. Otherwise, the control groups
</p>

<p> (groups 1-3) were quite similar to the drug court group
(group 4). </p>

<p> EVALUATION 3: DADE COUNTY </p>

<p> (GOLDKAMP AND WEILAND) </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:3 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.1 </p>

<p> Persons arrested for 2nd and 3rd degree drug-related
felonies. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.2 </p>

<p> Five key groups:\11 </p>

<p> (1)Persons admitted to drug court program (n=326). </p>

<p> (2)Sample of felony drug defendants in same period not
eligible </p>

<p> because of more serious drug-related offenses (n=199). </p>

<p> (3)Sample of nondrug felony defendants in same period
(n=185). </p>

<p> (4)Sample of felony drug defendants in period several years
earlier </p>

<p> (n=302). </p>

<p> (5)Sample of felony nondrug defendants in period several
years </p>

<p> earlier (n=536). </p>

<p> In addition, the evaluation compared persons completing the
drug </p>

<p> court program with those failing to complete. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \11 An additional sample of offenders could not reliably be
used as a </p>

<p> control group because they were exposed to the drug court
program. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants in groups 1-3 had charges filed in August 1990
and </p>

<p> September 1990. Charges for groups 4-5 were filed in the
summer of </p>

<p> 1987. Data report results after 18 month follow-up. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Rearrest rates: Drug court defendants were rearrested at a
</p>

<p> statistically significant lower rate (33 percent, vs. 40
percent to </p>

<p> 53 percent for other groups). </p>

<p> (2)Time before rearrest: Drug court defendants had
statistically </p>

<p> significant longer time before rearrest (median of 235 days,
vs. 52 </p>

<p> to 115 days for other groups). </p>

<p> (3)Rearrests and treatment completion: Rearrest rates were </p>

<p> associated with failure to complete the treatment program. </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.5 </p>

<p> The results suggested an effect of the program. However, the
study </p>

<p> design was unable to make the comparison with offenders in
the same </p>

<p> situation with similarly serious drug offenses; therefore,
the </p>

<p> results must be interpreted cautiously. In particular, the
drug </p>

<p> court sample had fewer prior arrests than had the other
comparison </p>

<p> groups, and the key group of felony drug defendants used for </p>

<p> comparative purposes were not eligible for the drug court
program </p>

<p> because of the seriousness of their charges or prior records.
</p>

<p> The comparisons between those completing and failing to
complete the </p>

<p> program must also be viewed with caution, due to possible </p>

<p> motivational and other differences between the groups. </p>

<p> In commenting on a draft of this report, DOJ officials noted
that </p>

<p> this study had a strong design with carefully drawn
comparison </p>

<p> groups. We agree that the study's design was generally
strong. </p>

<p> However, as we state in this report, there were some
potentially </p>

<p> important differences in prior arrest rates between the
groups, and </p>

<p> the study was not able to compare similarly situated drug
defendants </p>

<p> in a roughly similar time period. Therefore, as we noted, the
</p>

<p> study's results should be interpreted cautiously. </p>

<p> EVALUATION 4: DADE COUNTY </p>

<p> (SMITH, DAVIS AND GORETSKY) </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:4 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.1 </p>

<p> Defendants with no prior convictions charged with a drug
possession </p>

<p> offense, admitting to a drug problem for which they wanted
treatment. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 318 defendants assigned to the drug court with
a sample </p>

<p> of 99 narcotics cases in early 1988. In addition, a group of
drug </p>

<p> court defendants who were accepted into the drug court
program were </p>

<p> compared on rearrest rates. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants were assigned to the drug court in January 1990
through </p>

<p> March 1990. The comparison group was charged between January
1988 </p>

<p> and March 1988. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Rearrest rates: There was no statistically significant
difference </p>

<p> in the rate of felony rearrests after 1 year between those
assigned </p>

<p> to drug court (32 percent) and the comparison group of
defendants </p>

<p> charged 2 years earlier (33 percent). Those defendants
accepted by </p>

<p> the drug court did have lower rates of rearrest (15 percent),
but the </p>

<p> authors noted that these individuals constituted &quot;a
highly select </p>

<p> group . . . least disposed to commit new crimes.&quot; The
rearrest </p>

<p> results in this evaluation differed from those in the other </p>

<p> evaluation of Dade County (evaluation 3). </p>

<p> (2)Sentencing dispositions: There were statistically
significant </p>

<p> differences in dispositions between those assigned to drug
court and </p>

<p> the comparison group of earlier defendants. Those assigned to
drug </p>

<p> court were more likely not to face further prosecution and
less </p>

<p> likely to serve probation or short jail terms. </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.5 </p>

<p> There were concerns about the comparability of the
participants in </p>

<p> the various groups. In particular, the finding of lower
rearrest </p>

<p> rates for program participants should be viewed cautiously in
light </p>

<p> of the selectivity of admission to the program. As a result,
there </p>

<p> were strong reservations about the results reported. </p>

<p> DOJ officials, in commenting on a draft of this report,
indicated </p>

<p> that this study had several flaws. They pointed out that the
study </p>

<p> was done when this drug court was less than 10 months old.
They </p>

<p> further noted that information on successful drug court
participants </p>

<p> was not available for evaluation because the participants'
records </p>

<p> were sealed. We concur with these comments. </p>

<p> EVALUATION 5: BROWARD COUNTY </p>

<p> (TERRY) </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:5 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:5.0.1 </p>

<p> First-time offenders arrested for possession or purchase of
cocaine. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:5.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 392 defendants completing or remaining in the
drug </p>

<p> court program with 241 defendants not completing the drug
court </p>

<p> program. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:5.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants entered the program from July 1991 through June
1992. </p>

<p> Study results were reported for October 1993. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:5.0.4 </p>

<p> Rearrests: Persons remaining in the program committed
felonies at a </p>

<p> slightly lower rate than did those leaving the program (7.7
percent </p>

<p> vs. 12.0 percent). (Cases dismissed were not included in
these </p>

<p> comparisons.) No differences occurred in comparing the
proportions </p>

<p> having committed misdemeanors (4.1 percent for persons
remaining in </p>

<p> the program vs. 5.0 percent for those leaving the program). </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:5.0.5 </p>

<p> There was no adequate comparison group in this study from
which to </p>

<p> draw any conclusions about the effect of the program. </p>

<p> EVALUATION 6: MULTNOMAH COUNTY </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:6 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:6.0.1 </p>

<p> Defendants arrested for possession of any illegal substance
for </p>

<p> personal use. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:6.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 105 defendants graduating from the drug court
program </p>

<p> with 78 defendants who terminated unsuccessfully. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:6.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants entered the program on or before August 1, 1992,
and </p>

<p> graduated or terminated unsuccessfully on or before April 1,
1994. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:6.0.4 </p>

<p> Graduates had lower rates of bench warrants for failure to
appear, </p>

<p> went slightly longer before the first bench warrant was
issued, and </p>

<p> had a lower percentage of positive urine tests than those who
</p>

<p> terminated unsuccessfully. However, the report did not
indicate </p>

<p> whether these figures referred to prior histories or
follow-up </p>

<p> information after program completion. </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:6.0.5 </p>

<p> There was no adequate comparison group in this study from
which to </p>

<p> draw any conclusions about the effect of the program. </p>

<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a> </h3>

<p> Despite the demonstrated relationships between drug abuse and
crime, criminal justice agencies too seldom focus on reducing
drug abuse as a means of reducing the criminal activities of
drug-involved offenders. Yet evidence from the research
literature continues to accumulate, indicating that some drug
treatment programs have been successful in reducing recidivism.
Following an overview of pertinent research findings, this paper
outlines the elements of an effective strategy for treating
cocaine and heroin abusing offenders. </p>

<p> The interventions proposed in this paper grow out of the drug
abuse research literature, the authors' urban-based research, and
their clinical expcriencc with drug abuse treatment in
corrections. In addition, the suggested interventions emerge from
years of correctional outcome research which has assessed what
works, with whom, and under what circumstances. Although this
paper will focus on heroin and cocaine involved offenders, some
recommendations may apply to offenders who use other illicit
drugs. </p>

<h3><a name="ResearchFindings">Research findings</a> </h3>

<h4><a name="TheProblem">The problem </a></h4>

<p> Recent research provides amplc evidence that offender
populations are composed of large numbers of drug abusers-and
that drug-involved offenders commit substantial number-, of
undetected crimes. </p>

<p> <b>Very recent cocaine and heroin abusers constitute a
majority of the arrestees and inmates in jails and prisons in New
York City and some other jurisdictions.</b> </p>

<p> National surveys of jail and prison populations, smaller
self-report studies, and urine testing results indicate that
increasing proportions of offenders are users of drugs and that
cocaine use is increasing the most rapidly. More than
three-quarters of the nation's inmates and almost all inmates in
New York City report illicit drug use.' Similarly, sclf-rcport
studies among prison and jail inmates in California, Michigan,
and Texas reveal that approximately half are heroin users and
many are daily heroin users.' Recent urinalysis-based studies of
arrestees in Washington, D.C. reveal that well over half test
positive for at least one illicit drug and a quarter test
positive for two or more illicit drugs, In a recent Manhattan
study the level of co caine use had doubled .;ince 1984.
Eighty-three percent of arrestees in September and October 1986
tested positive for cocaine, compared with 42 percent in 1984;
the increase in cocaine was found at all age levels and for all
offenses. Comparable increases have also been reported in
Washington, DC. </p>

<p> <b>Frequent users of heroin and cocaine in the general
population exhibit </b>a <b>multiproblem lifestyle that may
include a pattern of persistent criminal behavior.</b> </p>

<p> Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing condition that is part
of a complex multiproblem lifestyle which is highly resistant to
rehabilitation. Several studies show that daily or near daily
heroin users-many of whom also use other illicit substances
daily-are not in treatment, and do not seek treatment. Many also
consume alcohol heavily. They average over 200 non-drug crimcs
and hundreds of drug distribution offenses annually, yet are
unlikely to be arrested more than once a year, and then spend
less than a month in incarceration, The majority commit many
crimes for which they are not arrested or incarcerated, but
because of sheer volume of activity, they still have many more
arrests and incarceration periods than non-drug offenders. Over
half their generally modest income comes from drug distribution
activities. They usually spend most of that income on drugs.
Daily heroin abusers also generally do not have a residence nor
make their own meals, but rather stay and eat with a relative or
friend. They do not receive or seek public assistance. They have
no legal employment during a typical week nor do they seek any.
Thus, they are typically an economic burden on the poorest
members of their low-income communities. Many aspects of their
lifestyle also put them at high risk for violence and many other
social and health problems such as AIDS, alcoholism, and TB.
Therefore, whatever treatment programming is applied to this
population, it must contend with all or most of these problems if
it is to achieve long-term changes in this lifestyle.' </p>

<p> Data about chronic cocaine users' crime rates are not as well
developed. Recent evidence from street and treatment setting
interviews with crack users indicate that about 60 percent admit
paying for their cocaine with money derived from illicit
sources-ranging from drug dealing and prostitution to theft and
robbery. The persons using cocaine, however, generally come from
more varied socioeconomic backgrounds than heroin users, their
lifestyles vary accordingly, and many do not ever get arrested.
Nevertheless, the lifestyles of cocaine abusers who do become
involved with the criminal justice system appear to be very
similar to those of heroin abusers, as cocaine users often also
use heroin. </p>

<h4><a name="CriminalJusticeResponse">The criminal justice
response </a></h4>

<p> While much remains to be learned about the precise nature of
the links betnveen doing drugs and doing crime, the two behaviors
are clearly associated. Yet criminal justice agencies have few
strategies for routinely detecting and intervening in the drug
use of arrested heroin and cocaine abusers. The justice system
focuses almost exclusively on its criminal processing functions
of arrest, adjudication, probation, incarceration, and parole.
Even these interventions often represent a limited intrusion on
the criminal activities of the drug abusing offender. </p>

<p> <b>Criminal justice agencies, with rare exceptions, do not
seek or use information about the drug use of persons who are
arrested or convicted of crimes.</b> </p>

<p> Littlc cffort is made to identify drug abusers, to record
information about their drug use, to provide treatment (other
than dctoxification) while in jail or prison, to refer them to
treatment programs in the community, or to use such information
in plea bargaining or case dispositions (where legally
appropriate). <b>Only </b>a few jurisdictions maintain any
information about the drug use of arrestees or convicted
offenders, and there is a strong likelihood that the drug
information in their records is both incomplete and inaccurate
because it is most often based on self-report and not
substantiated through urinalysis. Thus, information that could
help inform criminal justice processing is not generally
available.' </p>

<p> <b>To the extent that criminal sanctions are applied, their
ability to interrupt the life style of the vast majority of
cocainc-heroin abusers is minimal.</b> </p>

<p> Nationally, only a low percentage (less than 10 percent) of
all felony arrests lead to a felony conviction resulting in
incarceration. Over half of all felony arrests (60 percent in
Manhattan) lead to conviction, but there is much variation by
jurisdiction. Typically, offenders plead guilty to lesser charges
and are sentenced to time served, a fine, community service,
probation, or a few months in jail. Consequently, the vast
majority of offenders, mainly those arrested on less severe
felony and misdemeanor charges, are at liberty within three
months after arrest. In addition, many felony offenders (a
significant portion of whom are involved with drugs) are at
liberty on bail or on personal recognizance while awaiting trial.
Active heroin-cocaine users have higher failure-to-appear rates
and much higher rates of rearrest while out on bail than
offenders not involved with drugs.9 </p>

<h4><a name="EfficacyofCriminalSanctions">The efficacy of
criminal sanctions </a></h4>

<p> Little evidence is available that criminal justice sanctions
alone are as effective as drug treatment in reducing the drug use
and criminality of cocaineheroin abusers at liberty. The central
value of the criminal process may lie in the leverage that can be
exerted to bring hardcore drug abusers into treatment. </p>

<p> <b>Existing evidence does not show that criminal justice
sanctions (fine, probation, or parole, or length of time served)
reduce criminality or drug </b>use <b>more effectively than drug
treatment among cocaine-heroin abusers.</b> </p>

<p> It is not known whether or to what extent jail or prison time
alone suppresses post-incarceration criminality or cocaine-heroin
abuse among drug involved offenderq- The limited evidence
available suggests that two-thirds or <b>more </b>of arrested
heroin abusers return to heroin-cocaine use and their diverse
criminal patterns within three months after release from
detention. In contrast, several studies of drug treatment
outcomes with criminal justice clients (mainly probationers) show
substantial post-treatment reductions in both drug use and
criminality.10 Outpatient clients in methadone treatment report
less than half as much criminal activity as heroin abusers not in
treatment. Compared with their pretreatment criminality,
methadone clients report 50 to 80 percent less crime during
treatment.&quot; Even among those who continue criminal activity
during treatment, methadone clients report reduced involvement in
serious crimes such as robbery, burglary, or dealing of heroin or
cocaine; they report mainly low-level property crimes, con games,
and sale of marijuana or pills.&quot; </p>

<p> Residential drug programs have sizable proportions
(frequently over half) of clients who are on probation or parole
or under related <b>legal </b>pressure, and whose criminality is
near zero while in the residential program. This nearzero
criminality of cocaine-heroin abusers while in residential
programs is documented for therapeutic communities in several
cities. A study of treatment facilities in New York found that
about a third of residential clients were criminal justice
referrals and had extensive criminal histories. These clients
tended to stay longer and have as good or better outcomes than
clients with similar pretreatment criminal and drug abuse
histories who were not referred by the criminal justice system.
13 </p>

<p> <b>The coercive power, surveillance potential, and time
offcmd through criminal justice sanctions, open significant
opportunities for effectively treating cocaine-heroin abusers.</b>
</p>

<p> Although criminal justice sanctions alone may have uncertain
value in reducing the criminality of drug involved offenders,
those sanctions can serve a powerful role by facilitating
effective drug treatment. There are a variety of pressures that
bring hardcore drug abusers into treatment: parents, employers,
loved one, and friends may all apply psychological and social
pressures. The most powerful pressure, however, may be the threat
of legal sanction -- the threat of arrest and conviction, and
most importantly, the threat of incarceration. The leverage
created by this threat, and by the sanction itself, permits
treatment to be considered as a viable option by serious abusers.
Moreover, by reducing early program termination, it allows the
treatment and aftercare to continue for the length of the
permissable custody. </p>

<p> Cocaine-heroin abusers typically wish to avoid the
&quot;hassles&quot; associated with changing their lives. When
the alternative is lengthy incarceration, cocaine-heroin abusers
may be more willing to be referred to drug treatment. If,
however, the alternative is a short sentence, detainees and jail
inmates may prefer the incarceration rather than diversion to
long-term drug abuse treatment. </p>

<p> Unfortunately, relatively few offenders voluntarily seek
treatment. Many offenders are referred by the criminal justice
system to drug treatment as the result of negotiated plea
bargains in which the offender agrees to enter treatment instead
of receiving a substantial sentece. For many years TASC
(Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime) has operated in selected
jurisdictions to recruit clients and negotiate with court staff
for release of offenders to drug programs. TASC clients are more
likely to select treatment because the alternative is considered
more onerous. </p>

<p> Few cocaine-heroin abusers in custody volunteer for drug
treatment unless the treatment program is seen as an attractive
alternative. Prison inmates seek out in-house treatment programs
because they often provide better living conditions, a safer
environment, parole release considerations, and an opportunity to
possibly change one's lifestyle. In-prison programs that offer
such conditions are substantially better able to recruit
participants than those which do not. Although these offenders
may not be completely sincere at admission, there is an
opportunity for the program to engage them in an effective
treatment experience. In short, the threat of substantial
sanctions (for arrestees) or the promise of better in-prison
conditions (for those in custody) can operate as extremely useful
incentives for treatment. Nevertheless, it must be understood
that a significant portion of offenders who have long chronic
heroin or cocaine abuse patterns will not want treatment under
any circumstances. </p>

<h4><a name="Somedimensions">Some dimensions of effective drug
abuse treatment.</a> </h4>

<p> As the preceding section has demonstrated, the criminality of
heroin abusers is substantially reduced while they are receiving
some form of treatment. The experiences of effective programs
suggest that whatever treatment method is used must have a sound
theoretical and empirical basis for its implementation.
Additionally, the treatment method must emerge from a powerful
social restoration tradition (discussed further below) that is
capable of teaching offenders to interact with others in less
deviant, more socially acceptable ways. Such an approach must be
credible to participants and not be perceived to be coercive and
authoritarian. The approach must have the capability to convince
offenders that the demanding path to a socially acceptable
lifestyle is worthwhile despite their deprived backgrounds, their
experience with quick criminal profits, and their recognition
that there is a low probability they will be caught for their
crimes. </p>

<p> <b>Despite the often cited conclusion that &quot;nothing
works&quot;, evidence from the research literature continues to
accumulate that some programs have been successful in reducing
recidivism.&quot;</b> </p>

<p> The majority of successful programs have been based on a
social learning theory of criminal behavior.&quot; According to
this theory, criminal behavior is learned through a process of
social interaction with others. Thus, pro-social behaviors must
be learned to replace deviant behavior. Effective approaches
include: therapeutic communities, self-help groups, family
therapy, contingency contracting, role playing and modeling,
vocational and social skills training, training in interpersonal
cognitive problem-solving skills, and other programs involving
ongoing peer monitoring of participants' behavior.&quot; </p>

<p> Successful programs have several things in common: authority
structures that clearly specify rules and sanctions,
anti-criminal modeling and reinforcement of pro-social behavior,
pragmatic personal and social problemsolving assistance, program
staff knowledgeable about the use of community resources, and
relationships between staff and clients which are empathic and
characterized by open communication and trust. Ex-offender-addict
counselors who serve as credible role-models of successful
rehabilitation also are often utilized.&quot; The &quot;Stay 'N
Out&quot; program (see Appendix A) provides an example of a
successful program that employs these treatment principles. </p>

<p> Conversely, unsuccessful programs are frequently based on a
medical (disease) model of criminology which suggests that
criminal behavior is a sickness.'9 <b>Similarly, </b>intervention
programs based on deterrence models (e.g., &quot;Scared
Straight&quot;) have shown very limited effects and have even
been associated with increased offending.&quot;' Other types of
programs that have been unsuccessful include those that rely
solely on open communication, &quot;friendship&quot; models,
inmate-directed therapy groups, and those that are
non-directive.,, </p>

<p> While inmate-dircctcd therapy groups have not had a record of
success, behavioral programs that are simply imposed-without
involving inmates in their development-do not appear to work
either. Such programs are often focused on anti-social rather
than pro-social behaviors and as a result give undue attention
and reinforcement to negative behavior. Other features of
unsuccessful programs include the failure to either neutralize or
utilize the inmate's peer group and failure to sustain continuity
of care after release from prison. 22 </p>

<p> A number of factors have been identified that degrade
treatment integrity23 and impede treatment success. Many are
common to intervention pro grams in any setting. The absence of
sound theoretical basis for treatment is a typical obstacle to
the development of successful programs. Often, the quality and
intensity of treatment interventions are inadequate. Sometimes
programs propose treatment interventions that are based on sound
principles which are not followed when the program is
implemented. Another common problem is lack of staff training and
treatment experience, and/or their inadequate commitment to.both
the clients' and program success. </p>

<p> Other impediments to the establishment and maintenance of
successful treatment programs are related to a lack of
correctional system support and the negative influence of inmate
subcultures. Fundamental differences between custodial and
treatment perspectives often contribute to the failure of the
correctional environment to support program staff and goals, The
lack of support from the custodial forces of an institution is
exacerbated within prisons by the negative influence of the
anti-authoritarian and antitherapeutic &quot;prisoners'
code.&quot; Under this code, suspicion colors most interactions
between staff and inmates. The result may be a program that
receives neither staff support nor inmate cooperation. </p>

<p> <b>Time in community drug treatment is inversely related to
posttreatment cocaine-heroin abuse and criminality.</b> </p>

<p> Turning to a more quantitative dimension of treatment
programming, the available research clearly suggests the longer
heroin and cocaine abusers remain in treatment, the greater the
reduction in post-treatment criminality. Those who remain in
community-based residential, methadone, or outpatient programs
for more than three months have lower levels of both
post-treatment heroin and cocaine abuse and criminality than
those who drop out before three months and significantly lower
rates than their own pre-treatment levels. Subsequent months of
treatment in these programs yield even greater reductions in
post-treatment criminality, especially after 12 months of
treatment and after each subsequent treatment cycle. </p>

<p> Treatment personnel generally agree that it is hard even to
stabilize the cocaine-heroin abuser's lifestyle in three months,
much less begin to transform long-standing patterns of deviance.
After three months, clients can begin to be comfortable with the
treatment regime and start to make progress in changing
disruptive patterns in their lives. However, due to the chronic
relapsing pattern characteristic of the drug addict, several
&quot;cycles of treatment&quot; are frequently necessary for
hardcore drug abusers to achieve substantial improvement in their
behavior and lifestyle. </p>

<p> Clients who leave treatment early against program advice are
significantly more likely to recidivate than those who complete
the recommended program, Early leavers who later return to
treatment ultimately have less heroin use and criminality than
those who fail to return.&quot; </p>

<p> Outcome studies have shown that the first 12 months in
treatment are critical to long-term reductions in criminality
after leaving treatment. For cocaine and heroin abusers who are
incarcerated <b>and </b>who participate in prison-based
therapeutic community programs, the optimum period of treatment
appears to be nine to twelve months followed by release into the
community. Longer stays are associated with diminishing results.
It is believed this occurs for two reasons: First, longer periods
of program participation while in prison creates increased
dependency on the program and less transference of the learned
experiences to the community upon release. Secondly, some persons
are transferred as rehabilitated back into the general prison
population after completing more than a year of treatment, and
the criminal subculture undermines some gains made during the
treatment period. Thus, the timing of treatment and release for
prison inmateswith serious drug abuse problems needs to be
coordinated to achieve the optimum outcome </p>

<h4><a name="Conclusion">Conclusion</a> </h4>

<p> Clearly, much has been learned about effective ways of
reducing the drug involvement of heroin and cocaine abusing
offenders. Given the chronic recurring nature of addiction, no
program can realistically expect to eliminate severe heroin and
cocaine abuse for all offenders. Yet even if a program succeeds
only in reducing the frequency of use, substantial reductions in
criminality may follow. The evidence is clear: cocaine-heroin
abusers commit much less crime when they use once or twice a week
or less often than when they use once a day or more often. If,
for example, daily cocaine-heroin users were placed under
court-directed intensive surveillance and frequent urine
monitoring which curtailed their use of drugs by half or more, a
very substantial drop in their criminality'. would be likely to
occur, especially in crimes such as robbery and burglary- </p>

<h3><a name="PolicyRecommendations">Policy recommendations </a> </h3>

<p> What steps should be taken by the criminal justice system to
deal more effectively with the drug-involved offender? Based on
the research findings discussed in the preceding section and the
experience and opinions of <b>the </b>authors, this section
presents a series of policy recommendations. While it may not be
possible to institute all or even most of these recommendations
in many jurisdictions, they are offered as goals or guidelines
for the practitioner. We argue that the interventions proposed
will improve the system by leading to the effective integration
and coordination of offender supervision and drug treatment
approaches. </p>

<p> Beginning with the crucial need to identify heroin and
cocaine abusers at arrest, the recommendations focus in turn on
jail-based interventions, inprison programs, and community
treatment options. Also included are systemwide recommendations
pertaining to the organization and staffing of drug abuse
treatment programs. All of the recommendations presented in this
;ection call for the criminal justice system to supervise
cocaine-heroin users frequently and systematically: </p>

<p>  Convicted cocaine-heroin abusers under community
supervision should be intensively supervised and compelled to
attend treatment for their maximum period of custody. Optimal
supervision includes near daily validation of employment, time in
residence, associations, and absence of drug use. </p>

<p>  Convicted cocainc-hcroin abusers sentenced to prison
should be required to participate in drug treatment for nine
months to one year prior to release <i>and </i>to continue in
community treatment as a condition of parole. Their urine and
behavior should be carefully monitored while under field
supervision to insure attendance and prevent relapses.&quot; </p>

<p>  Steps should be taken to ensure that drug-involved
offenders in city and county detention facilities are placed in
treatment after release, During their confinement, methadone
maintenance should be continued for addicts previously assigned
to this program or initiated for other heroin users. Naltrexone
combined with urine surveillance should be used for those heroin
users on work release who opt for drug-frcc treatment. </p>

<h4><a name="identification">The identification of drug-involved
offenders </a></h4>

<p> <b>In areas with a large number of heroin and cocaine users,
urinalysis should be used to identify these users at arrest.</b> </p>

<p> Most cocaine-heroin abusers who have contact with the
criminal justice system are arrested about once per year. Results
of the pretrial drug-testing program operating in Washington,
D.C. suggest that recent users of cocaine or heroin can be
identified accurately at arrest through urinalysis. By collccting
urine samples from all arrestees, and analyzing the specimens for
five types of drugs including opiates, the D.C. Pretrial Services
Agency has been able to identify and increase supervision of drug
users released pen-ding trial. These procedures appear to have
reduced the rates of rearrest and failure-to-appear. Moreover, by
systematically retaining the results of the urine tests, the
information has been made available to help determine appropriate
criminal sanctions for those arrestces ultimately
convicted.&quot; </p>

<p> The costs of a urine testing program may be amply justified
in any jurisdiction with a significant drug problem. As in D.C.,
the data collected should be systematically maintained and used
for determining conditions of pre-trial release and sanctions for
those convicted. In particular, the opportunity should be seized
to present appropriate treatment options. </p>

<h4><a name="jailbased">Jail-based interventions </a></h4>

<p> <b>Treatment orientation and referral to drug treatment
programs should </b>be <b>instituted </b>in <b>metropolitan
courts and jails.</b> </p>

<p> A central intake staff and/or representatives of drug
treatment programs should be present at court and in jails. All
offenders who test drug positive at arrest should be required to
attend orientation and preliminary intake procedures while in
detention. These preliminary treatment steps may help ensure that
those who are released from custody are placed in appropriate
treatment after returning to the community.&quot; </p>

<p> Full treatment interventions, however, should not be
initiated for cocaineheroin offenders who will be free of custody
in less than three months. It is neither cost effective nor
therapeutically wise to implement full treatment programming when
there is little expectation that treatment can be completed. </p>

<p> <b>Methadone programs should be permitted to maintain clients
in jails to facilitate resumption of treatment at the end of
detention.</b> </p>

<p> Methadone treatment has proven effective in reducing daily
heroin use and substantially reducing criminality among heroin
abusers. Enrolled methadone clients who are arrested can be
maintained on methadone while detained. In this way, return to
methadone treatment upon release after short-term jail custody
would be facilitated. Those who are convicted and sentenced to
incarceration should be given the option (when medically
recommended) to remain on methadone or to detoxify from methadone
and enter an in-prison therapeutic community. Consideration
should also be given to initiating methadone treatment in jails
for chronic heroin addicts. Heroin addicts serving short
sentences who arc introduced to methadone treatment while
incarcerated are more likely to enter and remain in methadone
maintenance treatment in the community when they are released
from custody. </p>

<p> <b>Daily naltrexone consumption should be used for some
convicted heroin abusers in combination with drug-free treatment
and intensive supervision.</b> </p>

<p> <i>For her-oin-abusing </i>offenders who receive jail or
probation sentences <i>and </i>who opt for drug-free treatment,
use of naltrexone (Trexan@), combined with urine surveillance,
could be instituted. Its use with jail inmates on work release or
school furlough appears particularly appropriate. Naltrexone is
an easily administered narcotic antagonist drug which taken daily
produces almost immediate withdrawal symptoms in addicts when
they use an opiatc, but is harmless to nonaddicts. It is most
effective with heroinaddicted offenders who have a high level of
community integration. It has no effect on cocaine, however;
therefore, urine monitoring <i>must be </i>sustained.'o </p>

<h4><a name="inprison">In-prison treatment </a></h4>

<p> <b>Therapeutic communities and other intensive milieu drug
treatments should be made available to cocaine-heroin abusing
state prisoners about one year prior to parole eligibility.</b> </p>

<p> A successful therapeutic community, the &quot;Stay 'N
Out&quot; program (see Appendix A), was developed at two
correctional facilities in New York Stateone for men and one for
women. This model therapeutic community in prison holds the
greatest promise for changing hard-core, drug-abusing inmates and
reducing recidivism.&quot; </p>

<p> Despite their proven effectiveness, few therapeutic
communities such as &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot; are in place for
criminally involved drug abusers. One of the factors that limits
the creation of additional programs of this type is the concern
that such programs might engage in activities that threaten
security and encourage inmate resistance to the correctional
system. Nonetheless, correctional administrators learn quickly as
they become exposed to the operation of well-run programs that
such undesirable variance can be avoided. In fact, in
institutions where most of these programs have been established,
the wardens and correctional officers frequently are their most
vocal champions. To encourage their development, however, staff
and administration need education and training. Further, a number
of fiscal and practical issues have to be addressed prior to
implementation- </p>

<p> <b>The implementation of prison-based treatment programs
requires isolation from the general prison population.</b> </p>

<p> The inimical influence of the criminal inmate subculture
(&quot;prisoners' code&quot;) will inevitably undermine any
attempts to establish viable programming if the program is not
isolated from this anti-therapeutic force. Separate living
quarters, recreation, food services, etc. should be maintained
within the institution for this separation to be ideally
effective. Total isolation is, however, neither necessary nor
desirable; rather, some contact with the general inmate
population is useful for the purpose of allowing the inmate in
treatment to see where he has come from and how much he has
changed. In addition, the contact experience provides the
opportunity for the program resident to test both his new
prosocial values against the inmate subculture and his resistance
to negative influences. This kind of isolation is most possible
in medium security institutions with dormitorytype housing space
where one dormitory or two are physically segregated or separable
from the main institution. </p>

<p> <b>Prisoners in therapeutic communities who make good
treatment progress should be paroled to residential drug-free
programs that sustain the therapeutic community model prior to
completion of (heir sentence. They should be required to stay in
treatment as a condition of parole until their date of maximum
custody or until the program deems them recovered.</b> </p>

<p> It is essential for the successful treatment of
cocaine-heroin abuser offenders to maintain continuity-of-care
from the outset of treatment to termination of custody. While
there is benefit from prison treatment alone, these effects are
augmented and sustained by continuing that specific treat inent
in the community. </p>

<p> Ideally, release to the community facility would be
contingent on the progress made during in-prison treatment. Under
this incentive system, specific behaviors would be rewarded with
a specified number of restitution or release &quot;points&quot;
that might be administered as a form of &quot;good timc&quot;
system. Alternatively, prisoners might earn more favorable
conditions of confinement or higher status and associated program
privilege.-,. However it is administered, the basic notion is to
reinforce <b>the </b>desirability of pro-social behaviors. </p>

<h4><a name="community">Community treatment programs </a></h4>

<p> <b>Drug-abusing misdemennants should be considered for
communitybased sentencing alternatives.</b> </p>

<p> In lieu of confining drug-involved offenders in jails and
county penitentiaries, a range of intermediate sanctions should
be considered for heroin and cocaine abusers convicted of
misdemeanors. These might include house arrest with electronic
monitoring, intermittent sentences (e.g., weekend or evening
incarceration), TASC programs, or residence in a facility such as
a &quot;halfway in-halfway out&quot; center (a &quot;HiHo&quot;).
Again, in any of these alternatives offenders would ideally be
able to achieve release status more quickly by providing
drug-negative urine samples, routinely attending and
participating positively in treatment sessi ns, paying back their
victims, and providing evidence of prosocial activity.'2 </p>

<p> The community treatment resources available to support
intermediate sanctioning policies range from self-help groups
that meet once a week for a couple of hours to residential
facilities that provide 24 hour supervision and programming- At a
minimum, almost all communities have an Alcoholics Anonymous or
Narcotics Anonymous group that provides an context for recovering
substance abusers to meet, discuss day-to-day steps for
maintaining a drug free life, and participate in many different
types of social activities not involving alcohol or drugs.&quot;
Some communities provide drug treatment counseling through the
Department of Mental Health. And in many cities, recovering
substance-abusers operate group homes that use many of the same
principles of Alcoholics Anonymous or therapeutic communities
found in prison programs. </p>

<p> TASC programs run throughout the nation provide staff who are
familiar with the particular resources available for
drug-involved offenders in specific communities. And almost all
states have an agency that periodically determines the
availability of both private and public programs available for
drug treatment. <b>A </b>list of these agencies is available from
the National Association of State Drug and Alcohol Abuse
Directors, in Washington, DC </p>

<p> <b>Even if no other treatment is provided, heroin-cocaine
abusers who are on probation and parole should be required to
have frequent urine tests.</b> </p>

<p> Drug-abusing offenders on probation or parole who are in no
special treatment programs, as a minimum should be routinely
required to provide specimens for urinalysis over the entire
length of their probation or parole. At the outset the frequency
of urinalysis should be near daily, and decreascd as positive
progress warrants. The effective monitoring of urinalysis results
will help to interrupt relapse to daily heroin or cocaine use,
and, hence, high-rate criminality is likely to drop
substantially.&quot; When drug positive urines are detected,
offenders should be immediately confronted, clearly warned after
the first such incident, be required to enter treatment for
diagnosis and assessment after the second positive urine, and be
required to remain in treatment if relapse seems imminent or has
occurred. Refusal to enter treatment upon an affirmative
diagnosis should be considered a violation of release conditions.
</p>

<h4><a name="organization">Organization and staffing issues </a> </h4>

<p> <b>The integrity of the treatment programs for convicted
offenders must be maintained by developing structural safeguards
of independence and autonomy from correctional management.</b> </p>

<p> All too often well designed interventions operated by
competent and motivated agency and institutional staffs do not
succeed. Usually, the efforts arc not trusted by the criminal
justice clients, are overwhelmed by the difficulty of the
clients' problems, are weakened by inadequate funding and
institutional resistance, and are subject to high rates of staff
burnout and turnover. For a treatment program to last long enough
to make a substantial difference, it must maintain its own
integrity, ie., honesty and commitment to the treatment goals and
program participants. The staff must also have sufficient
independence and automony to deliver on their promises. </p>

<p> Treatment programs conducted by organizations independent of
(but closely linked to) corrections agencies are more likely to
maintain their integrity thz programs operated by correctional
staff within institutions or community corrections settings. This
suggests that an outside agency working in cooperation with or
under contract to the Department of Corrections may be the most
appropriate treatment organization. Management responsibility for
the rehabilitation program should be assigned to a team of
committed treatment professionals, as well as
ex-addict/ex-offender peer counselors, For this approach to work,
the power and authority of the treatment team should be
comparable to and complement the criminal justice authority. This
management group should be associated with and monitored by
respected professional self-help/therapeutic community
organizations, for example, Therapeutic Communities of America. </p>

<p> <b>Probation and parole officers should have their functions
divided into Surveillance Officers and Community 'fteatment Team
Leaders.</b> </p>

<p> For many years, correctional observers have debated the
wisdom of vesting probation and parole officers with the
potentially conflicting responsibilities of surveillance and
treatment. In the opinion of the authors, surveillance and
treatment functions of field supervision officers should be
separated to resolve the inherent conflicts and strengthen each
function. Essential to the effectiveness of the
treatment/counseling relationship is trust and confidentiality.
Persons tinder field supervision are unlikely to freely admit
criminal acts or drug use to someone in a position to return them
to prison for such violations. Therefore, surveillance and
rehabilitation responsibilities should be handled by staffs who
work separately but cooperatively to avoid role confusion for
both officer and offender. As the next recommendation suggests,
both types of officers should be augmented by carefully selected
exoffeiider-addicts who would serve as Monitors for the
Surveillance Officers and as Treatment Team staff for the
Community Treatment Team Leader. </p>

<p> The Treatment Team staff should rotate between working in
prison and the community to maintain continuity between the
rehabilitation efforts in both environments. For in-prison
programs, the objective of separating custodial and treatment
functions is satisfied by the organization discussed in the
preceding point. </p>

<p> <b>Former addict-offenders who have shown clear evidence of
prosocial change should have training and employment
opportunities, for example, as Monitors and Rntment Team members.</b>
</p>

<p> Large numbers of offenders who have been chronic
cocaine-heroin abusers are unable to gain and to keels legal
employment. Their background is so limited and so stigmatized
that legal employers are reluctant to employ them, and suspicious
after they do. Thus, even after making good treatment progress,
many offenders may still be unable to gain stable employment.
First, systematic skill development and training programs should
he providcd. Second, providing employment to ex-addict-offenders
within the treatment program itself is a valuable opportunity to
deal with this unemployment issue as well as cope with shortages
of field supervision personnel. </p>

<p> The employment of ex-addict-offenders in a variety of
progressively more responsible paraprofessional and professional
rolcs will help new monitoring and drug treatment systems
function effectively. They also will serve as role models to
offenders they supervise. The ex-addict offenders are the role
models (as in &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;) whose presence
demonstrates the realistic possibility of achieving successful
rehabilitation. Graduation from a drug treatment program,
evidence of successful integration into community life, and
additional training are prerequisites for the employment of
ex-addictoffenders as Monitors and Treatriient Team members. </p>

<h4><a name="Conclusion2">Conclusion</a> </h4>

<p> By substantially reducing their cocaine-heroin abuse, the
criminality of drug-involved offenders may be reduced by 20 to 50
percent or more. To do so, however, the criminal justice system
must develop an alliance with the drug treatment system geared to
achieve the goals of effective rehabilitation, enhanced prosocial
behavior, and reduced recidivism. </p>

<p> The difficulties inherent in bringing about this alliance
should not be minimizcd. Some reallocation of resources clearly
will be required, with all the tensions attendant on any
significant shift in funding and operational priorities. If
custodial and treatment functions are to be effectively
separated, recruitment, training, and retraining programs will
have to be developed for community corrections personnel.
Institutional corrections environments must be prepared to accept
independent treatment organizations. Procedures must be developed
to identify and train those therapeutic community graduates best
qualified to become competent treatment team members and
monitors. The problem of intensive community resistance to
accepting community treatment facilities (HiHo's) that house
felons and substance abusers must also be addressed. Within
prisons, space will have to be reallocated to create therapeutic
communities to house clients during treatment. If institutions
are converted for total therapeutic community utilization,
abandoned mental hospitals may be utilized, with significant
capital expenditures necessary for conversion. Beginning at the
point of arrest, screening procedures will have to be developed
to monitor drug use and to identify cocaine-heroin users who can
most benefit from the proposed interventions. </p>

<p> Perhaps most important, cooperation will be needed among
stable drug abuse agencies and drug treatment programs and
criminal justice organizations (courts, probation, corrections,
and parole) that traditionally have had competing political and
fiscal interests and often lack a history of successful Joint
ventures. Careful documentation of pilot results will also be
needed to evaluate whether the system is moving in desired or
unanticipated directions. For this, evaluation researchers will
have to be in place from the outset. Since many problems will
arise that have the potential for compromising the interventions,
the evaluation design must provide decision makers with timcly
information to assist them in formulating corrective actions. At
the same time, ongoing dissemination of outcome information
through professional and media channels will help foster and
maintain the support necessary to accomplish the changes
proposed. </p>

<p> &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;: A model for prison-based drug
treatment </p>

<p> &quot;Stay 'N <b>Out&quot; </b>is a therapeutic community
(TC), in part based upon the Phoenix House model, that has been
operating in the New York State prison system for the last ten
years. Over time the program has been modified to operate more
effectively within the prison environment. The program has been
fortunate to be operated by many of the founding staff who have
provided the vision, commitment, and determination necessary for
a successful prison program. </p>

<p> An early evaluation of the &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot; program
indicated that it was successfully implemented, maintained a
positive TC environment, and produced positive psychological and
behavioral changes in participants. In 1984, the National
Institute <b>on </b>Drug Abuse funded an evaluation of &quot;Stay
'N Out&quot;, comparing it to two other prison-bascd programs in
New York State and a control group of inmates on program waiting
lists, but receiving no treatment. A milieu program and a
standard counseling program were the comparison groups. Although
participants were not randomly assigned to thcsc treatment
conditions, preliminary results of the comparison are
provocative. The data indicate the &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;
participants who remained in the program for nine to twelve
months were less likely to have problems while on parole than
either those who left &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot; earlier or those in
other prison-based programs. For example, &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;
participants who remained in the program more than nine months
were more likely to have a positive parole discharge (80 percent
positive) than those who remained in the program less than three
months (50 percent positive). Positiv e parole discharge is
defined as no reported violations of parole during the parole
custody period. Long-term (9-12 months) participants of the other
programs studied also had fewer cases of positive parole
discharge; the milieu program reported a 56 percent positive
discharge rate and the counseling program a 47 percent positive
rate. </p>

<p> Preliminary analysis indicates that long-term &quot;Stay 'N
Out&quot; participants may also have a more encouraging pattern
of re-arrest than those in the other programs. Continuing
follow-up shows that only 27 percent of the TC participants were
re-arrested compared to 35 percent of the milieu participants, 50
percent of the counseling participants, and 42 percent of the
waiting list persons. In addition, TC participants averaged 18
months to rearrest compared to 11 months for the milieu and nine
months for the counseling group. These data should be interpreted
with caution, however, as variation in the actual number of days
at risk may vary greatly among samples. </p>

<h4><a name="overview">Program overview </a></h4>

<p> 64 Stay IN Out&quot; programs were begun as a joint effort
among New York </p>

<p> State Division of Substance Abuse Services (DSAS), New York
Therapeutic Communities (NYTC), New York Department of
Correctional Services (DOCS), and the New York State Division of
Parole. Currently, NYTC. operates the programs, DOCS supplies
funding, and Parole provides increased opportunities for program
residents. The DSAS Bureau of Research and Evaluation continues
to evaluate the program. </p>

<p> The current program consists of two treatment units for male
inmates in one facility with 35 beds per unit (a total capacity
of 70 beds), and one treatment unit with 40 beds for women
-inmates in another facility. Each unit is staffed by a total of
seven persons, including both professionals and
paraprofessionals. Inmates selected for the programs are
recruited at Statc correctional facilities. The criteria for
selection are: history of drug abuse, at least 18 years of age,
evidence of positive institutional participation, and no history
of sex crimes or mental illness. &quot;Stay IN Out&quot; clients
are housed in units segregated from the general prison
population. They cat in a common dining room, however, and attend
morning activities with other prisoners. The optimum length of
treatment is from nine to twelve months. Most program staff are
ex-addict-offenders who are graduates of community T)Cs: they act
as &quot;role models&quot; exemplifying successful
rehabilitation. The course of treatment is a developmental growth
process with the inmate becoming an increasingly responsible
member of the program. </p>

<p> During the early phase of treatment, the clinical thrust
involves assessment of client needs and problem areas.
Orientation to the prison TC procedures occurs through individual
counseling, encounter sessions, and seminars. Clients are given
low-level jobs and granted little status. During the later phases
of treatment, residents are provided opportunities to earn
higherlevel positions and increased status through sincere
involvement in the program and hard work. Encounter groups and
counseling sessions are more in-depth and focus on the areas of
self-discipline, self-worth, selfawareness, respect for
authority, and acceptance of guidance for problem areas. Seminars
take on a more intellectual nature. Debate is encouraged to
enhance self-expression and to increase self-confidence. </p>

<p> Ilpon release, participants are encouraged to seek further
substance abuse treatment at cooperating community TCs. Extensive
involvement with a network of community TCs is central to the
program's operation. Staff and senior residents of community TCs
visit &quot;Stay IN Out&quot; on a regular basis to recruit
resident inmates for their programs. These visitors provide
inspiration since they are ex-addicts and ex-felon role models
who are leading economically and socially productive lives. </p>

<p> <b>DRUG OFFENSES ACCOUNT FOR A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF JAIL
INMATES</b> </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h1>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C.-- Drug offenses accounted for 23 percent of </p>

<p> the charges against the almost 400,000 men and women being
held in </p>

<p> local jails during 1989--up from 9 percent in 1983, the
Bureau of </p>

<p> Justice Statistics announced today. The Bureau, a component
of the </p>

<p> Office of Justice Programs in the U.S. Department of Justice,
reported </p>

<p> that the number of inmates in the nation's 3,312 local jails
grew 77 </p>

<p> percent from 1983 to 1989. More than 40 percent of that
growth </p>

<p> resulted from the increased number of persons held for or
convicted of </p>

<p> drug offenses. </p>

<p> &quot;The dramatic increase in the number of persons in jails
on </p>

<p> drug charges occurred both among those awaiting trial and
those </p>

<p> already convicted of crimes,&quot; said Bureau Director
Steven D. </p>

<p> Dillingham. &quot;And more than one-half of all convicted
jail inmates </p>

<p> said they had committed the offense for which they were
incarcerated </p>

<p> under the influence of drugs or alcohol or both.&quot; </p>

<p> The findings were drawn from a nationally representative </p>

<p> survey of 5,675 inmates held in 424 local jails. Similar
Bureau </p>

<p> surveys of jail inmates were conducted in 1972, 1978 and
1983. A jail </p>

<p> is a locally administered institution that holds people
awaiting trial </p>

<p> or already sentenced, usually for one year or less. </p>

<p> About half of all jail inmates in 1989 had been convicted and
</p>

<p> were serving time, 7 percent had been convicted but not yet
sentenced, </p>

<p> 26 percent were awaiting or on trial and 16 percent were
awaiting </p>

<p> arraignment. </p>

<p> An estimated 46 percent of the jail inmates in 1989 were on </p>

<p> probation, on parole, on bail or were in some other criminal
justice </p>

<p> status at the time of their arrest. More than three-quarters
of all </p>

<p> inmates being held in 1989 for any offense had had a prior
sentence of </p>

<p> probation or incarceration. At least a third of the inmates
were in </p>

<p> jail for a violent offense or had been previously sentenced
for a </p>

<p> violent offense. Other survey results: </p>

<p> --More than four of every 10 convicted inmates said they had </p>

<p> been using an illegal drug during the month before they
committed the </p>

<p> offense for which they were incarcerated. About one in four
convicted </p>

<p> inmates said they had used a major drug, such as heroin,
cocaine, </p>

<p> crack, LSD or PCP, in that month. </p>

<p> --Women and Hispanic prisoners were the most likely among all
</p>

<p> jail inmates to be held on drug charges--about one-third in
each </p>

<p> group. </p>

<p> --Among convicted inmates, 29 percent reported they had </p>

<p> committed their offenses under the influence of only alcohol,
15 </p>

<p> percent under the influence of only drugs and 12 percent
under the </p>

<p> influence of both. </p>

<p> --Almost one-third of all jail inmates said they had </p>

<p> participated in a substance abuse treatment program at some
time in </p>

<p> their lives--about 18 percent of the inmates had received
treatment </p>

<p> for drugs, 9 percent for alcohol and 6 percent for both. </p>

<p> --More than four of every 10 female inmates reported they had
</p>

<p> been abused at some time before their current
incarceration--33 </p>

<p> percent physically and 36 percent sexually. </p>

<p> --About 39 percent of all jail inmates had grown up in a </p>

<p> single parent household and an additional 11 percent had
lived in a </p>

<p> household without either parent. </p>

<p> --The racial and ethnic composition of local jails changed </p>

<p> between 1983 and 1989--blacks increased from 38 percent to 42
percent </p>

<p> of the inmates population, Hispanics increased from 14
percent to 17 </p>

<p> percent and the percentage of white non-Hispanics decreased
from 46 </p>

<p> percent to 39 percent. </p>

<p> --The female jail population increased from 7.1 percent in </p>

<p> 1983 to 9.5 percent in 1989. One of every four female inmates
was in </p>

<p> jail for larceny or fraud. </p>

<p> --About 11 percent of the inmates were being held for other </p>

<p> authorities--most awaiting transportation to a state prison. </p>

<p> --Among the inmates who had been sentenced to serve their
time </p>

<p> in local jails, half had received a sentence of six months of
less. </p>

<p> It is estimated that about half of the inmates sentenced to
local </p>

<p> jails would serve less than five months. </p>

materials for the Fiscal Year 1995 Drug Court Program will be
available in early 1995. </p>

<p> DATE: All comments must be received by February 24, 1995. </p>

<p> ADDRESS: All comments should be addressed to Reginald L.

<p> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </p>

<p> The Department of Justice Response Center at 1-800-421-6770
or 202-307-1480. </p>

<p> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </p>

<p> Overview of Title V-Drug Courts </p>

<p> Federal discretionary grants are being made available under
the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Title
V, Public Law 103-322, 108 Stat. 1796 (September 13, 1994), 42
U.S.C. 3796ii-3796ii-8 [hereinafter the &quot;Act&quot;] to
States, units of local government, Indian tribal governments, and
state and local courts for assistance with drug court programs.
The Act gives the Attorney General, and through statutory
authority contained in the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act, an authorized designee (in this case the Assistant Attorney
General for the Office of Justice Programs), the authority to
make grants to the above-mentioned entities for drug court
programs that involve continuing judicial supervision over
non-violent offenders with substance abuse problems and the
integrated administration of sanctions and services including:
(1) mandatory periodic testing for, the use of controlled
substances or other addictive substances during any period of
supervised release or probation for each participant; (2)
substance abuse treatment for each participant; (3) diversion,
probation, or other supervised release involving the possibility
of prosecution, confinement, or incarceration based on
noncompliance with program requirements or failure to show
satisfactory progress; and (4) programmatic, offender management,
and aftercare services such as relapse prevention, health care,
education, vocational training, job placement, housing placement,
and,child care or other family support services for each
participant requiring such services. </p>

<p> Section 50001 of Title V of the Act requires that regulations
be issued to ensure exclusion of violent offenders from these
funded programs. This proposed rule responds to that requirement.
To more fully develop and define the grant program and to provide
direction and guidance to potential applicants, program
guidelines, will be issued subsequent to the publication of this
proposed rule. This Supplementary Information section is
intended, in part, to elicit comment on a broad range of issues
relevant to the development and implementation of those program
guidelines. </p>

<p> <b>Statement of the Problem</b> </p>

<p> More than half of all individuals brought into the criminal
justice system have substance abuse problems. Many of these
individuals are non-violent offenders who repeatedly cycle
through the court, corrections, and probation systems without
help to change their behavior. The underlying problem of such
non-violent substance abusing offenders frustrates and inhibits
judicial effectiveness. All too often, the non-violent drug
offender faces little certainty of punishment and represents a
long-term, recurring problem for both the criminal justice system
and society. </p>

<p> In too many cases, the criminal justice system fails to
subject non-violent, drug abusing offenders to intervention
measures that provide the mix of services and sanctions necessary
to change their behavior, or if necessary, coerce abstinence.
Some courts and prosecutors, however, have cost-effcctively
addressed the problem through the use of treatment drug courts.
Their results suggest that &quot;drug courts&quot; can
significantly enhance the offender's opportunity to break the
cycle of substance abuse and crime. Those who are coming into
contact with the criminal justice system for the first time may
be particularly susceptible to effective early intervention. </p>

<p> Indeed, research and evaluation demonstrate that the
&quot;drug court&quot; approach is effective in reducing both
drug abuse and drug-related crime. The Drug Court discretionary
grant program of Title V seeks to support the development of
innovative measures that provide courts additional resources to
assure certainty of punishment for drug abusing offenders through
the integrated administration of services and sanctions,
including close supervision and coerced abstinence. </p>

<p> <b>The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994</b>
</p>

<p> The Department of Justice (Department) recognizes that no
single model exists for an effective drug court. To the contrary,
the Department believes there may be a variety of valid
approaches that deal effectively with non-violent offenders with
substance abuse problems. Consequently, the Drug Court grant
program will maintain flexibility in providing funds to support
the development of a variety of initiatives that coordinate
treatment and coerced abstinence. </p>

<p> The Department also recognizes the great diversity in the
structure and operation of state and local courts and criminal
justice systems. Hence, the Department is committed to a flexible
approach that allows jurisdictions to tailor local initiatives to
best suit their needs and local conditions. Program flexibility,
however, is<b> </b>necessarily balanced by statutory requirements
concerning the design and administration of the funded programs.
Accordingly, Drug Court programs that receive grant awards must: </p>

<ul>
    <li>exclude violent offenders from program participation; </li>
    <li>include a long-term strategy and detailed
        implementation.plan; </li>
    <li>explain the applicant's inability to fund the program
        adequately without Federal assistance; </li>
    <li>use Federal support to supplement, and not supplant,
        State, Indian tribal, and local sources of funding that
        would otherwise be available; </li>
    <li>identify related governmental or community initiatives
        which complement or will be coordinated with the
        proposal; </li>
    <li>consult with all affected agencies and insure that there
        will be appropriate coordination with all, affected
        agencies in the implementation of the program; </li>
    <li>certify, that participating offenders will receive
        continuing judicial supervision by one or more designated
        judges with responsibility for the drug court program; </li>
    <li>specify plans for obtaining necessary support and
        continuing the proposed program following the conclusion
        of Federal support; and </li>
    <li>describe the methodology that will be used in evaluating
        the program. </li>
</ul>

<p> Consistent with Congressional intent, program evaluation will
be crucial. Grant recipients will be required to cooperate with a
national evaluation team throughout their involvement with the
program. Recipients will also be required to provide for
independent evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of their
funded programs. The following issues will be especially
important in determining whether programs receiving grants under
this initiative are effective: (1) reduction in recidivism rates
of program participants, (2) maintenance of acceptable substance
abuse treatment completion rates among program participants, (3)
decreased drug use by program participants, and (4) maintenance
of a cost effective program in relation to the overall criminal
justice system. </p>

<p> <b>FY 1995 Drug Court Initiative</b> </p>

<p> The Fiscal Year 1995 Department of Justice Appropriations
Act, Public Law 103-317, has allocated $29 million for the Drug
Court grant programs. Eligibility of applicants to receive grants
will be based on requirements of the statute and these
regulations, as well as assurances and certifications specified
in detailed program guidelines and application materials that
will be available in early 1995 for the Fiscal Year 1995 Drug
Court initiative. </p>

<p> While detailed program guidelines will follow the publication
of this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department has made
some broad programmatic decisions upon which it welcomes comment.
Three types of funding will be available under this program
during Fiscal Year 1995. First, planning funding will be
available for those jurisdictions that express interest in
initiating a drug court but have not engaged in the comprehensive
planning necessary to make such a program successful. Second,
jurisdictions currently operating drug court programs may seek
funding to expand enhalace, or augment these ongoing efforts.
Finally, for those jurisdictions that have engaged (or are
currently engaged) in a comprehensive drug court planning
process, funding may be available to implement the plans their
efforts have produced. </p>

<p> <b>Call For Comments Concerning The Drug Court Initiative</b>
</p>

<p> Substance abuse-related offender case management is primarily
a state and local issue; thus, the Drug Court grant program
contemplates collaboration between federal and state and local
agencies. State and local government officials were involved in
Congressional hearings and meetings that guided the development
of this legislation and will continue to be involved as the
Department moves forward in developing this regulation,
establishing policy guidance, and implementing program
guidelines. At this time, comments are welcome regarding the
basic program design requirements described in Section 93.4 of
the proposed rule and to the entire scope of the program. </p>

<p> <b>Administrative Requirements</b> </p>

<p> This regulation has been drafted and reviewed in accordance
with Executive Order 12866<i>,</i><b> </b> 1 (b), Principles of
Regulation. This rule is not a &quot;significant regulatory
action&quot; under Executive Order 12866, <b></b> 3(f),
Regulatory Planning and Review, and accordingly, this rule has
not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. </p>

<p> The Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice
Programs, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5
U.S.C. S 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation, and by approving
it, certifies that this regulation will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. </p>

<p>THE NATION'S PRISON POPULATION GREW ALMOST 9 PERCENT LAST YEAR
</p>

<p> U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE </p>

<p> ADVANCE FOR RELEASE AT 5 P.M. EDT BJS </p>

<p> WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 9, 1995 202/307-0784 </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The nation's state and federal prisons
had to find room for 83,294 more inmates last year--the second
largest annual increase in history and just 1,470 fewer than the
84,764 increase recorded in 1989. The total number of men and
women in prison last December 31 was 1,053,738--a new record.
Overall, almost 1.5 million people were incarcerated in the
United States in 1994. State and federal prisons, which primarily
hold convicted felons serving longer sentences, contained about
two-thirds of the total. Locally operated jails, which primarily
hold people awaiting trial or serving sentences of a year or
less, held the other third. </p>

<p> At the end of 1994 state prisons held 958,704 men and women
and federal prisons held 95,034 inmates. California (125,605) and
Texas (118,195) together held more than one in every five inmates
in the nation. Seventeen states, each holding fewer than 5,000
inmates, accounted for 4 percent of all prisoners. </p>

<p> Prison populations increased by at least 10 percent in 16
states last year. Texas reported the largest growth (28 percent),
followed by Georgia (20 percent). Alaska and </p>

<p> Connecticut reported fewer prisoners who had been sentenced
to more than a year. </p>

<p> The average sentence length and time served for state
prisoners has remained stable in recent years. Between 1985 and
1992, the years for which comparable data are available, half of
the state prisoners served at least 48 months. </p>

<p> In the federal system, however, the &quot;truth in
sentencing&quot; provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984
have contributed to increasing the median time served in prison
from 15 months in 1986 to 24 months in 1992. </p>

<p> The incarceration rate for prisoners sentenced to more than a
year reached a record 387 per 100,000 U.S. residents last
December 31. States with the highest incarceration rates were
Texas (636 inmates per 100,000 residents), Louisiana (530) and
Oklahoma (508). North Dakota (78) had the lowest, followed by
Minnesota (100) and West Virginia (106). </p>

<p> Since 1980 per capita incarceration rates rose the most in
the South (from 188 to 451) and West (from 105 to 333). The rate
in the Northeast rose from 87 to 285, and the rate in the Midwest
from 109 to 297. </p>

<p> In absolute numbers, violent offenders were the greatest
contributors to state prison inmate growth. Between 1980 and
1993, the number of violent offenders grew by an estimated
221,300, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) estimated using
1993 data. </p>

<p> More than a quarter of the state and federal inmates were in
prison for drug offenses (234,600 prisoners) in 1993. Prisoners
serving a drug sentence increased from 8 percent of the state and
federal prison population in 1980 to 26 percent in 1993. In
federal prisons, inmates sentenced for drug law violations were
the single largest group--60 percent in 1993, up from 25 percent
in 1980. </p>

<p> At the end of the year, states reported they were operating
between 17 percent and 29 percent over capacity, while the
federal system was operating at 25 percent over capacity. </p>

<p> Because of prison construction and the creation of new prison
beds, the ratio of the inmate population to the capacity of state
prisons has remained almost the same since 1990. </p>

<p> The average growth in the number of state and federal
prisoners sentenced to at least a year's incarceration was equal
to the need for 1,542 more beds per week in 1994. </p>

<p> During 1994 almost 5 percent of all state prisoners--48,949
inmates in 21 jurisdictions--were held in local jails or other
facilities because of prison crowding. </p>

<p> The number of female inmates grew 10.6 percent last year,
compared to an 8.5 percent increase among male inmates. On
December 31, 1994, there were 64,403 women in state and federal
prisons--6.1 percent of all prisoners. The rate of incarceration
for inmates serving a sentence of more than a year is 746 males
per 100,000 U.S. male residents, vs. 45 females per 100,000
female population. </p>

<p> Between 1980 and 1993, the number of white and black female
inmates grew at a faster pace than the number of male inmates in
either racial group. During this period the number of white males
grew 163 percent, the number of black males grew 217 percent, the
number of white females 327 percent, and the number of black
females 343 percent. An estimated 1,471 blacks per 100,000 black
residents and 207 whites per 100,000 white residents were
incarcerated in the nation's prisons on December 31, 1993. </p>

<h2>STATE AND FEDERAL PRISON POPULATION TOPS ONE MILLION </h2>

<p> <b>U.S. Department of Justice</b> </p>

<p> <b>Bureau of Justice Statistics</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The nation's prison population exceeds 1
million for the first time in history, the Department of Justice
announced today. At the end of June, 1,012,851 men and women were
incarcerated in state and federal prisons. State prisons held
919,143 inmates and federal prisons held 93,708 inmates.
California (124,813) and Texas (100,136) together accounted for
more than one in five inmates in the country. </p>

<p> The prison population grew by almost 40,000 inmates during
the first half of 1994, the equivalent of more than 1,500 a
week--or three additional 500-bed prisons. </p>

<p> During the last 12 months the prison population expanded by
more than 71,000, the second largest annual increase ever
recorded. This growth was slightly greater than the annual growth
in the preceding 12 months (69,525) and exceeds by 11 percent the
average annual growth (63,793) during the previous five years,
that is from July 1988 to June 1993. </p>

<p> The incarceration rate of state and federal prisoners
sentenced to more than a year reached a record 373 prisoners per
100,000 U.S. residents last June. The states with the highest
incarceration rates were Texas (545 per 100,000), Louisiana
(514), South Carolina (504) and Oklahoma (501). </p>

<p> During the 12 months preceding June 30, 1994, eleven states
recorded prisoner growth rates of 10 percent or more, led by
Connecticut (20 percent), Texas (18 percent), and Tennessee (15
percent). </p>

<p> In the last decade the U.S. prison population doubled on a
per capita basis. During this 10-year period, the incarceration
rate doubled both for white inmates and black inmates. At the end
of last year (the latest available data) there were 1,432 black
inmates per 100,000 black U.S. residents and 203 white inmates
per 100,000 white residents. </p>

<p> During the first six months of 1994, the number of female
inmates grew 6.2 percent, compared to a 3.9 percent increase
among male inmates. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1994, there were 61,872 women in state and
federal prisons--6.1 percent of all prisoners. The male
incarceration rate, 719 per 100,000 male residents, was more than
16 times higher than the female incarceration rate--43 per
100,000 female residents. </p>

<p> The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) collects state and
federal prisoner data twice a year--on June 30 and December 31.
These counts are designed to provide regular updates to the
public on the number of people confined by state and federal
authority. The data have been published since 1926. </p>

<p> The report was prepared by Allen J. Beck and Thomas P.
Bonczar, statisticians in the Department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS). Data from tables and graphs used in many BJS
reports can be obtained in spreadsheet files on 5 1/4 and 3 1/2

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C. -- More than 5.1 million Americans-or almost
2.7 percent of the adult population--were under some form of
correctional supervision last year, the Department of Justice
reported today. Almost three-quarters of these men and women were
being supervised in the community on probation or parole. The
others were confined in jail or prison. </p>

<p> The number of adults incarcerated or under supervision in the
community increased 3.9 percent during 1994. Since 1980 the
number has almost tripled, growing at an average annual rate of
7.6 percent. </p>

<p> At the end of last year, 2,962,000 adults were on probation
under community supervision rather than incarceration. An
additional 690,000 adults were on parole--conditional supervised
release after serving a prison term but subject to being returned
to incarceration for rule violations or other offenses.
Three-quarters of probationers and parolees were required to
maintain regular contact with a supervising agency. The other
offenders were not required to have regular contact (9 percent)
or had failed to report and could not be located (9 percent). </p>

<p> Texas had the largest number of adults on probation and
parole with more than 503,000 under such supervision, followed by
California with 370,000. At the end of 1994, more than 3.8
percent of all adults in Texas were on probation or parole. </p>

<p> Thirteen states reported that fewer than 1 percent of their
adult populations were on probation or parole. North Dakota had
the lowest probation and parole supervision rate (450 offenders
per 100,000 adults), followed by West Virginia (517), Mississippi
(552) and Kentucky (553). </p>

<p> Overall, the state and federal probation and parole
populations rose by 2.0 percent during 1994. Six states reported
increases of at least 10 percent in their probation populations,
and 11 reported similar increases in their parole populations.
Alabama, with a 14.5 percent rise in their probation population,
and Iowa, with a 27.1 percent rise in the parole population, led
the nation. </p>

<p> Twelve states and the Federal probation system reported a
decrease in the number of adults on probation, led by South
Dakota (down 6.2 percent), California (down 5.8 percent) and the
Federal system (down 6.8 percent). </p>

<p> Half of all offenders on probation in 1994 were on probation
for a felony. A quarter were on probation for a misdemeanor. One
of every seven probationers had been convicted of driving while
intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol. Almost all of the
offenders on parole (95 percent) had served a felony sentence in
jail or prison. </p>

<p> Approximately, 21 percent of the nation's probationers were
women, as were 10 percent of the parolees. </p>

<p> About 58 percent of the adults on probation were white, and
45 percent were black. Ninety percent of adults on parole were
men. Fifty-one percent of adults on parole were white, 45 percent
were black. </p>

<p> These data were collected and analyzed by Darrell Gilliard

<p> A LEMAS Report </p>

<p> By Brian A. Reaves, Ph.D. </p>

<p> BJS Statistician </p>

<p> In 1990, about 9,300 local police departments and 2,500
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments had primary responsibility for the enforcement of
drug laws. </p>

<p> Collectively, these agencies employed 466,000 full-time
officers, 92% of </p>

<p> all local police and sheriffs' officers nationwide. In
addition, 34 State </p>

<p> police departments, employing 43,000 officers, had primary
drug enforcement </p>

<p> responsibilities. </p>

<p> This report presents information collected from State and
local law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies with primary drug enforcement
responsibilities. It </p>

<p> includes information on types of illegal drugs seized,
operation of special </p>

<p> drug units, multi-agency task force participation, and
receipts from drug </p>

<p> asset forfeiture programs. </p>

<p> For all agencies the report also summarizes how drug testing
policies apply </p>

<p> to arrestees, applicants for sworn positions, and employees. </p>

<p> Major findings include the following: </p>

<p> *Among agencies with primary drug enforcement
responsibilities that served </p>

<p> 50,000 or more residents, over 90% of the police departments
and over 80% </p>

<p> of the sheriffs' departments operated special drug
enforcement units. </p>

<p> *Nationwide, more than 16,000 local police and sheriffs'
officers, and over </p>

<p> 2,000 State police officers were assigned full time to
special drug units. </p>

<p> *Half of local police and sheriffs' departments with primary
drug </p>

<p> enforcement responsibilities were participating in a
multi-agency drug </p>

<p> enforcement task force. These 6,500 agencies had assigned
nearly 10,000 </p>

<p> officers full time to such task forces. </p>

<p> *Among departments with primary drug enforcement
responsibilities, over 90% </p>

<p> of the police departments serving a population of 50,000 or
more, and over </p>

<p> 90% of the sheriffs' departments serving 250,000 or more
residents, </p>

<p> received money or goods from a drug asset forfeiture program.
</p>

<p> *Among the State police departments with primary drug
enforcement </p>

<p> responsibilities, 85% operated a special drug unit, 91%
participated in a </p>

<p> multi-agency drug enforcement task force, and 94% received
money or goods </p>

<p> from drug asset forfeitures. </p>

<p> *About 2 in 3 State police departments and 2 in 5 local
police and </p>

<p> sheriffs' departments reported that at least some of the
persons they </p>

<p> arrested were required to take a test for illegal drugs. </p>

<p> *A majority of State police departments and local police
departments </p>

<p> serving a population of 25,000 or more required that all
applicants for </p>

<p> sworn positions take a test for illegal drugs. </p>

<p> *About 3% of local law enforcement officers worked for
agencies that had a </p>

<p> mandatory drug testing program for regular field officers;
17% were </p>

<p> employed by agencies that had a random selection testing
program for </p>

<p> officers. </p>

<p> *Nonprobationary officers could be dismissed after one
positive test in </p>

<p> about two-thirds of local police and sheriffs' departments
and in about </p>

<p> three-fourths of State police departments. Nearly all
departments had a </p>

<p> policy specifying dismissal for two positive drug tests. </p>

<p> *Treatment alternatives were a part of the drug testing
policy for </p>

<p> employees in about half of State and local police departments
and two- </p>

<p> fifths of sheriffs' departments. Such alternatives were
generally limited </p>

<p> to the first positive test results only. </p>

<p> THE LEMAS SURVEY </p>

<p> The 1990 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics (LEMAS) </p>

<p> survey questionnaire was mailed to all 780 State and local
law enforcement </p>

<p> agencies with 100 or more sworn officers and to a sample of
2,338 agencies </p>

<p> with fewer than 100 officers. Of the 3,118 agencies receiving
the LEMAS </p>

<p> questionnaire, 2,945 (94.5%) responded. The survey used a
sampling frame </p>

<p> based on personnel data from the 1986 Directory Survey of Law
Enforcement </p>

<p> Agencies. (See Methodology for further discussion of
sampling.) </p>

<p> The local police departments included in this report are
general purpose </p>

<p> agencies operated by municipal or county governments. The
State police </p>

<p> departments included in this report are the primary general
purpose </p>

<p> agencies in all States except Hawaii, which does not have a
State police </p>

<p> department. </p>

<p> This report presents only data collected on drug-related
policies. The BJS </p>

<p> Bulletins State and Local Police Departments, 1990
(NCJ-133284) and </p>

<p> Sheriffs' Departments, 1990 (NCJ-133283) present other data
collected in </p>

<p> the LEMAS survey. </p>

<p> The first section of this report, on drug enforcement
activities, includes </p>

<p> only agencies with primary drug enforcement responsibilities.
Agencies </p>

<p> involved in drug enforcement only in a backup capacity, or
those whose </p>

<p> responsibilities are limited to traffic enforcement, jail
operation, court </p>

<p> operations or other such duties are not included. The second
section, on </p>

<p> drug testing policies, includes all local police, sheriffs',
and State </p>

<p> police departments. </p>

<p> Drug enforcement activities </p>

<p> State and local law enforcement agencies made an estimated
1.1 million </p>

<p> arrests for drug law violations during 1990, according to the
Uniform Crime </p>

<p> Reports (UCR) of the FBI. Excluding traffic violations, 1 in
every 13 </p>

<p> arrests made during the year was for a drug-related offense. </p>

<p> Local police and sheriffs' departments </p>

<p> During 1990, 77% of the Nation's local police and sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> reported they had primary responsibility for the enforcement
of drug laws </p>

<p> in areas under their jurisdiction. These 11,800 agencies
employed 466,000 </p>

<p> full-time officers, 92% of all local officers nationwide. </p>

<p> Over 9,000 local police departments, employing 96% of all
local police </p>

<p> officers, reported they had primary drug enforcement
responsibilities. </p>

<p> Nearly all of the police departments in jurisdictions of
10,000 or more in </p>

<p> population had such responsibilities. These 2,800 departments
employed </p>

<p> approximately 300,000 full-time officers. Departments in
towns with a </p>

<p> population of 2,500 to 9,999 (83%), or a population less than
2,500 (60%), </p>

<p> were less likely to have primary drug enforcement
responsibilities. These </p>

<p> 6,500 departments in smaller communities employed about
46,000 officers. </p>

<p> About 2,500 (81%) of the sheriffs' departments nationwide
reported having </p>

<p> primary drug enforcement responsibilities in 1990. Sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> located in jurisdictions with a population of under 100,000
were somewhat </p>

<p> more likely to have drug enforcement responsibilities than
those in larger </p>

<p> jurisdictions (83% versus 65%); however, the departments
serving a </p>

<p> population of 100,000 or more employed more officers than
those in smaller </p>

<p> jurisdictions (77,000 versus 42,000). </p>

<p> Local police and sheriffs' departments with primary drug
enforcement </p>

<p> responsibilities seized numerous types of illegal drugs
during the 12-month </p>

<p> period ending on June 30, 1990. Across all categories,
departments in </p>

<p> larger jurisdictions were more likely to have seized each
type of drug than </p>

<p> those in smaller jurisdictions. </p>

<p> Most of the police and sheriffs' departments serving a
population of 50,000 </p>

<p> or more seized nearly all of the types of drugs asked about
in the survey. </p>

<p> In the smallest jurisdictions, marijuana and cocaine were the
only drugs </p>

<p> seized by more than a third of all departments, and only
marijuana was </p>

<p> seized by more than half. </p>

<p> Eighty-six percent of local police depart-ments and 94% of
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments made seizures of marijuana--higher percentages
than for any </p>

<p> other drug. The percentage of departments making marijuana
seizures was </p>

<p> 94% or higher for departments in all population categories,
except for </p>

<p> sheriffs' departments serving a population of 10,000 or less
(88%) and </p>

<p> police departments serving a population of 2,500 or less
(70%). </p>

<p> According to UCR data for 1990, 30% of all arrests for drug
law violations </p>

<p> were marijuana-related. About 4 in 5 marijuana arrests were
for </p>

<p> possession, and the remainder, for offenses related to
trafficking. </p>

<p> Cocaine was seized by 72% of local police and sheriffs'
departments, the </p>

<p> second highest total percentage for any drug type. All police
departments </p>

<p> serving a population of 100,000 or more, and over 90% of
those serving </p>

<p> 10,000 to 99,999 residents, reported making seizures of
cocaine. Over 95% </p>

<p> of the sheriffs' departments serving 50,000 or more residents
reported </p>

<p> making seizures of cocaine. Only among police departments
serving under </p>

<p> 2,500 residents (39%), and sheriffs' departments serving
under 10,000 </p>

<p> residents (50%) did less than 75% of the departments in a
population </p>

<p> category report making cocaine seizures. Among police and
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments that did seize cocaine, nearly all of them
reported seizing the </p>

<p> powdered form of the drug, and a majority of them also seized
crack </p>

<p> cocaine. </p>

<p> A majority of the police departments serving a population of
25,000 or more </p>

<p> made heroin seizures, including all of those serving 500,000
or more </p>

<p> residents. More than two-thirds of the sheriffs' departments
in </p>

<p> jurisdictions with a population of 250,000 or more also
reported seizing </p>

<p> heroin. </p>

<p> Amphetamine seizures were made by 40% of all police and
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments, including more than 70% of those serving a
population of </p>

<p> 50,000 or more. More than half of the departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> 50,000 or more also reported making seizures of barbiturates,
methampheta- </p>

<p> mines, and LSD. PCP was seized by most of the police
departments serving a </p>

<p> population of 250,000 or more and the sheriffs' departments
serving 500,000 </p>

<p> or more. An aspect of the drug enforcement effort in many
jurisdictions </p>

<p> involves the operation of special drug enforcement units.
Where they </p>

<p> exist, such units are an integral part of the law enforcement
response to </p>

<p> drug trafficking and use. Since they focus directly on
conducting </p>

<p> sophisticated investigations of drug traffickers, these
special units </p>

<p> accumulate substantial knowledge about drugs in general and
about drug- </p>

<p> related activity in the community. </p>

<p> Nationwide, an estimated 3,270 local police and sheriffs'
departments were </p>

<p> operating a special drug unit during the 12-month period
ending on June 30, </p>

<p> 1990 (table 3). Overall, these agencies had over 16,000
officers assigned </p>

<p> to special drug units on a full-time basis. Included in this
total were an </p>

<p> estimated 12,715 police officers and 3,805 sheriffs'
officers. </p>

<p> Over 90% of local police departments serving 50,000 or more
residents were </p>

<p> operating a special drug unit, and 75% of all local police
officers </p>

<p> assigned to a drug unit nationwide were in one of these
departments. </p>

<p> Police departments serving 1 million or more residents had
the largest </p>

<p> special drug units, an average of 240 full-time officers
each. These 13 </p>

<p> departments accounted for a fourth of the local police
officers assigned to </p>

<p> drug units nationwide. </p>

<p> A majority (62%) of the police departments in jurisdictions
with 25,000 to </p>

<p> 49,999 residents also operated a special drug unit. Local
police </p>

<p> departments in small towns were the least likely to operate a
special drug </p>

<p> unit. About 19% of those serving a population of 2,500 to
9,999 and 5% of </p>

<p> those serving a population of under 2,500 had such a unit. </p>

<p> Among sheriffs' departments, over 90% of those serving a
population of </p>

<p> 500,000 or more and over 75% of those serving a population of
50,000 to </p>

<p> 499,999 operated a special drug unit. About 44% of the
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments serving a population of 25,000 to 49,999 operated
a drug unit. </p>

<p> In the smallest jurisdictions (under 10,000 residents), 11%
of the </p>

<p> sheriffs' departments had a drug unit. </p>

<p> The average size of special drug units in sheriffs'
departments ranged from </p>

<p> 34 full-time officers in departments serving a population of
1 million or </p>

<p> more to 1 officer in jurisdictions with fewer than 10,000
residents. </p>

<p> Many local police and sheriffs' departments operated other
types of special </p>

<p> units that were important to their drug control effort. Over
90% of large </p>

<p> police and sheriffs' departments (100 or more officers) with
primary drug </p>

<p> enforcement responsibilities operated a special unit for drug
education in </p>

<p> schools during 1990, and nearly 60% were operating a special
unit on gangs. </p>

<p> Law enforcement agencies recognize the value of coordinating
their efforts </p>

<p> to reduce drug abuse. For many police and sheriffs'
departments, this </p>

<p> coordination involves participating in a multiagency drug
enforcement task </p>

<p> force. Organizationally, such task forces often involve the
cooperation of </p>

<p> law enforcement agencies across jurisdictional boundaries and
governmental </p>

<p> levels. </p>

<p> The police and sheriffs' departments in multiagency task
forces develop </p>

<p> coordinated enforcement strategies aimed at accumulating the
evidence </p>

<p> needed to arrest, prosecute, and convict known drug
distributors. </p>

<p> Typically, these strategies involve the use of informants,
surveillance, </p>

<p> and undercover operations. They may also include complex
financial </p>

<p> investigations designed to trace drug distribution networks.
The resources </p>

<p> of special drug units often play an important role in
implementing task </p>

<p> force strategies. Multiagency drug task forces may also
attempt to reduce </p>

<p> problems associated with the illegal drug trade by including
not only law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies but also other types of government
agencies, nonprofit </p>

<p> organizations, business firms, and community groups. By
coordinating </p>

<p> education and health initiatives these task forces attempt to
reduce the </p>

<p> harm that illegal drugs do to the community. </p>

<p> Among agencies with drug enforcement responsibilities, about
half of the </p>

<p> local police departments and two-thirds of the sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> participated in a task force during the 12-month period
ending on June 30, </p>

<p> 1990. Overall, an estimated 6,500 local police and sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> participated in multiagency drug enforcement task forces
during this time </p>

<p> period. </p>

<p> Over 85% of the police and sheriffs' departments in each
population </p>

<p> category of 100,000 or more participated in a task force,
including over </p>

<p> 95% of the departments serving a population of 500,000 or
more. </p>

<p> Approximately 80% of the police and sheriffs' departments
serving a </p>

<p> population of 25,000 to 99,999, 65% of those serving a
population of 10,000 </p>

<p> to 24,999, and over 40% of those serving fewer than 10,000
residents </p>

<p> participated in a task force. </p>

<p> During the 12-month period ending June 30, 1990,
approximately 6,100 local </p>

<p> police officers were assigned to a multiagency drug task
force full time. </p>

<p> Although police departments serving a million or more
residents had the </p>

<p> most officers assigned to a task force on average (29), over
half of all </p>

<p> local police officers assigned to task forces nationwide were
employed by </p>

<p> departments serving a population of under 25,000. </p>

<p> Sheriffs' departments had about 3,500 officers assigned full
time to drug </p>

<p> task forces, ranging from an average of 10 officers per
department in </p>

<p> jurisdictions with 1 million or more residents, to an average
of 1 officer </p>

<p> per department in jurisdictions with fewer than 50,000
residents. </p>

<p> In addition to multiagency task forces, another innovation
for drug </p>

<p> enforcement in many jurisdictions is the use of drug asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> sanctions. Most States have laws that allow the government to
seize </p>

<p> convicted drug traffickers' cash, bank accounts, planes,
boats, cars, </p>

<p> homes, and other items purchased with proceeds from the
illicit drug trade. </p>

<p> State laws vary regarding the disposition of forfeited
assets. Most State </p>

<p> statutes require that outstanding liens be paid first, and
many States </p>

<p> require that all forfeited drug assets go to the State and/or
local </p>

<p> treasury. In some States, law enforcement agencies may keep
property such </p>

<p> as cars, planes, and boats for official use. In other States,
the agencies </p>

<p> can keep all property, cash, and proceeds from sales of what
is forfeited. </p>

<p> About 4,700 local police and sheriffs' departments reported
the receipt of </p>

<p> money or goods from a drug asset forfeiture program during
fiscal 1990. </p>

<p> This represented 41% of all local law enforcement agencies
with primary </p>

<p> drug enforcement responsibilities. A higher percentage of
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments (51%) than police departments (38%) had such
receipts. </p>

<p> The percentage of local police departments with asset
forfeiture receipts </p>

<p> was over 95% in jurisdictions with 50,000 to 999,999
residents. Among </p>

<p> departments serving 1 million or more residents and those
serving 25,000 to </p>

<p> 49,999 residents, about 85% received money or goods from an
asset </p>

<p> forfeiture program. Receiving money or goods from an asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> program was least likely for police departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> under 2,500 (11%). </p>

<p> About 95% of sheriffs' departments in jurisdictions with
250,000 or more </p>

<p> residents, and about 85% of those serving 50,000 to 249,999
residents had </p>

<p> asset forfeiture pro-gram receipts during fiscal 1990. In the
smallest </p>

<p> jurisdictions (under 10,000 residents), an estimated 27% of
the sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments received money or goods from an asset forfeiture
program. </p>

<p> State police departments </p>

<p> Thirty-four State police departments, employing approximately
43,000 full- </p>

<p> time officers, reported they had primary responsibility for
the enforcement </p>

<p> of drug laws. </p>

<p> Number of Full-time </p>

<p> State police sworn officers </p>

<p> departments employed </p>

<p> Total 49 52,372 </p>

<p> Departments with </p>

<p> primary responsibility </p>

<p> for drug enforcement 34 43,118 </p>

<p> All 34 of these departments reported they made marijuana and
cocaine </p>

<p> seizures during the 12-month period ending June 30, 1990
(table 6). A </p>

<p> large majority of them also seized amphetamines (94%), heroin
(91%), LSD </p>

<p> (88%), methamphetamines (88%), barbiturates (85%), and PCP
(74%). </p>

<p> Like those of local law enforcement agencies, State police
drug enforcement </p>

<p> strategies often involve the operation of special units,
participation in </p>

<p> multiagency drug enforcement task forces, and participation
in a drug asset </p>

<p> forfeiture program. </p>

<p> Twenty-nine (85%) of the State police departments that had
responsibility </p>

<p> for enforcing drug laws were operating special drug
enforcement units. </p>

<p> These 29 departments had assigned a total of 2,138 officers
to these units </p>

<p> on a full-time basis--an average of 74 officers per
department. </p>

<p> Most of these departments (82%) also operated special units
for drug </p>

<p> education in schools, and 29% of them had special units for
gangs. </p>

<p> Thirty-one of the departments (91%) participated in a
multiagency drug </p>

<p> enforcement task force during fiscal 1990. These departments
had 900 </p>

<p> officers assigned to drug task forces, an average of 29 per
department. </p>

<p> All but two of the departments (94%) responsible for drug
enforcement </p>

<p> reported they received money or goods from a drug asset
forfeiture program </p>

<p> during the year. </p>

<p> Drug testing policies </p>

<p> Local police and sheriffs' departments </p>

<p> Nearly 40% of local police and sheriffs' departments reported
that at least </p>

<p> some of their arrestees were tested for illegal drugs. Drug
testing of </p>

<p> arrestees was most likely to exist in police departments
serving a </p>

<p> population of 500,000 or more (56%) and in sheriffs'
departments serving a </p>

<p> population of 1 million or more (60%). </p>

<p> Among local police departments that reported testing of
arrestees, about 1 </p>

<p> in 8 were responsible for operation of the testing program.
In sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments with arrestee testing, about 1 in 4 operated the
testing </p>

<p> program. </p>

<p> About a fourth of both local police and sheriffs' departments
required all </p>

<p> applicants for sworn positions to submit to a drug test. The
prevalence of </p>

<p> drug testing of applicants increased with the size of the
population </p>

<p> served. Among local police departments, 80% of those serving
a population </p>

<p> of 250,000 or more required all applicants for sworn
positions to be tested </p>

<p> for illegal drugs. About 70% of those serving a population of
50,000 to </p>

<p> 249,999 and just under 50% of those serving a population of
10,000 to </p>

<p> 49,999 had such a requirement. The percentage of police
departments with a </p>

<p> mandatory drug testing policy for applicants was smallest
among those </p>

<p> serving 2,500 to 9,999 residents (25%) and those serving
fewer than 2,500 </p>

<p> residents (14%). </p>

<p> Slightly more than 40% of sheriffs' departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> 100,000 or more had a policy requiring drug testing of all
applicants for </p>

<p> sworn positions. About 30% of departments serving from 25,000
to 100,000 </p>

<p> residents had such a policy. Sheriffs' departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> less than 25,000 (15%) were the least likely to require all
applicants for </p>

<p> sworn positions to undergo tests for illegal drugs. </p>

<p> Small percentages of all local police and sheriffs'
departments had a </p>

<p> mandatory drug testing requirement for probationary officers,
regular field </p>

<p> officers, candidates for promotion, officers in drug-related
positions, or </p>

<p> civilian personnel. In every population category, less than
25% of the </p>

<p> police and sheriffs' departments had mandatory drug testing
for the above </p>

<p> personnel types, except the following: Probationary officers
and officers </p>

<p> in drug-related positions in police departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> 500,000 or more. </p>

<p> Small percentages of local police and sheriff's departments
were also using </p>

<p> random selection to test applicants or employees for illegal
drugs. An </p>

<p> estimated 2% of all departments tested applicants through
this method, and </p>

<p> the percentage of departments with random drug testing was no
more than 5% </p>

<p> for any personnel position. Random selection testing was most
common for </p>

<p> officers in drug-related positions employed by police
departments serving a </p>

<p> population of 1 million or more (36%). </p>

<p> About 10% of all local police and sheriffs' departments
required regular </p>

<p> field officers suspected of using illegal drugs to take a
drug test. The </p>

<p> percentage of departments with suspicion-based testing was
similar for </p>

<p> other types of employees. About 2% of the departments had
such a policy </p>

<p> for applicants. </p>

<p> Departments in larger jurisdictions were more likely than
those in smaller </p>

<p> jurisdictions to have a suspicion-based drug testing program.
For example, </p>

<p> among local police departments, about two-thirds of local
police </p>

<p> departments serving 250,000 or more residents authorized
testing of regular </p>

<p> field officers suspected of drug use, compared to about half
of those </p>

<p> serving a population of 50,000 to 249,999, about a third of
those serving a </p>

<p> population of 25,000 to 49,999, and a ninth of those serving
population of </p>

<p> 2,500 to 9,999. In police departments serving a population of
under 2,500, </p>

<p> roughly 1 in 30 authorized testing of regular field officers
suspected of </p>

<p> illegal drug use. </p>

<p> About 40% of the sheriffs' departments serving a population
of 1 million or </p>

<p> more had a policy authorizing testing of regular field
officers suspected </p>

<p> of illegal drug use. About 30% of the departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> 500,000 to 999,999, and 20% of those serving a population of
100,000 to </p>

<p> 499,999 had such a policy. Less than 10% of the sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> located in jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents
had a policy </p>

<p> that authorized drug testing of officers suspected of drug
use. </p>

<p> Nationwide, the local police departments that had a
suspicion-based drug </p>

<p> testing program for regular field officers employed 50% of
all local police </p>

<p> officers. The sheriffs' departments with such a testing
program employed </p>

<p> 31% of all sheriff's officers. An estimated 17% of all local
police </p>

<p> officers and 12% of sheriffs' officers worked for departments
that had a </p>

<p> random selection program for regular field officers. About 3%
of local </p>

<p> police officers and 4% of sheriffs' officers were employed by
departments </p>

<p> that had a mandatory drug testing requirement for field
officers. </p>

<p> Local police departments that tested civilian employees
suspected of drug </p>

<p> use employed 45% of all such employees nationwide. About 30%
of civilian </p>

<p> employees in sheriffs' departments worked in department with
a suspicion- </p>

<p> based testing program for civilians. </p>

<p> Civilian employees in sheriffs' departments were more likely
to be a part </p>

<p> of a random selection drug testing program than their
counterparts in local </p>

<p> police departments (9% versus 3%). About 5% of the civilian
employees in </p>

<p> local police and sheriffs' departments were subject to a
mandatory drug </p>

<p> testing requirement. </p>

<p> For comparison, the results of a 1988 survey conducted by the
Department of </p>

<p> Labor showed that 3% of private nonagricultural businesses
had a drug </p>

<p> testing program of some type, including 43% of those with
1,000 or more </p>

<p> employees. Overall, about 20% of private sector employees
worked for a </p>

<p> company with a drug testing program. (Bureau of Labor
Statistics, Survey </p>

<p> of Employer Anti-drug Programs, Report 760, January 1990.) </p>

<p> Among local law enforcement agencies with an employee drug
testing program, </p>

<p> an estimated 61% of the police departments and 69% of the
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments specified dismissal as a possible disciplinary
sanction against </p>

<p> nonprobationary officers after one positive drug test. </p>

<p> Local police officers testing positive for the first time
were most likely </p>

<p> to face dismissal as a possible sanction in larger
jurisdictions. All </p>

<p> police departments serving a population of 1 million or more
had a policy </p>

<p> specifying dismissal as a possible sanction after one
positive drug test, </p>

<p> and 83% of those serving a population of 250,000 to 999,999
had such a </p>

<p> policy. </p>

<p> Suspension was the most serious disciplinary sanction
specified for an </p>

<p> initial positive drug test in 14% of the police and sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> that tested employees for illegal drugs. </p>

<p> After a second positive drug test by a nonprobationary
officer, the </p>

<p> percentage of local law enforcement agencies specifying
dismissal as the </p>

<p> most serious disciplinary sanction increased to 93% for
police departments </p>

<p> and to 98% for sheriffs' departments. </p>

<p> Treatment was specified as a possible alternative for
nonprobationary </p>

<p> officers with positive drug test results in almost half of
the local police </p>

<p> and sheriffs' departments with a testing program. The drug
testing </p>

<p> policies of local police departments specified treatment
alternatives more </p>

<p> often than those of sheriffs' departments (49% versus 39%).
Treatment </p>

<p> alternatives were generally limited to the first offense. </p>

<p> Among police departments, treatment alternatives were most
likely to exist </p>

<p> in jurisdictions with a population of 50,000 to 249,999,
where two-thirds </p>

<p> of them had such a policy. Among sheriffs' departments, those
serving </p>

<p> 500,000 to 999,999 residents (62%) were the most likely to
have treatment </p>

<p> alternatives specified in their drug testing policy. </p>

<p> Police departments serving a population of 1 million or more
(20%) were the </p>

<p> least likely of all local law enforcement agencies to specify
treatment as </p>

<p> a possible alternative for officers who test positive for
drugs. </p>

<p> State police departments </p>

<p> Thirty-three (67%) of the 49 primary State police departments
reported that </p>

<p> at least some of the persons they arrested were being tested
for illegal </p>

<p> drugs. Four (8%) of the departments reported that they had
primary </p>

<p> responsibility for operation of the testing program. </p>

<p> Percent of departments </p>

<p> in which at least some </p>

<p> arrestees are tested </p>

<p> Total 67% </p>

<p> Agency-operated </p>

<p> program 8 </p>

<p> Not agency-operated 59 </p>

<p> Just over half (55%) of State police departments reported
they required </p>

<p> drug tests of all applicants for sworn positions. Two (4%) of
the </p>

<p> departments reported they required all regular field officers
to undergo </p>

<p> tests for illegal drugs, and five (10%) tested all officers
working in </p>

<p> drug-related positions. None of the State police departments
reported </p>

<p> having a mandatory drug testing policy for civilian
personnel. </p>

<p> Some State police departments used a random selection process
to test </p>

<p> probationary officers (12%), regular field officers (8%),
candidates for </p>

<p> promotion (8%), and officers working in drug-related
positions (10%). One </p>

<p> department (2%) had a random selection drug testing program
for applicants, </p>

<p> and two departments (4%) required civilian personnel to be
included in a </p>

<p> random selection drug testing program. </p>

<p> Although no State police departments had a mandatory drug
testing </p>

<p> requirement for civilian employees, nearly half (45%) of all
civilian State </p>

<p> police employees worked in departments that tested civilian
employees </p>

<p> suspected of using illegal drugs. A similar proportion of
sworn State </p>

<p> police employees (53%) were subject to suspicion-based drug
testing. About </p>

<p> 7% of State police officers were employed by departments with
random </p>

<p> selection testing for regular field officers and an equal
percentage worked </p>

<p> in departments with a mandatory drug testing requirement for
such officers. </p>

<p> About three-fourths (77%) of the State police departments
with a drug </p>

<p> testing program specified dismissal as a possible sanction
against </p>

<p> probationary officers after one positive drug test. After a
second </p>

<p> offense, dismissal was a possible sanction specified by 91%
of the </p>

<p> departments. </p>

<p> Half of the departments with employee drug testing specified
treatment as a </p>

<p> possible alternative after the first offense. As in local law
enforcement </p>

<p> agencies, treatment alternatives were generally not available
to State </p>

<p> police officers who tested positive for drugs a second time. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> The Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics
(LEMAS) survey </p>

<p> collects data from a nationally representative sample of the
nearly 17,000 </p>

<p> publicly funded State and local law enforcement agencies in
the United </p>

<p> States. </p>

<p> All 780 State and local law enforcement agencies in the
United States with </p>

<p> 100 or more sworn officers (as reported in the 1986 Directory
Survey of Law </p>

<p> Enforcement Agencies) received the full-length LEMAS
questionnaire. The </p>

<p> 780 self-representing (SR) agencies were supplemented by a
nationally </p>

<p> representative sample of all agencies with fewer than 100
sworn officers. </p>

<p> These nonself-representing (NSR) agencies were chosen using a
stratified </p>

<p> random sample with cells based on the type of agency (local
police, </p>

<p> sheriff, or special police), size of population served, and
number of sworn </p>

<p> officers. The 2,338 NSR agencies received a slightly
abbreviated LEMAS </p>

<p> questionnaire, which did not contain items about job
classifications, </p>

<p> residency requirements, special pay, collective bargaining,
police </p>

<p> membership organizations, special units, or written policy
directives. </p>

<p> The initial mailing of the survey questionnaire was conducted
in July 1990. </p>

<p> The pay period containing June 15, 1990, was used as the
reference date for </p>

<p> personnel-related questions and June 30, 1990, for other
questions. The </p>

<p> data were collected by the Bureau of the Census for the
Bureau of Justice </p>

<p> Statistics. </p>

<p> After two followup mailings and additional telephone calls as
needed, a </p>

<p> final total of 2,945 agencies responded to the LEMAS
questionnaire, </p>

<p> including 738 SR agencies and 2,207 NSR agencies. The overall
response </p>

<p> rate was 94.5%. The final data-base includes responses from
1,830 local </p>

<p> police departments, 840 sheriffs' departments, 226 special
police </p>

<p> departments, and the 49 primary State police departments. </p>

<p> The base weight for all SR agencies is 1. For NSR local and
special police </p>

<p> departments, the base weight is 8.128, and for NSR sheriffs'
departments it </p>

<p> is 4.09857. The final weight associated with every agency,
both SR and </p>

<p> NSR, is the product of the base weight and a factor that
adjusted for any </p>

<p> nonresponding agencies in each sample cell. This agency
nonresponse factor </p>

<p> was based on number of sworn officers for SR agencies and on
number of </p>

<p> agencies for NSR agencies. </p>

<p> Some responding agencies did not completely answer the LEMAS
questionnaire. </p>

<p> When an agency did not supply a response to an item, a donor
agency was </p>

<p> randomly selected from responding agencies in the same sample
cell. The </p>

<p> donor agency's value for the item was placed into the
nonresponding </p>

<p> agency's response field with an indicator that the value had
been imputed. </p>

<p> Complete documentation regarding sampling procedures and
non-response </p>

<p> adjustments is available upon request. </p>

<p> Because the data from agencies with fewer than 100 sworn
personnel were </p>

<p> collected from a sample, the results are subject to sampling
error. All </p>

<p> statements of comparison in this report have been tested to
ensure that </p>

<p> observed differences between values are significant at 2
standard errors </p>

<p> (the 95-percent confidence level) or higher. </p>

<h2>Systemwide Strategies To Alleviate Jail Crowding </h2>

<p> <img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> <b>Andy Hall</b> </p>

<p> <b>U.S. Department of Justice</b> </p>

<p> <b>National Institute of Justice</b> </p>

<p> <b>January 1987</b> </p>

<p> The words &quot;jail&quot; and &quot;crowding&quot; seem
inseparable these days. A 1983 National Institute of Justice
survey of more than 1,400 criminal justice officials from all
parts of the country identified jail and prison crowding as the
most serious problem facing criminal justice systems.(1) </p>

<p> The reality of more prisoners than available beds creates a
dilemma for local justice officials. Crowded jails may compromise
public safety through a lack of space to confine those who pose
serious threats to the community. Lawsuits challenging crowded
conditions may constrain a community's ability to incarcerate, </p>

<p> A recent Bureau of Justice Statistics <i>Bulletin </i>notes
that 22 percent (134) of the Nation's 621 largest jails (those
with a capacity of more than 100) were under court order in 1984
to expand capacity or reduce the number of inmates housed, and 24
percent (150)<i> </i>were under court order to improve one or
more conditions of confinement. (2) </p>

<p> Building or expanding facilities is often necessary to house
those who must be incarcerated. The time and costs of
construction and operation of new institutions, however, argue
that other options should not be overlooked. (3) </p>

<p> For the local sheriff or jail administrator, jail crowding
creates increased prisoner and staff tensions, increased wear and
tear of facility and equipment, budgetary problems from overtime
staffing, and an inability to meet program and service standards.
Less frequently recognized are the problems crowding creates for
other justice system officials: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Judges, prosecutors, probation and parole, and other
        officials often find crowding a severe constraint in
        cases where jailing offenders appears necessary but space
        is unavailable. </li>
    <li>Prosecutors, public defenders, and pretrial services
        officers find their functions impaired by delayed access
        to inmates caused by difficulty in processing large
        numbers of offenders. </li>
    <li>Court functions overall may suffer when crowding affects
        the movement of inmates to and from scheduled
        appearances. </li>
</ul>

<p> Too often, however, agencies outside jail management are not
fully involved in efforts to cope with the problem. </p>

<p> Many jurisdictions address the symptoms of jail crowding but
leave the underlying causes unaddressed. Other jurisdictions,
however, view jail crowding as a problem that demands the
cooperative involvement of all key figures in the local justice
system. </p>

<p> Given the success of this <i>systemwide </i>approach in a
number of locations, the National Institute of Justice sponsored
development of <i>Alleviating Jail Crowding: A Systems
Perspective </i>(NCJ 99462, 1985), based on a survey of justice
system officials and programs throughout the United States. The
report stresses that while construction of new facilities may be
part of a community's solution to crowding, emphasis must also be
placed on ensuring that existing bed space is used effectively.
Accordingly, the report highlights the role of each local
criminal justice agency in ensuring the effective use of jail bed
space to prevent crime and maintain public safety. This <i>Research
in Brief </i>summarizes the full report. </p>

<p> <b>Looking at the local justice system</b> </p>

<p> Virtually every decisionmaker in the local justice system
exercises discretion that can affect the jail population.
Jurisdictions using a systemwide approach to jail crowding see
the local justice system as a screening mechanism that can be
modified to enhance the use of scarce jail space. </p>

<p> These jurisdictions develop case-processing flowcharts to
understand the details of their case-handling process from the
initial contact to final disposition. Flowchart, illustrate the
stages of the legal process, specify the points at which
decisionmaker actions affect the jail population, and identify
opportunities to alleviate crowding. </p>

<p> Understanding the local flow of cases can help policymakers
identify program and process changes to reduce crowding. Program
changes frequently involve eliminating the jailing of persons
whom a community deems inappropriate for criminal justice
processing, such as the mentally ill. </p>

<p> Process changes improve system efficiency, eliminating
case-handling &quot;catch points&quot; that unnecessarily prolong
the confinement of persons who might eventually be released
through bail, probation, or transfer to the State prison. </p>

<p> Reducing length of confinement often becomes the first focus
of population reduction, because efficiency measures are
generally less costly and more readily implemented than new
programs. Local analysis often reveals that the primary
underlying cause of crowding is excessive length of confinement
due to inefficient case processing. </p>

<p> <b>How system decisionmakers can affect jail crowding</b> </p>

<p> System studies in a number of jurisdictions have suggested,
as one judge said, &quot;a lot of little ways&quot; to halt or
reverse jail population increases without releasing serious
offenders. The following discussion highlights just a few of the
&quot;little ways&quot; available at different parts of the
system. </p>

<p> Law enforcement - Decision, surrounding local arrest
practices whether to arrest, transport to jail or </p>

<p> stationhouse, book or detain for bail setting - are critical
determinants of jail population size. Law enforcement practices
both before and after arrest can be modified to reduce jail
admissions. Jurisdictions such as San Diego County, California,
and Frederick County (Winchester), Virginia, use perhaps the most
common form of prearrest diversion through short-term
&quot;sobering up&quot; facilities for public inebriates. </p>

<p> San Diego has been successful in reducing crowding through
the use of a privately operated detoxification reception program
where inebriates must remain for a minimum 4-hour period. Though
in a largely rural area, the Winchester, Virginia, detoxification
program, operated by the Division of Court Services, has also
diverted a large number of persons from jail. </p>

<p> Similar prearrest diversion programs are in effect for
persons involved in family disputes(4) and for homeless persons
in a number of jurisdictions throughout the United States. </p>

<p> Law enforcement officials in Galveston County, Texas, have
instituted practices to divert the mentally ill-a population that
frequently makes up 10 to 20 percent of a jail's population. A
team of deputies receives special training to assist in meeting
the emergency needs of the mentally ill, thereby allowing the
agency to take them directly to a mental health facility. </p>

<p> Many agencies also use a number of postarrest practices such
as station-house release before booking, field citations, and
court-delegated authority to release suspects according to a bail
schedule to eliminate unnecessary confinement. </p>

<p> Jail administrators - Elected sheriffs or appointed jail
executives are often viewed as the managers most affected but
least powerful in dealing with jail crowding. While having little
direct control over admissions and length of confinement, jail
administrators nevertheless can help reduce crowding by assuring
ready access for pretrial release screening and bail review. </p>

<p> Quick access to detainees tends to be a common characteristic
of successful programs to reduce jail crowding. For example, the
sheriff in Mecklenburg County (Charlotte), North Carolina, allows
pretrial services staff to be present during the jail admissions
process, which gives them access to defendants and speeds
decisionmaking. </p>

<p> Individual judges often lack feedback regarding prisoners in
jail awaiting or following adjudication. Yet such information is
of interest to the court and critical to jail population
reduction. The Bexar County (San Antonio), Texas, administrator
provides data to help judges monitor the court status of
prisoners and prevent length of confinement from being extended
through oversight or inattention. </p>

<p> In some other jurisdictions, jail administrators are
delegated authority to release defendants pretrial or divert
drunk drivers to treatment centers. Other administrators help
develop nonjail pretrial-release and sentencing options or
cooperate with other jurisdictions to alleviate crowding on a
multicounty basis. </p>

<p> <b>Prosecutors </b>- Prosecutors act at more case-handling
decision points than any other officials. This gives them an
especially important role in containing jail population growth. </p>

<p> Early case screening by prosecutors reduces unnecessary
length of confinement by eliminating or downgrading weak cases as
soon as possible. Assistant prosecutors in Milwaukee County,
Wisconsin, review arrests around the clock by examining police
records and conducting meetings between complainants and
suspects. This practice enables Milwaukee prosecutors to decide
on the appropriate charge within 24 to 36 hours after arrest. </p>

<p> Prosecutors in Milwaukee also use &quot;vertical case
processing&quot; - assigning the same attorney or team of
attorneys to prosecute a case from start to finish. Though not
necessarily the case in all jurisdictions, reassigning cases from
one assistant prosecutor to another while the matter is before
the court &quot;horizontal case processing&quot; - may cause
stagnation in caseflow, increased requests for continuances, and
lengthened time to trial. </p>

<p> Prosecutor cooperation is essential for alternatives in
arrest, pretrial confinement, and sentencing. Prosecutor
participation and leadership are essential to the effectiveness
of task forces dealing with jail crowding. Since the prosecutor
&quot;owns&quot; cases on behalf of the State, others are rarely
willing to propose case-handling changes without the prosecutor's
support. </p>

<p> Recognizing that a lack of space to confine dangerous persons
is a threat to public safety, prosecutors in a number of
jurisdictions have taken an active role in reducing jail crowding
by serving on &quot;key court officials&quot; groups or chairing
jail population reduction boards. </p>

<p> <b>Pretrial services </b>- Providing background information
on defendants, release recommendations, and other pretrial
assistance can be an important component of solutions to
crowding. Pretrial services can often help merely by adjusting
staff schedules to ensure timely screening and interviews for a
maximum number of defendants. </p>

<p> In Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, for example, pretrial
services and magistrate bail setting are available 24 hours, 7
days a week. In Kentucky, pretrial staff are on call 24 hours a
day to interview persons at rested, notify judges by phone of the
prisoner's qualifications for release, and supervise the release
process if nonfinancial bail is authorized. </p>

<p> Limited release authority is delegated to pretrial services
staff in an increasing number of jurisdictions. In San Mateo
County (Redwood City), California, pretrial staff are authorized
to release misdemeanor suspects prior to their first court
appearance. Seattle, Washington, is experimenting with delegated
release on certain felony charges. </p>

<p> Many pretrial programs respond to jail population pressures
by expanding the range of release options (conditional and
supervised release, third-party custody, unsecured bail, deposit
bail) and by conducting regular bail reviews for those detained
for trial. </p>

<p> A National Institute of Justice study found that supervised
release programs in Miami, Florida; Portland, Oregon; and
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, significantly reduced the bail-held
population without significantly increasing the risk to public
safety. </p>

<p> <b>Judiciary</b> - Judges make more decisions affecting jail
population than anyone else; this often makes them leaders in
seeking jail-crowding solutions. Judges can issue summonses
instead of arrest warrants; provide guidelines authorizing direct
release by police, jail, and pretrial staff; and provide bail
setting outside normal court hours. Evaluators of the 4-year Jail
Overcrowding Reduction Project of the former Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration found that the project's most
successful sites were those with strong judicial leadership. </p>

<p> Many courts provide 24-hour bail-setting magistrates. The
King County (Seattle), Washington, District Court has a
&quot;three-tier&quot; release policy that reduces court time,
jail admissions, and length of confinement. The court established
guidelines specify the charges for which pretrial services staff
may (1) release without consulting the court, (2) release after
phoning a duty judge, or (3) make recommendations to the court in
the most serious felony cases. </p>

<p> Reducing court delay is crucial to effective use of jail
space. Bexar County, Texas, seeks to eliminate &quot;dead
time&quot; by having the court administrator work with a jail
case coordinator to identify cases in need of special attention
and processing steps that can be shortened. Each judge receives
weekly a list of prisoners awaiting indictment, trial,
sentencing, or revocation in his or her court. </p>

<p> One result is a 50-percent time saving in disposing of
misdemeanor charges and thus a significant cut in overall length
of confinement. </p>

<p> Many judges have worked to extend the range of nonjail
sentencing options, using probation supervision, </p>

<p> suspended sentences, fines, community service and
restitution, halfway house placements, and specialized treatment
facilities as true alternatives to incarceration. </p>

<p> A growing number of courts now defer service of jail
sentences, when the jail is at capacity, in cases in which jail
is believed an appropriate sentence but immediate jailing is not
essential for the community's safety. </p>

<p> <b>Defense - </b>The National Institute's field test on Early
Representation by Defense Counsel found that early screening for
indigency, defender appointment, and defendant contact can
decrease length of confinement and thus yield substantial savings
of jail space.(6) Vertical case processing in defense offices
also helps cut length of confinement. </p>

<p> In Mecklenburg County, pretrial conferences between defense
and prosecution help identify, eliminate, or downgrade marginal
cases and facilitate plea negotiation. Both offices can thus
budget staff time efficiently and lessen pretrial confinement. </p>

<p> In St. Louis, Missouri, efforts to reduce staggering defender
caseloads by appointing private attorneys in felony cases have
also reduced case disposition time, stimulated bail review, and
resulted in shorter pretrial confinement. </p>

<p> <b>Probation and parole - </b>Not only do probation and
parole agencies provide nonjail alternatives for sentencing, they
can enhance case- processing efficiency by streamlining
presentence investigation (PSI) procedures and expediting
revocation decisions. All this helps cut length of confinement. </p>

<p> In Brevard County, Florida, the jail population oversight
committee spotlighted PSI delays and worked with probation and
parole officers to cut PSI preparation time from 90 days to 30 or
35 days for jail cases. The county also cut to 24 hours the time
required for decisions on probation revocation, thus decreasing
the use of jail beds for persons on probation &quot;hold&quot;
orders. </p>

<p> <b>Outside the local level </b>- State legislation, court
rules, executive orders, and other &quot;external factors&quot;
can affect jail populations - Guidelines on diversion, bail
policy, appointment of legal counsel, sentencing practices, and
jail operation all can affect the range of solutions available. </p>

<p> Other outside factors that need to be considered in local
planning for jail use include local -demographics, availability
of State and Federal resources, public opinion and media coverage
of criminal justice issues, activities of local civic<b> </b>groups
and community organizations, and political campaigns and
referendums. </p>

<p> <b>Outside the system</b>-Organizations outside the justice
system can be instrumental in alleviating shortages </p>

<p> of jail space by providing emergency shelter, detoxification,
and treatment facilities for the mentally disturbed, public
inebriates, and drunk drivers. Many jurisdictions use local
mental health centers to provide prompt mental health
assessments, diversion, and outpatient treatment. Private
agencies in several jurisdictions provide temporary shelter for
juveniles, pretrial supervision, and community service
placements. </p>

<p> <b>Formulating solutions</b> </p>

<p> While individual parts of the system can help through such
practices as those highlighted above, one or two agencies in the
local justice system are not enough to bring about comprehensive
solutions to crowding. Jail crowding results from the actions of
many, with their decisions interacting to determine jail
admissions and length of confinement. Effectively combating
crowding requires taking into account the interactive nature of
the problem. </p>

<p> Jurisdictions that successfully implemented a systemwide
approach to jail crowding have identified as critical needs (1)
the participation of key decisionmakers in formulating solutions
and (2) detailed information on case processing and on the actual
characteristics of the jail population. </p>

<p> <b>Key decisionmaker participation - </b>Whether it is a
&quot;jail population management board&quot; or some other body,
experience in many jurisdictions argues for a forum that
encourages communication and participation by judges,
prosecutors, sheriffs, police, probation officials, and other
policymakers in developing solutions to crowding. </p>

<p> Collective involvement provides increased awareness of the
impact of one agency's actions on another and of the other
agency's procedures. Also, recommendations of a broadly
constituted planning group are more likely to gain systemwide
support. Finally, the political pragmatism that may accompany
committee action may permit some participants to support more
imaginative policies. </p>

<p> <b>Information - </b>A<b> </b>systemwide approach to jail
crowding requires improved information about jail use. In
addition to the detailed flowcharts that help assess the
timeliness of case-processing decisions and the availability of
nonjail options, planners need information on precisely who or
what type of person is in jail and why and how long they stay.
This permits administrators to learn the frequency of admissions
and the size and variation of distinct segments of the jail
population, as well as indicating sluggish case processing. </p>

<p> Statistical analysis of the population identifies symptoms of
jail crowding, greatly enhancing the ability to identify and
treat the causes. But while jail population data are valuable,
they should not overshadow case-processing information. </p>

<p> Analysis of data on the jail population might show, for
example, that persons detained before trial are released only
after 7 to 10<b> </b>days. Alone, this finding could indicate the
need for a special pretrial services program to expedite
screening and bail review. Information on caseflow, however,
might reveal the actual cause to be inefficient case processing. </p>

<p> Evaluation information is also critical to developing
effective strategies. Evaluation data should be collected and
analyzed to determine if planned modifications in decisionmaking
are being made and the resulting positive or negative
implications for crowding and public safety. </p>

<p> <b>Implementing strategies and conclusions</b> </p>

<p> Localities that take a systemwide approach to jail crowding
generally follow some important steps: </p>

<p> <b>Involve </b>all key system decisionmakers; </p>

<p> <b>Collect</b> all necessary data on jail population and case
processing; </p>

<p> <b>Identify</b>, implement, and evaluate appropriate changes
in programs or processes; and </p>

<p> <b>Inform</b> the public of system changes when initiated and
successful strategies when confirmed. </p>

<p> While many communities have taken great steps, experience has
also confirmed the complexity of the jail crowding problem and
the futility of seeking a panacea through one or two changes.
Long-term success requires a variety of solutions and, most
important, the time, patience, and attention of the entire
criminal justice community. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">From the
Director </h3>

<p> Communities throughout the Nation face the problem of jail
crowding: Having more prisoners than space to house them. Despite
construction innovations that may help cities or counties expand
their confinement capacity both more quickly and at less expense,
a host of problems, including fiscal pressures sometimes, may
indicate solutions other than construction. </p>

<p> Some consequences of jail crowding are well known: Increased
victimization and fear, decreased public confidence that
dangerous persons can be locked up, lawsuits, court-imposed
limits on the number of prisoners, damage to facilities and
equipment. Crowding increases both tension in the institution and
the strain on correctional budgets. </p>

<p> Less obvious but equally worrisome are delays in case
processing due to cumbersome access to prisoners and the limits
put on such necessary judicial options as pretrial release and
sentencing. </p>

<p> National Institute of Justice surveys have shown that
officials in law enforcement, courts, corrections, and other
parts of the justice system were virtually unanimous in naming
prison and jail crowding their number one concern. </p>

<p> Recognition of the gravity of jail crowding, however, offers
a glimmer of hope. Officials in a growing number of jurisdictions
have concluded that if each part of the local justice system does
what it can to ease crowding, the sum of all<b> </b>these small
solutions has a notable cumulative effect. </p>

<p> The separate decisions of law enforcement, judicial
prosecution, defense, pretrial services, probation, corrections,
and other officials can interact to influence the number of jail
admissions and length of confinement. Jurisdictions taking this
systemwide approach find that seemingly minor modifications in
case processing can both reduce crowding and, more important,
improve the overall administration of justice. </p>

<p> Jail crowding is a local problem that must be dealt with
locally. The National Institute of Justice hopes to contribute to
such endeavors, however, by assessing and synthesizing
information on the program and process changes that local
jurisdictions may want to consider. Without information on the
experience of other jurisdictions, informed policy decisions are
hard to come by. </p>

<p> At<b> </b>the Institute, our role is one articulated by
President Reagan and Attorney General Meese: To support, not to
direct, local responsibilities. Experience demonstrates that we
have many useful tools to deal with jail crowding. <i>This
Research in Brief </i>offers local jurisdictions their choice
among such options. </p>

<p> ADVANCE FOR RELEASE AT 5 P.M. EST </p>

<p> BJS SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1993 202-307-0784 </p>

<p> <b>20 YEARS OF MEASURING CRIME SHOWS FEWER OFFENSES OVERALL
BUT INCREASED VIOLENCE AGAINST MINORITIES AND THE YOUNG </b> </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C. -- After 20 years of asking Americans what
their actual experiences with crime have been, the Justice
Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) today identified
several long-term trends: </p>

<p> --Overall, the number of criminal victimizations dropped 6
percent since the annual National Crime Victimization Survey
began in 1973. </p>

<p> --The steepest declines are in household burglary and theft.
--Blacks are substantially more likely to be violent crime
victims than are whites. </p>

<p> --Young minority males in central cities are violent crime
victims at the highest rates the survey ever recorded. The data
are from the survey's 20th anniversary report, which noted that
more than 4.4 million interviews were conducted from 1973 through
last year. &quot;While the overall trends are positive, some
groups of Americans are disproportionately the victims of
increasing crime,&quot; observed Lawrence A. Greenfeld, the
acting BJS director. &quot;For example, last year blacks
experienced the highest per capita rates of violent crime in the
survey's history.&quot; &quot;The survey also documented the
growing ratio of violent crime,&quot; Greenfeld pointed out.
&quot;In 1973 about 15 percent of all crimes were violent
compared to 20 percent in 1992. Moreover, about a third of all
victims of violence report an injury.&quot; During the last two
decades an estimated 37 million victims were injured, and more
than one-third of those injured had no health insurance or were
not eligible for public health benefits. Among other report
highlights: </p>

<p> --Handguns are used in about 10 percent of all violent
crimes. Handgun crime rates are above the 1986 low but have not
returned to the highest rate reached in 1982. </p>

<p> --During 1991 an estimated $19.1 billion were lost directly
from personal and household crimes. </p>

<p> --Males are much more likely to be victims of violence
inflicted by strangers than by family members or other close
associates, whereas females are as likely to be hurt by family
members and close associates as by strangers. </p>

<p> --About 30 percent of all violent crimes and 25 percent of
home burglaries occur when the victim or victims are away from
home on a leisure activity. </p>

<p> --In approximately half of all female rapes the victim knew
the offender. Strangers used some type of weapon in 29 percent of
the offenses, compared to 17 percent by non-stranger rapists. </p>

<p> --In robberies during which the offender threatened the
victim before the attack, those victims who defended themselves
in some way were less likely to lose property but were more
likely to be injured than were victims who took no action. When
the offender had a handgun, the victim was seriously injured in 1
percent of the incidents in which self- protective measures were
not taken, compared to 7 percent when such action was taken. </p>

<p> --Households earning more than $30,000 annually are generally
more likely than are households in most other income categories
to experience theft of a motor vehicle, but as household income
rises, burglary rates fall. </p>

<p> --Black male teenagers (that is boys and young men from 12
through 19 years old) are more likely to be violent crime victims
than any other group of people. Their average annual rate is 113
victimizations per 1,000 residents--or almost one in nine black
teenagers. For white male teenagers the rate was 90 per 1,000--or
about one in 11. </p>

<p> --For adult black males (35 through 64 years) the violent
victimization rate was 35 per 1,000. For adult white males, 18
per 1,000; adult white females, 15; adult black females 13;
elderly (65 years or more) black males 12; elderly black females,
10; elderly white males, 6 and elderly white females, 3 per
1,000. The rate of criminal victimizations for all U.S. residents
compared to other life experiences is as follows: </p>

<p> Occurrences Yearly rate per 1,000 adults </p>

<p> Accidental injury, all circumstances 220 </p>

<p> Accidental injury at home 66 </p>

<p> Personal theft 61 </p>

<p> Accidental injury at work 47 </p>

<p> Violent victimization 31 </p>

<p> Assault (aggravated and simple) 25 </p>

<p> Motor vehicle accident injury 22 </p>

<p> Death, all causes 11 </p>

<p> Victimization with injury 11 </p>

<p> Aggravated assault 8 </p>

<p> Robbery 6 </p>

<p> Death from heart disease 5 </p>

<p> Death from cancer 3 </p>

<p> Rape (women only) 1 </p>

<p> Accidental death, all circumstances 0.4 </p>

<p> Death from pneumonia or influenza 0.4 </p>

<p> Death in motor vehicle accident 0.2 </p>

<p> Suicide 0.2 </p>

<p> Death from HIV infection 0.1 </p>

<p> Homicide and capital punishment executions 0.1 </p>

<p> The survey measures rape, robbery, assault, burglary,
personal and household larceny and motor vehicle theft. It does
not measure murder, kidnapping or commercial crimes. </p>

<p> Last year 39 percent of all these crimes were reported to
police--the highest since 1973, when it was 32 percent. The
increased reporting rate was consistent with the fact that
violent crime and motor vehicle theft have made up an increasing
proportion of total crime during the last two decades. The
highest reporting rate last year was for completed motor vehicle
theft--92 percent. The lowest was for personal larceny without
contact--15 percent. </p>

<p> DRUG DATA PRODUCED BY BJS </p>

<p> Many Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) programs produce data
on drug law enforcement, drug offenders, and drugs and crime. For
example -- * the BJS National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
asks victims of personal crimes if they believed the offenders
had been using drugs * the BJS Law Enforcement Management and
Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) program produces information on
drug-related programs of State and local police agencies </p>

<p> * the BJS National Pretrial Reporting Program (NPRP) examines
drug law violators' criminal histories and status at time of
arrest, pretrial release/detention status, trial appearance, and
disposition </p>

<p> * the BJS National Judicial Reporting Program (NJRP) compares
sentences given to drug offenders with those given to other
offenders </p>

<p> * BJS reports on Federal and State prisoners, jail inmates,
and incarcerated youth including data on their histories of drug
use and drug offenses </p>

<ul>
    <li>the BJS Federal Justice Statistics Program collects and
        publishes detailed data on drug law violators in the
        Federal justice system </li>
    <li>* the annual BJS Sourcebook of criminal justice
        statistics presents data on drug use in the general
        population and on public opinion toward drugs and
        enforcement of drug laws. </li>
</ul>

<p> Drugs and crime facts, 1994 presents the most current
information available relating to drugs and crime published by
BJS in over two dozen different reports through the end of
calendar 1994. This publication also highlights other drug data

Policy (ONDCP) Drugs &amp; Crime Clearinghouse in responding to
requests. </p>

<p> Among other BJS reports published in calendar 1994 were the
following: </p>

<p> * Pretrial release of Federal felony defendants, 1990 (BJS
Special Report, February 1994) examines the likelihood of
pretrial release, type of release, and pretrial misconduct of
Federal defendants, including Federal drug offenders. </p>

<p> * Women in prison (BJS Special Report, March 1994) reports on
female inmates in State prisons in 1991 including prior drug and
alcohol use, needle sharing behaviors, treatment, and prior
physical or sexual abuse of drug offenders. </p>

<p> DRUG USE BY OFFENDERS AT THE TIME OF OFFENSE </p>

<p> The BJS National Crime Victimization Survey asks victims of
the violent crimes of rape, robbery, and assault about their
perceptions of the offender's use of alcohol and drugs. In 30% of
violent crime victimizations in 1992, victims reported that they
believed their assailants were under the influence of drugs or
alcohol. In half of violent crime victimizations, the victim did
not know whether the offender was under the influence. </p>

<p> Data from BJS corrections surveys show that a quarter of
convicted jail inmates, a third of State prisoners, and
two-fifths of youths in long-term, State-operated facilities
admit that they were under the influence of an illegal drug at
the time of their offense. </p>

<p> * 44% used drugs in the month before the offense </p>

<p> * 30% used drugs daily in the month before the offense </p>

<p> * 27% used drugs at the time of the offense. </p>

<p> Jail inmates convicted of drug offenses most frequently
reported having been under the influence of drugs at the time of
their offense (39%), followed by convicted burglars (38%) and
robbers (36%). Jail inmates convicted of driving while

<p> In 1991, 49% of all State prison inmates reported that they
were under the influence of drugs or alcohol or both at the time
they committed the offense for which they were currently
sentenced: 17% were under the influence of drugs only, and 14%
were under the influence of drugs and alcohol. </p>

<p> Half of the State prisoners said they had taken illegal drugs
during the month before committing the crime. </p>

<p> Among violent offenders in State prisons-- </p>

<p> * 61% said that they or their victims were under the
influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the offense </p>

<p> * 50% reported being under the influence of alcohol or drugs
at the time of the offense </p>

<p> * 30% said their victims were under the influence of alcohol
or drugs. </p>

<p> Nearly 40% of the youth incarcerated in long-term,
State-operated facilities in 1987 said they were under the
influence of drugs at the time of their offense. </p>

<p> Data from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Drug Use
Forecasting (DUF) program revealed that of a sample of adult
males arrested in 23 U.S. cities in 1993, the percent testing
positive for any drug ranged from 54% in Omaha and San Jose to
81% in Chicago. Among the 20 cities reporting data on female
arrestees, the percent of females testing positive for any drug
ranged from 42% in San Antonio to 83% in Manhattan. </p>

<p> PRIOR DRUG USE BY OFFENDERS </p>

<p> Data from BJS surveys show that 78% of jail inmates in 1989,
79% of State prisoners in 1991, 60% of Federal prisoners in 1991,
and 83% of youth in long-term public juvenile facilities in 1987
had used drugs at some point in their lives. </p>

<p> Although drug use by State prison inmates in the month before
the offense fell between 1986 and 1991, a higher proportion of
inmates reported use of cocaine or crack in 1991 than 1986. One
in three inmates who ever used drugs in the past used a needle to
inject drugs. Fifteen percent of inmates who had ever used drugs
had shared a needle at least once. </p>

<p> Sixty percent of jail inmates who ever used any drug reported
they had done so more than a year before their first arrest. Of
inmates who reported using a major drug regularly, 55% had not
done so until after their first arrest. </p>

<p> Almost 83% of youth in long-term, State-operated juvenile
facilities in 1987 reported use of an illegal drug in the past,
and 63% had used an illegal drug on a regular basis. The most
commonly mentioned drugs were marijuana, cocaine, and
amphetamines. </p>

<p> Among drug-using youth in long-term, State- operated juvenile
facilities, 19% said they first used drugs before age 10; 38%
reported their first use was before age 12. </p>

<p> DRUG-RELATED CRIME </p>

<p> Overall, 10% of Federal prison inmates in 1991, 17% of State
prison inmates in 1991, and 13% of convicted jail inmates in 1989
said they committed their offense to obtain money for drugs.
Twenty percent of Hispanic State prison inmates said they
committed their offense to get money for drugs, compared to 15%
of white inmates and 17% of black inmates. Twenty-four percent of
female inmates said they committed their offense to get money to
buy drugs, compared to 16% of male inmates. </p>

<p> Inmates incarcerated for robbery, burglary, larceny, and drug
trafficking most often committed their crime to obtain money for

<p> The Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR) of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that in 1993, 5.5% of the
23,271 homicides in which circumstances were known were
narcotics- related. This includes only those murders that
occurred specifically during a narcotics felony, such as drug
trafficking or manufacturing. Those homicides that involved a
narcotics felony and a more serious felony, such as armed
robbery, were not tabulated as drug-related. </p>

<p> A study of murder cases disposed in the Nation's 75 most
populous counties in 1988 found that circumstances involving
illegal drugs, such as a drug scam or dispute over drugs,
accounted for 18% of the defendants and 16% of the victims. In 7%
of cases, victims and their killers were both at the murder scene
because of drugs. Of victims, 12% were involved with the killer
in a drug relationship. </p>

of393 million plants in 64,132 plots, 12,397 arrests, 6,062
weapons seized, and assets seized valued at $52 million </p>

<p> * in fiscal year 1993 DEA confiscated 133,665 pounds of
cocaine, 1,590 pounds of heroin, 39 pounds of opium, 314,054
pounds of marijuana, 2.8 million dosage units of hallucinogens,
and 80.5 million dosage units of stimulants </p>

<p> * in fiscal year 1993 the DEA completed 16,690 asset seizures
valued at $680 million </p>

<p> * in fiscal year 1993 the U.S. Customs Service seized 507,249
pounds of marijuana, 175,318 pounds of cocaine, and 17.9 million
dosage units of drugs such as LSD and barbiturates </p>

<p> * in 1993 the U.S. Coast Guard confiscated 48,441 pounds of
marijuana and 32,313 pounds of cocaine </p>

<p> * in fiscal year 1993 the U.S. Postal Service made 2,193
arrests for mailing controlled </p>

<p> substances </p>

<p> * in 1992 State and Federal courts authorized wiretaps in 634
narcotics cases. </p>

<p> Drug seizure data from different Federal agencies should not
be added together because in many instances more than one agency
participated in the operations. The Federal-wide Drug Seizure
System (FDSS) reflects the combined drug seizure efforts of the
DEA, FBI, and the U.S. Customs Service within the jurisdiction of
the United States, as well as maritime seizures by the U.S. Coast
Guard. FDSS eliminates duplicate reporting of a seizure involving
more than one Federal agency. </p>

<p> Preliminary data indicate that the following amounts of drugs
were seized in fiscal 1993 by the Federal agencies participating
in FDSS: </p>

<p> DRUG ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS </p>

<p> As reported in Federal law enforcement officers, 1993, as of
December 1993, Federal agencies employed about 69,000 full-time
personnel authorized to make arrests and carry firearms. The DEA
employed 2,813 full-time agents. These officers investigate major
narcotics violators, enforce regulations governing the
manufacture and dispensing of controlled substances, and perform
a variety of other functions in support of drug trafficking
prevention and control. </p>

<p> The FBI employed 10,075 full-time agents. These agents
investigate more than 250 types of Federal crimes. The FBI has
concurrent jurisdiction with the DEA over drug offenses under the
Controlled Substances Act. </p>

<p> According to the BJS Law Enforcement Management and
Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) program, in 1990, about 9,300
local police departments, 2,500 sheriffs' departments, and 34
State police departments, employing over 500,000 full-time
officers, had primary responsibility for drug law enforcement. </p>

<p> Drug-related law enforcement activities include making
arrests and seizing drugs as well as laboratory testing of drugs,
drug education, and drug testing of arrestees and agency
employees. Most agencies serving 50,000 or more residents
operated a special drug enforcement unit, participated in a
multiagency task force, and received money or goods from an asset
forfeiture program: </p>

<p> * Special drug units focus on conducting investigations on
drug traffickers and drug-related activities in the community. </p>

<p> * To coordinate efforts with other law enforcement agencies
to accumulate evidence, most large agencies participate in a
multiagency task force. These task forces develop enforcement
strategies such as the use of informants, surveillance, and
undercover operations. </p>

<p> * Most States have laws that allow the government to seize
convicted drug traffickers' assets, such as cash, bank accounts,
planes, boats, cars, and homes. Many State laws require that all
forfeited assets go to the State and/or local treasury upon
payment of outstanding loans. In some States, law enforcement
agencies can keep all property, cash, and proceeds from sales of
what is forfeited. </p>

<p> PRETRIAL RELEASE OF DRUG DEFENDANTS </p>

<p> The National Pretrial Reporting Program (NPRP) revealed that
of persons charged with a felony drug offense in 1992 in the 75
most populous counties-- </p>

<p> * 68% were released prior to case disposition </p>

<p> * 27% were held with bail set </p>

<p> * 5% were held without bail. </p>

<p> The median amount of bail set for a person charged with a
drug offense was $5,000. Defendants charged with a drug offense
were more likely to secure release (29%) when bail was set at
$20,000 or more than those charged with a violent offense (17%),
public-order offense (18%), or a property offense (11%). </p>

<p> Of felony drug defendants released prior to the disposition
of their case, 51% were released within 1 day of their arrest,
79% within 1 week, and 93% within 1 month. </p>

<p> Of felony drug defendants released before case disposition,
27% failed to make a scheduled court appearance within 1 year.
Seventy percent of the defendants who failed to appear returned
to court by the end of the 1-year study period, while 30%
remained fugitives. </p>

<p> Sixteen percent of released drug defendants were known to
have been rearrested while on pretrial release. </p>

<p> Of all released defendants rearrested for a drug offense, 59%
were once again granted pretrial release. </p>

<p> PROSECUTION AND SENTENCING OF FEDERAL DRUG LAW VIOLATORS </p>

<p> The number of suspects prosecuted for drug offenses increased
from 7,697 in 1981 to 25,663 in 1991. U.S. attorneys declined to
prosecute 22.3% (7,814) of suspected drug offenders who were
investigated in matters closed in 1991, a lower percentage than
for offenders suspected of violent offenses (29.5%), property
offenses (48.5%), and public-order offenses (36%). </p>

<p> The number of persons convicted of violating Federal drug
laws rose to 17,349 in 1991 from 5,981 in 1981. This 190%
increase exceeded the 53% growth in U.S. district court
convictions for all Federal offenses during the same years and
accounted for over 67% of the total increase in Federal
convictions. </p>

<p> The number of defendants convicted of drug possession
offenses increased from 498 in 1981 to 1,163 in 1991 -- a 134%
increase. Drug possession convictions were 7% of all drug
convictions in 1991. </p>

<p> Drug offenses accounted for 19% of all defendants convicted
in 1981 and 35% of all defendants convicted in 1991. Drug
trafficking offenses alone accounted for 33% of all defendants
convicted in 1991. The conviction rate for drug defendants
increased from 76% in 1981 to 84% in 1991. </p>

<p> The percentage of offenders convicted of drug offenses
sentenced to prison rose from 73% in 1981 to 87% in 1991. </p>

<p> The average prison sentence for persons charged with Federal
drug violations was longer than for all other offenses except
violent crimes in 1991. </p>

prisons for drug and nondrug offenses, 1991 </p>

<p> Drug offenders are receiving longer sentences and are serving
a larger percentage of their sentence than in the past. The
average Federal prison sentence for drug offenses rose from 62
months in 1986 to 86 months in 1991. The average percent of
sentence served until first release increased from 60% in 1985 to
68% in 1990. Contributing to these increases are the sentencing
guidelines that went into effect in 1987 and the 1986 and 1988
anti-drug abuse laws which prescribed stiffer sentences and
mandatory minimum incarceration terms for Federal offenders. </p>

<p> In the United States in 1990 there were an estimated-- </p>

<p> * 324,235 adults arrested for drug trafficking </p>

<p> * 168,360 felony drug trafficking convictions </p>

<p> * 129,637 drug traffickers sentenced to incarceration </p>

<p> * 82,496 drug traffickers sentenced to State prison or 25 for
every 100 drug trafficking arrests. According to data from the
BJS National Prosecutor Survey Program, in 1992, 1 in 5 State
prosecutors' offices had a specialized narcotics unit. Based on
statutes enacted in the previous 3 years-- </p>

<p> * 23% of the offices prosecuted cases based on recently
enacted statutes addressing controlled substances, such as
anabolic steroids and precursor chemicals </p>

<p> * 21% prosecuted cases addressing illegal drugs in a school
zone </p>

<p> * 42% were white, 57% black, and 1% of other races </p>

<p> * the average age was 30 </p>

<p> * 50% were between ages 20 and 29. </p>

<p> Ninety percent of drug trafficking convictions in 1990
resulted from guilty pleas; 4% resulted from jury trials; and 4%
resulted from bench trials. </p>

<p> Drug offenders comprised a third of all persons convicted of
a felony in State courts in 1990. </p>

<p> Drug traffickers accounted for 20% of all convicted felons;
drug possessors also accounted for 13% of all convicted felons. </p>

<p> Seventy-seven percent of persons convicted of drug
trafficking in 1990 were sentenced to some kind of incarceration:
28% to jail and 49% to prison; 23% were sentenced to probation.
The average prison sentence for persons convicted of drug
trafficking was 6 years 2 months, of which the estimated time to
be served was 1 year 11 months. </p>

<p> The BJS 1990 Census of State and Federal Correctional
Facilities reported on drug treatment and intervention programs
for 1,024 correctional facilities. Prisons may offer many types
of drug intervention or treatment: detoxification, counseling,
education and or awareness programs, urine surveillance, and
treatment in special residential units within the facility-- </p>

<p> * Federal facilities reported they could test 33% of inmates
for drugs; State confinement facilities, 10%; and community-based
facilities, 57%. </p>

<p> * Counseling was available for 14% of inmates in Federal
facilities, 12% in State, and 48% in community-based facilities. </p>

<p> * Residential treatment program capacity was from 1% to 2% of
inmate population for all types of institutions. </p>

<p> Of all Federal inmates, 9% were enrolled in some form of drug
treatment on June 29, 1990. Among State prisoners, 14% in
confinement facilities were enrolled and 37% in community-based
facilities were enrolled. The two most common types of programs
for both Federal and State correctional facilities were education
and counseling. </p>

<p> According to data from the 1991 Survey of Inmates in State
Correctional Facilities, 43% of all inmates had participated in a
drug treatment program; 36% received their most recent treatment
while incarcerated. Group counseling was the most frequent type
of treatment program. </p>

<p> In 1991, about 57% of Federal drug offenders and 52% of drug
offenders in state prisons were tested for the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In Federal prisons, property (1.4%)
and violent (1.1%) offenders had higher positive HIV rates than
drug (0.6%) and public-order offenders (0.6%). In State prisons,
drug (3.2%) and property (2.7%) offenders had higher rates than
public-order (1.9%) and violent (1.4%) offenders. </p>

<p> Drug using offenders have a higher risk for infection with
AIDS-- </p>

<p> * 3.2% of Federal inmates and 4.9% of State inmates who used
a needle to inject drugs, tested positive </p>

<p> * 5.5% of Federal inmates and 7.1% of State inmates who
shared needles to inject drugs, tested positive. About 4% of drug
offenders in Federal prisons and 15% of drug offenders in State
prisons who had shared needles, were HIV positive. </p>

<p> DRUG ENFORCEMENT IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES </p>

<p> Data from the BJS 1990 Census of State and </p>

<p> Federal Correctional Facilities describe the various methods
used to prevent illegal entry of drugs into prisons and to stop
the use of illegal drugs by those under correctional supervision.
These methods include drug testing, questioning, patdowns,
clothing exchanges, and body cavity searches. </p>

<p> Most prison facilities required new admissions and inmates
returning from temporary release to be patted down and required
them to exchange their clothing for prison-furnished clothing. </p>

<p> Interdiction efforts were more stringent in maximum security
prisons than in medium or minimum security facilities. All
Federal maximum security prisons required clothing exchanges,
compared to 81% of Federal medium security prisons and 78% of
Federal minimum security facilities. Prison visitors are also
subjected to interdiction activities. Most visitors were
questioned verbally and were subjected to searches of their
belongings. Patdowns and body cavity searches were usually
conducted if visitors were suspected of carrying drugs or
paraphernalia. </p>

staff are subjected to interdiction activities, particularly when
under suspicion of drug smuggling. Staff were questioned in 45%

<p> The 1990 Census revealed that 7 out of 8 institutions conduct
urine tests on inmates to detect drug use. Of the tests conducted
between July 1, 1989, and June 30, 1990, evidence of drug use
among State prison inmates was detected in about-- </p>

<p> * 1 in 16 tests for marijuana </p>

<p> * 1 in 28 tests for cocaine </p>

<p> * 1 in 50 tests for methamphetamines </p>

<p> * 1 in 75 tests for heroin. </p>

<p> Among tests conducted among Federal prison inmates, positive
test results were found in approximately-- </p>

<p> * 1 in 100 tests for marijuana </p>

<p> * 1 in 250 tests for cocaine </p>

<p> * 1 in 250 tests for heroin </p>

<p> Self-reports of drug use among high school seniors may
underrepresent drug use among youth of that age because high
school dropouts and truants are not included, and these groups
may have more involvement with drugs than those who stay in
school. </p>

<p> The 1993 high school seniors were asked, &quot;How much do
you think people risk harming themselves?&quot; </p>

<p> Those students answering &quot;great risk&quot; in regular
use accounted for the following percentages-- </p>

<p> * marijuana, 72.5%, up from a low of 34.9% in 1978, but down
from 76.5% in 1992 </p>

<p> * cocaine, 90%, up from a low of 68.2% in 1977 and 1978 </p>

<p> * heroin, 88.3%, virtually stable since 1975 </p>

<p> * LSD, 79.4%, following a low of 79.1% in 1977 and a high of
84.5% in 1990. </p>

<p> Data from the National Crime Victimization Survey </p>

<p> School Crime Supplement show that in the first half of 1989,
2 out of 3 students ages 12 to 19 reported availability of drugs
at their school. </p>

<p> Availability of drugs was reported more often by-- </p>

<p> * public school students (70%) than by private school
students (52%) </p>

<p> * students in grades 9 to 12, compared to students in grades
6 to 8. </p>

<p> Similar rates of drug availability were reported by-- </p>

<p> * white students (69%) and black students (67%) </p>

<p> * students residing in cities (66%), suburban areas (67%),
and nonmetropolitan areas (71%). </p>

<p> The survey also showed that most drugs, while available, were
difficult to obtain. </p>

<p> As reported in the 1991 BJS Sourcebook of criminal justice
statistics, a 1990 national survey of fifth and sixth graders
found that-- </p>

<p> * 15% knew adults or older kids who tried or who use
marijuana; 5% knew kids their own age who tried or who use
marijuana </p>

<p> * 10% knew adults or older kids who tried or who use cocaine;
2% knew kids their own age who use cocaine or crack </p>

<p> * 90% agreed with the statement &quot;drugs bought on the
street are not safe to use&quot; </p>

<p> * 7% said they will probably have tried drugs by the time
they enter high school. </p>

<p> GANGS </p>

<p> About 6% of State prison inmates belonged to a gang prior to
incarceration, according to data from the 1991 Survey of Inmates
in State Correctional Facilities. </p>

<p> Among inmates who were gang members </p>

<p> . 81% reported past drug use </p>

<p> . 69% said they manufactured, imported, or sold drugs as a
group </p>

<p> . 92% reported their gang fought other groups. </p>

<p> Of inmates who reported belonging to a gang before entering
prison, 32% were still members at the time of incarceration. On
average, they had joined a gang at age 14. Half reported that
their gang had 60 or more members. </p>

<p> In 1991, among Federal offenders who had trafficked in,
grown, or manufactured illegal drugs or who had managed drug
money, 25% said they were a member of a group or organization
that engaged in illegal drug activities. About 11% were leaders
or middle men in a drug organization. About 9% belonged to
organizations with 11 or more members. </p>

<p> Fifteen percent of students ages 12 to 19 reported the
presence of street gangs at their school, according to 1989 data
from the National Crime Victimization Survey School Crime
Supplement. </p>

<p> Seventy-eight percent of students who reported gang presence
at their school said drugs were available compared to 66% of
students who reported gangs were not present. </p>

<p> Students at schools with gangs were more likely to fear an
attack both at school and on the way to school and were more
likely to avoid certain areas inside the school. </p>

<p> DRUG USE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION </p>

<p> According to data from the 1993 Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Administration (SAMHSA) National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse-- </p>

<p> * 77 million Americans age 12 or older (37% of the
population) reported use of an illicit drug at least once in
their lifetime </p>

<p> * 12% reported use of a drug within the past year </p>

<p> * 6% reported use of a drug within the past month. </p>

<p> PUBLIC OPINION ABOUT DRUGS </p>

<p> As reported in the 1993 BJS Sourcebook of criminal justice
statistics, the percentage of Gallup Poll respondents describing
drug abuse as the single most important problem facing our
country peaked in 1989: </p>

<p> Drug abuse most serious </p>

<p> Date of poll problem </p>

<p> January 1985 2% </p>

<p> July 1986 8 </p>

<p> March 1992 8 </p>

<p> January 1993 6 </p>

<p> January 1994 9 </p>

<p> Among Gallup Poll respondents, the use of drugs was most
often mentioned as one of the biggest problems for schools in
their communities. Giving that response in 1993 were-- </p>

<p> * 14% of public school parents </p>

<p> * 9% of nonpublic school parents </p>

<p> * 17% of those with no children in school </p>

<p> * 16% of all surveyed. </p>

<p> When asked about spending for various social problems, 60% of
the respondents to a 1993 National Opinion Research Center (NORC)
Poll said this country is spending too little to deal with drug
addiction. </p>

<p> In 1990 Gallup Poll respondents were asked how best the
government should allocate its resources in its fight against
drugs: </p>

<p> * 40% said &quot;teaching young people about the dangers of
drugs&quot; </p>

<p> * 28% said &quot;working with foreign governments to stop the
export of drugs to this country&quot; </p>

<p> * 19% said &quot;arresting people in this country who sell
drugs&quot; </p>

<p> * 5% said &quot;helping drug users to overcome their
addiction to drugs&quot; </p>

<p> * 4% said &quot;arresting the people who use drugs.&quot; </p>

<p> Gallup Poll respondents were asked, &quot;What is the most
important thing that can be done to help reduce crime?&quot; In
1989, the most frequent response was to cut the drug supply
(25%), followed by harsher punishment (24%). In 1981, 3% of
respondents mentioned cutting the drug supply, while harsher
punishment was mentioned by 38% of respondents. </p>

<p> NORC has asked adults (age 18 or older) about legalization of
marijuana since 1973. In 1993, 22% believed that marijuana should
be made legal, down from a peak of 30% in 1978. </p>

<p> College freshmen have been surveyed by NORC since 1968. In
1993, 28.2% of those surveyed agreed strongly or somewhat that
marijuana should be legalized, down from a high of 52.9% in 1977
and up from a low of 16.7% in 1989. Of 1993 high school seniors--
</p>

<p> * 22.8% felt using marijuana should be legal, down from 32.9%
feeling that way in 1978 and up from a low of 14.9% in 1986 </p>

<p> * 75.5% reported worrying often or sometimes about drug
abuse, up from 65.5% in 1978 and down from 82.6% in 1990. </p>

<p> In 1990 a Gallup Poll asked what respondents felt would be
the effect of legalizing drugs: </p>

<p> Effect of legalization would increase: </p>

<p> Drug use in public schools 65% </p>

<p> The number of addicts 67 </p>

<p> The number of drug overdoses 63 </p>

<p> Drug-related crime 52 </p>

</p>

<p> This Bulletin presents counts of the Nation's prisoners at
the end of 1990. The 1990 increase of nearly 59,000 prisoners
equals a demand for approximately 1,100 new prison beds per week
nationwide. Prisons were estimated to be operating from 18% to
29% above their capacities at yearend. </p>

<p> Strong evidence exists that during the 1980's there was an
increasing probability that a convicted offender would go to
prison. The ratio of prison admissions to reported serious crimes
and arrests for serious crimes increased to levels unequalled in
almost 30 years of reporting. </p>

<p> The Bureau of Justice Statistics expresses its appreciation
to the departments of corrections in the 50 States, the District
of Columbia, and the Federal Prison System, that make it possible
for us to gather and report data on the Nation's prisoners. </p>

<p> PRISONERS IN 1990 </p>

<p> By Robyn L. Cohen </p>

<p> BJS Statistician </p>

<p> The number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of Federal or
State correctional authorities at yearend 1990 reached a record
high of 771,243. The States and the District of Columbia added
52,331 prisoners; the Federal system, 6,355. The increase for
1990 brings total growth in the prison population since 1980 to
441,422 - an increase of about 134% in the 10-year period. </p>

<p> The 1990 growth rate (8.2%) was less than the percentage
increase recorded during 1989 (13.5%), and the number of new
prisoners added during 1990 was 26,271 less than the number added
during the preceding year (84,957). The 1990 increase translates
into a nationwide need for approximately 1,100 prison bedspaces
per week, compared to 1,600 prison bedspaces per week needed in
1989. </p>

<p> Prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year (referred to as
&quot;sentenced prisoners&quot;) accounted for 96% of the total
prison population at the end of 1990, growing by 8.6% during the
year. The remaining prisoners had sentences of a year or less or
were unsentenced (like those, for example, awaiting trial in
States with combined prison-jail systems). </p>

<p> The number of sentenced Federal prisoners increased at a
faster rate than sentenced prisoners in the States during the
year (10.7% versus 8.5%). For States, the rate of increase in the
number of sentenced prisoners was lower than in 1989 (13%). </p>

<p> Among the 13,318 Federal prisoners with no sentences or
sentences of a year or less were 1,910 under the jurisdiction of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a decrease of 45 from
the number held at the end of 1989 (1,955). The number of Federal
prisoners with no sentences or sentences of less than a year
increased by 1,315 during 1990 (from 12,003 to 13,318), while the
number of sentenced prisoners increased by 5,040. </p>

<p> Total prison populations in Alaska, the District of Columbia,
Oregon, Rhode Island, and Tennessee altogether decreased by 1,675
inmates during 1990. The District of Columbia accounted for more
than half of this decline. The percentage of growth was the
highest during 1990 in Vermont (15.9%), Washington (15.4%), and
New Hampshire (15.1%). Thirteen States reported total prisoner
increases of 10% or more since yearend 1989. California's
increase of more than 10,000 prisoners during the year was the
largest gain in the number of prisoners for any single
jurisdiction. At the end of 1990, about 1 in 8 prisoners
nationwide were confined in a California institution. California
accounted for more than 17% of the increase nationwide during the
year. </p>

<p> Rates of Incarceration Increase </p>

<p> On December 31, 1990, the number of sentenced prisoners per
100,000 residents was 293, also setting a new record. Ten of the
16 jurisdictions with rates equal to or greater than the rate for
the Nation were located in the South, 4 were in the West, 1 was
in the Midwest, and 1 was in the Northeast. </p>

<p> Since 1980 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000
residents has risen nearly 111%, from 139 to 293. During this
period, per capita incarceration rates have grown most rapidly in
the Northeast, increasing by 167% (from 87 to 232) and the West,
up by nearly 163% (from 105 to 276). The per capita number of
sentenced prisoners in the Midwest climbed 119% (from 109 to
239), and the rate rose 68% in the South (from 188 to 315). The
number of sentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents
has increased 133% (from 9 to 21) over the same period. </p>

<p> Prison Populations in Western States Grow the Fastest </p>

<p> Regionally, during 1990 the percentage increase in the number
of sentenced prisoners was highest in the Western States, with a
gain of 9.2%. The number of sentenced prisoners grew by 8.8% in
the Northeast, 8.8% in the South, and 6.9% in the Midwestern
States. The sentenced Federal prison population grew by 10.7%. </p>

<p> In 13 States the percentage change in the number of sentenced
prisoners during 1990 was equal to or higher than that of 1989.
Among these jurisdictions, four had increases of at least 10%,
led by New Hampshire (15.1%), Texas (13.7%), Alabama (13.2%), and
Georgia (10.1%). </p>

<p> From the end of 1985 to December 31, 1990, net gains in the
number of sentenced prisoners have averaged about 1,000 prisoners
per week - a weekly gain of about 922 State prisoners and 75
Federal prisoners per week over the period. The largest net gains
have occurred in the South (306 inmates per week) followed by the
West (243), the Midwest (194), and the Northeast (179). During
1990 average growth in the number of sentenced State and Federal
prisoners was equal to a demand for 1,131 additional bed- spaces
per week, about 354 fewer than the average weekly growth in 1989.
</p>

<p> The sentenced prisoner population had increased in four
States by 90% or more since 1985: California (94%), Colorado
(107%), Michigan (93%), and New Hampshire (97%). California's
increase of 45,796 sentenced prisoners since 1985 accounts for
72% of the increase for the West and 19% of the increase among
all States over the period. In 1985, 10.8% of the Nation's
sentenced State prisoners were in California; in 1990, 13.7%. </p>

<p> Male Prisoner Population Growth Outpaces that of Females </p>

<p> The number of male inmates (727,398) increased at a faster
rate during 1990 (8.3%) than the number of female inmates (7.9%).
This is the first year since 1981 that the number of male inmates
has increased at a faster rate than the number of female inmates.
The rate of incarceration for sentenced males (566 per 100,000
males in the resident population) was about 18 times higher than
for sentenced females (31 per 100,000 females in the resident
population). At the end of 1990, women accounted for 5.7% of
prisoners nationwide. </p>

<p> The 1990 growth rate (7.9%) for female inmates was less than
the percentage increase recorded during 1989 (24.4%). As shown
below, the percentage change was lower in 1990 across all the
regions and at the Federal level. </p>

<p> Percent Increase in Female Inmate Population </p>

<p> 1989-90 1988-89 </p>

<p> Total 7.9% 24.4% </p>

<p> Federal 13.0 36.8 </p>

<p> State 7.2 23.1 Northeast 9.2 29.8 </p>

<p> Midwest 7.1 19.5 </p>

<p> South 7.2 23.6 </p>

<p> West 6.3 22.3 </p>

<p> In 1990, 22 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal
system had more than 500 female inmates. Among these
jurisdictions, 10 had increases of at least 10%, led by New
Jersey's increase of 17.5% (from 886 in 1989 to 1,041 in 1990).
California's increase during 1990, 502 inmates, accounted for
15.7% of the nationwide increase of 3,199. </p>

<p> Local Jails Held More than 18,000 Because of State Prison
Crowding </p>

<p> At the end of 1990, 21 jurisdictions reported a total of
18,380 State prisoners held in local jails or other facilities
because of crowding in State facilities. The number of State
prisoners held locally decreased by 3.6% over that of yearend
1989. Three States - Louisiana, New Jersey, and Virginia -
accounted for more than half of the prisoners sentenced to prison
but incarcerated locally. Five States - Arkansas, Louisiana, New
Jersey, Tennessee, and Virginia - held more than 10% of their
State- sentenced prisoners in local jails because of State
facility crowding. Overall, 2.4% of the State prison population
was confined in local jails on December 31, 1990, because of
prison crowding. </p>

<p> Prison Capacity Estimates are Difficult to Compare </p>

<p> The extent of crowding in the Nation's prisons is difficult
to determine precisely because of the absence of uniform measures
for defining capacity. A wide variety of capacity measures is in
use among the 52 reporting jurisdictions because capacity may
reflect both available space to house inmates and the ability to
staff and operate an institution. To estimate the capacity of the
Nation's prisons, jurisdictions were asked to supply up to three
measures for yearend 1990 - rated, operational, and design
capacities. These measures were defined as follows: </p>

<p> - Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by
a rating official to institutions within the jurisdiction. </p>

<p> - Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can be
accommodated based on a facility's staff, existing programs, and
services. </p>

<p> - Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners or
architects intended for the facility. </p>

<p> Of the 52 reporting jurisdictions, 32 supplied rated
capacities, 42 provided operational capacities, and 38 submitted
design capacities. As a result, estimates of total capacity and
measures of the relationship to population are based on the
highest and lowest capacity figures provided. (Twenty-six
jurisdictions reported 1 capacity measure or gave the same figure
for each capacity measure they reported.) </p>

<p> Most Jurisdictions are Operating Above Capacity </p>

<p> Prisons generally require reserve capacity to operate
efficiently. Prison dormitories and cells need to be maintained
and repaired periodically, special housing is needed for
protective custody and disciplinary cases, and space may be
needed to cope with emergencies. At the end of 1990, nine States
reported they were operating below 95% of their highest capacity.
</p>

<p> Forty-two jurisdictions and the Federal prison system
reported operating at 100% or more of their lowest capacity; 34
of these held populations that met or exceeded their highest
reported capacities. </p>

<p> Overall, at the end of 1990 State prisons were estimated to
be operating at 115% of their highest capacities and 127% of
their lowest capacities. Prisons in Southern States were found to
be operating closest to their reported capacity on each measure. </p>

<p> The Federal system was estimated to be operating at 51% over
capacity. Between 1989 and 1990, State and Federal prison
capacities were estimated to have increased by approximately
20,000-50,000 beds. At the end of 1990, prisons nationwide were
estimated to be from 18% to 29% over their capacities. </p>

<p> Prison Population Growth may Reflect Increasing Certainty of
Punishment </p>

<p> There is some evidence that during the period 1980-89 changes
in criminal justice policies have increased a criminal's
probability of being incarcerated from levels existing in prior
years. </p>

<p> Murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, and burglary are among the most serious crimes and
account for approximately half of prison commitments from courts.
In 1960 there were 62 prison commitments for every 1,000 of these
crimes reported to law enforcement agencies. During the rest of
the decade this ratio steadily declined reaching 23 in 1970 and
was relatively stable during the 1970's. Between 1980 and 1989
the ratio increased from 25 commitments per 1,000 reported crimes
to 62. </p>

<p> Similarly, between 1960 and 1970 the ratio of prison
commitments to adult arrests for the selected crimes declined
from 299 per 1,000 to 170. This ratio was relatively stable
during the 1970's, but it increased between 1980 and 1989, from
196 commitments per 1,000 adult arrests to 332. (See
Methodological note for more detail on these data.) </p>

<p> Prison-admissions-to-crime ratios for individual States
provide an alternative measure of prison use to population-based
rates. Population-based incarceration rates take into account the
number of sentenced prisoners and the size of the resident
population in a jurisdiction. The crime-based rate measures entry
into prison relative to the number of crimes reported to law
enforcement agencies during a year. </p>

<p> Between 1980 and 1989 the ratio of court commitments to
prison and reported crimes increased 148%, from 25 commitments
per 1,000 crimes to 62. Over the same period the number of prison
commitments per 100,000 adult residents went up 115%, from 80 to
172. The Northeast had the largest percentage increase in the
number of commitments relative to reported crime and experienced
the largest gain in prison commitments relative to population.
However, in both 1980 and 1989 the South had the largest number
of court commitments to prison relative to reported crime and to
population. </p>

<p> Besides the increased use of prison relative to reported
crime, arrests, and resident population, prison population has
also been affected by changes in the extent of the illegal drug
problem. </p>

<p> An estimated two-thirds of those in State prisons for a drug
offense were convicted of trafficking or manufacturing illegal
drugs. (For additional information on drug offenders in State
prisons, see Profile of State Prison Inmates, 1986, BJS Special
Report, NCJ-109926, January 1988 and Drug Use and Crime, BJS
Special Report, NCJ-111940, July 1988.) Since 1985 the number of
adult arrests for drug violations has increased by 74%, and the
number of arrests for sales or manufacturing of illegal drugs has
grown by 137%. </p>

the local court maintains jurisdiction.) Texas. Population counts
are based on custody data. The courts have ordered that the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice Institutional Division (TDCJ-ID)
cannot house more inmates than 95% of capacity. Approximately
2,928 beds are exempt from this rule, and the inmates in these

<p>Prisoners in 1992 </p>

<p> Darrell K. Gilliard </p>

<p> BJS Statistician </p>

<p> The number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of Federal or
State correctional authorities at yearend 1992 reached a record
high of 883,593. The States and the District of Columbia added
50,809 prisoners; the Federal system, 8,651. The increase for
1992brings total growth in the prison population since 1980 to
553,772, an increase of about 168% in the 12-year period. </p>

<p> The 1992 growth rate (7.2%) was greater than the percentage
increase recorded during 1991 (6.6%), and the number of new
prisoners added during 1992 was 8,451 more than the number added
during the preceding year (51,009). The 1992 increase translates
into nationwide need for approximately 1,143 prison bedspaces per
week, compared to the nearly 981 prison bedspaces per week needed
in 1991. </p>

<p> Prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year (referred to as
&quot;sentenced prisoners&quot;) accounted for 96% of the total
prison population at the end of 1992, growing by 7.3% during the
year. The remaining prisoners had sentences of a year or less or
were unsenenced (for example, those awaiting trial in States with
combined prison-jail systems). </p>

<p> The number of sentenced Federal prisoners increased at a
faster rate than sentenced prisoners in the States during 1992
(15.9% versus 6.8%). These annual rates of increase were higher
than in 1991 when the Federal system grew 12.5%, and State
systems, 6.4. </p>

<p> The number of Federal prisoners with no sentences or
sentences of less than a year decreased during 1992 (from 14,912
to 14,553), while the number of sentenced prisoners increased by
9,010. </p>

<p> Prison populations in Maine, New Jersey, North Dakota,
Oregon, and Wyoming decreased during 1992. The decrease in these
5 States totaled 1,135 inmates. The highest percentages of growth
during 1992 were reported in Texas (18.4%), West Virginia
(16.2%), Nw Hampshire (15.9%), Idaho (15.5%), and Wisconsin
(15.4%). Eight States reported total prisoner population
increases of 10% or more since yearend 1991. </p>

<p> Texas' increase of 9,501 prisoners during the year was the
largest gain in the number of prisoners for any single
jurisdiction, followed by California (7,688), New York (3,874),
and Michigan (2,596). Texas accounted for about 16% of the
increase in prisonpopulation nationwide. </p>

<p> Rates of incarceration increase </p>

<p> On December 31, 1992, the number of sentenced prisoners per
100,000 residents was 329, a new record. Twelve of the 19
jurisdictions with rates greater than the rate for the Nation
were located in the South, 4 were in the West, 2 were in the
Midwest, and 1was in the Northeast. </p>

<p> Since 1980 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000
residents has risen nearly 137%, from 139 to 329. During this
period, per capita incarceration rates have grown most rapidly in
the Northeast, increasing by 198% (from 87 to 259), and the West,
up by184% (from 105 to 298). The per capita number of sentenced
prisoners in the Midwest climbed 149% (from 109 to 271), and the
rate rose 89% in the South (from 188 to 355). The number of
sentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents has
increased 18% (from 9 to 26) over the same period. </p>

<p> Prison populations in Southern States grow the fastest </p>

<p> Regionally, during 1992 the percentage increase in the number
of sentenced prisoners was highest in the Southern States, with a
gain of 7.8% (table 3). The number of sentenced prisoners grew by
6.7% in the Midwest, 5.9% in the West, and 4.6% in the Northest.
The sentenced Federal prison population grew by 15.9%. In 22
States and the District of Columbia the percentage change in the
number of sentenced prisoners during 1992 was higher than that of
1991. Among these jurisdictions, eight had increases of a least
10%, led by Texas (18.4%), Vermont (18.3%), West Virginia
(16.2%), New Hampshire (15.9%), Wisconsin (15.5%), and Idaho
(15.5%). </p>

<p> Since December 31, 1986, net gains in the number of sentenced
prisoners have averaged about 1,039 prisoners per week -- a
weekly gain of about 946 State prisoners and 94 Federal prisoners
per week over the period. The largest net gains have occurred in
te South (344 inmates per week) followed by the West (223), the
Midwest (202), and the Northeast (176). During 1992, the average
growth in the number of sentenced State and Federal prisoners was
equal to a demand for 1,103 additional bedspaces per week, abut
139 more than the average weekly growth in 1991. </p>

<p> In 1992 the 10 States with the largest prison populations
accounted for 52% of the total prison population nationwide --
California, New York, and Texas accounting for over 25%.
Louisiana had the highest incarceration rate with 478 prisoners
per 100,000 esidents. </p>

<p> Male prisoner population grows at a faster pace </p>

<p> The number of male inmates (833,184) increased at a faster
rate during 1992 (7.3%) than the number of female inmates
(50,409, 5.9%). The rate of incarceration for sentenced males
(636 per 100,000 males in the resident population) was over 18
times higher han for sentenced females (35 per 100,000 females in
the resident population). At the end of 1992, women accounted for
5.7% of all prisoners nationwide. </p>

<p> Overall, the 1992 growth rate (5.9%) for female inmates was
less than the 1991 growth rate (8.4%). The growth rate declined
in the Northeast, from 14.6% in 1991 to 1.7% in 1992, and in the
South, from 10.0% to 3.6%. These declines in 1992 offset the
highr growth rates in the Midwest and West. </p>

<p> Percent increase in </p>

<p> female inmate population </p>

<p> 1991-92 1990-91 </p>

<p> U.S. total 5.9% 8.4% </p>

<p> Federal 13.2% 12.8% </p>

<p> State 5.0% 7.8% </p>

<p> Northeast 1.7 14.6 </p>

<p> Midwest 8.2 7.6 </p>

<p> South 3.6 10.0 </p>

<p> West 7.0 .4 </p>

<p> In 1992, 26 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal
system had more than 500 female inmates. Among these
jurisdictions, 8 had increases of at least 10%, led by Colorado's
increase of 16.3% (from 453 in 1991 to 527 in 1992). The Federal
prison sstem's increase during 1992, 745 inmates, accounted for
26.4% of the nationwide increase of 2,826. </p>

<p> Local jails held more than 18,000 because of State prison
crowding </p>

<p> At the end of 1992, 21 jurisdictions reported a total of
18,191 State prisoners held in local jails or other facilities
because of crowding in State facilities (table 7). Four States,
Louisiana, New Jersey, Virginia, and Tennessee, accounted for
almost 60 of the prisoners sentenced to prison but incarcerated
locally. Four States, Louisiana, West Virginia, New Jersey, and
Mississippi, held more than 10% of their prison population
locally. Overall, 2.1% of the State prison population was
confined in local ails on December 31, 1992, because of prison
crowding. </p>

<p> Prison capacity estimates are difficult to compare </p>

<p> The extent of crowding in the Nation's prisons is difficult
to determine precisely because of the absence of uniform measures
for defining capacity. A wide variety of capacity measures is in
use among the 52 reporting jurisdictions because capacity may
rflect both available space to house inmates and the ability to
staff and operate an institution. To estimate the capacity of the
Nation's prisons, jurisdictions were asked to supply up to three
measures for yearend -- rated, operational, and design capaciies.
These measures were defined as follows: </p>

<p> Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by a
rating official to institutions within the jurisdiction. </p>

<p> Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can be
accommodated based on a facility's staff, existing programs, and
services. </p>

<p> Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners or
architects intended for the facility. </p>

<p> Of the 52 reporting jurisdictions, 38 supplied rated
capacities, 42 provided operational capacities, and 35 submitted
design capacities. As a result, estimates of total capacity and
measures of the relationship to population are based on the
highest and lwest capacity figures provided. (Twenty-four
jurisdictions reported 1 capacity measure or gave the same figure
for each capacity measure they reported.) </p>

<p> Most jurisdictions are operating above capacity </p>

<p> Prisons generally require reserve capacity to operate
efficiently. Prison dormitories and cells need to be maintained
and repaired periodically, special housing is needed for
protective custody and disciplinary cases, and space may be
needed to cope with mergencies. At the end of 1992, 11 States
reported they were operating at 95% or below their highest
capacity. Forty-three jurisdictions and the Federal prison system
reported operating at 100% or more of their lowest capacity. </p>

<p> At the end of 1992, the Federal system was estimated to be
operating at 52% over capacity. State prisons were estimated to
be operating at 118% of their highest capacities and 131% of
their lowest capacities. </p>

<p> Rise in prison population linked to changes in prison
admissions </p>

<p> Underlying the dramatic growth in the State prison population
during the 1980's were changes in the composition of prison
admissions. Since 1977 the relative sizes of the two principal
sources of admissions to prison, court commitments and returned
conditonal release violators, have changed. Court commitments
account for a decreasing share of all prison admissions: 68.0% in
1991, down from 84.3% in 1977 (table 10). As a percentage of all
admissions, those returning to prison after a conditional release
mre than doubled, from 14.5% to 30.5%. These conditional release
violators had originally left prison as parolees, mandatory
releases, and other types of releases involving communty
supervision. </p>

<p> The absolute number of conditional release violators returned
to prison grew 7-fold, from 19,617 in 1977 to 142,100 in 1991,
while the number of new court commitments nearly tripled, from
114,230 to 317,237. Overall, the increase in the number of
conditioal release violators accounted for more than a third of
the growth in the total admissions to State prisons. </p>

<p> An increasing percentage of court commitments sentenced for
drug offenses </p>

<p> In 1990, the latest year for which data are available, the
number of new court commitments for drug offenses reached a
record high, an estimated 103,800. For the first time, the number
of persons admitted for drug offenses was greater than the number
admited for property offenses (102,400), violent offenses
(87,200), or public-order offenses (26,200). An estimated 32.1%
of all new court commitments in 1990 were drug offenders, up from
11.5% in 1977 (figure 2). In 1990 an estimated 31.7% were
property offnders; 27.0%, violent offenders; and 8.1%,
public-order offenders. The increase in drug offenders admitted
to prison accounted for more than 40% of the total growth in new
court commitments since 1977. </p>

<p> Growth in the number of persons arrested for drug law
violations and an increase in the rate of incarceration for drug
offenses account for the change in the prison offense
distribution. Between 1977 and 1990, the estimated number of
adult arrests for dru law violations increased by 104.4%, from
493,300 to 1,008,300 (table 11). Compounding the impact of more
drug arrests, the rate of drug offenders sent to State prison
rose from 27 per 1,000 adult arrests for drug violations in 1977
to 103 admissions per ,000 in 1990. </p>

<p> An increasing number of arrests and a rise in the probability
of incarceration for serious crimes </p>

<p> Growth in the prison population was not solely the result of
more commitments of drug offenders. Between 1977 and 1990 the
number of persons admitted to prison for selected serious
offenses, such as murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, sexual
assault, robbey, aggravated assault, and burglary, also rose by
more than 50,000. </p>

<p> Regardless of the type of offense, the number of adults
arrested and the ratio of prison admissions to arrests increased
between 1977 and 1990. The total number of arrests for serious
crimes rose by 48.8%, from 592,400 to 881,300, while the ratio of
priso admissions to adult arrests for these crimes increased from
121 commitments per 1,000 arrests to 143. Although the prison
commitment ratio was higher in 1990 than in 1977, it changed from
year-to-year: increasing from 1978 to 1984, fluctuating between
195 and 1988, and then increasing after 1988. </p>

<p> Although the number of persons admitted to prison grew for
each of the five selected serious offenses, increases in the
number arrested for aggravated assault and in the probability of
incarceration for burglary accounted for much of the total
growth. </p>

<p> Growth in the number of arrests for aggravated assault
accounted for more than two-thirds of the total increase in
arrests for serious crimes. In 1990 an estimated 410,800 adults
were arrested for aggravated assault, up from 209,300 in 1977.
When combine with an increase in the probability of going to
prison from 32 per 1,000 arrests to 56 per 1,000, aggravated
assault accounted for nearly a third of the total increase in
prison admissions for serious offenses. </p>

<p> A rise in the prison admissions to arrest ratio for burglary
accounted for an additional 24% of the total increase in prison
admissions for serious offenses. While the annual number of
adults arrested for burglary grew by 42,000 between 1977 and
1990, thenumber of admissions to prison per 1,000 arrests
increased from 115 to 160. At least 13,000 more admissions to
prison for burglary occurred in 1990 than in 1977 because of the
higher rate of imprisonment. </p>

<p> In 1992, for the first time in its 9-year history, the Annual
</p>

<p> Survey of Jails collected information from the large </p>

<p> jurisdictions about the programs that their jails administer </p>

<p> -- boot camps, work release, alternatives to incarceration, </p>

<p> educational and treatment programs for inmates, and drug </p>

<p> testing. </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails and this Bulletin would not </p>

<p> have been possible without the generous cooperation of jail </p>

<p> administrators and staff whose facilities were selected for </p>

<p> the survey. </p>

<p> Thomas P. Bonczar </p>

<p> and Darrell K. Gilliard </p>

<p> BJS Statisticians </p>

<p> At midyear 1992 local jails held an estimated 444,584 </p>

<p> persons. From July 1991 to June 1992, the number in jail </p>

<p> grew 4%, about the same rate as for the previous 12 months. </p>

<p> In 1992 overall jail occupancy was 99% of the rated capacity.
</p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails provides these findings from </p>

<p> data reported by 795 jurisdictions for 1,113 jails, about a </p>

<p> third of all jails. Local officials administer these </p>

<p> facilities which are able to hold persons for more than 48 </p>

<p> hours but usually for less than 1 year. </p>

<p> Other survey findings include: </p>

<p> *About 1 in every 428 adult U.S. residents were in jail on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. </p>

<p> *A majority of jail inmates were black or Hispanic. White </p>

<p> non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail population; </p>

<p> black non- Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non- Hispanic </p>

<p> inmates of other races, 1%. </p>

<p> *An estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. The average daily juvenile population for the </p>

<p> year was 2,527. </p>

<p> *Based on the most recent census (1988) 503 jurisdictions had
</p>

<p> an average daily population of at least 100 jail inmates. In </p>

<p> 1992, these jurisdictions operated 814 jail facilities, which
</p>

<p> held 362,217 inmates, or about 81% of all jail inmates in the
</p>

<p> country. </p>

<p> One-day counts </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the estimated number of inmates held in </p>

<p> local jails was 444,584, an increase of 4.2% over the number </p>

<p> held on June 28, 1991. About 1 in every 428 adult residents </p>

<p> of the United States was in jail on June 30, 1992. Fewer </p>

<p> than 1% of the inmates of the Nation's jails in 1992 were </p>

<p> juveniles. </p>

<p> As estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails </p>

<p> across the country on June 30, 1992. Most juveniles in </p>

<p> correctional custody are housed in juvenile facilities. (For </p>

<p> a definition of juveniles and discussion of their detention, </p>

<p> see Methodology, page 5.) </p>

<p> Since 1970 the number of jail inmates per 100,000 residents </p>

<p> has risen 120%, from 79 to 174. During the period, the </p>

<p> number of jail inmates at midyear increased more than 2 + </p>

<p> times, from 160,863 to 444,584. </p>

<p> The rates of incarceration in local jails have risen more </p>

<p> rapidly for blacks than whites. In 1984, the earliest year </p>

<p> for which data are available, the incarceration rate for </p>

<p> blacks was 339 jail inmates per 100,000 residents; by 1992, </p>

<p> the rate was 619. For whites, the rates increased from 68 to </p>

<p> 109 per 100,000. On June 30, 1992, local jails held an </p>

<p> estimated 195,200 blacks and 233,000 whites. </p>

<p> Average daily population </p>

<p> The average daily population for the year ending June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, was 441,889, an increase of 4.6% from 1991. The </p>

<p> average daily population for males increased 4.7% from the </p>

<p> number in 1991; during the same period, the female average </p>

<p> daily population increased 2.8%. The average daily juvenile </p>

<p> population for the year ending June 30, 1992, was 2,527. </p>

<p> Adult conviction status </p>

<p> At midyear 1992, convicted inmates made up 49% of all adult </p>

<p> inmates. The number of convicted inmates increased 6% since </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Convicted inmates include those awaiting </p>

<p> sentencing or serving a sentence and those returned to jail </p>

<p> because they had violated the conditions of their probation </p>

<p> or parole. From 1991 to 1992 the number of unconvicted </p>

<p> inmates increased 3%. Unconvicted inmates include those on </p>

<p> trial or awaiting arraignment or trial. </p>

<p> Demographic characteristics </p>

<p> Males accounted for 91% of the jail inmate population. The </p>

<p> adult male inmate population increased 4% from 1991 to 1992. </p>

<p> An estimated 1 in every 226 men and 1 in every 2,417 women </p>

<p> residing in the United States were in a local jail on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> White non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail </p>

<p> population; black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and </p>

<p> other races (Native Americans, Aleuts, Alaska Natives, </p>

<p> Asians, and Pacific Islanders), 1%. </p>

<p> Daily population movements </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, local jails had more than 46,000 new </p>

<p> admissions and discharges, about equally divided between the </p>

<p> two categories. Discharges include sentence completions, </p>

<p> bail, and deaths. These data exclude transfers among </p>

<p> facilities and readmissions or other departures on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, which can only be estimated to have been within the </p>

<p> range of 10,733 and 13,367. (For a discussion on reporting </p>

<p> practices, see Methodology.) </p>

<p> Occupancy </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates increased 4% from 1991, while the </p>

<p> total rated capacity of the Nation's jails rose 7%. Between </p>

<p> June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, the percentage of rated </p>

<p> capacity which was occupied fell 2 percentage points to 99%. </p>

<p> Facilities with the largest average daily populations </p>

<p> reported the highest occupancy rates. Occupancy was 114% of </p>

<p> rated capacity in facilities with an average daily population
</p>

<p> of 1,000 or more, compared to 53% in those with fewer than 20
</p>

<p> inmates. </p>

<p> Between June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, these jurisdictions
</p>

<p> held on average 356,471 inmates. On the day of the survey, </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, these large jurisdictions held 362,217. </p>

<p> Including an unspecified number of facilities counted as 1 in
</p>

<p> both Cook County (Chicago), Illinois, and Orleans Parish (New
</p>

<p> Orleans), Louisiana, these jurisdictions reported data on 814
</p>

<p> separate jail facilities -- 73% of all facilities surveyed. </p>

<p> Nearly half of these large jurisdictions maintained an </p>

<p> average daily population of between 100 and 299 inmates. </p>

<p> Although these jurisdictions represented 47% of all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, they held only 13% of the total annual number </p>

<p> of inmates in large jurisdictions. </p>

<p> Twenty-nine jurisdictions reported an average daily </p>

<p> population of between 2,000 and 22,220 inmates. With an </p>

<p> average of more than 4 facilities per jurisdiction, they </p>

<p> accounted for 16% of all facilities and 41% of the total </p>

<p> average daily population in large jurisdictions. </p>

<p> 25 largest jail jurisdictions </p>

<p> Within the group of jurisdictions that have an annual number </p>

<p> of inmates between 2,000 and 22,220 are the Nation's 25 </p>

<p> largest jurisdictions. These 25 jurisdictions were in 11 </p>

<p> States: 9 in California, 4 in Texas, 4 in Florida, and 1 </p>

<p> each in New York, Illinois, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Arizona,
</p>

<p> Louisiana, Maryland, and Georgia. These jurisdictions had </p>

<p> between 1 and 16 jail facilities in their systems. </p>

<p> Six of the jurisdictions had a smaller average daily </p>

<p> population in 1992 than in 1991, and six had a smaller </p>

<p> population on June 30, 1992, than on June 28, 1991. Harris </p>

<p> County (Houston), Texas, reported the largest growth during </p>

<p> the year, an increase of 4,919 inmates on the day of the </p>

<p> survey. New York City reported the sharpest decline, a </p>

<p> decrease of 2,136 inmates. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the 25 largest jurisdictions held 32% of </p>

<p> all jail inmates nationwide. The two largest jurisdictions, </p>

<p> Los Angeles County and New York City, had more than 40,700 </p>

<p> inmates, 9% of the national total. </p>

<p> Overall, the number of inmates in the Nation's 25 largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions on June 30, 1992, was 5% greater than on June </p>

<p> 28, 1991. The number of jail inmates in these jurisdictions </p>

<p> totalled 143,604, up from 132,506. </p>

<p> Inmates held for other authorities </p>

<p> Local jail jurisdictions frequently house inmates for other </p>

<p> authorities, because of crowding elsewhere or routine needs </p>

<p> of other jurisdictions, such as housing detainees pending </p>

<p> their transfer or holding convicted inmates while awaiting </p>

<p> transfer to State or Federal prison. Among the 503 </p>

<p> jurisdictions with 100 or more inmates in 1988, 425 were </p>

<p> holding inmates for other authorities in 1992. Approximately </p>

<p> 84% of these large jurisdictions had one or more jail </p>

<p> facilities holding inmates for other authorities on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992. </p>

<p> Two-thirds of the large jurisdictions were holding inmates </p>

<p> for State authorities; half for Federal authorities. </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates being held for other authorities </p>

<p> by these large jurisdictions increased by 9,063, up 23% from </p>

<p> 1991. The number of State prisoners in local jails grew the </p>

<p> most (31%), followed by the number of Federal prisoners </p>

<p> (22%). Prisoners held for other local authorities decreased </p>

<p> 26%, from 4,548 to 3,355. </p>

<p> Court orders to reduce population and improve conditions </p>

<p> At midyear 1992 more than a quarter of the 503 large </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported that 1 or more of their jail </p>

<p> facilities were under court order or consent decree to reduce
</p>

<p> the inmate population. On June 30, 1992, 131 jurisdictions </p>

<p> were under court orders to limit the number of inmates, down </p>

<p> from 135 in 1991. </p>

<p> Jail administrators in these 131 jurisdictions reported an </p>

<p> increase of 13% in their rated capacity during the year, or </p>

<p> an increase of 20,160 beds. On average these jurisdictions </p>

<p> were operating at about 105% of their rated capacities. </p>

<p> Administrators in the 372 jurisdictions not under orders to </p>

<p> reduce population or crowding reported less than 1% rise in </p>

<p> their rated capacity, and a slight increase in the occupancy </p>

<p> rate, from 104% to 105%. </p>

<p> Judges intervened most often in the operation of jails with </p>

<p> orders to reduce population or crowding, but they also cited </p>

<p> other elements of the jail facility, staff, operation, or </p>

<p> programs. Overall, 157 of the large jurisdictions were under </p>

<p> court order to limit population or to correct a specific </p>

<p> condition of confinement. Ninety-four were cited for two or </p>

<p> more conditions of confinement: </p>

<p> Nearly a third of the large jurisdictions with a facility </p>

<p> under court order in 1992 were cited for six or more </p>

<p> conditions. Forty-one of the 503 jurisdictions were cited </p>

<p> for the totality of conditions (that is, the cumulative </p>

<p> effect of several conditions). The most frequent condition </p>

<p> cited was crowded living units (118 jurisdictions), followed </p>

<p> by inadequate recreation facilities (62), medical facilities </p>

<p> or services (57), and staffing (53). </p>

<p> Fourteen fewer jurisdictions were under court order for </p>

<p> specific conditions of confinement on June 30, 1992, than on </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Six fewer jurisdictions were under court </p>

<p> order for administrative segregation procedures or policies; </p>

<p> three fewer for recreation; and four fewer for food service. </p>

<p> Nine more jurisdictions were cited for grievance procedures </p>

<p> or policies; eight more for staffing patterns. </p>

<p> Jail programs and alternatives to incarceration </p>

<p> In 1992, for the first time in the history of the survey, </p>

<p> jurisdictions were asked if any of their jail facilities </p>

<p> operated a boot camp or daily work release program and if any
</p>

<p> operated alternative-to-incarceration programs, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, and day reporting. </p>

<p> (Jail jurisdictions reported only for the programs that they </p>

<p> operated. Within some counties other agencies may have </p>

<p> operated similar types of programs). These programs are </p>

<p> defined as follows: </p>

<p> boot camp -- a program having a chain of command, highly </p>

<p> regimented activity schedules, drill and ceremonies, and </p>

<p> stressing physical challenges, fitness, discipline and </p>

<p> personal appearance. </p>

<p> Work-release -- a program that allows an inmate to work in </p>

<p> the community unsupervised by correctional staff during the </p>

<p> day and return to jail at night. </p>

<p> Electronic monitoring -- a program in which offenders are </p>

<p> supervised by correctional authorities outside of the jail </p>

<p> facility by use of an electronic signalling device or </p>

<p> programmed contact device attached to a telephone. </p>

<p> House arrest (without electronic monitoring) -- a program in </p>

<p> which offenders are legally ordered to remain confined in </p>

<p> their own residence except for medical reasons and employment
</p>

<p> but are not subject to any electronic surveillance. </p>

<p> Day reporting -- a program that permits offenders to remain </p>

<p> in their residence at night and weekends while reporting to a
</p>

<p> correctional official one or more times daily. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 9 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating a boot camp program. About 4% of the jail inmates </p>

<p> (1,463) in these jurisdictions with boot camps were </p>

<p> participating in the program. Among inmates in all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, fewer than half of one percent were in a boot </p>

<p> camp. </p>

<p> Daily work release programs were available to inmates in more
</p>

<p> than two-thirds of the large jurisdictions. On June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, 17,887 inmates in 359 jail jurisdictions were in a work
</p>

<p> release program. On that day, 7% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in work release programs. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 180 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating an alternative-to-incarceration program, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, or day reporting. </p>

<p> Offenders in these programs are not considered jail inmates </p>

<p> to be included in the midyear count because they are not in </p>

<p> physical custody. They do not serve time in a jail facility </p>

<p> but would if not for these programs. </p>

<p> Of the differing types of alternative programs, electronic </p>

<p> monitoring was the most widely available and had the most </p>

<p> participants (118 jurisdictions and 4,582 offenders). Day- </p>

<p> reporting programs were offered in fewer jurisdictions (43) </p>

<p> and had fewer than 2,445 participants. House arrest programs </p>

<p> without electronic monitoring were operated by 18 jail </p>

<p> jurisdictions with a total of 602 participants. Other types </p>

<p> of alternative programs, such as community service and </p>

<p> weekend reporting, were available in 57 jurisdictions. More </p>

<p> than 6,100 offenders were participating in these other </p>

<p> alternatives. </p>

<p> About three-quarters of all jail inmates in boot camps were </p>

<p> in two jurisdictions -- Tarrant County (Fort Worth), Texas, </p>

<p> and New York City. Each of these jurisdictions had more </p>

<p> inmates in a boot camp than the other seven jurisdictions </p>

<p> combined. </p>

<p> Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties in California had the </p>

<p> largest number of jail inmates in daily work release </p>

<p> programs. Each of these jurisdictions had more than 1,000 </p>

<p> work release participants. </p>

<p> Riverside County, California, stretching to the Nevada border
</p>

<p> east of Los Angeles, had the most offenders (1,435) </p>

<p> participating in some type of alternative program. Cook </p>

<p> County (Chicago), Illinois, had the second largest number of </p>

<p> participants (1,223), and Orange County, California, </p>

<p> containing Anaheim and Santa Ana, the third largest number, </p>

<p> 1,050 offenders. More than 10% of offenders under the </p>

<p> supervision of these jail jurisdictions were in an </p>

<p> alternative-to-incarceration program. </p>

<p> Drug testing </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails asked the largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions if and on whom they conducted urinalysis tests </p>

<p> for drugs. Of all large jurisdictions, 308 said that they </p>

<p> did test. Jurisdictions were more likely to test upon </p>

<p> suspicion (219 jurisdictions) than testing all inmates at </p>

<p> least once (35 jurisdictions). The number of jurisdictions </p>

<p> that tested at random or on an inmate's return from the </p>

<p> community was about the same (159 and 153, respectively). </p>

<p> Jurisdictions holding between 2,000 and 3,999 inmates were </p>

<p> more likely to have at least 1 facility testing for drugs </p>

<p> than any other group, 93%. Those jurisdictions that had from </p>

<p> 100 to 199 inmates were least likely to test, 47%. </p>

<p> Selected jail programs </p>

<p> In the 1992 survey, the 503 largest jurisdictions were asked </p>

<p> to report on inmate participation in drug treatment, alcohol </p>

<p> treatment, psychological counseling or psychiatric care, and </p>

<p> educational programs offered by their jail facilities. On </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, at least 1 jail facility in 420 of these </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported operating these types of programs. A </p>

<p> total of 127 jurisdictions reported operating all 4 types of </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> Educational programs (including literacy, basic education, </p>

<p> and GED programs) were offered in more than two-thirds of the
</p>

<p> large jurisdictions. About 9% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in an education program at </p>

<p> the time of the survey. </p>

<p> Alcohol and drug treatment programs were offered in more than
</p>

<p> half of the large jail jurisdictions. On June 30, 1992, </p>

<p> 20,100 jail inmates were receiving alcohol treatment; 18,052 </p>

<p> were receiving drug treatment. In the jurisdictions </p>

<p> operating alcohol or drug treatment programs, the inmate </p>

<p> participation rate was lower than 10%. </p>

<p> Psychological or psychiatric counseling programs were </p>

<p> provided in 212 of the large jurisdictions. More than 14,000 </p>

<p> jail inmates were participating in these programs. </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> A total of 178 large jail jurisdictions (35%) reported one or
</p>

<p> more jails with an inmate death during the year ending June </p>

<p> 30, 1992, compared to 190 (38%) the previous year . Natural </p>

<p> causes other than AIDS were the leading cause of death among </p>

<p> inmates in large jail jurisdictions (38%), followed by </p>

<p> suicide (28%). AIDS-related deaths accounted for 24% of the </p>

<p> total, injury by another person, 3%, and accidents or </p>

<p> undetermined causes, 7%. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails was the ninth such survey in </p>

<p> a series sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The </p>

<p> first was conducted in 1982. Complete enumerations of the </p>

<p> Nation's jails are conducted every 5 years. Annual surveys - </p>

<p> - which collect data on all jails in jurisdictions with 100 </p>

<p> or more jail inmates and on a sample of all other jails -- </p>

<p> are carried out in each of the 4 years between the full </p>

<p> censuses. The reference date for the 1992 survey was June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. Full censuses were done on February 15, 1978, June </p>

<p> 30, 1983, and June 30, 1988. </p>

<p> A local jail is a facility that holds inmates beyond </p>

<p> arraignment, usually for more than 48 hours, and is </p>

<p> administered by local officials. Specifically excluded from </p>

<p> the count were temporary lockups that house persons for less </p>

<p> than 48 hours, physically separate drunk tanks, and other </p>

<p> holding facilities that did not hold persons after they had </p>

<p> been formally charged, Federal- or State-administered </p>

<p> facilities, and the combined jail-prison systems of Alaska, </p>

<p> Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. </p>

<p> Included in the universe were five locally operated jails in </p>

<p> Alaska and eight jails that were privately operated under </p>

<p> contract for local governments. </p>

<p> The 1992 survey included 1,113 jails in 795 jurisdictions. A </p>

<p> jurisdiction is a county, municipality, township, or regional
</p>

<p> authority that administers one or more local jails. The </p>

<p> jails in 503 jurisdictions were automatically included in the
</p>

<p> survey because the average daily inmate population in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions was 100 or more in the 1988 census. The </p>

<p> jurisdictions with large jail populations, referred to as </p>

<p> certainty jurisdictions, accounted for 814 jails and 362,217 </p>

<p> inmates, or 81% of the estimated inmate population on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> The other jurisdictions surveyed constituted a stratified </p>

<p> probability sample of those jurisdictions whose average daily
</p>

<p> population was less than 100 in the 1988 jail census. </p>

<p> Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Two followup </p>

<p> mailings and phone calls were used to encourage reporting. </p>

<p> The response rate was 99% for all jails. </p>

<p> For the eight jails in certainty jurisdictions and the one </p>

<p> jail in a noncertainty jurisdiction not responding to the </p>

<p> survey, data were adjusted by applying the average growth </p>

<p> factor for facilities in the same stratum and region with the
</p>

<p> same type of inmates (men, women, or both sexes). </p>

<p> National estimates for the inmate population on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, were produced by sex, race, legal status, and </p>

<p> conviction status and for the average daily population during
</p>

<p> the year ending June 30, 1992, by sex and legal status. </p>

<p> National estimates were also produced for rated capacity. </p>

<p> Administrators of jails in jurisdictions with large jail </p>

<p> populations provided counts of inmates held for other </p>

<p> authorities, inmate deaths, and jails under court order. </p>

<p> Sampling error </p>

<p> National estimates have an associated sampling error because </p>

<p> jurisdictions with an average daily population of less than </p>

<p> 100 were sampled for the survey. Estimates based on a sample </p>

<p> survey are apt to differ somewhat from the results of a </p>

<p> survey canvassing all jurisdictions. Each of the samples </p>

<p> that could have been selected using the same sample design </p>

<p> could yield somewhat different results. Standard error is a </p>

<p> measure of the variation among the estimates from all </p>

<p> possible samples, stating the precision with which an </p>

<p> estimate from a particular sample approximates the average </p>

<p> result of all possible samples. The estimated relative </p>

<p> sampling error for the total inmate population of 444,584 on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, was 0.47%. </p>

<p> Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determine </p>

<p> whether statistical significance could be associated with </p>

<p> observed differences between values. Differences were tested </p>

<p> to ascertain whether they were significant at the 95-percent </p>

<p> confidence level or higher. Differences mentioned in the </p>

<p> text meet or exceed this 95-percent confidence level. </p>

<p> Measures of population </p>

<p> Two measures of inmate population are used: the average </p>

<p> daily population for the year ending June 30 and the inmate </p>

<p> count on June 30 of each year. The average daily inmate </p>

<p> population balances out any extraordinary events that may </p>

<p> render the 1-day count atypical. The 1-day count is useful </p>

<p> because some characteristics of the inmate population -- such
</p>

<p> as race, Hispanic origin, and detention status -- can be </p>

<p> obtained for a specific date, but may not be available on an </p>

<p> annual basis. </p>

<p> Population movement </p>

<p> In contrast with prior years, admission and discharge data </p>

<p> were collected for the single day, June 30, 1992, rather than
</p>

<p> for the entire year preceding the census date to improve data
</p>

<p> quality and to ease reporting burdens. Intrasystem transfers </p>

<p> within jail systems have been removed from counts of </p>

<p> admissions and discharges and included with a combined </p>

<p> estimate of transfers between jails and long-term medical and
</p>

<p> mental health facilities and readmissions/other departures. </p>

<p> Because some jurisdictions do not maintain separate records </p>

<p> for returning inmates who were on temporary transfers to </p>

<p> other facilities or readmissions resulting from weekend </p>

<p> sentences, medical appointments, and court appearances, it </p>

<p> was only possible to provide an estimate of the volume of </p>

<p> this movement. </p>

<p> Juveniles </p>

<p> State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be </p>

<p> incarcerated in adult jails and prisons under a variety of </p>

<p> circumstances. Juveniles are persons who are defined by </p>

<p> State statute as being under a certain age, usually 18 years,
</p>

<p> and who are initially subject to juvenile court authority </p>

<p> even if tried as adults in criminal court. </p>

<p> The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 </p>

<p> requires sight and sound separation from adults for those </p>

<p> juveniles not tried as adults in criminal court but held in </p>

<p> adult jails. A 1980 amendment to that 1974 act requires the </p>

<p> removal of juveniles from local jails, except those juveniles
</p>

<p> who are tried as adults for criminal felonies. The </p>

<p> proportion of juveniles who were housed in adult jails in </p>

<p> accordance with these guidelines is not available. </p>

<p> In 1992, for the first time in its 9-year history, the Annual
</p>

<p> Survey of Jails collected information from the large </p>

<p> jurisdictions about the programs that their jails administer </p>

<p> -- boot camps, work release, alternatives to incarceration, </p>

<p> educational and treatment programs for inmates, and drug </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails and this Bulletin would not </p>

<p> persons. From July 1991 to June 1992, the number in jail </p>

<p> grew 4%, about the same rate as for the previous 12 months. </p>

<p> In 1992 overall jail occupancy was 99% of the rated capacity.
</p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails provides these findings from </p>

<p> data reported by 795 jurisdictions for 1,113 jails, about a </p>

<p> third of all jails. Local officials administer these </p>

<p> facilities which are able to hold persons for more than 48 </p>

<p> hours but usually for less than 1 year. </p>

<p> Other survey findings include: </p>

<p> *About 1 in every 428 adult U.S. residents were in jail on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. </p>

<p> *A majority of jail inmates were black or Hispanic. White </p>

<p> non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail population; </p>

<p> black non- Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non- Hispanic </p>

<p> inmates of other races, 1%. </p>

<p> *An estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. The average daily juvenile population for the </p>

<p> year was 2,527. </p>

<p> *Based on the most recent census (1988) 503 jurisdictions had
</p>

<p> an average daily population of at least 100 jail inmates. In </p>

<p> 1992, these jurisdictions operated 814 jail facilities, which
</p>

<p> held 362,217 inmates, or about 81% of all jail inmates in the
</p>

<p> country. </p>

<p> One-day counts </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the estimated number of inmates held in </p>

<p> local jails was 444,584, an increase of 4.2% over the number </p>

<p> held on June 28, 1991. About 1 in every 428 adult residents </p>

<p> of the United States was in jail on June 30, 1992. Fewer </p>

<p> than 1% of the inmates of the Nation's jails in 1992 were </p>

<p> juveniles. </p>

<p> As estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails </p>

<p> across the country on June 30, 1992. Most juveniles in </p>

<p> correctional custody are housed in juvenile facilities. (For </p>

<p> a definition of juveniles and discussion of their detention, </p>

<p> see Methodology, page 5.) </p>

<p> Since 1970 the number of jail inmates per 100,000 residents </p>

<p> has risen 120%, from 79 to 174. During the period, the </p>

<p> number of jail inmates at midyear increased more than 2 + </p>

<p> times, from 160,863 to 444,584. </p>

<p> The rates of incarceration in local jails have risen more </p>

<p> rapidly for blacks than whites. In 1984, the earliest year </p>

<p> for which data are available, the incarceration rate for </p>

<p> blacks was 339 jail inmates per 100,000 residents; by 1992, </p>

<p> the rate was 619. For whites, the rates increased from 68 to </p>

<p> 109 per 100,000. On June 30, 1992, local jails held an </p>

<p> estimated 195,200 blacks and 233,000 whites. </p>

<p> Average daily population </p>

<p> The average daily population for the year ending June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, was 441,889, an increase of 4.6% from 1991. The </p>

<p> average daily population for males increased 4.7% from the </p>

<p> number in 1991; during the same period, the female average </p>

<p> daily population increased 2.8%. The average daily juvenile </p>

<p> population for the year ending June 30, 1992, was 2,527. </p>

<p> Adult conviction status </p>

<p> At midyear 1992, convicted inmates made up 49% of all adult </p>

<p> inmates. The number of convicted inmates increased 6% since </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Convicted inmates include those awaiting </p>

<p> sentencing or serving a sentence and those returned to jail </p>

<p> because they had violated the conditions of their probation </p>

<p> or parole. From 1991 to 1992 the number of unconvicted </p>

<p> inmates increased 3%. Unconvicted inmates include those on </p>

<p> trial or awaiting arraignment or trial. </p>

<p> Demographic characteristics </p>

<p> Males accounted for 91% of the jail inmate population. The </p>

<p> adult male inmate population increased 4% from 1991 to 1992. </p>

<p> An estimated 1 in every 226 men and 1 in every 2,417 women </p>

<p> residing in the United States were in a local jail on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> White non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail </p>

<p> population; black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and </p>

<p> other races (Native Americans, Aleuts, Alaska Natives, </p>

<p> Asians, and Pacific Islanders), 1%. </p>

<p> Daily population movements </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, local jails had more than 46,000 new </p>

<p> admissions and discharges, about equally divided between the </p>

<p> two categories. Discharges include sentence completions, </p>

<p> bail, and deaths. These data exclude transfers among </p>

<p> facilities and readmissions or other departures on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, which can only be estimated to have been within the </p>

<p> range of 10,733 and 13,367. (For a discussion on reporting </p>

<p> practices, see Methodology.) </p>

<p> Occupancy </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates increased 4% from 1991, while the </p>

<p> total rated capacity of the Nation's jails rose 7%. Between </p>

<p> June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, the percentage of rated </p>

<p> capacity which was occupied fell 2 percentage points to 99%. </p>

<p> Facilities with the largest average daily populations </p>

<p> reported the highest occupancy rates. Occupancy was 114% of </p>

<p> rated capacity in facilities with an average daily population
</p>

<p> of 1,000 or more, compared to 53% in those with fewer than 20

<p> Jurisdictions with large jail populations </p>

<p> Characteristics </p>

<p> In 1992 , an estimated 81% of the total annual number of </p>

<p> inmates in the Nation's local jails were housed in the </p>

<p> facilities of 503 jurisdictions, each with an average daily </p>

<p> population of at least 100 incarcerated persons at the time </p>

<p> of the 1988 Census of Jails. </p>

<p> Between June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, these jurisdictions
</p>

<p> held on average 356,471 inmates. On the day of the survey, </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, these large jurisdictions held 362,217. </p>

<p> Including an unspecified number of facilities counted as 1 in
</p>

<p> both Cook County (Chicago), Illinois, and Orleans Parish (New
</p>

<p> Orleans), Louisiana, these jurisdictions reported data on 814
</p>

<p> separate jail facilities -- 73% of all facilities surveyed. </p>

<p> Nearly half of these large jurisdictions maintained an </p>

<p> average daily population of between 100 and 299 inmates. </p>

<p> Although these jurisdictions represented 47% of all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, they held only 13% of the total annual number </p>

<p> of inmates in large jurisdictions. </p>

<p> Twenty-nine jurisdictions reported an average daily </p>

<p> population of between 2,000 and 22,220 inmates. With an </p>

<p> average of more than 4 facilities per jurisdiction, they </p>

<p> accounted for 16% of all facilities and 41% of the total </p>

<p> average daily population in large jurisdictions. </p>

<p> 25 largest jail jurisdictions </p>

<p> Within the group of jurisdictions that have an annual number </p>

<p> of inmates between 2,000 and 22,220 are the Nation's 25 </p>

<p> largest jurisdictions. These 25 jurisdictions were in 11 </p>

<p> States: 9 in California, 4 in Texas, 4 in Florida, and 1 </p>

<p> each in New York, Illinois, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Arizona,
</p>

<p> Louisiana, Maryland, and Georgia. These jurisdictions had </p>

<p> between 1 and 16 jail facilities in their systems. </p>

<p> Six of the jurisdictions had a smaller average daily </p>

<p> population in 1992 than in 1991, and six had a smaller </p>

<p> population on June 30, 1992, than on June 28, 1991. Harris </p>

<p> County (Houston), Texas, reported the largest growth during </p>

<p> the year, an increase of 4,919 inmates on the day of the </p>

<p> survey. New York City reported the sharpest decline, a </p>

<p> decrease of 2,136 inmates. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the 25 largest jurisdictions held 32% of </p>

<p> all jail inmates nationwide. The two largest jurisdictions, </p>

<p> Los Angeles County and New York City, had more than 40,700 </p>

<p> inmates, 9% of the national total. </p>

<p> Overall, the number of inmates in the Nation's 25 largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions on June 30, 1992, was 5% greater than on June </p>

<p> 28, 1991. The number of jail inmates in these jurisdictions </p>

<p> totalled 143,604, up from 132,506. </p>

<p> Inmates held for other authorities </p>

<p> Local jail jurisdictions frequently house inmates for other </p>

<p> authorities, because of crowding elsewhere or routine needs </p>

<p> of other jurisdictions, such as housing detainees pending </p>

<p> their transfer or holding convicted inmates while awaiting </p>

<p> transfer to State or Federal prison. Among the 503 </p>

<p> jurisdictions with 100 or more inmates in 1988, 425 were </p>

<p> holding inmates for other authorities in 1992. Approximately </p>

<p> 84% of these large jurisdictions had one or more jail </p>

<p> facilities holding inmates for other authorities on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992. </p>

<p> Two-thirds of the large jurisdictions were holding inmates </p>

<p> for State authorities; half for Federal authorities. </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates being held for other authorities </p>

<p> by these large jurisdictions increased by 9,063, up 23% from </p>

<p> 1991. The number of State prisoners in local jails grew the </p>

<p> most (31%), followed by the number of Federal prisoners </p>

<p> (22%). Prisoners held for other local authorities decreased </p>

<p> 26%, from 4,548 to 3,355. </p>

<p> Court orders to reduce population and improve conditions </p>

<p> At midyear 1992 more than a quarter of the 503 large </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported that 1 or more of their jail </p>

<p> facilities were under court order or consent decree to reduce
</p>

<p> the inmate population. On June 30, 1992, 131 jurisdictions </p>

<p> were under court orders to limit the number of inmates, down </p>

<p> from 135 in 1991. </p>

<p> Jail administrators in these 131 jurisdictions reported an </p>

<p> increase of 13% in their rated capacity during the year, or </p>

<p> an increase of 20,160 beds. On average these jurisdictions </p>

<p> were operating at about 105% of their rated capacities. </p>

<p> Administrators in the 372 jurisdictions not under orders to </p>

<p> reduce population or crowding reported less than 1% rise in </p>

<p> their rated capacity, and a slight increase in the occupancy </p>

<p> rate, from 104% to 105%. </p>

<p> Judges intervened most often in the operation of jails with </p>

<p> orders to reduce population or crowding, but they also cited </p>

<p> other elements of the jail facility, staff, operation, or </p>

<p> programs. Overall, 157 of the large jurisdictions were under </p>

<p> court order to limit population or to correct a specific </p>

<p> condition of confinement. Ninety-four were cited for two or </p>

<p> more conditions of confinement: </p>

<p> Nearly a third of the large jurisdictions with a facility </p>

<p> under court order in 1992 were cited for six or more </p>

<p> conditions. Forty-one of the 503 jurisdictions were cited </p>

<p> for the totality of conditions (that is, the cumulative </p>

<p> effect of several conditions). The most frequent condition </p>

<p> cited was crowded living units (118 jurisdictions), followed </p>

<p> by inadequate recreation facilities (62), medical facilities </p>

<p> or services (57), and staffing (53). </p>

<p> Fourteen fewer jurisdictions were under court order for </p>

<p> specific conditions of confinement on June 30, 1992, than on </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Six fewer jurisdictions were under court </p>

<p> order for administrative segregation procedures or policies; </p>

<p> three fewer for recreation; and four fewer for food service. </p>

<p> Nine more jurisdictions were cited for grievance procedures </p>

<p> or policies; eight more for staffing patterns. </p>

<p> Jail programs and alternatives to incarceration </p>

<p> In 1992, for the first time in the history of the survey, </p>

<p> jurisdictions were asked if any of their jail facilities </p>

<p> operated a boot camp or daily work release program and if any
</p>

<p> operated alternative-to-incarceration programs, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, and day reporting. </p>

<p> (Jail jurisdictions reported only for the programs that they </p>

<p> operated. Within some counties other agencies may have </p>

<p> operated similar types of programs). These programs are </p>

<p> defined as follows: </p>

<p> boot camp -- a program having a chain of command, highly </p>

<p> regimented activity schedules, drill and ceremonies, and </p>

<p> stressing physical challenges, fitness, discipline and </p>

<p> personal appearance. </p>

<p> Work-release -- a program that allows an inmate to work in </p>

<p> the community unsupervised by correctional staff during the </p>

<p> day and return to jail at night. </p>

<p> Electronic monitoring -- a program in which offenders are </p>

<p> supervised by correctional authorities outside of the jail </p>

<p> facility by use of an electronic signalling device or </p>

<p> programmed contact device attached to a telephone. </p>

<p> House arrest (without electronic monitoring) -- a program in </p>

<p> which offenders are legally ordered to remain confined in </p>

<p> their own residence except for medical reasons and employment
</p>

<p> but are not subject to any electronic surveillance. </p>

<p> Day reporting -- a program that permits offenders to remain </p>

<p> in their residence at night and weekends while reporting to a
</p>

<p> correctional official one or more times daily. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 9 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating a boot camp program. About 4% of the jail inmates </p>

<p> (1,463) in these jurisdictions with boot camps were </p>

<p> participating in the program. Among inmates in all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, fewer than half of one percent were in a boot </p>

<p> camp. </p>

<p> Daily work release programs were available to inmates in more
</p>

<p> than two-thirds of the large jurisdictions. On June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, 17,887 inmates in 359 jail jurisdictions were in a work
</p>

<p> release program. On that day, 7% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in work release programs. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 180 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating an alternative-to-incarceration program, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, or day reporting. </p>

<p> Offenders in these programs are not considered jail inmates </p>

<p> to be included in the midyear count because they are not in </p>

<p> physical custody. They do not serve time in a jail facility </p>

<p> but would if not for these programs. </p>

<p> Of the differing types of alternative programs, electronic </p>

<p> monitoring was the most widely available and had the most </p>

<p> participants (118 jurisdictions and 4,582 offenders). Day- </p>

<p> reporting programs were offered in fewer jurisdictions (43) </p>

<p> and had fewer than 2,445 participants. House arrest programs </p>

<p> without electronic monitoring were operated by 18 jail </p>

<p> jurisdictions with a total of 602 participants. Other types </p>

<p> of alternative programs, such as community service and </p>

<p> weekend reporting, were available in 57 jurisdictions. More </p>

<p> than 6,100 offenders were participating in these other </p>

<p> alternatives. </p>

<p> About three-quarters of all jail inmates in boot camps were </p>

<p> in two jurisdictions -- Tarrant County (Fort Worth), Texas, </p>

<p> and New York City. Each of these jurisdictions had more </p>

<p> inmates in a boot camp than the other seven jurisdictions </p>

<p> combined. </p>

<p> Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties in California had the </p>

<p> largest number of jail inmates in daily work release </p>

<p> programs. Each of these jurisdictions had more than 1,000 </p>

<p> work release participants. </p>

<p> Riverside County, California, stretching to the Nevada border
</p>

<p> east of Los Angeles, had the most offenders (1,435) </p>

<p> participating in some type of alternative program. Cook </p>

<p> County (Chicago), Illinois, had the second largest number of </p>

<p> participants (1,223), and Orange County, California, </p>

<p> containing Anaheim and Santa Ana, the third largest number, </p>

<p> 1,050 offenders. More than 10% of offenders under the </p>

<p> supervision of these jail jurisdictions were in an </p>

<p> alternative-to-incarceration program. </p>

<p> Drug testing </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails asked the largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions if and on whom they conducted urinalysis tests </p>

<p> for drugs. Of all large jurisdictions, 308 said that they </p>

<p> did test. Jurisdictions were more likely to test upon </p>

<p> suspicion (219 jurisdictions) than testing all inmates at </p>

<p> least once (35 jurisdictions). The number of jurisdictions </p>

<p> that tested at random or on an inmate's return from the </p>

<p> community was about the same (159 and 153, respectively). </p>

<p> Jurisdictions holding between 2,000 and 3,999 inmates were </p>

<p> more likely to have at least 1 facility testing for drugs </p>

<p> than any other group, 93%. Those jurisdictions that had from </p>

<p> 100 to 199 inmates were least likely to test, 47%. </p>

<p> Selected jail programs </p>

<p> In the 1992 survey, the 503 largest jurisdictions were asked </p>

<p> to report on inmate participation in drug treatment, alcohol </p>

<p> treatment, psychological counseling or psychiatric care, and </p>

<p> educational programs offered by their jail facilities. On </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, at least 1 jail facility in 420 of these </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported operating these types of programs. A </p>

<p> total of 127 jurisdictions reported operating all 4 types of </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> Educational programs (including literacy, basic education, </p>

<p> and GED programs) were offered in more than two-thirds of the
</p>

<p> large jurisdictions. About 9% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in an education program at </p>

<p> the time of the survey. </p>

<p> Alcohol and drug treatment programs were offered in more than
</p>

<p> half of the large jail jurisdictions. On June 30, 1992, </p>

<p> 20,100 jail inmates were receiving alcohol treatment; 18,052 </p>

<p> were receiving drug treatment. In the jurisdictions </p>

<p> operating alcohol or drug treatment programs, the inmate </p>

<p> participation rate was lower than 10%. </p>

<p> Psychological or psychiatric counseling programs were </p>

<p> provided in 212 of the large jurisdictions. More than 14,000 </p>

<p> jail inmates were participating in these programs. </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> A total of 178 large jail jurisdictions (35%) reported one or
</p>

<p> more jails with an inmate death during the year ending June </p>

<p> 30, 1992, compared to 190 (38%) the previous year . Natural </p>

<p> causes other than AIDS were the leading cause of death among </p>

<p> inmates in large jail jurisdictions (38%), followed by </p>

<p> suicide (28%). AIDS-related deaths accounted for 24% of the </p>

<p> total, injury by another person, 3%, and accidents or </p>

<p> undetermined causes, 7%. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails was the ninth such survey in </p>

<p> a series sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The </p>

<p> first was conducted in 1982. Complete enumerations of the </p>

<p> Nation's jails are conducted every 5 years. Annual surveys - </p>

<p> - which collect data on all jails in jurisdictions with 100 </p>

<p> or more jail inmates and on a sample of all other jails -- </p>

<p> are carried out in each of the 4 years between the full </p>

<p> censuses. The reference date for the 1992 survey was June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. Full censuses were done on February 15, 1978, June </p>

<p> 30, 1983, and June 30, 1988. </p>

<p> A local jail is a facility that holds inmates beyond </p>

<p> arraignment, usually for more than 48 hours, and is </p>

<p> administered by local officials. Specifically excluded from </p>

<p> the count were temporary lockups that house persons for less </p>

<p> than 48 hours, physically separate drunk tanks, and other </p>

<p> holding facilities that did not hold persons after they had </p>

<p> been formally charged, Federal- or State-administered </p>

<p> facilities, and the combined jail-prison systems of Alaska, </p>

<p> Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. </p>

<p> Included in the universe were five locally operated jails in </p>

<p> Alaska and eight jails that were privately operated under </p>

<p> contract for local governments. </p>

<p> The 1992 survey included 1,113 jails in 795 jurisdictions. A </p>

<p> jurisdiction is a county, municipality, township, or regional
</p>

<p> authority that administers one or more local jails. The </p>

<p> jails in 503 jurisdictions were automatically included in the
</p>

<p> survey because the average daily inmate population in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions was 100 or more in the 1988 census. The </p>

<p> jurisdictions with large jail populations, referred to as </p>

<p> certainty jurisdictions, accounted for 814 jails and 362,217 </p>

<p> inmates, or 81% of the estimated inmate population on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> The other jurisdictions surveyed constituted a stratified </p>

<p> probability sample of those jurisdictions whose average daily
</p>

<p> population was less than 100 in the 1988 jail census. </p>

<p> Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Two followup </p>

<p> mailings and phone calls were used to encourage reporting. </p>

<p> The response rate was 99% for all jails. </p>

<p> For the eight jails in certainty jurisdictions and the one </p>

<p> jail in a noncertainty jurisdiction not responding to the </p>

<p> survey, data were adjusted by applying the average growth </p>

<p> factor for facilities in the same stratum and region with the
</p>

<p> same type of inmates (men, women, or both sexes). </p>

<p> National estimates for the inmate population on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, were produced by sex, race, legal status, and </p>

<p> conviction status and for the average daily population during
</p>

<p> the year ending June 30, 1992, by sex and legal status. </p>

<p> National estimates were also produced for rated capacity. </p>

<p> Administrators of jails in jurisdictions with large jail </p>

<p> populations provided counts of inmates held for other </p>

<p> authorities, inmate deaths, and jails under court order. </p>

<p> Sampling error </p>

<p> National estimates have an associated sampling error because </p>

<p> jurisdictions with an average daily population of less than </p>

<p> 100 were sampled for the survey. Estimates based on a sample </p>

<p> survey are apt to differ somewhat from the results of a </p>

<p> survey canvassing all jurisdictions. Each of the samples </p>

<p> that could have been selected using the same sample design </p>

<p> could yield somewhat different results. Standard error is a </p>

<p> measure of the variation among the estimates from all </p>

<p> possible samples, stating the precision with which an </p>

<p> estimate from a particular sample approximates the average </p>

<p> result of all possible samples. The estimated relative </p>

<p> sampling error for the total inmate population of 444,584 on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, was 0.47%. </p>

<p> Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determine </p>

<p> whether statistical significance could be associated with </p>

<p> observed differences between values. Differences were tested </p>

<p> to ascertain whether they were significant at the 95-percent </p>

<p> confidence level or higher. Differences mentioned in the </p>

<p> text meet or exceed this 95-percent confidence level. </p>

<p> Measures of population </p>

<p> Two measures of inmate population are used: the average </p>

<p> daily population for the year ending June 30 and the inmate </p>

<p> count on June 30 of each year. The average daily inmate </p>

<p> population balances out any extraordinary events that may </p>

<p> render the 1-day count atypical. The 1-day count is useful </p>

<p> because some characteristics of the inmate population -- such
</p>

<p> as race, Hispanic origin, and detention status -- can be </p>

<p> obtained for a specific date, but may not be available on an </p>

<p> annual basis. </p>

<p> Population movement </p>

<p> In contrast with prior years, admission and discharge data </p>

<p> were collected for the single day, June 30, 1992, rather than
</p>

<p> for the entire year preceding the census date to improve data
</p>

<p> quality and to ease reporting burdens. Intrasystem transfers </p>

<p> within jail systems have been removed from counts of </p>

<p> admissions and discharges and included with a combined </p>

<p> estimate of transfers between jails and long-term medical and
</p>

<p> mental health facilities and readmissions/other departures. </p>

<p> Because some jurisdictions do not maintain separate records </p>

<p> for returning inmates who were on temporary transfers to </p>

<p> other facilities or readmissions resulting from weekend </p>

<p> sentences, medical appointments, and court appearances, it </p>

<p> was only possible to provide an estimate of the volume of </p>

<p> this movement. </p>

<p> Juveniles </p>

<p> State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be </p>

<p> incarcerated in adult jails and prisons under a variety of </p>

<p> circumstances. Juveniles are persons who are defined by </p>

<p> State statute as being under a certain age, usually 18 years,
</p>

<p> and who are initially subject to juvenile court authority </p>

<p> even if tried as adults in criminal court. </p>

<p> The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 </p>

<p> requires sight and sound separation from adults for those </p>

<p> juveniles not tried as adults in criminal court but held in </p>

<p> adult jails. A 1980 amendment to that 1974 act requires the </p>

<p> removal of juveniles from local jails, except those juveniles
</p>

<p> who are tried as adults for criminal felonies. The </p>

<p> proportion of juveniles who were housed in adult jails in </p>

<p> accordance with these guidelines is not available. </p>

<p> This report was written by Allen J. Beck, Thomas P. Bonczar, </p>

<p> and Darrell K. Gilliard. Corrections statistics are prepared </p>

<p> under the general direction of Lawrence A. Greenfeld. James </p>

<p> Stephan reviewed the statistics. Tom Hester edited the </p>

<p> report. Marilyn Marbrook administered production, assisted </p>

<p> by Betty Sherman, Jayne Pugh, and Yvonne Boston. Collection </p>

<p> and processing of the 1992 Jail Survey were conducted by </p>

<p> Margaret Ferguson and Linda Huang under the supervision of </p>
