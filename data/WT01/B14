Q:  On a recent trip overseas, I was unable to reach Kemper Funds
Shareholder Services by using the general 800-number.  How can
I get information about my account or initiate a transaction when
I'm not in the U.S.?
<P>
A:  The easiest way to contact Kemper Funds when you're abroad
is through the Internet. Send an e-mail to info@kemper.com and
we'll respond with an e-mail within 24 hours.  For security reasons,
however, we ask that you don't send account-specific information
via e-mail.
<P>
If you need to reach us by telephone to initiate a transaction,
you can call us collect at 1-312-781-1121 Monday through Friday, between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.,
Central Standard Time.  For your convenience, we've added this
number to the contact information shown on the back of your account
statement.

<IMG SRC = "gifs/no_match_head.gif" ALT = "Why Published Investment Returns May Not Match Your Experience">
<BR>
How much did my investment return? That's usually the bottomline
for investors.But the actual annual return on your invested dollars may never
match the annual total returns that you read in the newspaper
or even in your fund's shareholder report. Remember that your
investment's progress will be the result of many factors.
<P>
We've prepared the following hypothetical illustration to explain
the difference between the published return and an individual's
actual experience. In each of the scenarios shown, the shareholders
had a total of $10,000 in the same hypothetical fund on the last
day of the one-year period from April 30, 1995, through April
30, 1996. Yet, the actual returns on their investments varied
significantly.
<P>
To produce the returns presented below, we've used Towers Data
Systems data based on the actual performance of the <A HREF="http://www.stockinfo.standardpoor.com/brochure/idxdirs.htm">Standard &amp;
Poor's 500</A> over a recent one-year period (April 30, 1995, through
April 30, 1996). The S&amp;P 500 is an unmanaged index of common
stocks that is generally considered representative of the U.S.
stock market. Investments cannot be made directly in this index.
As you know, the stock market enjoyed a generally upward performance
during this one-year period. The high point of the period was
reached on February 12, 1996, and the low point reached on January
10, 1996. For this illustration, however, absolute performance
is not relevant, and we could have used any one-year period to
demonstrate how returns vary according to several factors.
<P>
<B>Hypothetical illustration</B>
<BR>
News item: XYZ Equity Fund today reported a total return of 30.14%
for the one-year period that ended April 30, 1996.
<BR>
The calculation of this return used the same assumptions that
your account statement, shareholder report and most published
listings use: That the full sum was invested on the first day
of the one-year period, that the shareholder did not add to or
subtract from the invested amount and that all income and capital
gain dividends were reinvested. The following illustrate how the
actual returns earned by various XYZ Equity Fund shareholders
might have been quite different from the published 30.14% return.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/no_match_table.gif" ALT="hypothetical examples">
<BR>

<FONT SIZE=1>
The above hypothetical examples are for illustrative purposes
only and are not intended to represent performance of any specific
investment, which may fluctuate.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/no_match_table2.gif" ALT="Income dividends + Capital gain dividends + Changes in the value of your fund's shares = Your fund's total return">
<P><BR>

Today, the best measure of your investment progress is the portion
of your quarterly account statement that details the change in
the total value of your invested dollars. But Kemper Funds recognizes
that you need to evaluate your investment's long-term performance,
taking into consideration your individual account activity. Toward
that end, we are working on developing an account statement with
annual total return figures that reflect your activity. Watch
for more information in this section of Kemper.com on your Personal Performance.

Kemper mutual fund and you'd like to return, we'd love to have you

<BR>
By acting within six months of your redemption of your Class A Shares or
the equivalent, you can take advantage of Kemper's reinvestment
privilege, which allows you to reinvest all or a portion of your
redemption proceeds in the same Kemper fund or Class A Shares of another
Kemper fund without opening a new account or paying a new sales charge.
This privilege is not applicable to Class A Shares of Kemper Cash
Reserves Fund purchased directly at net asset value.
<BR><BR>

For Class B shareholders, the privilege enables you to reinvest all or a
portion of your redemption proceeds in the same fund or Class B Shares
of another fund - plus Kemper will reinvest the amount of contingent
deferred sales charge that was imposed upon the redemption proceeds
that you reinvest. If you reinvest, you will receive the original
purchase date on the reinvested shares. (The original purchase date is a
consideration when determining any future contingent deferred sales
charge. However, depending on your particular situation, this will not
be your purchase date for tax purposes. When calculating your holding
period for capital gains purposes, you will need to use your new
purchase date.)
<BR><BR>

Call Kemper Shareholder Services for a reinvestment certificate - or send us a
reinvestment check with a letter stating your intention to return - and
welcome back!

Your automated teller machine will ask you for one, your credit card
issuer will ask you for another and don't try to retrieve your voice
mail messages if you don't remember its code. You also need a Personal
Identification Number (PIN) in order to access Kemper's automated
telephone response system - your preassigned KemperACCESS PIN is the
last four digits of your Social Security number. 

<BR><BR>

Are you feeling overwhelmed by all the numbers and codes that today's
technologies are imposing on you? Remember that you can change your
KemperACCESS PIN at any time. Some shareholders prefer to adopt a
four-letter code (the letters correspond to numbers on the telephone keypad)
 that fits their personality and is therefore more memorable.

<BR><BR>

In order to change your PIN, just dial KemperACCESS (1-800-972-3060) and
follow its series of prompts. Of course, once you've changed your code,
be sure to keep it to yourself. 

<BR><BR>

KemperACCESS provides up-to-date Kemper fund and account information 24
hours a day, seven days a week. Your account balance, most recent
transactions, dividend earnings, current yields and returns and current
net asset values all are available from KemperACCESS. Selected account
transactions also are available.

Investment">
<BR>

To keep an eye on the progress of your investment, you can turn to many sources
of information. Here's a quick review of what Kemper provides:
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Your quarterly statement.</B> You'll find your fund's year-to-date
total return through the end of the previous month and its average
annual
total returns as of the closing date of the previous quarter shown in
the fund summary of your quarterly statement. 
<BR><BR>

Total return and average annual total return are a measure of net
investment income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments,
assuming that dividends are reinvested. While total returns are not
adjusted, average annual total returns are adjusted for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the
end of the period. Average annual total return reflects annualized
change while total return reflects aggregate change. 
<BR><BR>

Our goal is to mail your statement as close to the end of the quarter as
possible, which restricts our ability to print your fund's returns as of
the date of the close of that quarter. 
<BR><BR>
 
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B> KemperACCESS.</B> For up-to-date Kemper fund and account information 24
hours a day, seven days a week, call our automated telephone response
system. By calling 1-800-972-3060 on a touch-tone telephone, you can
receive the following information:
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Account balance <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Most recent transactions <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Dividend earnings <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Current yields and returns <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Current net asset values <BR>
<BR>

Selected account transactions also are available.
<BR><BR>

Are you a first-time caller? Don't be stumped when asked to enter your
Personal Identification Number (PIN) - your PIN is the last four digits
of your Social Security number. (You can change your PIN by following
KemperACCESS instructions.)
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B><I>Instant Profiles.</I></B> This quarterly publication presents performance
data about each fund in the Kemper family of funds. Asset size,
portfolio
composition and applicable duration and maturity information also are
reported. 
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Annual and semiannual shareholder reports.</B> A comprehensive report
of your fund's six-month performance is mailed to you twice a year. In
it
you will find an economic overview from Kemper's chief investment
officer, a question-and-answer with the fund's portfolio manager and
detailed performance and financial data.
<BR><BR>

Reminder: Please remember that the performance of your individual
investment may differ from the total return reported by your fund. The
total return on your investment will depend on when you purchased your
shares, at what price and how you handle dividends and other
distributions. Your financial representative is the best source you can
turn to for help in reviewing your Kemper investment.

When in doubt, diversify. Diversification - investment in a variety of
mutual funds, for example - is a time-tested way of reducing the risk
associated with the often unpredictable financial markets. 

<BR><BR>

As a shareholder in the Kemper family of funds, you have lots of
flexibility to diversify your holdings. Before taking any action,
however, be sure to consult with your financial representative. (If you know your representative's e-mail address, <A HREF="mailto:">click here</A> to send him or her an e-mail now.)

<BR><BR>

These shareholder privileges support diversification:

<BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>You can exchange funds. You can move all or a portion of your shares
from one Kemper fund to another fund within the same class of shares
without incurring additional sales charges (except as noted below). 

<BR><BR>

Fund exchanges are subject to the following conditions - and please
note that Kemper's exchange privilege may be modified, suspended or
terminated at any time.
	
	<BR><BR>
	
<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
	<LI>If you exchange shares into a Kemper fund in which you do not
	currently have an open account, the minimum exchange is $1,000.	
	
	<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Shares purchased by check or ACH transaction 
	may be exchanged after they have been owned for at least 15 days.
	Once shares are exchanged, they must remain in the fund for a minimum
	of 15 days before they can be exchanged again. This latter rule does not
	apply to Kemper Money Funds or Kemper Cash Reserves Fund.
	
	<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Your exchange from shares of Kemper Money Funds into any	
	other Kemper mutual fund will be subject to an applicable sales
	charge. However, exchanges of shares that you acquired through
	reinvesting your dividends are not subject to any sales charge upon
	exchange. To find out the amount of your Kemper Money Funds
	investment attributable to reinvested dividends, call Shareholder
	Services.
	
	<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Fund exchanges are taxable transactions. The Internal Revenue
	Service considers an exchange to be the redemption of shares of
	one fund (a sale) and a new investment (a purchase) into another
	fund.

</UL>

<BR>

<LI>You can arrange to exchange an amount systematically from one fund
into another fund* each month. In order to exercise the 
<A HREF="../shareholders/forms.html">
Systematic
Exchange Privilege,</A> the accounts you are exchanging to and from must
each have a value of at least $1,000. There is a $100 minimum that can
be automatically exchanged each month.

<BR><BR>

<LI>You can arrange to have dividends from one fund automatically invested
into shares of another Kemper fund*. You must have a minimum balance of
$1,000 in the account from which you are moving dividends and $1,000 in
the account into which you are investing the dividends. Shares purchased
by reinvested dividends are always bought at net asset value - you do
not pay a sales charge.

<BR><BR>

<LI>You can arrange to have a certain amount (a minimum of $50 each month)
invested into a Kemper fund account each month**. Call Shareholder
Services to learn more about Kemper's three automatic investment plans
(<A HREF="../shareholders/forms.html">Bank Direct Deposit, Payroll Direct Deposit and Government Direct
Deposit</A>). An automatic investment plan does not guarantee a profit or
protect against a loss in a declining market.

<BR><BR>

</UL>
 
*<EM> This privilege is not available to Kemper Retirement Fund Series and
Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund shareholders.</EM>
<BR>
** <EM>Investment may be subject to a sales charge. Please consult your fund
prospectus for additional information.</EM>

<BR><BR>

An investment in Kemper Money Funds is neither insured nor
guaranteed by the U.S. government. There can be no assurance that the
funds will be able to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per
share.

<BR><BR>

<EM>To obtain a Kemper Funds prospectus in addition to those you
already have, please call Shareholder Services or 
<A HREF="../prospectus.html">request one now.</A> 
The prospectus contains
more complete information including management fees and expenses. Please
read it carefully before you invest or send money.</EM>

<IMG SRC="gifs/certificates_subhead.gif" ALT="Do you have share
certificates for your fund investment?">
<BR>
Your privileges as a Kemper Funds shareholder are designed to give you
maximum flexibility to adjust your investment portfolio as the general
market conditions or your individual investment objectives change. But
if you have share certificates for your funds, you should know
that your flexibility to move your shares is limited. 

<BR><BR>

The traditional purpose of share certificates - which was to provide
proof of ownership - has been rendered almost obsolete. Today, the
securities industry has the capability to settle trades and maintain
investors' positions electronically. The existence of the paper
documents and your possession of them, though, can keep you from taking
full advantage of your privileges.

<BR><BR>

Some examples: You cannot redeem shares by telephone or wire transfer or
use the telephone exchange privilege if share certificates have been
issued. The systematic exchange and the systematic withdrawal plan are
two privileges that cannot be established for fund accounts whose shares
are held in certificate form. If you want to exchange shares that you
hold in certificate form, you must first return them to Kemper.

<BR><BR>

Considering these limitations and the risks involved if a certificate is
lost or destroyed - a bond worth 2% or more of the certificate value is
normally required to replace the certificate, Kemper strongly recommends
that you not request your shares in certificate form and that you return
any certificates you may have.

<BR><BR>

Please return your certificates <EM>by registered mail</EM> to the
following
address:

<BR><BR>

<DL><DD>
Kemper Service Company
<BR>
Special Functions Department
<BR>
811 Main Street
<BR>
Kansas City, MO 64105
</DL>
<BR><BR>

Please do not endorse your certificates or sign them in any way. Once we
receive them, you will be notified that your certificated shares have been 
deposited in your account.

Are you getting married in the morning? Or is there any other pending
event - the coming of age of a minor on a custodial account, the
addition of a companion as a joint tenant, the death of a joint tenant -
that will affect the ownership of your mutual fund account?

<BR><BR>

Any change in the ownership of your Kemper Funds account requires transferring the
shares to a new Kemper account. And, for security reasons, not all
privileges from your original account can be transferred. However, you
can easily establish privileges on your new account by completing a
Kemper Account Privileges Form, which can be requested from Shareholder
Services.

<BR><BR>

While visiting Kemper.com, you can go to <A HREF="forms.html">
Printable Forms</A> and print one or more forms that enable you to 
establish individual privileges. Just complete, sign and return 
to Kemper at the address shown on the form.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
October 21,1996</I>
<P>
<I>At present, there appear to be only three events which could
jeopardize investor confidence in the 1997 outlook.</I> The first
risk would be a resurgence of output growth during the fourth
quarter that also revived expectations of Federal Reserve tightening.
The second risk would be a surprise slowdown in the economy so
severe and protracted that it encouraged a sharp downward revision
of 1997 profit forecasts. The third risk would be a Democratic
victory in the congressional elections on a scale which gave them
the capacity to enact new legislation despite defections by some
members of their dwindling band of southern conservatives (say
a majority over 25).
<P>
<I>The dominant economic risk in the outlook continues to be the
potential for a resurgence of output growth during the next few
quarters.</I> On the basis of preliminary data, it appears that
real GDP growth slowed to only 1.5-2.0% during the third quarter
because of a pause in consumer spending during the summer. But
the economy has experienced such pauses in the past and it is
difficult to imagine the recent one being sustained when the financial
environment is so supportive of employment and income growth.
Consumer spending expanded at a 3.5% annual rate during the first
half of 1996 and nothing has happened during the interim to suggest
it should remain subdued for longer than one quarter. The University
of Michigan survey of consumer confidence held at 94.8 in early
October compared to an average of 91.5 during the second quarter
and 94.9 during the third quarter. The Conference Board survey
of confidence also held at 111.8 during September compared to
112 in August and an average of 102.8 during the second quarter.
Households are upbeat because of optimism about their personal
financial situation and the labor market. In September, 26.7%
said jobs were plentiful compared to 24.6% in June and 21.3% in
January.
<P>
As a result of the stock market boom,<I> the demand for discretionary
goods and luxuries is very robust at present.</I> The Financial
Times reports that the most recent issue of Vogue had over 700
pages of advertisements, the highest number in over a decade.
While stock ownership is concentrated among the top decile of
America's population, other income groups can benefit from wealth
creation in the equity market through a declining cost of capital
and increased business investment, not just luxury goods consumption.
The volume and value of equity IPO offerings this year could exceed
the 1993 record of $56 billion. Moody's recently reported that
the number of credit upgrades during the third quarter exceeded
downgrades by 80%, the highest ratio of upgrades to downgrades
in two decades. There were 60 upgrades accounting for $39 billion
of debt in the industrial sector compared to 14 downgrades covering
$14.2 billion of debt.
<P>
Consumer optimism also should benefit from the Federal Reserve's
decision to leave interest rates unchanged at the latest FOMC
meeting. According to the University of Michigan survey of consumer
confidence, most households had been expecting a modest interest
rate hike to occur this autumn. The decision of the Federal Reserve
to take chances on the side of growth should reassure households
that the risks of recession during the next twelve months is minimal.
<P>
The primary risk to consumer spending during the next few quarters
is that banks will react to rising loan losses on credit card
operations by imposing tougher quality standards on new applicants
and reducing the credit lines of existing customers. But surveys
of bank lending policies suggest that they are making only modest
changes in credit access. The U.S. banking sector is currently
enjoying such robust profits that few institutions will want to
sacrifice market share by significantly curtailing lending volume.
In the August survey of lending conditions, for example, 90.9%
of banks said their credit policies for small business were unchanged
compared to 5.5% which said they were easing and 3.6% which said
they were tightening.
<P>
The large expansion of the U.S. trade deficit during July and
August is encouraging many analysts to shave their third quarter
growth forecasts but the surge of imports will be partly offset
by increased inventory building. Inventories were very low at
the end of the second quarter and firms had to expand them during
the third quarter in order to get ready for the fourth quarter
retail season.
<P>
If there is a rebound in consumer spending during the fourth quarter,
total output growth will probably rise back into the 3.0-3.5%
range from only 1.5-2.5% during the third quarter. As such a high
level of output growth would probably push the unemployment rate
below 5.0%, the odds are high that the Federal Reserve would respond
by raising interest rates during late 1996 or early 1997. <I>What
remains unclear is whether the FOMC will have sufficient information
by its November 14th meeting to act shortly after the presidential
election.</I> If the upcoming government reports on employment
costs and labor market conditions show further signs of wage acceleration
as well as renewed job creation, the odds are high that the hawks
on the FOMC will revive their demands for an interest rate hike.
The demands for tightening at the late September FOMC meeting
were subdued because of Mr. Alan Greenspan's anger about the leak
to the Reuters news service of proposals from eight district banks
for a hike in the discount rate. But with unemployment well below
5.0% in regions accounting for 45% of the national labor market,
many district presidents will continue to advocate a tighter monetary
policy at the next FOMC meeting.
<P>
At the recent IMF meeting, Mr. Greenspan assured many foreign
government officials that the U.S. inflation rate is still under
control despite the country's low level of unemployment. <I>But
he also qualified his statement by stressing the unusual nature
of the current equilibrium in the labor market.</I> He said that
the traditional relationship between unemployment and wages had
broken down because of the great concern about employment stability
among American workers. The obsession with job security has greatly
lessened demands for pay growth compared to past business cycles.
But Mr. Greenspan stressed there is no way of telling how long
this job security obsession will restrain wages in the face of
a prolonged period of low unemployment.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 26, 1996</I>

<P>
According to Lindsey, the number of credit card delinquencies
has increased sharply during the past two years but the volume
of loans which is delinquent has increased by much less.  The
household sector has also been experiencing a sharp rise in its
asset values, not just its leverage.  Since 1991, the household
sector has enjoyed a $4.75 trillion capital gain on its equity
portfolio and $9.5 trillion gain on its total assets while liabilities
have increased by only $1.5 trillion.  The major risk in the debt
expansion is its concentration among lower income Americans. 
As Lindsey explained,

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;We estimate, that on average, the household sector increased
its debt-to-income ratio about 5 percentage points between 1992
and 1995.  This was the result of a 2 percentage point increase
in mortgage debt, from 59.8 percent of income to 61.9 percent
of income and a 3 percentage point increase in non-mortgage consumer
debt, from 16.9 percent of income o 19.8 percent of income.&quot;</I>

<P>

<I>&quot;Nevertheless, the survey does suggest some interesting
trends in the distribution of this debt.  Typically, households
earning more than $100,000 per year sharply reduced their debt
levels between 1992 and 1995.  The share of total household debt
held by these households fell from one-third to one-quarter and
this decline was particularly concentrated among households earning
more than $250,000 per year.  These upper income groups experienced
a decline in both the mean and median absolute level of debt outstanding,
while all other income groups increased their debt.&quot;</I>
<P>

<I>&quot;The decline in the debt levels for these groups makes
the rise in debt levels for other groups more striking.  For example,
households with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 increased
their rates of aggregate mortgage debt to aggregate income by
about one-sixth and their corresponding consumer debt to income
ratio by roughly 50 percent.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;Of course, some households increased their debt substantially
more than this, some not at all.  <I>The Survey of Consumer Finance
does indicate a striking increase in the willingness to go into
debt in the $50,00 to $100,000 income group.</I>  The proportion
of survey households in this income group reporting credit card
debt rose 13 percentage points, from 51% in 1992 to 64% in 1995,
compared to a 4 point increase, from 44 percent to 48 percent
for the whole population.  Those holding installment debt such
as auto loans increased from 52 percent to 59 percent in this
income group while the proportion in the overall population with
this type of debt was unchanged.  Nearly 60 percent of the total
increase in non-mortgage debt outstanding was assumed by households
in this income group.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;Debt increases for households earning under $50,000 were
also sizable.  The increasing attractiveness of various types
of financing tied to one's home produced a particularly large
increase in the ratio of mortgage debt to income.  It should be
noted that although the mortgage debt to income ratio increase
just 7 percentage points for households earning under $25,000,
compared to 10 to 11 percentage points for households earnings
$25,000 to $100,000, home ownership rates are much lower among
this segment of the population.  Adjusted for the lower level
of home ownership rates among this income group, mortgage debt
to income ratios increased more for these lower income groups
than for the $50,000 to $100,000 income group.  I might add that
the rapid expansion of mortgage financing among low and moderate
income groups is borne out by other data as well.  We will not
know for some time what he overall effect of this lending will
be on default and delinquency rates.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;But these data also show that while some of the added
credit extension during this period is to people in income groups
that traditionally haven't owed much debt, the bulk is not.  While
overall debt levels increased for all groups earning under $100,000,
<I>the only group to increase its relative share of such non-mortgage
debt was the $50,000 to $100,000 income group</I>.  Thus, it is
reasonable to conclude that the main reason for the household
debt expansion of recent years is not so much an extension of
debt to new households, but an increase in the debt levels taken
on by fairly well-to-do segments of the population to whom being
in debt (albeit not at these levels) is not an unusual experience.&quot;</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Governor Lindsey's testimony on the debt issue is important because
in previous speeches he has warned about the risk of leverage
excesses in the household sector.  His September testimony suggests
that consumer debt will pose risks for middle income families
during future recessions but that there will not be an abrupt
decline of borrowing or suspension of credit access by banks large
enough to trigger a business downturn during the twelve months.
<P>
The disagreements which exist in both the private sector and the
Fed about the economy's optimal growth rate will not be resolvable
for some time.  If the economy can continue to enjoy output growth
of 2.5-3.5% with no upward pressure on inflation, there will be
increasing support for the view that government data underestimates
productivity growth as well as the economy's effective capital
stock.  But as adopting such a position today would require the
Fed to take risks on the side of inflation without totally conclusive
proof that the economy's optimal growth rate is higher than 2.0-2.5%,
it is doubtful that they will remain passive if output growth
rebounds to the 3.0-3.5% range during the fourth quarter.  They
would probably tighten by at least 50 basis points during November
and December.
<P>
<I>The American forecasting community has a generally pessimistic
view of the outlook for both output growth and the resilience
of corporate profit margins next year.</I>  In the most recent
Blue Chip survey of the economic consensus, forecasters projected
output growth of 2.2% and CPI inflation of 3.0% during 1997 compared
to 2.4% for growth and 3.0% for inflation this year.  The great
contrast in the 1996 and 1997 forecasts centers on corporate profits.
 American forecasters are projecting only 3.1% profit growth next
year compared to 9.0% during 1996.  <I>The pessimism about profits
suggests that analysts expect rising wages to come at the expense
of corporate profit margins rather than higher inflation.</I>
<P>
If the U.S. forecasting consensus is correct, the Fed should be
able to fine tune another year of modest growth during 1997 with
only modest interest rate hikes or even with a stable monetary
policy.  <I>The problem with such forecasts is that it is difficult
to believe that business or household psychology will remain static
in the face of a sixth and seventh year of uninterrupted economic
expansion.</I>  If everyone concludes that the risk of a recession
is minimal, it is difficult to believe that investment plans,
hiring intentions or wage expectations will remain consistent
with output growth of only 2.2% and real interest rates of 2.0-2.5%
against the backdrop of an unemployment rate in the 4.5-5.0% range.
 As a result, the odds are high that there will be more cyclical
volatility in the economy during the year ahead than is currently
being reflected in the forecasting community.  Either the economy
will lose momentum on a sustained basis this autumn or output
growth will rebound and set the stage for a monetary policy adjustment
which will reduce output growth to only 1.0-1.5% for two quarters
during the second half of 1997or early 1998.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 2, 1996</I>

<P>
As domestic final sales grew at a 4.5% annual rate during the first quarter and 4.8% during the second quarter, the optimists are far more likely to be right than the pessimists.  The economy does not suddenly fade when final demand is resilient and there are no major policy shocks to depress confidence.  The August purchasing agent survey confirmed that the July pause in output was temporary and there is no reason for output growth to slow during September unless there is a strike in the auto industry.  As a result, the odds are high that U.S. forecasters will soon revise up their fourth quarter forecasts to the 2.5-3.5% range from the current range of 1.5-2.2%.  Such revisions will then set the stage for Fed tightening of at least 25 basis points by late September.  If the August employment report shows robust gains in job creation, the Fed could tighten even sooner but such a dramatic gesture will probably require the unemployment rate to drop to 5.2% or less.
<P>
The minutes of the early July FOMC meeting depicted the divergences which exist both in the Fed and private sector forecasting community very accurately.  The majority believed that ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
" The most likely outcome was a slowing of the expansion to a more sustainable pace and a continuation of subdued inflation.  Nevertheless, they were concerned that the risks to that outcome were tilted toward higher inflation.  While a strong economy generally was a welcome development, at current levels of resource use a continuation of rapid growth was not likely to be sustainable because it would have the potential for adding significantly to inflation pressures.    However, inflation had remained relatively damped thus far and the rise in interest rates among other factors was expected to curb demand.  Moreover, any tendency for price pressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and be reversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment.  The current stance of monetary policy could not be described in this view as clearly accommodative.  While the federal funds rate had been reduced appreciably in nominal terms over the past year, its current level on an inflation-adjusted basis seems to be only marginally below its peak prior to mid-1995.  In the circumstances, the Committee could afford to wait for more evidence to see whether additional inflation pressures were like to develop"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The dissidents from the majority view warned that continued strong output growth would undermine the Fed's inflation targets.  The minutes noted,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"A differing view gave more emphasis to prospects for rising inflation and the need for immediate action to forestall a buildup of cost and price pressures before they undermined the expansion.  There was little firm evidence that economic growth was slowing and reports of appreciable wage pressures were increasing.  Inflation expectations persisted in financial markets, and probably in product and labor markets as well; if they were allowed to worsen the Committee's long-run goal of price stability would become much more difficult to achieve.  Delaying action risked the need for a greater adjustment in policy at a later date with possible disruption to the economy"

<P>
The committee decided to approve only a change in their policy bias, not an actual interest rate hike, because of the psychological impact of raising interest rates.  The minutes said "Some noted that a policy tightening action would tend to have a more pronounced effect than usual because it would indicate a shift in the direction of policy and might generate expectations of further tightening". 
<P>
At the FOMC meeting in late September, the Fed will probably have new evidence of the economy expanding at a rate close to 3.0% but few signs of accelerating inflation at the retail level.  The factors which will force the Fed to hike interest rates will be concern about the intermediate term inflation consequence of the unemployment rate dropping close to 5.0% and large increases in long-term bond yields.  The fact that the two dissenting votes on monetary policy during the past nine months have come from district presidents in the middle west (Minneapolis, Kansas City) also suggests that the district presidents could play a more important role than usual in the conduct of monetary policy this autumn.  As a result of their location in strong growth regions such as the middle west, the rocky mountain states and California, they are more aware of how low unemployment and aggressive bank lending practices are affecting business behavior than the Washington based governors who depend upon government statistical reports and staff forecasts which often lag behind developments in the private sector.  The fact that the Fed's own staff has greatly underestimated the economy's growth rate this year will probably also increase the determination of the district presidents to become more vociferous about the potential inflation risks of the economy expanding at an above trend growth rate for another year.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
July 29, 1996</I>

<P>
The slowdown in the high technology sector is of greater important than in the
past because of the role which it has played in sustaining growth since 1994 as
demand for autos and housing slowdown.<p>
Business expenditures on office and computer machinery now accounts for about
1.8% of real GDP compared to 0.6% during 1990 and less than 0.2% during the
early 1980's.  Its nominal share of GDP is about 1.0% compared to 0.7% in 1990
and 1.1% in 1984.  According to Hewlett Packard, the nominal growth rate of
computer spending could slow to 0-5% by the first quarter of 1997.  Under such
a scenario, the real growth rate would drop to about 5-10% from 30-40% during
1995 and early 1996.  While such a slowdown will represent a major negative
swing from the sector's previous growth rate, it is by no means an
unprecedented adjustment.  During the mid-1980's, the growth rate of office and
computer equipment spending fluctuated in a range of plus 80% at annual rates
to only slightly positive growth.  In the 1990 recession, real spending
actually fell by over 20%.<p>
<p>
The other investment sector which has enjoyed buoyant during recent years is
communications equipment.  It's share of real GDP has expanded to .95%  from
.7% during 1992 and a previous peak of just under 1.0% during the mid-1980's.
The growth rate of communications equipment investment has already slowed from
25% during mid-1994 to 6-7% recently.<p>
<p>
<i>Since the economy's two most vulnerable high technology sectors account for
less than 3.0% of GDP, they will not be able to change the economy's overall
direction if other sectors are enjoying moderate growth.</i>   The correction
occurring in high technology capital investment is a far more important
phenomena for the stock market than for the economy because of the leadership
role which technology companies have played in the market during recent
years.<p>
<p>
As a result of the buoyant outlook for corporate profits and the high level of
capacity utilization rates, other capital spending sectors should continue to
enjoy moderate growth this year.  Industrial equipment accounts for about 1.8%
of both nominal and real GDP.  It has already slowed from a growth rate of over
15% during late 1994 to about 6-7% recently.  The truck and bus sector of
equipment investment is highly cyclical and has already experienced a major
adjustment.  Its growth rate has dropped from a peak of nearly 40% in late 1993
to only 2-3% recently.  The sector has a history of experiencing sub-cycle
contractions even during periods of steady growth in the economy, so it could
continue to decline during the second half of 1996 and then could rebound
during 1997 (as it did during the sub-cycle of the mid-1980's).<p>
<p>
The arguments for the Fed to tighten in the face of these risks to final demand
growth center on inflation expectations in the private sector and the
uncertainty which exists about the magnitude of any late 1996 slowdown in the
midst of a financial environment which appears to be highly supportive of
growth.<p>
<p>
The Fed has been able to fine tune the economy during the 1990's without
risking a recession in part because of the confidence which it enjoys among
investors and business decision makers.  If they saw the Fed remaining passive
in the face of rising wages in order to sustain a prolonged period of full
employment, they would start to increase their forecasts of the intermediate
term inflation outlook.  While the adjustments might be small at first, there
would be a clear and increasing tendency for analyst to assume a core inflation
rate closer to 4.0% than 3.0% by late 1997.<p>
<p>
While there are numerous reasons why final demand could slow in some important
sectors during the next nine months, <i>the financial environment in the U.S.
remains so buoyant that it is difficult to imagine a prolonged period of output
growth below 2.0%.</i>  Banks are competing so aggressively to make loans that
most small business owners can now chose between four and five potential
lenders if they have to finance a new investment or a sale of their business.
The boom in the stock market and the expansion of the mutual fund industry has
produced a very buoyant environment for new equity IPO's and the sale of
non-investment grade bonds.  The number of equity I.P.O.'s was 428 during the
first half of 1996 compared to 573 during all of 1995, 571 during 1994, and a
peak of 665 during 1993.  These I.P.O.'s raised about $27.2 billion during the
first half of 1996 compared to $28.9 billion last year, $22.9 billion during
1994 and $34.0 billion during 1993.  The peak for I.P.O. financing during the
1980's, by contrast, was $17.7 billion during 1986.  The search for higher
yields also has helped to revitalize the so-called junk bond market.  In the
first half of 1996, Wall Street sold 92 new non-investment grade bond offering
compared to 159 during 1995, 190 during 1994, and 343 during 1993.  The funds
raised were $17.1 billion during the first half of 1996, $28.8 billion during
1995, $31.5 billion during 1994, and $54.4 billion during 1993.  The previous
peak in non-investment grade bond financing was 218 deals worth $30.5 billion
during 1986.  <p>
<p>
It is difficult to imagine a self-reinforcing slowdown when capital is so
readily available to the entrepreneurial companies responsible for most of
America's job creation.  Meanwhile, the appreciation of the stock market has
boosted the net worth of the household sector by almost $2 billion since 1994.
If the household sector spends only 5% of its capital gains, the potential
boost to consumer spending is $100 billion.  The correction now occurring  in
the equity market will inhibit new wealth creation but the market has been
robust for so long that wealth losses are unlikely to be a depressing influence
on household spending until next year.<p>
<p>
<b>Are the Financial Markets Focusing on the Election?</b><p>
<p>
The major focus of media commentary about the stock market during July was the
risk that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates.  <i>But equity
investors were probably also concerned about the continuing poor performance of
former Senator Robert Dole in the presidential opinion polls.</i>  Dole has
performed so poorly in the polls that there is growing concern about the
ability of the Republican Party to retain control of Congress.  Wall Street has
long perceived the president to be a superior campaigner but investors had
expected Dole to benefit from the conviction of the Governor of Arkansas  for
corruption in June as well as his resignation from the Senate.  Clinton's
seeming immunity to his scandals has so unnerved the Republicans that they are
about to announce a major tax cut program in order to bolster Dole's electoral
appeal.  As Dole has devoted his whole career to reducing federal deficits and
criticizing supply side economists, it is far from clear that the new strategy
will work but his new tax proposals will at least allow him to reinvoke the
optimistic message of Ronald Reagan during the early 1980's.<p>
<p>
<i>The August political conventions will provide the next important test of
investor sentiment about the election.</i>  As political conventions focus
great media attention on candidates, they typically give a boost to the
challenger who is attempting to establish credibility as an alternative to the
incumbent.  As Clinton is already 15-20 points ahead, investor concern about
Dole will evolve into alarm about both the presidential and congressional races
if he does not emerge from the convention narrowing the gap with Clinton by at
least 10 points.<p>
<p>
The prospect of the Republicans losing control of Congress is potentially
disturbing to Wall Street for three reasons,<p>
<p>
<i>First, the 1996 election poses a unique historic challenge for both
parties.</i>  No Democratic president has won two consecutive elections since
Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930's.  The Republican Party has not controlled the
Congress for  two consecutive terms since the 1920's.  If the Republicans lose
control again in 1996, it will suggest that the public is turning away from
their themes of deficit reduction, slowing growth of entitlement spending, and
promoting lower marginal income tax rates.<p>
<p>
Secondly, there has been a profound change in the character of the Democratic
Party in the Congress as a result of recent Republican victories.  <i>The
Republican Party now has 77 of the 125 house seats of the old southern
Confederacy compared to 48 in 1992, 34 in 1972 and 6 in 1960.</i>  On the basis
of pending Democratic retirements, the Republicans may even be able to claim
control over two thirds of the seats in the south by next year even if they
lose their overall majority.  As a result of the Republican takeover of the
south, the Democrats now depend far more upon the urban centers of the
northeast, the middle west and California for their congressional membership.
<i>This geographic shift in the composition of the parties suggests that future
Democratic committee chairman would be far more supportive of federal spending
programs and other forms of government intervention in the economy than both
the current Republican chairmen and past Democratic chairmen.</i><p>

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
June 21, 1996</I>

<P>
While the government's newly revised labor market data point to
a much stronger economy than analysts anticipated a few months
ago, not every survey of labor market conditions is as robust.
Dun and Bradstreet recently published the results of its latest
survey of business hiring intentions for 1996. The survey is projecting
that firms will create only 1.4 million new jobs this year compared
to 3 million jobs in last year's survey. The survey reports that
small firms will hire more cautiously but that large firms will
expand their hiring -- a reversal of the trend which has prevailed
during recent years. It said,
<P>
&quot;About 21 percent of the nation's smallest businesses expect
to add jobs this year. As a group, mid-sized firms were slightly
more optimistic, with roughly 28 percent predicting higher employment
levels. However, the 199,000 jobs expected among firms with 20
to 99 employees is down 56 percent in comparison with last year.
Firms with 100 to 999 employees expect to add about 387,000 jobs,
down 43 percent from last year. Businesses with between 1,000
and 9,999 employees say they will hire 185,000 new employees,
down form 268,000 last year.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Only the nation's largest employers predict faster job growth
in 1996 than in 1995, a significant reversal of the downsizing
trend of the past decade. Businesses employing more than 10,000
workers expect to add about 113,000 jobs this year. That represents
an increase of 47 percent from last year's survey.&quot;
<P>
As the payroll survey of employment has already increased by 1.8
million jobs this year, the D&amp;B survey is either wrong or
the economy is poised for a sudden slowing of employment growth.
But the survey may be misleading this year because firms appear
to be concerned about labor shortages, not just concerns over
slower growth of the economy. As the survey noted,
<P>
&quot;A high percentage of U.S. employers are finding it difficult
to locate qualified workers. Thirty-six percent of all firms say
they have trouble finding qualified workers. High-tech and skilled
labor markets are reporting the most serious labor shortage. Fifty-two
percent of construction firms, for instance, reported trouble
finding qualified workers, and 41 percent of manufacturers had
difficulty. Among the transportation/public utilities, retail
trade and services sectors, 38 percent, 37 percent and 34 percent,
respectively, of all firms surveyed said they had trouble finding
qualified workers.&quot;
<P>
<B>It is also possible that American firms have underestimated
their employment needs because they have been influenced by the
consensus among U.S. forecasters that 1996 would be a year of
sluggish output growth</B>. According to the June 10th Blue Chip
survey of the U.S. forecasting community, forecasters have increased
their expectations for second quarter growth to 3.3% from 2.1%
during March and 2.7% during May, but they continue to project
a sharp slowing to growth rates of only 2.3% and 2.0% during the
final two quarters of the year. Those forecasts are no higher
than March's despite the fact that first half growth will be twice
as high as most forecasters projected in January.
<P>
The surprising resilience of the U.S. economy since January creates
some potentially challenging questions for the Federal Reserve.
Should it reverse its January easing move with a 25 basis point
rate hike at its July third FOMC meeting? Should it delay any
tightening move until it has more clear-cut evidence on the third
quarter outlook and tighten at the late August meeting, which
will coincide with the Democratic national convention? Should
it wait until the July employment report in early August and change
its recent custom of adjusting policy only at FOMC meetings by
making an adjustment in response to new information appearing
between the FOMC meetings? As inflation has remained remarkably
subdued despite the economy's strong performance this year, should
the Fed simply revise up its estimate of the economy's optimal
potential growth rate and not tighten until there is clear-cut
evidence of accelerating inflation?
<P>
<B>The odds are high that the Fed will raise interest rates at
some point this summer.</B> The big questions center on whether
the policy adjustment will occur in July or August and whether
they will occur on the actual day of FOMC meetings. As inflation
has been well behaved and there is still no consensus in the private
sector about the second half outlook, the Fed can rationalize
remaining passive at its July meeting. But if the July data appearing
in early August suggests output growth will remain close to 3.0%
during the third quarter, bond yields will rise to at least 7.50%
and intensify pressure on the Fed to hike short-term interest
rates. As the Fed will probably not want its tightening action
to coincide with a major political convention, it could take advantage
of the early August data reports to act a few weeks ahead of the
FOMC meeting.
<P>
With an election looming for both the White House and the Congress,
there will be political criticism of any Fed tightening this summer,
but Mr. Greenspan will have little problem justifying his action.
<B>If output growth remains at 3.0% or higher during the second
half of 1995, the unemployment rate will drop to 5.0% by year
end.</B> Despite the recent turmoil in the copper market, there
will also be a firming of industrial commodity prices and the
purchasing agent price index will probably climb back into the
60-70 range from 50 during May and 40 during April.
<P>
While it would be natural for the administration to frown upon
Fed tightening during the summer before a presidential election,
<B>the fact is it would be far more prudent for the Fed to move
quickly this summer than to delay policy adjustments until the
autumn.</B> As the Fed is still in a fine turning mode, any policy
adjustment this summer would only have a marginal impact on the
growth rate of output and real income this autumn. But procrastination
by the Fed could set the stage for large and destabilizing fluctuations
in bond and equity prices. If the Fed adheres to a passive policy
this summer, the Dow Jones Industrial Index could shoot up to
6,000 and push the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP
to 92-93% compared to its previous peak of 81.0% in 1929. If the
Fed continued to be surprised by the economy's resilience during
the third quarter, it could feel compelled to tighten by 50 basis
points or more during the autumn and set the stage for a major
equity market correction. <B>If the equity market correction was
large and compressed into a few days (as it was in October, 1987),
it could have a far more damaging impact on the economic credibility
of the Clinton administration than modest Fed tightening this
summer.</B> 
<P>
Fed officials are reluctant to comment in public about the stock
market but they are privately apprehensive about both the level
of equity prices and the extraordinary flow of retail money into
equity mutual funds. <B>As a result, they should understand the
logic of adjusting interest rates this summer rather than delaying
policy changes in a way which might maximize the risk of a financial
accident later this year.</B> Fed fine tuning will not eliminate
all stock market risk in the outlook. If the economy continues
to expand at a rate of 3.0-4.0% despite the Fed hiking short-term
interest rates by 25-50 basis points, the Fed could feel compelled
to push short-term interest rates all the way back to 6.0% or
even higher. In such a scenario, it would be difficult to avoid
a major stock market correction during the fourth quarter. But
as the Fed tightening would be spread over a period of three to
six months, investors would have time to adjust to the policy
change and the risk would diminish of a 1987 style stock market
crash.
<P>
<B>Tobin's Q and Market Prices</B> 
<P>
There has been extensive media discussion during recent weeks
about the risk of a large stock market correction occurring autonomously
from any monetary tightening because of the current ratio of share
prices to asset replacement costs. The so-called Tobin's Q ratio
of share prices to asset replacement costs is now at 1.7 compared
to a range of 0.3 to 1.4 before 1994. The Tobin Q ratio is computed
on the basis of Federal Reserve data which shows that the U.S.
corporate sector has a current net worth value of just under $4
trillion compared to a stock market which is now capitalized at
over $7 trillion. In 1994, the components of net worth were equipment
valued at $2.009 trillion, inventory valued at $1.037 trillion
and real estate valued at $2.1702 trillion. The real estate value
includes buildings worth $2.078 trillion and land worth $92.2
billion. The Fed is still compiling data for 1995 but on a preliminary
basis it is projecting that corporate current value net worth
will rise to $4247.3 billion, with the components consisting of
$2.233 trillion of real estate, $2.089 trillion of equipment and
$1.145 trillion of inventory.
<P>
The equipment and building components of the current value estimates
of corporate net worth are computed with broad indices of inflation
in the capital goods sector. The estimates of land value are based
on national surveys of real estate prices. As there has been deflation
in many high technology capital goods industries during the 1990's,
the value of non-residential plant and equipment has increased
by only 12% since 1990 despite large increases in capital investment.
<B>The corporate sector's land values, by contrast, have fallen
by almost 90% from their peak of $940 billion in 1989. While there
is no doubt that land values have fallen during the 1990's, it
is far from clear that the decline has been as steep as the Federal
Reserve data suggests</B>. If land values were restated to show
a decline of only 50%, corporate net worth would increase by $380
billion and the Tobin Q ratio would decline to 1.58 from 1.7.
If land values were still at 1989 levels, corporate net worth
would increase by almost $900 billion and Tobin's Q would decline
to 1.42.

<P>

<B>The Dollar Remains Firm</B>
<BR>

<P>
The prospect of the U.S. being the first G-7 country to raise
interest rates this year suggests that the dollar will retain
the bias towards firmness which has been apparent during recent
weeks.
<P>
The German economy should improve during the summer but the Bundesbank
is unlikely to tighten until mid-1997 at the earliest.  Germany
has a large output gap and Bundesbank officials favor a weak D-mark
in order to discourage support from German industry for the introduction
of a new European currency.  The major constraint on further easing
this spring is the industrial unrest now occurring in Germany's
public sector as well as Bundesratt opposition to Chancellor Kohl's
proposed cuts in government expenditure.
<P>
<B>In Japan, there are increasing signs of economic recovery but
officials are downplaying the possibility of monetary tightening
because of the lingering credit quality problems of the financial
system.</B>  Tokyo journalists also report that recent bureaucratic
shuffles at the Ministry of Finance have increased the odds of
Dr. Eisuke Sakakibara being reappointed for another year as the
Director General of the international finance bureau.  As Dr.
Sakakibara has been a strong promoter of a firm dollar with both
Japanese investment firms and the New York hedge funds, his reappointment
should be a psychological plus for the U.S. dollar.  He does not
favor pushing the dollar all the way to 130 yen, as some press
reports have suggested, but he will certainly try to hold the
yen dollar rate in a trading range of 105-110 in order to promote
further improvement in Japanese corporate profitability.
<P>
The only potential negative factor for the dollar during the next
few quarters is increasing political risk in the U.S. and reduced
political risk in other countries.  It now appears that Mr. Yeltsin
will win the Russian presidential election and lessen the danger
of investors selling the currencies of Germany and other central
European countries because of a communist victory.  In the U.S.,
by contrast, <B>the opinion polls suggest that President Clinton
could win such a large victory in this November's presidential
election that he might be able to pull many new Democrats into
Congress with him</B>.  According to some pollsters, the Republicans
have potentially thirty vulnerable House freshmen while the Democrats
are likely to lose about four to six open seats in the south.
 If there is a net swing of 24 seats, the Democrats would be able
to retake control of the House and elect their majority leader,
Rep. Richard Gephardt, as Speaker.  The market would be concerned
about a Democratic recapture of the House for three reasons. 

<P>
First, Rep. Gephardt has often been an advocate of protectionist
trade policies in the past and was hostile to the administration's
financial rescue program for Mexico.  
<P>
Secondly, the Democratic Party has lost so many of its traditional
southern seats that it is a party increasingly dominated by the
big cities of the northeast, the middle west, and California as
well as their lower middle class suburbs.  Whereas the Democratic
Party had over 95% of the southern Congressional delegation as
recently as the early 1960's, it now has only one quarter of the
seats in the old Confederacy and could emerge from the next election
with only 10-15%.  <B>As a result, many of the new committee chairman
in a Democratic controlled Congress would be from poor urban districts
in cities such as Detroit, New York and Los Angeles.</B>  They
would be far more left of center on many economic policy issues,
such as public spending and labor market regulation, than both
the current Republican chairmen and the past Democratic committee
chairmen.
<P>
Finally, many investors would view a Democratic victory as a major
lost opportunity for structural reform of social security, Medicare
and other federal programs.  As the Republicans have not controlled
Congress for two consecutive terms since the 1920's and might
well engage in a demoralizing fratricidal conflict if they lose
control again after only one term, it is unclear when an opportunity
for structural reform would re-emerge.  In fact, the markets are
confronted with a unique set of historical circumstances this
year.  No Democratic President has won re-election for two consecutive
terms since the days of Franklin Roosevelt while the Republicans
have not controlled Congress for two consecutive terms since the
1920's.  Hence, if one were to extrapolate on the basis of history,
they would project that Senator Robert Dole would emerge as the
next president and that Richard Gephardt would be the new House
Speaker.  The odds of such an outcome appear modest today because
a Dole victory would probably guarantee Republican retention of
the Congress while a Clinton victory would not insure a Democratic
takeover of the House unless he won by a landslide.  But unless
Senator Dole rallies in the polls, the markets could become alarmed
about the prospect of the Republicans suffering an electoral debacle
this November.
<P>
Despite the current wide gap in the opinion polls, <B>it would
be premature for investors to conclude that the President is assured
of re-election</B>.  The Dole campaign is currently suffering
from money problems and his responsibilities in the Senate, but
four factors suggest that Senator Dole should enjoy a significant
improvement during the autumn.  First, the Republicans have a
strong hold on several southern and western states with about
160-170 electoral votes.  Secondly, the President has been pursuing
re-election by emphasizing Republican themes, such as a balanced
budget and family values.  While the strategy has worked so far,
the media could ultimately portray him as such a cynical manipulator
of public opinion that it will backfire.  Thirdly, the recent
conviction of the Governor of Arkansas and Mr. Clinton's former
real estate partners on various allegations of fraud will force
the media to probe further into allegations of corruption during
his tenure as Governor of Arkansas.  As Arkansas has many of the
characteristics of an emerging market, press scrutiny of the state
coupled with the Starr investigations of the first family's financial
affairs could easily revive doubts about the president's character.
 Finally, despite Mr. Dole's long history in U.S. public life,
pollsters working with voter focus groups have discovered that
most Americans know very little about him.  At one Republican
focus group, for example, only 25% of the voters were aware of
Mr. Dole's record during World War Two.  As the presidential campaign
intensifies and the media focuses more closely on the character
of the candidates, Senator Dole is likely to benefit at the expense
of the president.
<P>
<I><B>To summarize,</B></I> the U.S. economy is likely to expand
at a 3.0-4.0% annual rate during the second quarter because of
steady growth of consumption and investment as well as corporate
restocking of inventories.  There is still widespread disagreement
about the outlook for third quarter growth but recent reports
on employment intentions and capital goods demand suggest that
output growth should remain close to 3.0%.  As a result, there
will be further increases in the economy's level of resource utilization
which could encourage the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary
policy at the FOMC meeting in early July or late August.  The
recovery now underway in the economies of Latin America, China
and other developing countries, coupled with the cyclical upturn
projected for Europe and Japan also suggest that world output
growth could exceed 4.0% this year and next year for the first
time since 1988.  The dollar should remain firm because of the
strength of the U.S. economy and the desire of government officials
in both Germany and Japan to encourage depreciation of the D-mark
and the yen.

<P>


The performance of the financial markets will also play an important role in the FOMC thinking. <B>If bond yields rise well above 7.0% while the stock market remains firm, more governors will be willing to tighten policy in order to restrain investors' inflation expectations</B>.  Conversely, if rising bond yields produce a large stock market correction, there will be more reluctance to tighten because of concern about household wealth losses.  The personal savings rate has begun to decline after rising sharply last year, but it could easily change direction if households become pessimistic about the economy because of  falling equity prices.
<P>

If the Federal Reserve does raise interest rates this summer, it will be the first G-7 central bank to break with the pattern of global easing which has prevailed since early 1995.  Japanese interest rates have fallen to such low levels that the next policy change has to be a rate hike, but such a hike is unlikely to occur until late this year because of the credit quality problems of the Japanese financial system.  Monetary policy in Germany is likely to remain easy because of the government's moves towards fiscal restraint, the weakness of the German economy, and the moral hazard problems created by the increasingly probable replacement of the D-mark by a new European currency in the year 1999.  Since Chancellor Kohl's coalition  won a decisive victory in the German lander elections during late March, both financial markets and European central bank officials have begun to assign a much higher probability to the introduction of a new European currency in the year 1999.  French bond yields have fallen sharply in relation to German bond yields while the German yield curve has remained positively sloped because of investor apprehension about the loss of  the D-mark.  Bundesbank officials have many doubts about the viability of a new European currency, but they cannot stop Chancellor Kohl from going forward unless there is some exogenous political shock which erodes his power.   <B>Instead of actively resisting the introduction of the Euro, many Bundesbank officials have decided to encourage a gradual devaluation of the D-mark in order to lessen the support of German industry for switching to a new European currency</B>.  As foreign investors own nearly 40% of Germany's public debt, the Bundesbank cannot push this devaluation strategy too far, but there is little doubt that they would be willing to accept a 10-15% decline against the U.S. dollar and the yen as well as smaller corrections against other European currencies.
<P>

The prospect of Germany and other European countries pursuing an easy monetary policy in order to weaken their currencies, coupled with the likelihood of Japanese monetary policy remaining on hold through the autumn, increases the possibility of a positive growth surprise occurring in the G-7 countries next year.  The easy monetary conditions in the G-7 countries are also reviving capital flows to the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Africa and thus increasing the odds that they will enjoy stronger recoveries as well.  A few developing countries, such as Malaysia and Thailand, are raising interest rates in order to constrain domestic inflation pressures, but they are still likely to experience growth rates in excess of 7.0%.  The Yeltsin government is pursuing such populist fiscal policies in order to win the upcoming Russian presidential election, it will certainly have to reverse course if it wins, but the emergence of a large private sector in Russia should still permit positive output growth in the future after a long period of contraction.  After three years of tightening monetary policy in order to restrain inflation, China also has begun to relax monetary policy during recent days.  On  May 1st, it announced a reduction in the cost of working capital loans from 12.06% to 10.98%.  These interest rate adjustments also followed a selective easing of credit rationing policies late last year.  If we measure GDP on the basis of purchasing power parity adjustments to compensate for price differentials, Europe accounts for about 25% of world output, the U.S. for about 22%, Japan for about 9%, and China for about 8%.  <B>Monetary policy has therefore shifted towards an expansionary direction in about two-thirds of the world economy during the past four quarters and the shift is not yet completed in several countries</B>.  This monetary policy bias suggests that the world economy will become increasingly buoyant during the next six quarters, even if the U.S. economy enjoys only a moderately positive sub-cycle recovery during the second half of 1996.  As a result, <B>the IMF is predicting 4.3% growth in world output during 1997 compared to 3.8% this year, and 3.5 % in 1999</B>.
<P>

To summarize, the surprising resilience of final demand in the first quarter is provoking new discussion about Fed tightening  during the summer, but the FOMC is unlikely to support such tightening unless it sees clear evidence that output growth will remain above 2.5% on a sustained basis and industrial commodity prices start to rise more sharply.  The best leading indicators of a monetary policy change will be the performance of the purchasing agent price index, retail sales, and the bond market.  The generally accommodative tone of monetary policy in Europe and Japan suggests that the odds are increasing of a positive growth surprise in the world economy during 1997 and 1998.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
March 25, 1996</I>


<P>


  While central bank policy is likely to remain passive in the face of a moderate rebound in U.S. output growth, <B>there is a risk that bond yields could be more volatile.</B> The growth of hedge funds and other leveraged investors has given the bond market a far more speculative flavor than the equity market during recent years and thus bond prices often react far more violently to new economic information than other financial assets. In 1996, the U.S. bond market will also have to contend with volatility in the political outlook of investors, not just fluctuations in the business cycle.  

<P>

  On the basis of 30 year bond yields, real long-term interest rates are currently just under 4.0% in the U.S., 5.0% in Britain, and well over 5.0% in France and Germany. The ten-year bonds of Japan yield about 3.0% in real terms while in Switzerland they yield about 3.5%. In late December 1995, by contrast, real and nominal long-term interest rates were about 100 basis points lower in the U.S. and Europe.  

<P>

  The one event still capable of producing a positive bond market surprise in the face of stronger output growth during the second quarter would be a successful U.S. budget compromise. <B>The White House is sufficiently concerned about the large rise in U.S. bond yields since January that is has been putting out feelers to Senator Robert Dole about pursuing a new budget agreement.</B> The White House has long viewed him as a more amenable to a compromise than the House Republican leadership and his success in the Republican primaries has greatly increased his potential freedom of action. But despite the opportunity for new negotiations created by the Dole victory, there are still major hurdles to an agreement. The major case for the Republicans to accept a compromise is that they have fallen sharply in the opinion polls and many voters now perceive their attempt at confrontational budget negotiations to have been a failure. The barriers to a budget agreement are congressional and White House perceptions of the tradeoffs between improving the performance of the economy and achieving no deal. The Republicans fear that a budget agreement could help the president more than them by lowering bond yields and boosting the housing market. The White House fears that any compromise which trims Medicare spending will deny them the opportunity to engage in demagogic attacks on the Republicans in states with large populations of retired people, such as Florida. In short, neither side perceives overwhelming advantages to a deal while both sides perceive potential downside. As a result of these constraints, the odds of a deal will probably remain below 50% unless the economy is so strong during the second quarter that bond yields shoot over 7.0% and equity prices fall sharply. In such a scenario, the president would offer major concessions to obtain a deal.  

<P>

  While most investors are relieved that Senator Robert Dole has won firm control of the Republican nomination and thwarted the challenge posed by Patrick Buchanan, they are not optimistic about his prospects in November. They perceive him to be an older and less dynamic campaigner than the president. They also perceive that a third party candidacy by Ross Perot or Patrick Buchanan will draw votes largely at the expense of Dole. <B>They believe that Dole has a solid base of about 150 electoral votes in the South and West but they do not think that he will be able to carry California or the Great Lakes states unless the economy deteriorates sharply,</B> there is a foreign policy disaster, or the various investigations of the first family's financial affairs in the 'emerging market' state of Arkansas produce a formal indictment of Mrs. Clinton, not just press stories about sleazy business relationships. The special federal prosecutor, Mr. Ken Starr, has indicted the Governor of Arkansas and may obtain new evidence to use against the first family if he can obtain a conviction which encourages other Arkansas politicians to plea bargain at the expense of the president. But as the president has already survived four years of rumors about his personal life and financial affairs in Arkansas, the markets will remain skeptical about his vulnerability without major new disclosures.  

<P>

  While the president is clearly ahead at the present time, <B>there are several factors which could still produce a Dole victory.</B> First, the president received only 43% of the vote in 1992 and thus would have lost if Ross Perot had not taken 19% of the vote largely at the expense of the Republicans. Secondly, as the American president is both head of state and head of government, the issue of character looms large in public perceptions of the office. Senator Dole can campaign as a World War Two veteran who has devoted a lifetime to public service while nearly half of the electorate perceives the president to be a decadent, if not corrupt, member of the most self-indulgent generation in American history (the baby boomers). Thirdly, it is doubtful that Ross Perot will be able to come anywhere close to matching the 19% share of the vote which he received four years ago. In 1992, he was a new face and the opinion polls briefly suggested that he might win the election. In 1996, it is widely accepted that a vote for Ross Perot is ultimately a vote for Bill Clinton. Nor can Perot attract the support of people who voted for Patrick Buchanan because of his clear uncompromising position on abortion. Ross Perot supports the right to abortion, so the pro-life movement has no alternative but to return to the Republican Party. Finally, in contrast to George Bush four years ago, Dole should be able to attract the support of most conservatives because he provides them with an unprecedented opportunity to influence U.S. public policy through Republican control of both the White House and the Congress for the first time since the era of Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. The fact that Dole comes from a tradition of political moderation may offend some conservatives but the fact is the American people would probably not support the election of an ultra-conservative President and Congress at the same time. They like the checks and balances which come from dividing power between executive and legislative branches of different political persuasions. In fact, the president himself has effectively co-opted much of the Republicans' rhetoric so that he can campaign as the candidate who will eliminate the budget deficit in a humane way, not through savage cuts in popular middle class entitlement programs. It will be far easier for Senator Dole to portray himself as the president who can achieve his party's agenda without threatening ordinary people than it would have been for some of his party's other candidates.  

<P>

  As a result of these factors, the American presidential race is still wide open. The President's lead should narrow during the next few months but could re-open if the Republicans permit their convention to be dominated by extremist rhetoric or if Patrick Buchanan joins Ross Perot on a third party ticket which captures a large share of the Christian evangelical vote.  

<P>

  The Republicans are aware of these risks, so they should be able to avoid the mistakes which plagued them at the 1992 convention but Senator Dole will still have to demonstrate far more skill at coalition building with his party's right wing populists than was possible for George Bush.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
February 29, 1996</I>

<P>

The stagnation of real wages also has coincided with a dramatic expansion of pay among many senior executives as well as a stock market boom which has produced large gains for them on their stock option programs. Popular magazines, such as Newsweek, have played upon class resentments over such differentials in pay by running front page stories about the rise of the "Overclass" (the technocratic elite profiting from the new world economic order) and "Corporate Killers" (a recent cover story on chief executives responsible for large layoffs). In the mid-1980's, there also was considerable media discussion about the social side-effects of corporate restructuring through takeover activity but the restructuring of that era did not provoke as much resentment because the overall growth rate of the economy and real income was much stronger. As many of the takeover artists of the mid-1980's violated federal security laws, the public also derived some satisfaction from watching some of the most prominent players go to jail. The corporate restructuring of the 1990's is being driven by factors very different from the takeover boom of the mid-1980's. As U.S. equity price/earnings multiples are much higher today than they were ten years ago, the dominant factors driving the restructuring are technology, international competition and the cumulative impact of several years of low inflation on corporate cost control strategies, not Wall Street's search for new transaction fees. As a result of the explosive growth of mutual fund ownership, a far larger share of the American population is benefiting from the impact of company rationalization on profits and share prices than ever before but the linkage between share ownership and employment is much weaker among ordinary corporate employees than among senior executives. According to Labor Department data, only 13% of U.S. employees participated in deferred profit sharing plans during 1993 while just 3% of this group belonged to employee stock ownership programs (ESOPS) and less than 1.0% received stock bonuses. The low level of stock ownership among company employees has helped to enhance the appeal of the Buchanan attack on corporate America despite the tremendous growth occurring in public equity ownership through mutual funds, individual retirement accounts and other tax deferred family savings programs. In a few weeks, a special White House taskforce will issue a report examining the feasibility of investing some portion of the social security trust fund in the equity market. Such a development would create practically universal equity ownership in the U.S. but it is unlikely to occur for at least three years.
<P>

The OECD recently published a study on income distribution in the major industrial countries. <B>The OECD data suggests that the U.S. has significantly more income inequality than other industrial countries primarily because of the very small share of income accruing to people in the bottom quintile of the population.</B> In the U.S., the bottom 20% of the population received about 5.7% of income in 1986 compared to 7.8% in Canada, 10.6% in Sweden and 7.0% in Britain. The share of income accruing to the wealthiest 10% of the population in the U.S. was about 24% in 1986 compared to 22% in Canada, 23% in Britain, 18% in Sweden, and 22% in Australia. In developing countries, such as Brazil and Mexico by contrast, the top 10% of households receive over 40% of personal income while the bottom 20% received only about 2.0-3.0%. The offset to this inequality is that affluent Americans pay high effective marginal income tax rates by international standards. In 1986, people in the top quintile of U.S. income paid 53% of all taxes compared to 3.8% for people in the bottom quintile. In Canada, the top quintile paid 46.5% of all taxes compared to 3.6% for the bottom quintile. In Britain, the top quintile paid 46.5% of all taxes compared to 4.5% for the bottom quintile. 
<P>

The U.S. also enjoys remarkable social mobility between income classes. According to a recent research report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, only about 5.1% of the people in the bottom income quintile of the population during 1975 were still in that quintile by 1991. Instead, 29% had moved to the top income quintile, 30% to the second income quintile, 21% to the third highest income quintile, and 14.6% to the fourth. Among people in the fourth income quintile, 37.0% also had moved to the highest income quintile while another 32.6% had moved to the second highest income quintile. The fact is that many of the people in the bottom income quintile are elderly and living on savings income, not wages, or young and thus poised to increase their income sharply as they gain work experience. <B>The marital status of people also has a major impact on their income rankings.</B> Among white people, 25% of households headed by single females have income below $10,000 compared to 4.7% for married couples. Among black people, 44% of households headed by single females have incomes below $10,000 compared to 9.8% for married couples.
<P>

The factor which appears to explain the magnitude of American income inequality compared to other industrial countries is the low level of transfer payments to the poor. In 1986, transfer payments accounted for only 13.7% of median income in the bottom quintile of the U.S. population compared to 32.4% for Britain, 18.3% for Canada, 27.0% for Sweden and 22.5% for Australia. The recent upsurge of spending on the Earned Income Tax Credit may have altered this ratio but with the exception of the EITC program the U.S. has far less generous transfer payment programs for the non-elderly than most other industrial countries. No presidential candidate is currently advocating an expansion of transfer payment programs because most middle class Americans perceive transfer payments other than social security to be give-aways to low income minority groups. In other industrial countries, by contrast, there is much less racial polarization than in the U.S. and thus much greater willingness to use the government as an engine for income redistribution. <B>As a result of the racial constraints on popular support for using the federal government to promote income redistribution, it is not surprising that right wing populists, such as Patrick Buchanan, have focused so heavily on themes such as foreign competition and corporate greed to explain falling living standards.</B> Such issues permit him to play upon the theme of economic insecurity without offering any detailed program for increasing public expenditure to promote job training or redistribute income. 
<P>

<B>The Buchanan themes played well in New Hampshire because that state has had one of the most volatile economies in the nation during the past decade.</B> In the 1980's, New Hampshire enjoyed an economic boom because of the impact of strong employment growth in New England's computer and defense industries, a flight of tax refugees from Massachusetts, and a real estate development boom financed by the state's newly privatized mutual savings banks. In the early 1990's, the boom turned to a bust as the New England high tech sector suffered from a slump in defense spending and demand for micro computers while vacancy rates for real estate reached such high levels that many of the state's banks failed. As a result of these upheavals, New Hampshire has not been immune to the problem of job insecurity and eroding real wages despite a low unemployment rate. According to one consultant's report, median family income in new Hampshire fell by 14.7% between 1989 and 1994 compared to 4.7% for the nation.
<P>

In 1996, Buchanan received only 27% of the primary vote in New Hampshire compared to 37% when he challenged George Bush in 1992. But while the 1996 primary vote was more fragmented because of the large number of candidates, the profile of the Buchanan vote clearly reflected the theme of economic insecurity. His voters were more heavily male, poorly educated and young than the voters for other candidates. According to surveys, he received the votes of 31% of male voters compared to 26% for Dole, 21% for Alexander, and 12% for Forbes while among women he received only 25% of the vote. He obtained 31% of the votes of people aged 18-29 years compared to 18% for Dole, 29% for Alexander, and 13% for Forbes. Among people over the age of 60, he received only 25% of the vote compared to 39% for Dole, 19% for Alexander, and 10% for Forbes. He received 43% of the votes of non-college graduates compared to 21% for Dole, 22% for Alexander, and 13% for Forbes whereas among college graduates he had only 23% of the vote compared to 27% for Dole, 23% for Alexander, and 12% for Forbes. Buchanan's voters also had strong ideological views. He collected the votes of 59% of people who described themselves as very conservative compared to 13% for Dole and 9% for Alexander while among moderates he obtained only 18% of the vote compared to 26% for Dole and 30% for Alexander. Buchanan received one third of the votes of people who said the economy mattered most compared to 25% for Dole and 23% for Alexander but his voting group was very much biased towards people with bad economic experiences. He received the votes of 27% of the people who said their personal financial situation had deteriorated compared to 19% for Dole, 24% for Alexander, and 14% for Forbes.

<I>Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and Local
Privatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>
As Congressman Gephardt has ambitions to run for president in the year 2000, it
is doubtful that the next Congress will be as left wing as the markets might
fear this autumn.  But Wall Street is apprehensive because it was surprised by
the upsurge of support for Patrick Buchanan in the Republican primaries during
early 1996.  With the unemployment rate so low, it was not prepared for such a
rapidly protectionist candidate to win the New Hampshire primary.<p>
<p>
Congressman Gephardt himself said after the early primaries that the politics
of the deficit was about to be replaced by the politics of income.  He
suggested that the Democratic Party would attempt to revive itself by focusing
on the economic insecurities and concerns about income inequality which had
helped to produce the Buchanan primary victories.  If the Democrats regain
control of Congress, they are likely to emphasize such themes in their
legislative agenda for 1997.<p>
<p>
The critics of the U.S. economy have three major complaints.  First, real wages
have been stagnant for several years.  Secondly, there is growing income
inequality on the basis of differentials in education.  Thirdly, corporations
provide excessive compensation for a few senior executives at the same time
that they are demanding pay cuts or other sacrifices from low and middle income
workers.  <p>
<p>
There is no doubt that real wage growth has slowed dramatically compared to the
growth rates which prevailed before the oil crises of the 1970's.  But it is
far from clear that hourly wages deflated by the consumer price index are a
good proxy for what is happening to total U.S. compensation.  There is
considerable evidence that the CPI now overstates inflation.  If we adjust
wages with the new measures of the CPI being developing to measure inflation
more accurately or deflators of prices being charged by U.S. companies, there
has been modest growth of real wages during the past decade, not a decline.
Many firms also offer their workers generous non-wage compensation in order to
avoid taxes, including pensions and health care.  Such benefits are now equal
to about 18% of total compensation compared to 5% in the late 1940's.<p>
<p>
There is growing income inequality based on education because new developments
in technology are forcing firms to bid up the price of educated workers
compared to people with fewer skills.  With the economy now close to full
employment, it is likely that unskilled workers will now have an opportunity to
improve their wage negotiating power because of labor scarcity in many regions.
The unemployment rate is now below 5.0% in states accounting for almost one
half of the national labor market and such a low level of unemployment has
always encouraged faster wage growth in the past.<p>
<p>
Corporations have been able to justify large compensation programs for their
executives during the 1990's because profits have boomed and share prices have
risen sharply.   The problem with the corporate sector is that only about 13%
of U.S. workers qualify for profit sharing plans while only another 3% belong
to ESOP programs (Employee Stock Ownership).  As a result, there is a weak link
in the U.S. corporate sector between employment and share ownership.  About 51
million Americans have exposure to the stock market through mutual funds,
defined contribution pension plans, and other forms of share ownership but they
do not enjoy the same preferential access to shares as senior executives in
most corporations. The perceived unfairness of this imbalance also has been
magnified  in the public mind by the fact that it is the large Fortune 500
companies which have done the most aggressive restructuring since 1980.  During
the past fifteen years, the old Fortune 500 companies have reduced their
employment from 16.5 million jobs to 11.5 million jobs despite the fact that
total U.S. employment has expanded by almost 28 million.  The high visibility
of the Fortune 500 layoffs in the media has produced a far greater sense of
insecurity among American workers than than can be justified by the economy's
overall employment performance.<p>
<p>
While the American corporate sector can be faulted for narrow stock option
programs and insensitive public relations in the way it conducts
restructurings, the fact remains that the U.S. has the most successful labor
market for job creation in the industrial world.<p>
<p>
Since 1980, the U.S. economy has created 28 million new jobs for a labor force
of 134 million and in the process absorbed 95% of all the new labor force
entrants.  About 20 million American also change their job every years.  Since
1980, the European Union has created about 14 new million jobs for a labor
force of 194 million and absorbed only about one half of the new labor force
entrants.  As a result, unemployment in continental Europe is at doubt digit
levels for the population as a whole and much higher for young people.<p>
<p>
The U.S. also enjoys great social mobility.  Among those in the bottom income
quintile twenty years ago, 29% have gone to the top income quintile, 30% to the
second and 21% have moved to the third.  The number of American households
earning over $100,000 per annum in 1994 dollars has risen from 1.0 million in
1967 and 2.7 million in 1980to over 6 million today.<p>
<p>
Most other industrial countries are deeply envious of the U.S. labor market.
In April, a German business magazine published a cover story about how Germany
should regard the U.S. economy as a role model for labor market reform.  The
cover showed a picture of Chancellor Kohl (a man who weighs well over 200
pounds) trying to squeeze into an Uncle Sam costume.  Shortly after the article
appeared, Chancellor Kohl announced several measures to encourage job creation,
including reduced payroll taxes and a proposal to abolish many expensive
government regulations on firms which employ ten workers or less.  Under the
previous law, such rules applied to firms  employing more than 5 people.  In
the U.S., by contrast, firms are not subject to many federal labor laws until
their total employment exceeds 50 workers.<p>
<p>
However envious Europe may be of the U.S. labor market, though one of the risks
poised by this autumn's election is that the voters will believe politicians
who say that it is malfunctioning.  In politics, perceptions are reality and
many Americans perceive that the U.S. economy is producing unfair outcomes by
redistributing income from the poor to the rich.<p>
<p>
The Democratic congressional leadership has announced a variety of proposals to
promote "stakeholder capitalism" and protect employment through new corporate
subsides and labor market regulations.  While such proposals are well
intentioned, the experience of Europe suggests that they would be highly
counter productive over the long-term.  They would produce a more rigid labor
market and discourage hiring without necessarily reducing wage inequality.<p>
<p>
While politicians in Washington have dominated the debate about income
inequality and social fairness, the politicians who actually have the greatest
capacity to promote a more just society in the U.S. are state and local
government politicians.  They have a major role to play because they are
responsible for the nation's educational system.  The U.S. spends about 6.5% of
its GDP on education and Washington is responsible for only about $40 billion
of the expenditures.  The only effective way to reduce income inequality in an
era rapid of technological change is to ensure that everyone has effective
access to a good education.  Yet, real education spending has been stagnant and
even declining in some states despite the growing public concern about income
inequality.  Attempts to promote more effective use of education dollars
through vouchers and other forms of school choice also have been stymied by
opposition from teachers unions.<p>

<I>Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>





The growth of the mutual fund industry has had several effects on the economy.

<P>

First, it has encouraged the household sector to boost its equity market exposure to the highest level since the 1960's.  Household ownership of equities and mutual funds now exceeds 25% of all households financial assets compared to 15.5% in 1995, 13.5% in 1975, and a previous peak of 36.0% in 1968.  Mutual funds now also represent about 25% of total household equity portfolios compared to 14% in 1985, 6% in 1968 and less than 4% in the 1960's.

<P>

Second, the growth of the mutual fund industry is broadening the number of households with exposure to the equity market.  According to data from Federal Reserve surveys of household finances, about 17.8% of U.S. households owned equities directly in 1992 compared to 19.l1% in 1983 and 17.2% in 1962.  But if we include mutual funds, the share of households owning equities rises to 22.0% from 20.1% in 1983 and 19.0% in 1962.  If we include IRA's, Keogh plans, and defined contribution plans, the share rises to 37.4% from 33.2% in 1983.  There is no comparable data for the 1960's because IRA's and defined contribution pension plans were non-existent before the 1970's. 

<P>

While the share of the population owning equities has been expanding steadily during recent years, the great bulk of U.S. equity continues to be owned by high income people.  According to the Federal Reserve survey of household finances, people with incomes above $250,000 (1.2% of total households) own 29.11% of all publicly traded stock compared to 20.78% for the income group earning $100,000-250,000  (5.9% of total households), 8.76% for the income group earning $75,000-100,000 (5.51% of total households) and 15.16% for the income group earning $50,000-75,000 (13.38% of total households).

<P>

If we divide the population on the basis of wealth, the ownership of equity appears to be even more concentrated.  According to the Fed surveys, the wealthiest 0.5% of  U.S.  households own 58.6% of all publicly traded stock compared to 11.74% for the second 0.5%, 24.18% for the next 4% of households, 4.62% for the next 5% and less than 1.0% for the remainder of the population.  In the case of housing equity, by contrast, the bottom 80% of the population owns 28% of residential housing stock compared to just under 16.0% for the top 1.0% of the population.
Age also plays an important role in equity ownership.  In the 1992 Fed survey, households with ages above 65 owned 41.36% of all publicly of traded stock compared to 19.25% for the age group 55-64 years, 18.07% for the age group 45-54 years, and 17.01% for the age group 35-44 years.

<P>

But while U.S. equity ownership is highly concentrated among older high income people, it is becoming more diffuse. The share of publicly traded equity owned by people with incomes above $250,000 fell from 50.60% in 1983 to 29.11% in 1992.  If we broaden the measure of equity ownership to include mutual funds, IRA's, Keoghs and defined contribution plans, the share of the top income group drops from 43.06% in 1983 to 22.72% in 1992.  The major gainers are groups with incomes below $100,000.  The group with incomes of $75,000-100,00 per annum has expanded its share of all equities including mutual funds, IRA's, Keogh's defined contribution pension, to 12.1% from 7.28% in 1983.  The $50,000-75,000 group has boosted its share from 12.63% in 1983 to 16.75% in 1992.  The group earning $25,000-50,000 has boosted its share of  equity from 8.08% in 1983 to 18.39% in 1992.  The group earning under $25,000 has boosted its share from 3.06% in 1983 to 7.07% in 1992.

<P>

Stock ownership is also becoming less concentrated on the basis of age, not just income.  In 1992, households over the age of 65 owned 41.35% of U.S. publicly traded equity compared to 49.24% in 1983.  The age group 35-44 years, by contrast, has increased its share of  publicly traded equity from 6.83% in 1983 to 17.01% in 1992.  Share ownership is also far more diffused when mutual funds, IRA's, Keogh plans, and defined contribution plans are included.  On this basis, the share of equity owned by households over 65 years of age falls from 43.14% in 1983 to 30.71% in 1992 while the share of households aged 35-44 years rises from 9.13% to 16.97%.

<P>

Equity ownership on the basis of wealth continues to be highly concentrated but it is becoming gradually more diffuse.  In 1992, the top 1.0% of households owned over 70% of publicly traded U.S. equity compared to 78% in 1983 and 75.07% in 1962.  The next 4% of the population owned 24.18% of publicly traded stock in 1992 compared to 17.38% in 1983 and 20.4% in 1962.  The next 5% of the population owned 4.62% of publicly traded stock in 1992 compared to 3.58% in 1983 and 3.77% in 1962.  The bottom 80% of the population continues to own an insignificant share of publicly traded stock compared to 13.7% of all non-equity financial assets, 28.07% of the national housing stock and 19.2% of total household net worth. What has changed dramatically as a result of the mutual fund boom is the distribution of bond ownership by wealth class.  In 1992, the wealthiest 1.0% of the U.S. population owned 41.6% of all bonds compared to 78% in 1989.  The next 9% of the population has expanded its share of the bond market from 16.1% to 46.3% while the other 90% of the population has boosted its share from 5.9% to 12.0%.

<P>

Thirdly, the growth of the mutual fund sector is altering the ownership structure of the U.S. corporate sector.  In 1994, mutual funds owned 13.6% of U.S. corporate equity compared to 7.1% in 1990, 5.0% in 1985 and 4.5-5.5% during the 1960's.  During the modern era, the dominant trend in equity ownership has been a steady decline in the household share and a steady increase in the pension fund share.  In 1951, households owned 90% of U.S. corporate equity compared to 1.1% for pension funds, 3.1% for mutual funds, 3.5% for insurance companies, and 2.2% for foreign investors.  The household share remained high through the 1950's but plunged to 55.0-60.0% by the early 1970's while the pension fund share grew to 15.0-16.0% and bank personal trusts expanded to 11.0-12.0%.  The household share of corporate equity continued to erode during the 1980's and is now only 47.7%.  The bank trust account share also has slid to 2.7% while the pension fund share has been stable in the 24-26% range since the mid-1980's.  The growth of defined contribution pension plans, individual retirement accounts, and 401-K plans will probably continue to boost the mutual fund share of U.S. corporate equity during the late 1990's at the expense of direct household ownership.  But since households own two thirds of mutual fund assets as well as most trust fund and defined benefit pension plans asssets, analysts estimate that households still control about two thirds of all U.S. corporate equity on a direct and indirect basis.

<P>

Fourthly, the growth of mutual fund assets has helped to encourage a tremendous boom in securitized finance by companies. The number of initial equity public offerings has risen to record high levels during recent years partly because of the demand for new securities from the mutual fund sector.  The number of equity IPO's was 582 in 1995, 646 in 1994, 471 in 1993, 447 in 1992, 330 in 1991 and only 150 in 1990.  These IPO's raised about $34 billion of new capital for companies in 1995, $30 billion in 1994, $25 billion in 1993, $19.4 billion in 1992, and $13.8 billion in 1991 compared to only $4.2 billion in 1990.  The search for higher yields also revitalized the so-called "junk bond market".  In 1993, Wall Street sold about $60 billion of non-investment grade bonds compared to $42 billion in 1992, $16.9 billion in 1991, and $2.9 billion in 1990.

<P>

The improved access to equity and debt finance for small and medium sized companies is important to job creation because practically all of America's employment growth since 1980 has been concentrated in that sector.  Between 1979 and 1994, the Fortune 500 companies reduced their employment from 16.2 million to 11.8 million.  In the 1980's, the employment losses at large firms were offset by job creation at small firms, but during the early 1990's the economy stalled in part because the small firms lost access to the credit market.  In 1993, by contrast, the mutual fund boom provided small firms with unprecedented access to the debt and equity markets while the recovery in bank profitability encouraged banks to ease their lending conditions as well.  The securitization boom has even had a benign effect on the U.S. real estate market.    During 1992 and 1993, Wall Street sold retail investors about 100 new Real Estate investment Trusts worth $12 billion.  These trusts permit investors to invest in real estate without being subject to double taxation of income.  They became popular as interest rates fell because commercial property still offered yields in the 10-12% range.  As a result of the IPO boomlet for real estate, the market capitalization of the REIT sector now exceeds $60 billion compared to less than $10 billion during 1990.

<P>

Fifth, the growth of the mutual fund industry is helping to encourage an unprecedented outflow of capital from the U.S. to foreign security markets.  The number of purely international equity funds has expanded from 13 in 1984 to 367 while the number of global equity funds (including U.S.) has grown from 16 to 176.  Meanwhile, the population of global bond funds has shot up from 1 in 1985 to 145 today.  International and global equity funds have expanded their assets from $37 billion in 1992 to $212 billion recently while global bond funds grew from $27.6 billion to a peak of $40 billion in early 1994 before rising interest rates caused an upsurge of net redemptions which reduced assets to $33 billion in late 1995.  The creation of this new infrastructure for retail diversification into foreign securities has made New York a far larger market for international bonds and equities than it has ever been before.  But the retail demand for foreign securities is volatile.  The share of money flows into international mutual funds peaked at 44% in early 1994 and then slumped to less than 20% during much of 1995 as Wall Street boomed.  The assets of international money market funds have slumped from a peak of $21.4 billion during the period of high European interest rates after German unification to only $3.7 billion recently.  In January, 1996, money flows into international and global equity funds shot up to over $6 billion from only $1-2 billion in mid-1995 but their share of total equity sales was still only 25%.

<P>

Finally, the mutual fund boom is forcing banks to introduce new fund products  in order to retain their share of household savings flows.  In 1994, 2072 banks sold mutual funds and 46% of them were proprietary funds compared to 31.5% in 1991.  In the early 1990's, banks primarily offered money market funds but they are also now actively promoting equity and bond funds.  Such products accounted for over 70% of their money flows in 1994 compared to only about one half in 1991.  Government officials are concerned that households may confuse mutual fund products with government insured deposits, so they are encouraging banks to carefully explain to customers that their mutual fund products do not enjoy FDIC protection but surveys indicate that bank customers do not always fully understand the distinction.  The growth of bank sponsored mutual funds is also complicating the task of the Federal Reserve in monitoring the growth of the nation's monetary aggregates.  The Fed includes money market funds in its measure of M2 but it does not include any share of bond and equity funds despite the fact that such funds often have check writing privileges.

In January, Kemper Financial Services, Inc. became an indirect subsidiary of Zurich Insurance Group. In March, KFS changed its name to <A HREF="../about/aboutzki.html">Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.</A> "The name is different," says Stephen B. Timbers, president, chief executive and chief investment officer, "but our fundamental mission is the same: To manufacture and distribute high quality investment management products and services to individuals and institutions and to help them achieve their long-term financial goals. Our goal is to fulfill this mission better than anyone else in the investment management business."
<P>
The transfer of ownership provided an occasion for us to update our look. Specifically, at the bottom right-hand of every page of Kemper.com, you'll see our new Kemper Funds logo, which includes a "wealthmark." The wealthmark relates to both our Midwest home base and to the concept of harvest.

In March, <A HREF="../about/kempercom.html">Kemper.com</A> arrived on the World Wide Web! The site was established as an extension of the services we provide to our shareholders and to the financial representatives who offer Kemper Funds to the investing public. In our first year, we've received positive reviews from organizations such as Yahoo Internet Life!, the Microsoft Network and EyeOnTheWeb.
<P>
In August, a second site, <A HREF="http://www.kempercash.com/">kempercash.com</A> debuted. The site, which focuses on money market funds only, is written from the view of an experienced investor based on a private island in the South Pacific.

As of October 31, 1996, Kemper High Yield Fund, Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund all received Morningstar's five-star "highest" rating for overall performance in their respective categories.
<P>
<A HREF="../funds/high_yield.html">Kemper High Yield Fund</A> also has five stars for the three-, five- and 10-year periods.  It was rated among 1,054, 572 and 233 fixed-income funds for the three-, five- and 10-year periods, respectively.  For the one-year period, the fund received four stars and was rated among 1,654 fixed-income funds.
<P>
In addition to its five-star overall rating, <A HREF="../funds/high_return.html">Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund</A> received five stars for the one-, three- and five-year periods.  It was rated among 2,864, 1,724, 1,031 and 575 domestic equity funds for the one-, three- and five-year periods, respectively.

<P>
Ten percent of the funds in a rating category receive five stars, and the next 22.5 percent receive four stars.  Morningstar proprietary ratings reflect risk-adjusted performance through October 31, 1996. Ratings are calculated from the funds' three-, five-, and, where applicable, 10-year returns (with fee adjustments) in excess of 90-day Treasury bill returns.  The one-year rating is calculated using the same methodology, but is not a component of the overall rating. Ratings are subject to change every month.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>

October 21,1996</I>



<P>
<I>At present, there appear to be only three events which could
jeopardize investor confidence in the 1997 outlook.</I> The first
risk would be a resurgence of output growth during the fourth
quarter that also revived expectations of Federal Reserve tightening.
The second risk would be a surprise slowdown in the economy so
severe and protracted that it encouraged a sharp downward revision
of 1997 profit forecasts. The third risk would be a Democratic
victory in the congressional elections on a scale which gave them
the capacity to enact new legislation despite defections by some
members of their dwindling band of southern conservatives (say
a majority over 25).
<P>
<I>The dominant economic risk in the outlook continues to be the
potential for a resurgence of output growth during the next few
quarters.</I> On the basis of preliminary data, it appears that
real GDP growth slowed to only 1.5-2.0% during the third quarter
because of a pause in consumer spending during the summer. But
the economy has experienced such pauses in the past and it is
difficult to imagine the recent one being sustained when the financial
environment is so supportive of employment and income growth.
Consumer spending expanded at a 3.5% annual rate during the first
half of 1996 and nothing has happened during the interim to suggest
it should remain subdued for longer than one quarter. The University
of Michigan survey of consumer confidence held at 94.8 in early
October compared to an average of 91.5 during the second quarter
and 94.9 during the third quarter. The Conference Board survey
of confidence also held at 111.8 during September compared to
112 in August and an average of 102.8 during the second quarter.
Households are upbeat because of optimism about their personal
financial situation and the labor market. In September, 26.7%
said jobs were plentiful compared to 24.6% in June and 21.3% in
January.
<P>
As a result of the stock market boom,<I> the demand for discretionary
goods and luxuries is very robust at present.</I> The Financial
Times reports that the most recent issue of Vogue had over 700
pages of advertisements, the highest number in over a decade.
While stock ownership is concentrated among the top decile of
America's population, other income groups can benefit from wealth
creation in the equity market through a declining cost of capital
and increased business investment, not just luxury goods consumption.
The volume and value of equity IPO offerings this year could exceed
the 1993 record of $56 billion. Moody's recently reported that
the number of credit upgrades during the third quarter exceeded
downgrades by 80%, the highest ratio of upgrades to downgrades
in two decades. There were 60 upgrades accounting for $39 billion
of debt in the industrial sector compared to 14 downgrades covering
$14.2 billion of debt.
<P>
Consumer optimism also should benefit from the Federal Reserve's
decision to leave interest rates unchanged at the latest FOMC
meeting. According to the University of Michigan survey of consumer
confidence, most households had been expecting a modest interest
rate hike to occur this autumn. The decision of the Federal Reserve
to take chances on the side of growth should reassure households
that the risks of recession during the next twelve months is minimal.
<P>
The primary risk to consumer spending during the next few quarters
is that banks will react to rising loan losses on credit card
operations by imposing tougher quality standards on new applicants
and reducing the credit lines of existing customers. But surveys
of bank lending policies suggest that they are making only modest
changes in credit access. The U.S. banking sector is currently
enjoying such robust profits that few institutions will want to
sacrifice market share by significantly curtailing lending volume.
In the August survey of lending conditions, for example, 90.9%
of banks said their credit policies for small business were unchanged
compared to 5.5% which said they were easing and 3.6% which said
they were tightening.
<P>
The large expansion of the U.S. trade deficit during July and
August is encouraging many analysts to shave their third quarter
growth forecasts but the surge of imports will be partly offset
by increased inventory building. Inventories were very low at
the end of the second quarter and firms had to expand them during
the third quarter in order to get ready for the fourth quarter
retail season.
<P>
If there is a rebound in consumer spending during the fourth quarter,
total output growth will probably rise back into the 3.0-3.5%
range from only 1.5-2.5% during the third quarter. As such a high
level of output growth would probably push the unemployment rate
below 5.0%, the odds are high that the Federal Reserve would respond
by raising interest rates during late 1996 or early 1997. <I>What
remains unclear is whether the FOMC will have sufficient information
by its November 14th meeting to act shortly after the presidential
election.</I> If the upcoming government reports on employment
costs and labor market conditions show further signs of wage acceleration
as well as renewed job creation, the odds are high that the hawks
on the FOMC will revive their demands for an interest rate hike.
The demands for tightening at the late September FOMC meeting
were subdued because of Mr. Alan Greenspan's anger about the leak
to the Reuters news service of proposals from eight district banks
for a hike in the discount rate. But with unemployment well below
5.0% in regions accounting for 45% of the national labor market,
many district presidents will continue to advocate a tighter monetary
policy at the next FOMC meeting.
<P>
At the recent IMF meeting, Mr. Greenspan assured many foreign
government officials that the U.S. inflation rate is still under
control despite the country's low level of unemployment. <I>But
he also qualified his statement by stressing the unusual nature
of the current equilibrium in the labor market.</I> He said that
the traditional relationship between unemployment and wages had
broken down because of the great concern about employment stability
among American workers. The obsession with job security has greatly
lessened demands for pay growth compared to past business cycles.
But Mr. Greenspan stressed there is no way of telling how long
this job security obsession will restrain wages in the face of
a prolonged period of low unemployment.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 26, 1996</I>

<P>
According to Lindsey, the number of credit card delinquencies
has increased sharply during the past two years but the volume
of loans which is delinquent has increased by much less.  The
household sector has also been experiencing a sharp rise in its
asset values, not just its leverage.  Since 1991, the household
sector has enjoyed a $4.75 trillion capital gain on its equity
portfolio and $9.5 trillion gain on its total assets while liabilities
have increased by only $1.5 trillion.  The major risk in the debt
expansion is its concentration among lower income Americans. 
As Lindsey explained,
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;We estimate, that on average, the household sector increased
its debt-to-income ratio about 5 percentage points between 1992
and 1995.  This was the result of a 2 percentage point increase
in mortgage debt, from 59.8 percent of income to 61.9 percent
of income and a 3 percentage point increase in non-mortgage consumer
debt, from 16.9 percent of income o 19.8 percent of income.&quot;</I>

<P>

<I>&quot;Nevertheless, the survey does suggest some interesting
trends in the distribution of this debt.  Typically, households
earning more than $100,000 per year sharply reduced their debt
levels between 1992 and 1995.  The share of total household debt
held by these households fell from one-third to one-quarter and
this decline was particularly concentrated among households earning
more than $250,000 per year.  These upper income groups experienced
a decline in both the mean and median absolute level of debt outstanding,
while all other income groups increased their debt.&quot;</I>
<P>

<I>&quot;The decline in the debt levels for these groups makes
the rise in debt levels for other groups more striking.  For example,
households with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 increased
their rates of aggregate mortgage debt to aggregate income by
about one-sixth and their corresponding consumer debt to income
ratio by roughly 50 percent.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;Of course, some households increased their debt substantially
more than this, some not at all.  <I>The Survey of Consumer Finance
does indicate a striking increase in the willingness to go into
debt in the $50,00 to $100,000 income group.</I>  The proportion
of survey households in this income group reporting credit card
debt rose 13 percentage points, from 51% in 1992 to 64% in 1995,
compared to a 4 point increase, from 44 percent to 48 percent
for the whole population.  Those holding installment debt such
as auto loans increased from 52 percent to 59 percent in this
income group while the proportion in the overall population with
this type of debt was unchanged.  Nearly 60 percent of the total
increase in non-mortgage debt outstanding was assumed by households
in this income group.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;Debt increases for households earning under $50,000 were
also sizable.  The increasing attractiveness of various types
of financing tied to one's home produced a particularly large
increase in the ratio of mortgage debt to income.  It should be
noted that although the mortgage debt to income ratio increase
just 7 percentage points for households earning under $25,000,
compared to 10 to 11 percentage points for households earnings
$25,000 to $100,000, home ownership rates are much lower among
this segment of the population.  Adjusted for the lower level
of home ownership rates among this income group, mortgage debt
to income ratios increased more for these lower income groups
than for the $50,000 to $100,000 income group.  I might add that
the rapid expansion of mortgage financing among low and moderate
income groups is borne out by other data as well.  We will not
know for some time what he overall effect of this lending will
be on default and delinquency rates.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;But these data also show that while some of the added
credit extension during this period is to people in income groups
that traditionally haven't owed much debt, the bulk is not.  While
overall debt levels increased for all groups earning under $100,000,
<I>the only group to increase its relative share of such non-mortgage
debt was the $50,000 to $100,000 income group</I>.  Thus, it is
reasonable to conclude that the main reason for the household
debt expansion of recent years is not so much an extension of
debt to new households, but an increase in the debt levels taken
on by fairly well-to-do segments of the population to whom being
in debt (albeit not at these levels) is not an unusual experience.&quot;</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Governor Lindsey's testimony on the debt issue is important because
in previous speeches he has warned about the risk of leverage
excesses in the household sector.  His September testimony suggests
that consumer debt will pose risks for middle income families
during future recessions but that there will not be an abrupt
decline of borrowing or suspension of credit access by banks large
enough to trigger a business downturn during the twelve months.
<P>
The disagreements which exist in both the private sector and the
Fed about the economy's optimal growth rate will not be resolvable
for some time.  If the economy can continue to enjoy output growth
of 2.5-3.5% with no upward pressure on inflation, there will be
increasing support for the view that government data underestimates
productivity growth as well as the economy's effective capital
stock.  But as adopting such a position today would require the
Fed to take risks on the side of inflation without totally conclusive
proof that the economy's optimal growth rate is higher than 2.0-2.5%,
it is doubtful that they will remain passive if output growth
rebounds to the 3.0-3.5% range during the fourth quarter.  They
would probably tighten by at least 50 basis points during November
and December.
<P>
<I>The American forecasting community has a generally pessimistic
view of the outlook for both output growth and the resilience
of corporate profit margins next year.</I>  In the most recent
Blue Chip survey of the economic consensus, forecasters projected
output growth of 2.2% and CPI inflation of 3.0% during 1997 compared
to 2.4% for growth and 3.0% for inflation this year.  The great
contrast in the 1996 and 1997 forecasts centers on corporate profits.
 American forecasters are projecting only 3.1% profit growth next
year compared to 9.0% during 1996.  <I>The pessimism about profits
suggests that analysts expect rising wages to come at the expense
of corporate profit margins rather than higher inflation.</I>
<P>
If the U.S. forecasting consensus is correct, the Fed should be
able to fine tune another year of modest growth during 1997 with
only modest interest rate hikes or even with a stable monetary
policy.  <I>The problem with such forecasts is that it is difficult
to believe that business or household psychology will remain static
in the face of a sixth and seventh year of uninterrupted economic
expansion.</I>  If everyone concludes that the risk of a recession
is minimal, it is difficult to believe that investment plans,
hiring intentions or wage expectations will remain consistent
with output growth of only 2.2% and real interest rates of 2.0-2.5%
against the backdrop of an unemployment rate in the 4.5-5.0% range.
 As a result, the odds are high that there will be more cyclical
volatility in the economy during the year ahead than is currently
being reflected in the forecasting community.  Either the economy
will lose momentum on a sustained basis this autumn or output
growth will rebound and set the stage for a monetary policy adjustment
which will reduce output growth to only 1.0-1.5% for two quarters
during the second half of 1997or early 1998.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 2, 1996</I>

<P>
As domestic final sales grew at a 4.5% annual rate during the first quarter and 4.8% during the second quarter, the optimists are far more likely to be right than the pessimists.  The economy does not suddenly fade when final demand is resilient and there are no major policy shocks to depress confidence.  The August purchasing agent survey confirmed that the July pause in output was temporary and there is no reason for output growth to slow during September unless there is a strike in the auto industry.  As a result, the odds are high that U.S. forecasters will soon revise up their fourth quarter forecasts to the 2.5-3.5% range from the current range of 1.5-2.2%.  Such revisions will then set the stage for Fed tightening of at least 25 basis points by late September.  If the August employment report shows robust gains in job creation, the Fed could tighten even sooner but such a dramatic gesture will probably require the unemployment rate to drop to 5.2% or less.
<P>
The minutes of the early July FOMC meeting depicted the divergences which exist both in the Fed and private sector forecasting community very accurately.  The majority believed that ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
" The most likely outcome was a slowing of the expansion to a more sustainable pace and a continuation of subdued inflation.  Nevertheless, they were concerned that the risks to that outcome were tilted toward higher inflation.  While a strong economy generally was a welcome development, at current levels of resource use a continuation of rapid growth was not likely to be sustainable because it would have the potential for adding significantly to inflation pressures.    However, inflation had remained relatively damped thus far and the rise in interest rates among other factors was expected to curb demand.  Moreover, any tendency for price pressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and be reversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment.  The current stance of monetary policy could not be described in this view as clearly accommodative.  While the federal funds rate had been reduced appreciably in nominal terms over the past year, its current level on an inflation-adjusted basis seems to be only marginally below its peak prior to mid-1995.  In the circumstances, the Committee could afford to wait for more evidence to see whether additional inflation pressures were like to develop"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The dissidents from the majority view warned that continued strong output growth would undermine the Fed's inflation targets.  The minutes noted,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"A differing view gave more emphasis to prospects for rising inflation and the need for immediate action to forestall a buildup of cost and price pressures before they undermined the expansion.  There was little firm evidence that economic growth was slowing and reports of appreciable wage pressures were increasing.  Inflation expectations persisted in financial markets, and probably in product and labor markets as well; if they were allowed to worsen the Committee's long-run goal of price stability would become much more difficult to achieve.  Delaying action risked the need for a greater adjustment in policy at a later date with possible disruption to the economy"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The committee decided to approve only a change in their policy bias, not an actual interest rate hike, because of the psychological impact of raising interest rates.  The minutes said "Some noted that a policy tightening action would tend to have a more pronounced effect than usual because it would indicate a shift in the direction of policy and might generate expectations of further tightening". 
<P>
At the FOMC meeting in late September, the Fed will probably have new evidence of the economy expanding at a rate close to 3.0% but few signs of accelerating inflation at the retail level.  The factors which will force the Fed to hike interest rates will be concern about the intermediate term inflation consequence of the unemployment rate dropping close to 5.0% and large increases in long-term bond yields.  The fact that the two dissenting votes on monetary policy during the past nine months have come from district presidents in the middle west (Minneapolis, Kansas City) also suggests that the district presidents could play a more important role than usual in the conduct of monetary policy this autumn.  As a result of their location in strong growth regions such as the middle west, the rocky mountain states and California, they are more aware of how low unemployment and aggressive bank lending practices are affecting business behavior than the Washington based governors who depend upon government statistical reports and staff forecasts which often lag behind developments in the private sector.  The fact that the Fed's own staff has greatly underestimated the economy's growth rate this year will probably also increase the determination of the district presidents to become more vociferous about the potential inflation risks of the economy expanding at an above trend growth rate for another year.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
July 29, 1996</I>

<P>



The slowdown in the high technology sector is of greater important than in the
past because of the role which it has played in sustaining growth since 1994 as
demand for autos and housing slowdown.<p>
Business expenditures on office and computer machinery now accounts for about
1.8% of real GDP compared to 0.6% during 1990 and less than 0.2% during the
early 1980's.  Its nominal share of GDP is about 1.0% compared to 0.7% in 1990
and 1.1% in 1984.  According to Hewlett Packard, the nominal growth rate of
computer spending could slow to 0-5% by the first quarter of 1997.  Under such
a scenario, the real growth rate would drop to about 5-10% from 30-40% during
1995 and early 1996.  While such a slowdown will represent a major negative
swing from the sector's previous growth rate, it is by no means an
unprecedented adjustment.  During the mid-1980's, the growth rate of office and
computer equipment spending fluctuated in a range of plus 80% at annual rates
to only slightly positive growth.  In the 1990 recession, real spending
actually fell by over 20%.<p>
<p>
The other investment sector which has enjoyed buoyant during recent years is
communications equipment.  It's share of real GDP has expanded to .95%  from
.7% during 1992 and a previous peak of just under 1.0% during the mid-1980's.
The growth rate of communications equipment investment has already slowed from
25% during mid-1994 to 6-7% recently.<p>
<p>
<i>Since the economy's two most vulnerable high technology sectors account for
less than 3.0% of GDP, they will not be able to change the economy's overall
direction if other sectors are enjoying moderate growth.</i>   The correction
occurring in high technology capital investment is a far more important
phenomena for the stock market than for the economy because of the leadership
role which technology companies have played in the market during recent
years.<p>
<p>
As a result of the buoyant outlook for corporate profits and the high level of
capacity utilization rates, other capital spending sectors should continue to
enjoy moderate growth this year.  Industrial equipment accounts for about 1.8%
of both nominal and real GDP.  It has already slowed from a growth rate of over
15% during late 1994 to about 6-7% recently.  The truck and bus sector of
equipment investment is highly cyclical and has already experienced a major
adjustment.  Its growth rate has dropped from a peak of nearly 40% in late 1993
to only 2-3% recently.  The sector has a history of experiencing sub-cycle
contractions even during periods of steady growth in the economy, so it could
continue to decline during the second half of 1996 and then could rebound
during 1997 (as it did during the sub-cycle of the mid-1980's).<p>
<p>
The arguments for the Fed to tighten in the face of these risks to final demand
growth center on inflation expectations in the private sector and the
uncertainty which exists about the magnitude of any late 1996 slowdown in the
midst of a financial environment which appears to be highly supportive of
growth.<p>
<p>
The Fed has been able to fine tune the economy during the 1990's without
risking a recession in part because of the confidence which it enjoys among
investors and business decision makers.  If they saw the Fed remaining passive
in the face of rising wages in order to sustain a prolonged period of full
employment, they would start to increase their forecasts of the intermediate
term inflation outlook.  While the adjustments might be small at first, there
would be a clear and increasing tendency for analyst to assume a core inflation
rate closer to 4.0% than 3.0% by late 1997.<p>
<p>
While there are numerous reasons why final demand could slow in some important
sectors during the next nine months, <i>the financial environment in the U.S.
remains so buoyant that it is difficult to imagine a prolonged period of output
growth below 2.0%.</i>  Banks are competing so aggressively to make loans that
most small business owners can now chose between four and five potential
lenders if they have to finance a new investment or a sale of their business.
The boom in the stock market and the expansion of the mutual fund industry has
produced a very buoyant environment for new equity IPO's and the sale of
non-investment grade bonds.  The number of equity I.P.O.'s was 428 during the
first half of 1996 compared to 573 during all of 1995, 571 during 1994, and a
peak of 665 during 1993.  These I.P.O.'s raised about $27.2 billion during the
first half of 1996 compared to $28.9 billion last year, $22.9 billion during
1994 and $34.0 billion during 1993.  The peak for I.P.O. financing during the
1980's, by contrast, was $17.7 billion during 1986.  The search for higher
yields also has helped to revitalize the so-called junk bond market.  In the
first half of 1996, Wall Street sold 92 new non-investment grade bond offering
compared to 159 during 1995, 190 during 1994, and 343 during 1993.  The funds
raised were $17.1 billion during the first half of 1996, $28.8 billion during
1995, $31.5 billion during 1994, and $54.4 billion during 1993.  The previous
peak in non-investment grade bond financing was 218 deals worth $30.5 billion
during 1986.  <p>
<p>
It is difficult to imagine a self-reinforcing slowdown when capital is so
readily available to the entrepreneurial companies responsible for most of
America's job creation.  Meanwhile, the appreciation of the stock market has
boosted the net worth of the household sector by almost $2 billion since 1994.
If the household sector spends only 5% of its capital gains, the potential
boost to consumer spending is $100 billion.  The correction now occurring  in
the equity market will inhibit new wealth creation but the market has been
robust for so long that wealth losses are unlikely to be a depressing influence
on household spending until next year.<p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u><b>Are the Financial Markets Focusing on the Election?</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The major focus of media commentary about the stock market during July was the
risk that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates.  <i>But equity
investors were probably also concerned about the continuing poor performance of
former Senator Robert Dole in the presidential opinion polls.</i>  Dole has
performed so poorly in the polls that there is growing concern about the
ability of the Republican Party to retain control of Congress.  Wall Street has
long perceived the president to be a superior campaigner but investors had
expected Dole to benefit from the conviction of the Governor of Arkansas  for
corruption in June as well as his resignation from the Senate.  Clinton's
seeming immunity to his scandals has so unnerved the Republicans that they are
about to announce a major tax cut program in order to bolster Dole's electoral
appeal.  As Dole has devoted his whole career to reducing federal deficits and
criticizing supply side economists, it is far from clear that the new strategy
will work but his new tax proposals will at least allow him to reinvoke the
optimistic message of Ronald Reagan during the early 1980's.<p>
<p>
<i>The August political conventions will provide the next important test of
investor sentiment about the election.</i>  As political conventions focus
great media attention on candidates, they typically give a boost to the
challenger who is attempting to establish credibility as an alternative to the
incumbent.  As Clinton is already 15-20 points ahead, investor concern about
Dole will evolve into alarm about both the presidential and congressional races
if he does not emerge from the convention narrowing the gap with Clinton by at
least 10 points.<p>
<p>
The prospect of the Republicans losing control of Congress is potentially
disturbing to Wall Street for three reasons,<p>
<p>
<i>First, the 1996 election poses a unique historic challenge for both
parties.</i>  No Democratic president has won two consecutive elections since
Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930's.  The Republican Party has not controlled the
Congress for  two consecutive terms since the 1920's.  If the Republicans lose
control again in 1996, it will suggest that the public is turning away from
their themes of deficit reduction, slowing growth of entitlement spending, and
promoting lower marginal income tax rates.<p>
<p>
Secondly, there has been a profound change in the character of the Democratic
Party in the Congress as a result of recent Republican victories.  <i>The
Republican Party now has 77 of the 125 house seats of the old southern
Confederacy compared to 48 in 1992, 34 in 1972 and 6 in 1960.</i>  On the basis
of pending Democratic retirements, the Republicans may even be able to claim
control over two thirds of the seats in the south by next year even if they
lose their overall majority.  As a result of the Republican takeover of the
south, the Democrats now depend far more upon the urban centers of the
northeast, the middle west and California for their congressional membership.
<i>This geographic shift in the composition of the parties suggests that future
Democratic committee chairman would be far more supportive of federal spending
programs and other forms of government intervention in the economy than both
the current Republican chairmen and past Democratic chairmen.</i><p>

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
June 21, 1996</I>

<P>
While the government's newly revised labor market data point to
a much stronger economy than analysts anticipated a few months
ago, not every survey of labor market conditions is as robust.
Dun and Bradstreet recently published the results of its latest
survey of business hiring intentions for 1996. The survey is projecting
that firms will create only 1.4 million new jobs this year compared
to 3 million jobs in last year's survey. The survey reports that
small firms will hire more cautiously but that large firms will
expand their hiring -- a reversal of the trend which has prevailed
during recent years. It said,
<P>
&quot;About 21 percent of the nation's smallest businesses expect
to add jobs this year. As a group, mid-sized firms were slightly
more optimistic, with roughly 28 percent predicting higher employment
levels. However, the 199,000 jobs expected among firms with 20
to 99 employees is down 56 percent in comparison with last year.
Firms with 100 to 999 employees expect to add about 387,000 jobs,
down 43 percent from last year. Businesses with between 1,000
and 9,999 employees say they will hire 185,000 new employees,
down form 268,000 last year.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Only the nation's largest employers predict faster job growth
in 1996 than in 1995, a significant reversal of the downsizing
trend of the past decade. Businesses employing more than 10,000
workers expect to add about 113,000 jobs this year. That represents
an increase of 47 percent from last year's survey.&quot;
<P>
As the payroll survey of employment has already increased by 1.8
million jobs this year, the D&amp;B survey is either wrong or
the economy is poised for a sudden slowing of employment growth.
But the survey may be misleading this year because firms appear
to be concerned about labor shortages, not just concerns over
slower growth of the economy. As the survey noted,
<P>
&quot;A high percentage of U.S. employers are finding it difficult
to locate qualified workers. Thirty-six percent of all firms say
they have trouble finding qualified workers. High-tech and skilled
labor markets are reporting the most serious labor shortage. Fifty-two
percent of construction firms, for instance, reported trouble
finding qualified workers, and 41 percent of manufacturers had
difficulty. Among the transportation/public utilities, retail
trade and services sectors, 38 percent, 37 percent and 34 percent,
respectively, of all firms surveyed said they had trouble finding
qualified workers.&quot;
<P>
<B>It is also possible that American firms have underestimated
their employment needs because they have been influenced by the
consensus among U.S. forecasters that 1996 would be a year of
sluggish output growth</B>. According to the June 10th Blue Chip
survey of the U.S. forecasting community, forecasters have increased
their expectations for second quarter growth to 3.3% from 2.1%
during March and 2.7% during May, but they continue to project
a sharp slowing to growth rates of only 2.3% and 2.0% during the
final two quarters of the year. Those forecasts are no higher
than March's despite the fact that first half growth will be twice
as high as most forecasters projected in January.
<P>
The surprising resilience of the U.S. economy since January creates
some potentially challenging questions for the Federal Reserve.
Should it reverse its January easing move with a 25 basis point
rate hike at its July third FOMC meeting? Should it delay any
tightening move until it has more clear-cut evidence on the third
quarter outlook and tighten at the late August meeting, which
will coincide with the Democratic national convention? Should
it wait until the July employment report in early August and change
its recent custom of adjusting policy only at FOMC meetings by
making an adjustment in response to new information appearing
between the FOMC meetings? As inflation has remained remarkably
subdued despite the economy's strong performance this year, should
the Fed simply revise up its estimate of the economy's optimal
potential growth rate and not tighten until there is clear-cut
evidence of accelerating inflation?
<P>
<B>The odds are high that the Fed will raise interest rates at
some point this summer.</B> The big questions center on whether
the policy adjustment will occur in July or August and whether
they will occur on the actual day of FOMC meetings. As inflation
has been well behaved and there is still no consensus in the private
sector about the second half outlook, the Fed can rationalize
remaining passive at its July meeting. But if the July data appearing
in early August suggests output growth will remain close to 3.0%
during the third quarter, bond yields will rise to at least 7.50%
and intensify pressure on the Fed to hike short-term interest
rates. As the Fed will probably not want its tightening action
to coincide with a major political convention, it could take advantage
of the early August data reports to act a few weeks ahead of the
FOMC meeting.
<P>
With an election looming for both the White House and the Congress,
there will be political criticism of any Fed tightening this summer,
but Mr. Greenspan will have little problem justifying his action.
<B>If output growth remains at 3.0% or higher during the second
half of 1995, the unemployment rate will drop to 5.0% by year
end.</B> Despite the recent turmoil in the copper market, there
will also be a firming of industrial commodity prices and the
purchasing agent price index will probably climb back into the
60-70 range from 50 during May and 40 during April.
<P>
While it would be natural for the administration to frown upon
Fed tightening during the summer before a presidential election,
<B>the fact is it would be far more prudent for the Fed to move
quickly this summer than to delay policy adjustments until the
autumn.</B> As the Fed is still in a fine turning mode, any policy
adjustment this summer would only have a marginal impact on the
growth rate of output and real income this autumn. But procrastination
by the Fed could set the stage for large and destabilizing fluctuations
in bond and equity prices. If the Fed adheres to a passive policy
this summer, the Dow Jones Industrial Index could shoot up to
6,000 and push the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP
to 92-93% compared to its previous peak of 81.0% in 1929. If the
Fed continued to be surprised by the economy's resilience during
the third quarter, it could feel compelled to tighten by 50 basis
points or more during the autumn and set the stage for a major
equity market correction. <B>If the equity market correction was
large and compressed into a few days (as it was in October, 1987),
it could have a far more damaging impact on the economic credibility
of the Clinton administration than modest Fed tightening this
summer.</B> 
<P>
Fed officials are reluctant to comment in public about the stock
market but they are privately apprehensive about both the level
of equity prices and the extraordinary flow of retail money into
equity mutual funds. <B>As a result, they should understand the
logic of adjusting interest rates this summer rather than delaying
policy changes in a way which might maximize the risk of a financial
accident later this year.</B> Fed fine tuning will not eliminate
all stock market risk in the outlook. If the economy continues
to expand at a rate of 3.0-4.0% despite the Fed hiking short-term
interest rates by 25-50 basis points, the Fed could feel compelled
to push short-term interest rates all the way back to 6.0% or
even higher. In such a scenario, it would be difficult to avoid
a major stock market correction during the fourth quarter. But
as the Fed tightening would be spread over a period of three to
six months, investors would have time to adjust to the policy
change and the risk would diminish of a 1987 style stock market
crash.
<P>
<B>Tobin's Q and Market Prices</B> 
<P>
There has been extensive media discussion during recent weeks
about the risk of a large stock market correction occurring autonomously
from any monetary tightening because of the current ratio of share
prices to asset replacement costs. The so-called Tobin's Q ratio
of share prices to asset replacement costs is now at 1.7 compared
to a range of 0.3 to 1.4 before 1994. The Tobin Q ratio is computed
on the basis of Federal Reserve data which shows that the U.S.
corporate sector has a current net worth value of just under $4
trillion compared to a stock market which is now capitalized at
over $7 trillion. In 1994, the components of net worth were equipment
valued at $2.009 trillion, inventory valued at $1.037 trillion
and real estate valued at $2.1702 trillion. The real estate value
includes buildings worth $2.078 trillion and land worth $92.2
billion. The Fed is still compiling data for 1995 but on a preliminary
basis it is projecting that corporate current value net worth
will rise to $4247.3 billion, with the components consisting of
$2.233 trillion of real estate, $2.089 trillion of equipment and
$1.145 trillion of inventory.
<P>
The equipment and building components of the current value estimates
of corporate net worth are computed with broad indices of inflation
in the capital goods sector. The estimates of land value are based
on national surveys of real estate prices. As there has been deflation
in many high technology capital goods industries during the 1990's,
the value of non-residential plant and equipment has increased
by only 12% since 1990 despite large increases in capital investment.
<B>The corporate sector's land values, by contrast, have fallen
by almost 90% from their peak of $940 billion in 1989. While there
is no doubt that land values have fallen during the 1990's, it
is far from clear that the decline has been as steep as the Federal
Reserve data suggests</B>. If land values were restated to show
a decline of only 50%, corporate net worth would increase by $380
billion and the Tobin Q ratio would decline to 1.58 from 1.7.
If land values were still at 1989 levels, corporate net worth
would increase by almost $900 billion and Tobin's Q would decline
to 1.42.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
May 29, 1996</I>


<P>
The prospect of the U.S. being the first G-7 country to raise
interest rates this year suggests that the dollar will retain
the bias towards firmness which has been apparent during recent
weeks.
<P>
The German economy should improve during the summer but the Bundesbank
is unlikely to tighten until mid-1997 at the earliest.  Germany
has a large output gap and Bundesbank officials favor a weak D-mark
in order to discourage support from German industry for the introduction
of a new European currency.  The major constraint on further easing
this spring is the industrial unrest now occurring in Germany's
public sector as well as Bundesratt opposition to Chancellor Kohl's
proposed cuts in government expenditure.
<P>
<B>In Japan, there are increasing signs of economic recovery but
officials are downplaying the possibility of monetary tightening
because of the lingering credit quality problems of the financial
system.</B>  Tokyo journalists also report that recent bureaucratic
shuffles at the Ministry of Finance have increased the odds of
Dr. Eisuke Sakakibara being reappointed for another year as the
Director General of the international finance bureau.  As Dr.
Sakakibara has been a strong promoter of a firm dollar with both
Japanese investment firms and the New York hedge funds, his reappointment
should be a psychological plus for the U.S. dollar.  He does not
favor pushing the dollar all the way to 130 yen, as some press
reports have suggested, but he will certainly try to hold the
yen dollar rate in a trading range of 105-110 in order to promote
further improvement in Japanese corporate profitability.
<P>
The only potential negative factor for the dollar during the next
few quarters is increasing political risk in the U.S. and reduced
political risk in other countries.  It now appears that Mr. Yeltsin
will win the Russian presidential election and lessen the danger
of investors selling the currencies of Germany and other central
European countries because of a communist victory.  In the U.S.,
by contrast, <B>the opinion polls suggest that President Clinton
could win such a large victory in this November's presidential
election that he might be able to pull many new Democrats into
Congress with him</B>.  According to some pollsters, the Republicans
have potentially thirty vulnerable House freshmen while the Democrats
are likely to lose about four to six open seats in the south.
 If there is a net swing of 24 seats, the Democrats would be able
to retake control of the House and elect their majority leader,
Rep. Richard Gephardt, as Speaker.  The market would be concerned
about a Democratic recapture of the House for three reasons. 

<P>
First, Rep. Gephardt has often been an advocate of protectionist
trade policies in the past and was hostile to the administration's
financial rescue program for Mexico.  
<P>
Secondly, the Democratic Party has lost so many of its traditional
southern seats that it is a party increasingly dominated by the
big cities of the northeast, the middle west, and California as
well as their lower middle class suburbs.  Whereas the Democratic
Party had over 95% of the southern Congressional delegation as
recently as the early 1960's, it now has only one quarter of the
seats in the old Confederacy and could emerge from the next election
with only 10-15%.  <B>As a result, many of the new committee chairman
in a Democratic controlled Congress would be from poor urban districts
in cities such as Detroit, New York and Los Angeles.</B>  They
would be far more left of center on many economic policy issues,
such as public spending and labor market regulation, than both
the current Republican chairmen and the past Democratic committee
chairmen.
<P>
Finally, many investors would view a Democratic victory as a major
lost opportunity for structural reform of social security, Medicare
and other federal programs.  As the Republicans have not controlled
Congress for two consecutive terms since the 1920's and might
well engage in a demoralizing fratricidal conflict if they lose
control again after only one term, it is unclear when an opportunity
for structural reform would re-emerge.  In fact, the markets are
confronted with a unique set of historical circumstances this
year.  No Democratic President has won re-election for two consecutive
terms since the days of Franklin Roosevelt while the Republicans
have not controlled Congress for two consecutive terms since the
1920's.  Hence, if one were to extrapolate on the basis of history,
they would project that Senator Robert Dole would emerge as the
next president and that Richard Gephardt would be the new House
Speaker.  The odds of such an outcome appear modest today because
a Dole victory would probably guarantee Republican retention of
the Congress while a Clinton victory would not insure a Democratic
takeover of the House unless he won by a landslide.  But unless
Senator Dole rallies in the polls, the markets could become alarmed
about the prospect of the Republicans suffering an electoral debacle
this November.
<P>
Despite the current wide gap in the opinion polls, <B>it would
be premature for investors to conclude that the President is assured
of re-election</B>.  The Dole campaign is currently suffering
from money problems and his responsibilities in the Senate, but
four factors suggest that Senator Dole should enjoy a significant
improvement during the autumn.  First, the Republicans have a
strong hold on several southern and western states with about
160-170 electoral votes.  Secondly, the President has been pursuing
re-election by emphasizing Republican themes, such as a balanced
budget and family values.  While the strategy has worked so far,
the media could ultimately portray him as such a cynical manipulator
of public opinion that it will backfire.  Thirdly, the recent
conviction of the Governor of Arkansas and Mr. Clinton's former
real estate partners on various allegations of fraud will force
the media to probe further into allegations of corruption during
his tenure as Governor of Arkansas.  As Arkansas has many of the
characteristics of an emerging market, press scrutiny of the state
coupled with the Starr investigations of the first family's financial
affairs could easily revive doubts about the president's character.
 Finally, despite Mr. Dole's long history in U.S. public life,
pollsters working with voter focus groups have discovered that
most Americans know very little about him.  At one Republican
focus group, for example, only 25% of the voters were aware of
Mr. Dole's record during World War Two.  As the presidential campaign
intensifies and the media focuses more closely on the character
of the candidates, Senator Dole is likely to benefit at the expense
of the president.
<P>
<I><B>To summarize,</B></I> the U.S. economy is likely to expand
at a 3.0-4.0% annual rate during the second quarter because of
steady growth of consumption and investment as well as corporate
restocking of inventories.  There is still widespread disagreement
about the outlook for third quarter growth but recent reports
on employment intentions and capital goods demand suggest that
output growth should remain close to 3.0%.  As a result, there
will be further increases in the economy's level of resource utilization
which could encourage the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary
policy at the FOMC meeting in early July or late August.  The
recovery now underway in the economies of Latin America, China
and other developing countries, coupled with the cyclical upturn
projected for Europe and Japan also suggest that world output
growth could exceed 4.0% this year and next year for the first
time since 1988.  The dollar should remain firm because of the
strength of the U.S. economy and the desire of government officials
in both Germany and Japan to encourage depreciation of the D-mark
and the yen.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
May 6, 1996</I>


<P>


The performance of the financial markets will also play an important role in the FOMC thinking. <B>If bond yields rise well above 7.0% while the stock market remains firm, more governors will be willing to tighten policy in order to restrain investors' inflation expectations</B>.  Conversely, if rising bond yields produce a large stock market correction, there will be more reluctance to tighten because of concern about household wealth losses.  The personal savings rate has begun to decline after rising sharply last year, but it could easily change direction if households become pessimistic about the economy because of  falling equity prices.
<P>

If the Federal Reserve does raise interest rates this summer, it will be the first G-7 central bank to break with the pattern of global easing which has prevailed since early 1995.  Japanese interest rates have fallen to such low levels that the next policy change has to be a rate hike, but such a hike is unlikely to occur until late this year because of the credit quality problems of the Japanese financial system.  Monetary policy in Germany is likely to remain easy because of the government's moves towards fiscal restraint, the weakness of the German economy, and the moral hazard problems created by the increasingly probable replacement of the D-mark by a new European currency in the year 1999.  Since Chancellor Kohl's coalition  won a decisive victory in the German lander elections during late March, both financial markets and European central bank officials have begun to assign a much higher probability to the introduction of a new European currency in the year 1999.  French bond yields have fallen sharply in relation to German bond yields while the German yield curve has remained positively sloped because of investor apprehension about the loss of  the D-mark.  Bundesbank officials have many doubts about the viability of a new European currency, but they cannot stop Chancellor Kohl from going forward unless there is some exogenous political shock which erodes his power.   <B>Instead of actively resisting the introduction of the Euro, many Bundesbank officials have decided to encourage a gradual devaluation of the D-mark in order to lessen the support of German industry for switching to a new European currency</B>.  As foreign investors own nearly 40% of Germany's public debt, the Bundesbank cannot push this devaluation strategy too far, but there is little doubt that they would be willing to accept a 10-15% decline against the U.S. dollar and the yen as well as smaller corrections against other European currencies.
<P>

The prospect of Germany and other European countries pursuing an easy monetary policy in order to weaken their currencies, coupled with the likelihood of Japanese monetary policy remaining on hold through the autumn, increases the possibility of a positive growth surprise occurring in the G-7 countries next year.  The easy monetary conditions in the G-7 countries are also reviving capital flows to the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Africa and thus increasing the odds that they will enjoy stronger recoveries as well.  A few developing countries, such as Malaysia and Thailand, are raising interest rates in order to constrain domestic inflation pressures, but they are still likely to experience growth rates in excess of 7.0%.  The Yeltsin government is pursuing such populist fiscal policies in order to win the upcoming Russian presidential election, it will certainly have to reverse course if it wins, but the emergence of a large private sector in Russia should still permit positive output growth in the future after a long period of contraction.  After three years of tightening monetary policy in order to restrain inflation, China also has begun to relax monetary policy during recent days.  On  May 1st, it announced a reduction in the cost of working capital loans from 12.06% to 10.98%.  These interest rate adjustments also followed a selective easing of credit rationing policies late last year.  If we measure GDP on the basis of purchasing power parity adjustments to compensate for price differentials, Europe accounts for about 25% of world output, the U.S. for about 22%, Japan for about 9%, and China for about 8%.  <B>Monetary policy has therefore shifted towards an expansionary direction in about two-thirds of the world economy during the past four quarters and the shift is not yet completed in several countries</B>.  This monetary policy bias suggests that the world economy will become increasingly buoyant during the next six quarters, even if the U.S. economy enjoys only a moderately positive sub-cycle recovery during the second half of 1996.  As a result, <B>the IMF is predicting 4.3% growth in world output during 1997 compared to 3.8% this year, and 3.5 % in 1999</B>.
<P>

To summarize, the surprising resilience of final demand in the first quarter is provoking new discussion about Fed tightening  during the summer, but the FOMC is unlikely to support such tightening unless it sees clear evidence that output growth will remain above 2.5% on a sustained basis and industrial commodity prices start to rise more sharply.  The best leading indicators of a monetary policy change will be the performance of the purchasing agent price index, retail sales, and the bond market.  The generally accommodative tone of monetary policy in Europe and Japan suggests that the odds are increasing of a positive growth surprise in the world economy during 1997 and 1998.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
March 25, 1996</I>


<P>


  While central bank policy is likely to remain passive in the face of a moderate rebound in U.S. output growth, <B>there is a risk that bond yields could be more volatile.</B> The growth of hedge funds and other leveraged investors has given the bond market a far more speculative flavor than the equity market during recent years and thus bond prices often react far more violently to new economic information than other financial assets. In 1996, the U.S. bond market will also have to contend with volatility in the political outlook of investors, not just fluctuations in the business cycle.  

<P>

  On the basis of 30 year bond yields, real long-term interest rates are currently just under 4.0% in the U.S., 5.0% in Britain, and well over 5.0% in France and Germany. The ten-year bonds of Japan yield about 3.0% in real terms while in Switzerland they yield about 3.5%. In late December 1995, by contrast, real and nominal long-term interest rates were about 100 basis points lower in the U.S. and Europe.  

<P>

  The one event still capable of producing a positive bond market surprise in the face of stronger output growth during the second quarter would be a successful U.S. budget compromise. <B>The White House is sufficiently concerned about the large rise in U.S. bond yields since January that is has been putting out feelers to Senator Robert Dole about pursuing a new budget agreement.</B> The White House has long viewed him as a more amenable to a compromise than the House Republican leadership and his success in the Republican primaries has greatly increased his potential freedom of action. But despite the opportunity for new negotiations created by the Dole victory, there are still major hurdles to an agreement. The major case for the Republicans to accept a compromise is that they have fallen sharply in the opinion polls and many voters now perceive their attempt at confrontational budget negotiations to have been a failure. The barriers to a budget agreement are congressional and White House perceptions of the tradeoffs between improving the performance of the economy and achieving no deal. The Republicans fear that a budget agreement could help the president more than them by lowering bond yields and boosting the housing market. The White House fears that any compromise which trims Medicare spending will deny them the opportunity to engage in demagogic attacks on the Republicans in states with large populations of retired people, such as Florida. In short, neither side perceives overwhelming advantages to a deal while both sides perceive potential downside. As a result of these constraints, the odds of a deal will probably remain below 50% unless the economy is so strong during the second quarter that bond yields shoot over 7.0% and equity prices fall sharply. In such a scenario, the president would offer major concessions to obtain a deal.  

<P>

  While most investors are relieved that Senator Robert Dole has won firm control of the Republican nomination and thwarted the challenge posed by Patrick Buchanan, they are not optimistic about his prospects in November. They perceive him to be an older and less dynamic campaigner than the president. They also perceive that a third party candidacy by Ross Perot or Patrick Buchanan will draw votes largely at the expense of Dole. <B>They believe that Dole has a solid base of about 150 electoral votes in the South and West but they do not think that he will be able to carry California or the Great Lakes states unless the economy deteriorates sharply,</B> there is a foreign policy disaster, or the various investigations of the first family's financial affairs in the 'emerging market' state of Arkansas produce a formal indictment of Mrs. Clinton, not just press stories about sleazy business relationships. The special federal prosecutor, Mr. Ken Starr, has indicted the Governor of Arkansas and may obtain new evidence to use against the first family if he can obtain a conviction which encourages other Arkansas politicians to plea bargain at the expense of the president. But as the president has already survived four years of rumors about his personal life and financial affairs in Arkansas, the markets will remain skeptical about his vulnerability without major new disclosures.  

<P>

  While the president is clearly ahead at the present time, <B>there are several factors which could still produce a Dole victory.</B> First, the president received only 43% of the vote in 1992 and thus would have lost if Ross Perot had not taken 19% of the vote largely at the expense of the Republicans. Secondly, as the American president is both head of state and head of government, the issue of character looms large in public perceptions of the office. Senator Dole can campaign as a World War Two veteran who has devoted a lifetime to public service while nearly half of the electorate perceives the president to be a decadent, if not corrupt, member of the most self-indulgent generation in American history (the baby boomers). Thirdly, it is doubtful that Ross Perot will be able to come anywhere close to matching the 19% share of the vote which he received four years ago. In 1992, he was a new face and the opinion polls briefly suggested that he might win the election. In 1996, it is widely accepted that a vote for Ross Perot is ultimately a vote for Bill Clinton. Nor can Perot attract the support of people who voted for Patrick Buchanan because of his clear uncompromising position on abortion. Ross Perot supports the right to abortion, so the pro-life movement has no alternative but to return to the Republican Party. Finally, in contrast to George Bush four years ago, Dole should be able to attract the support of most conservatives because he provides them with an unprecedented opportunity to influence U.S. public policy through Republican control of both the White House and the Congress for the first time since the era of Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. The fact that Dole comes from a tradition of political moderation may offend some conservatives but the fact is the American people would probably not support the election of an ultra-conservative President and Congress at the same time. They like the checks and balances which come from dividing power between executive and legislative branches of different political persuasions. In fact, the president himself has effectively co-opted much of the Republicans' rhetoric so that he can campaign as the candidate who will eliminate the budget deficit in a humane way, not through savage cuts in popular middle class entitlement programs. It will be far easier for Senator Dole to portray himself as the president who can achieve his party's agenda without threatening ordinary people than it would have been for some of his party's other candidates.  

<P>

  As a result of these factors, the American presidential race is still wide open. The President's lead should narrow during the next few months but could re-open if the Republicans permit their convention to be dominated by extremist rhetoric or if Patrick Buchanan joins Ross Perot on a third party ticket which captures a large share of the Christian evangelical vote.  

<P>

  The Republicans are aware of these risks, so they should be able to avoid the mistakes which plagued them at the 1992 convention but Senator Dole will still have to demonstrate far more skill at coalition building with his party's right wing populists than was possible for George Bush.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
February 29, 1996</I>

<P>


The stagnation of real wages also has coincided with a dramatic expansion of pay among many senior executives as well as a stock market boom which has produced large gains for them on their stock option programs. Popular magazines, such as Newsweek, have played upon class resentments over such differentials in pay by running front page stories about the rise of the "Overclass" (the technocratic elite profiting from the new world economic order) and "Corporate Killers" (a recent cover story on chief executives responsible for large layoffs). In the mid-1980's, there also was considerable media discussion about the social side-effects of corporate restructuring through takeover activity but the restructuring of that era did not provoke as much resentment because the overall growth rate of the economy and real income was much stronger. As many of the takeover artists of the mid-1980's violated federal security laws, the public also derived some satisfaction from watching some of the most prominent players go to jail. The corporate restructuring of the 1990's is being driven by factors very different from the takeover boom of the mid-1980's. As U.S. equity price/earnings multiples are much higher today than they were ten years ago, the dominant factors driving the restructuring are technology, international competition and the cumulative impact of several years of low inflation on corporate cost control strategies, not Wall Street's search for new transaction fees. As a result of the explosive growth of mutual fund ownership, a far larger share of the American population is benefiting from the impact of company rationalization on profits and share prices than ever before but the linkage between share ownership and employment is much weaker among ordinary corporate employees than among senior executives. According to Labor Department data, only 13% of U.S. employees participated in deferred profit sharing plans during 1993 while just 3% of this group belonged to employee stock ownership programs (ESOPS) and less than 1.0% received stock bonuses. The low level of stock ownership among company employees has helped to enhance the appeal of the Buchanan attack on corporate America despite the tremendous growth occurring in public equity ownership through mutual funds, individual retirement accounts and other tax deferred family savings programs. In a few weeks, a special White House taskforce will issue a report examining the feasibility of investing some portion of the social security trust fund in the equity market. Such a development would create practically universal equity ownership in the U.S. but it is unlikely to occur for at least three years.
<P>

The OECD recently published a study on income distribution in the major industrial countries. <B>The OECD data suggests that the U.S. has significantly more income inequality than other industrial countries primarily because of the very small share of income accruing to people in the bottom quintile of the population.</B> In the U.S., the bottom 20% of the population received about 5.7% of income in 1986 compared to 7.8% in Canada, 10.6% in Sweden and 7.0% in Britain. The share of income accruing to the wealthiest 10% of the population in the U.S. was about 24% in 1986 compared to 22% in Canada, 23% in Britain, 18% in Sweden, and 22% in Australia. In developing countries, such as Brazil and Mexico by contrast, the top 10% of households receive over 40% of personal income while the bottom 20% received only about 2.0-3.0%. The offset to this inequality is that affluent Americans pay high effective marginal income tax rates by international standards. In 1986, people in the top quintile of U.S. income paid 53% of all taxes compared to 3.8% for people in the bottom quintile. In Canada, the top quintile paid 46.5% of all taxes compared to 3.6% for the bottom quintile. In Britain, the top quintile paid 46.5% of all taxes compared to 4.5% for the bottom quintile. 
<P>

The U.S. also enjoys remarkable social mobility between income classes. According to a recent research report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, only about 5.1% of the people in the bottom income quintile of the population during 1975 were still in that quintile by 1991. Instead, 29% had moved to the top income quintile, 30% to the second income quintile, 21% to the third highest income quintile, and 14.6% to the fourth. Among people in the fourth income quintile, 37.0% also had moved to the highest income quintile while another 32.6% had moved to the second highest income quintile. The fact is that many of the people in the bottom income quintile are elderly and living on savings income, not wages, or young and thus poised to increase their income sharply as they gain work experience. <B>The marital status of people also has a major impact on their income rankings.</B> Among white people, 25% of households headed by single females have income below $10,000 compared to 4.7% for married couples. Among black people, 44% of households headed by single females have incomes below $10,000 compared to 9.8% for married couples.
<P>

The factor which appears to explain the magnitude of American income inequality compared to other industrial countries is the low level of transfer payments to the poor. In 1986, transfer payments accounted for only 13.7% of median income in the bottom quintile of the U.S. population compared to 32.4% for Britain, 18.3% for Canada, 27.0% for Sweden and 22.5% for Australia. The recent upsurge of spending on the Earned Income Tax Credit may have altered this ratio but with the exception of the EITC program the U.S. has far less generous transfer payment programs for the non-elderly than most other industrial countries. No presidential candidate is currently advocating an expansion of transfer payment programs because most middle class Americans perceive transfer payments other than social security to be give-aways to low income minority groups. In other industrial countries, by contrast, there is much less racial polarization than in the U.S. and thus much greater willingness to use the government as an engine for income redistribution. <B>As a result of the racial constraints on popular support for using the federal government to promote income redistribution, it is not surprising that right wing populists, such as Patrick Buchanan, have focused so heavily on themes such as foreign competition and corporate greed to explain falling living standards.</B> Such issues permit him to play upon the theme of economic insecurity without offering any detailed program for increasing public expenditure to promote job training or redistribute income. 
<P>

<B>The Buchanan themes played well in New Hampshire because that state has had one of the most volatile economies in the nation during the past decade.</B> In the 1980's, New Hampshire enjoyed an economic boom because of the impact of strong employment growth in New England's computer and defense industries, a flight of tax refugees from Massachusetts, and a real estate development boom financed by the state's newly privatized mutual savings banks. In the early 1990's, the boom turned to a bust as the New England high tech sector suffered from a slump in defense spending and demand for micro computers while vacancy rates for real estate reached such high levels that many of the state's banks failed. As a result of these upheavals, New Hampshire has not been immune to the problem of job insecurity and eroding real wages despite a low unemployment rate. According to one consultant's report, median family income in new Hampshire fell by 14.7% between 1989 and 1994 compared to 4.7% for the nation.
<P>

In 1996, Buchanan received only 27% of the primary vote in New Hampshire compared to 37% when he challenged George Bush in 1992. But while the 1996 primary vote was more fragmented because of the large number of candidates, the profile of the Buchanan vote clearly reflected the theme of economic insecurity. His voters were more heavily male, poorly educated and young than the voters for other candidates. According to surveys, he received the votes of 31% of male voters compared to 26% for Dole, 21% for Alexander, and 12% for Forbes while among women he received only 25% of the vote. He obtained 31% of the votes of people aged 18-29 years compared to 18% for Dole, 29% for Alexander, and 13% for Forbes. Among people over the age of 60, he received only 25% of the vote compared to 39% for Dole, 19% for Alexander, and 10% for Forbes. He received 43% of the votes of non-college graduates compared to 21% for Dole, 22% for Alexander, and 13% for Forbes whereas among college graduates he had only 23% of the vote compared to 27% for Dole, 23% for Alexander, and 12% for Forbes. Buchanan's voters also had strong ideological views. He collected the votes of 59% of people who described themselves as very conservative compared to 13% for Dole and 9% for Alexander while among moderates he obtained only 18% of the vote compared to 26% for Dole and 30% for Alexander. Buchanan received one third of the votes of people who said the economy mattered most compared to 25% for Dole and 23% for Alexander but his voting group was very much biased towards people with bad economic experiences. He received the votes of 27% of the people who said their personal financial situation had deteriorated compared to 19% for Dole, 24% for Alexander, and 14% for Forbes.

<I>Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and Local
Privatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>
As Congressman Gephardt has ambitions to run for president in the year 2000, it
is doubtful that the next Congress will be as left wing as the markets might
fear this autumn.  But Wall Street is apprehensive because it was surprised by
the upsurge of support for Patrick Buchanan in the Republican primaries during
early 1996.  With the unemployment rate so low, it was not prepared for such a
rapidly protectionist candidate to win the New Hampshire primary.<p>
<p>
Congressman Gephardt himself said after the early primaries that the politics
of the deficit was about to be replaced by the politics of income.  He
suggested that the Democratic Party would attempt to revive itself by focusing
on the economic insecurities and concerns about income inequality which had
helped to produce the Buchanan primary victories.  If the Democrats regain
control of Congress, they are likely to emphasize such themes in their
legislative agenda for 1997.<p>
<p>
The critics of the U.S. economy have three major complaints.  First, real wages
have been stagnant for several years.  Secondly, there is growing income
inequality on the basis of differentials in education.  Thirdly, corporations
provide excessive compensation for a few senior executives at the same time
that they are demanding pay cuts or other sacrifices from low and middle income
workers.  <p>
<p>
There is no doubt that real wage growth has slowed dramatically compared to the
growth rates which prevailed before the oil crises of the 1970's.  But it is
far from clear that hourly wages deflated by the consumer price index are a
good proxy for what is happening to total U.S. compensation.  There is
considerable evidence that the CPI now overstates inflation.  If we adjust
wages with the new measures of the CPI being developing to measure inflation
more accurately or deflators of prices being charged by U.S. companies, there
has been modest growth of real wages during the past decade, not a decline.
Many firms also offer their workers generous non-wage compensation in order to
avoid taxes, including pensions and health care.  Such benefits are now equal
to about 18% of total compensation compared to 5% in the late 1940's.<p>
<p>
There is growing income inequality based on education because new developments
in technology are forcing firms to bid up the price of educated workers
compared to people with fewer skills.  With the economy now close to full
employment, it is likely that unskilled workers will now have an opportunity to
improve their wage negotiating power because of labor scarcity in many regions.
The unemployment rate is now below 5.0% in states accounting for almost one
half of the national labor market and such a low level of unemployment has
always encouraged faster wage growth in the past.<p>
<p>
Corporations have been able to justify large compensation programs for their
executives during the 1990's because profits have boomed and share prices have
risen sharply.   The problem with the corporate sector is that only about 13%
of U.S. workers qualify for profit sharing plans while only another 3% belong
to ESOP programs (Employee Stock Ownership).  As a result, there is a weak link
in the U.S. corporate sector between employment and share ownership.  About 51
million Americans have exposure to the stock market through mutual funds,
defined contribution pension plans, and other forms of share ownership but they
do not enjoy the same preferential access to shares as senior executives in
most corporations. The perceived unfairness of this imbalance also has been
magnified  in the public mind by the fact that it is the large Fortune 500
companies which have done the most aggressive restructuring since 1980.  During
the past fifteen years, the old Fortune 500 companies have reduced their
employment from 16.5 million jobs to 11.5 million jobs despite the fact that
total U.S. employment has expanded by almost 28 million.  The high visibility
of the Fortune 500 layoffs in the media has produced a far greater sense of
insecurity among American workers than than can be justified by the economy's
overall employment performance.<p>
<p>
While the American corporate sector can be faulted for narrow stock option
programs and insensitive public relations in the way it conducts
restructurings, the fact remains that the U.S. has the most successful labor
market for job creation in the industrial world.<p>
<p>
Since 1980, the U.S. economy has created 28 million new jobs for a labor force
of 134 million and in the process absorbed 95% of all the new labor force
entrants.  About 20 million American also change their job every years.  Since
1980, the European Union has created about 14 new million jobs for a labor
force of 194 million and absorbed only about one half of the new labor force
entrants.  As a result, unemployment in continental Europe is at doubt digit
levels for the population as a whole and much higher for young people.<p>
<p>
The U.S. also enjoys great social mobility.  Among those in the bottom income
quintile twenty years ago, 29% have gone to the top income quintile, 30% to the
second and 21% have moved to the third.  The number of American households
earning over $100,000 per annum in 1994 dollars has risen from 1.0 million in
1967 and 2.7 million in 1980to over 6 million today.<p>
<p>
Most other industrial countries are deeply envious of the U.S. labor market.
In April, a German business magazine published a cover story about how Germany
should regard the U.S. economy as a role model for labor market reform.  The
cover showed a picture of Chancellor Kohl (a man who weighs well over 200
pounds) trying to squeeze into an Uncle Sam costume.  Shortly after the article
appeared, Chancellor Kohl announced several measures to encourage job creation,
including reduced payroll taxes and a proposal to abolish many expensive
government regulations on firms which employ ten workers or less.  Under the
previous law, such rules applied to firms  employing more than 5 people.  In
the U.S., by contrast, firms are not subject to many federal labor laws until
their total employment exceeds 50 workers.<p>
<p>
However envious Europe may be of the U.S. labor market, though one of the risks
poised by this autumn's election is that the voters will believe politicians
who say that it is malfunctioning.  In politics, perceptions are reality and
many Americans perceive that the U.S. economy is producing unfair outcomes by
redistributing income from the poor to the rich.<p>
<p>
The Democratic congressional leadership has announced a variety of proposals to
promote "stakeholder capitalism" and protect employment through new corporate
subsides and labor market regulations.  While such proposals are well
intentioned, the experience of Europe suggests that they would be highly
counter productive over the long-term.  They would produce a more rigid labor
market and discourage hiring without necessarily reducing wage inequality.<p>
<p>
While politicians in Washington have dominated the debate about income
inequality and social fairness, the politicians who actually have the greatest
capacity to promote a more just society in the U.S. are state and local
government politicians.  They have a major role to play because they are
responsible for the nation's educational system.  The U.S. spends about 6.5% of
its GDP on education and Washington is responsible for only about $40 billion
of the expenditures.  The only effective way to reduce income inequality in an
era rapid of technological change is to ensure that everyone has effective
access to a good education.  Yet, real education spending has been stagnant and
even declining in some states despite the growing public concern about income
inequality.  Attempts to promote more effective use of education dollars
through vouchers and other forms of school choice also have been stymied by
opposition from teachers unions.<p>

<I>Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>





The growth of the mutual fund industry has had several effects on the economy.

<P>

First, it has encouraged the household sector to boost its equity market exposure to the highest level since the 1960's.  Household ownership of equities and mutual funds now exceeds 25% of all households financial assets compared to 15.5% in 1995, 13.5% in 1975, and a previous peak of 36.0% in 1968.  Mutual funds now also represent about 25% of total household equity portfolios compared to 14% in 1985, 6% in 1968 and less than 4% in the 1960's.

<P>

Second, the growth of the mutual fund industry is broadening the number of households with exposure to the equity market.  According to data from Federal Reserve surveys of household finances, about 17.8% of U.S. households owned equities directly in 1992 compared to 19.l1% in 1983 and 17.2% in 1962.  But if we include mutual funds, the share of households owning equities rises to 22.0% from 20.1% in 1983 and 19.0% in 1962.  If we include IRA's, Keogh plans, and defined contribution plans, the share rises to 37.4% from 33.2% in 1983.  There is no comparable data for the 1960's because IRA's and defined contribution pension plans were non-existent before the 1970's. 

<P>

While the share of the population owning equities has been expanding steadily during recent years, the great bulk of U.S. equity continues to be owned by high income people.  According to the Federal Reserve survey of household finances, people with incomes above $250,000 (1.2% of total households) own 29.11% of all publicly traded stock compared to 20.78% for the income group earning $100,000-250,000  (5.9% of total households), 8.76% for the income group earning $75,000-100,000 (5.51% of total households) and 15.16% for the income group earning $50,000-75,000 (13.38% of total households).

<P>

If we divide the population on the basis of wealth, the ownership of equity appears to be even more concentrated.  According to the Fed surveys, the wealthiest 0.5% of  U.S.  households own 58.6% of all publicly traded stock compared to 11.74% for the second 0.5%, 24.18% for the next 4% of households, 4.62% for the next 5% and less than 1.0% for the remainder of the population.  In the case of housing equity, by contrast, the bottom 80% of the population owns 28% of residential housing stock compared to just under 16.0% for the top 1.0% of the population.
Age also plays an important role in equity ownership.  In the 1992 Fed survey, households with ages above 65 owned 41.36% of all publicly of traded stock compared to 19.25% for the age group 55-64 years, 18.07% for the age group 45-54 years, and 17.01% for the age group 35-44 years.

<P>

But while U.S. equity ownership is highly concentrated among older high income people, it is becoming more diffuse. The share of publicly traded equity owned by people with incomes above $250,000 fell from 50.60% in 1983 to 29.11% in 1992.  If we broaden the measure of equity ownership to include mutual funds, IRA's, Keoghs and defined contribution plans, the share of the top income group drops from 43.06% in 1983 to 22.72% in 1992.  The major gainers are groups with incomes below $100,000.  The group with incomes of $75,000-100,00 per annum has expanded its share of all equities including mutual funds, IRA's, Keogh's defined contribution pension, to 12.1% from 7.28% in 1983.  The $50,000-75,000 group has boosted its share from 12.63% in 1983 to 16.75% in 1992.  The group earning $25,000-50,000 has boosted its share of  equity from 8.08% in 1983 to 18.39% in 1992.  The group earning under $25,000 has boosted its share from 3.06% in 1983 to 7.07% in 1992.

<P>

Stock ownership is also becoming less concentrated on the basis of age, not just income.  In 1992, households over the age of 65 owned 41.35% of U.S. publicly traded equity compared to 49.24% in 1983.  The age group 35-44 years, by contrast, has increased its share of  publicly traded equity from 6.83% in 1983 to 17.01% in 1992.  Share ownership is also far more diffused when mutual funds, IRA's, Keogh plans, and defined contribution plans are included.  On this basis, the share of equity owned by households over 65 years of age falls from 43.14% in 1983 to 30.71% in 1992 while the share of households aged 35-44 years rises from 9.13% to 16.97%.

<P>

Equity ownership on the basis of wealth continues to be highly concentrated but it is becoming gradually more diffuse.  In 1992, the top 1.0% of households owned over 70% of publicly traded U.S. equity compared to 78% in 1983 and 75.07% in 1962.  The next 4% of the population owned 24.18% of publicly traded stock in 1992 compared to 17.38% in 1983 and 20.4% in 1962.  The next 5% of the population owned 4.62% of publicly traded stock in 1992 compared to 3.58% in 1983 and 3.77% in 1962.  The bottom 80% of the population continues to own an insignificant share of publicly traded stock compared to 13.7% of all non-equity financial assets, 28.07% of the national housing stock and 19.2% of total household net worth. What has changed dramatically as a result of the mutual fund boom is the distribution of bond ownership by wealth class.  In 1992, the wealthiest 1.0% of the U.S. population owned 41.6% of all bonds compared to 78% in 1989.  The next 9% of the population has expanded its share of the bond market from 16.1% to 46.3% while the other 90% of the population has boosted its share from 5.9% to 12.0%.

<P>

Thirdly, the growth of the mutual fund sector is altering the ownership structure of the U.S. corporate sector.  In 1994, mutual funds owned 13.6% of U.S. corporate equity compared to 7.1% in 1990, 5.0% in 1985 and 4.5-5.5% during the 1960's.  During the modern era, the dominant trend in equity ownership has been a steady decline in the household share and a steady increase in the pension fund share.  In 1951, households owned 90% of U.S. corporate equity compared to 1.1% for pension funds, 3.1% for mutual funds, 3.5% for insurance companies, and 2.2% for foreign investors.  The household share remained high through the 1950's but plunged to 55.0-60.0% by the early 1970's while the pension fund share grew to 15.0-16.0% and bank personal trusts expanded to 11.0-12.0%.  The household share of corporate equity continued to erode during the 1980's and is now only 47.7%.  The bank trust account share also has slid to 2.7% while the pension fund share has been stable in the 24-26% range since the mid-1980's.  The growth of defined contribution pension plans, individual retirement accounts, and 401-K plans will probably continue to boost the mutual fund share of U.S. corporate equity during the late 1990's at the expense of direct household ownership.  But since households own two thirds of mutual fund assets as well as most trust fund and defined benefit pension plans asssets, analysts estimate that households still control about two thirds of all U.S. corporate equity on a direct and indirect basis.

<P>

Fourthly, the growth of mutual fund assets has helped to encourage a tremendous boom in securitized finance by companies. The number of initial equity public offerings has risen to record high levels during recent years partly because of the demand for new securities from the mutual fund sector.  The number of equity IPO's was 582 in 1995, 646 in 1994, 471 in 1993, 447 in 1992, 330 in 1991 and only 150 in 1990.  These IPO's raised about $34 billion of new capital for companies in 1995, $30 billion in 1994, $25 billion in 1993, $19.4 billion in 1992, and $13.8 billion in 1991 compared to only $4.2 billion in 1990.  The search for higher yields also revitalized the so-called "junk bond market".  In 1993, Wall Street sold about $60 billion of non-investment grade bonds compared to $42 billion in 1992, $16.9 billion in 1991, and $2.9 billion in 1990.

<P>

The improved access to equity and debt finance for small and medium sized companies is important to job creation because practically all of America's employment growth since 1980 has been concentrated in that sector.  Between 1979 and 1994, the Fortune 500 companies reduced their employment from 16.2 million to 11.8 million.  In the 1980's, the employment losses at large firms were offset by job creation at small firms, but during the early 1990's the economy stalled in part because the small firms lost access to the credit market.  In 1993, by contrast, the mutual fund boom provided small firms with unprecedented access to the debt and equity markets while the recovery in bank profitability encouraged banks to ease their lending conditions as well.  The securitization boom has even had a benign effect on the U.S. real estate market.    During 1992 and 1993, Wall Street sold retail investors about 100 new Real Estate investment Trusts worth $12 billion.  These trusts permit investors to invest in real estate without being subject to double taxation of income.  They became popular as interest rates fell because commercial property still offered yields in the 10-12% range.  As a result of the IPO boomlet for real estate, the market capitalization of the REIT sector now exceeds $60 billion compared to less than $10 billion during 1990.

<P>

Fifth, the growth of the mutual fund industry is helping to encourage an unprecedented outflow of capital from the U.S. to foreign security markets.  The number of purely international equity funds has expanded from 13 in 1984 to 367 while the number of global equity funds (including U.S.) has grown from 16 to 176.  Meanwhile, the population of global bond funds has shot up from 1 in 1985 to 145 today.  International and global equity funds have expanded their assets from $37 billion in 1992 to $212 billion recently while global bond funds grew from $27.6 billion to a peak of $40 billion in early 1994 before rising interest rates caused an upsurge of net redemptions which reduced assets to $33 billion in late 1995.  The creation of this new infrastructure for retail diversification into foreign securities has made New York a far larger market for international bonds and equities than it has ever been before.  But the retail demand for foreign securities is volatile.  The share of money flows into international mutual funds peaked at 44% in early 1994 and then slumped to less than 20% during much of 1995 as Wall Street boomed.  The assets of international money market funds have slumped from a peak of $21.4 billion during the period of high European interest rates after German unification to only $3.7 billion recently.  In January, 1996, money flows into international and global equity funds shot up to over $6 billion from only $1-2 billion in mid-1995 but their share of total equity sales was still only 25%.

<P>

Finally, the mutual fund boom is forcing banks to introduce new fund products  in order to retain their share of household savings flows.  In 1994, 2072 banks sold mutual funds and 46% of them were proprietary funds compared to 31.5% in 1991.  In the early 1990's, banks primarily offered money market funds but they are also now actively promoting equity and bond funds.  Such products accounted for over 70% of their money flows in 1994 compared to only about one half in 1991.  Government officials are concerned that households may confuse mutual fund products with government insured deposits, so they are encouraging banks to carefully explain to customers that their mutual fund products do not enjoy FDIC protection but surveys indicate that bank customers do not always fully understand the distinction.  The growth of bank sponsored mutual funds is also complicating the task of the Federal Reserve in monitoring the growth of the nation's monetary aggregates.  The Fed includes money market funds in its measure of M2 but it does not include any share of bond and equity funds despite the fact that such funds often have check writing privileges.

in Washington, D.C., in conjunction with the new public television
series &quot;In the Prime.&quot; &quot;In the Prime,&quot; a 26-part
television series dealing with issues and topics for people who
are in the prime of their life, was underwritten by Kemper Funds
Group. 
<P>
<I>Couples and Money</I> Psychotherapist Olivia Mellan is a ground-breaker
in the field of money psychology and conflict resolution. Mellan
explains what makes people irrational about money and identifies
money myths, money personalities and the dynamics of couples and
money.
<P>
<I>The Mind-Body Connection</I> James S. Gordon, M.D., a Harvard
Medical School graduate, takes an approach that emphasizes the
power of self-care through self-awareness, meditation, relaxation,
self-hypnosis, nutrition and exercise. This video shows how these
techniques and approaches -- from acupuncture to herbalism, from
meditation to massage -- improve health and treat serious illnesses.

<P>
<I>Changing Careers</I> Through a series of simple exercises,
motivational speaker, author and career specialist Carole Hyatt
helps viewers identify their own &quot;strands&quot; and explore
how to reweave them into new patterns to create their next careers.
<P>
As the national underwriter of &quot;In the Prime,&quot; Kemper
Funds Group can offer these videos at a significant discount.
When offered through normal channels, the videos sell for $24.95
each with postage and handling. But you can purchase each for
only $14.95 with postage and handling by calling (800) 498-4041.
That's a $10 savings on each video.
<P>
 &quot;In the Prime&quot; can be seen weekly throughout most of
the country on the local PBS affiliate. <A HREF="intheprime_times.html">Check local listings</A>

<FONT SIZE=-1>*A series of Kemper Money Funds.<BR>
# Portfolios are subject to change.</FONT SIZE=-1>

<P>

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048), 
<A HREF="../prospectus_email.html">
e-mail us your request</A> for a prospectus through the mail or 
<A HREF="../prospectus_download.html">
download a prospectus.</A>

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.
<P>

Please see <A HREF="../prospectus.html">

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_title.gif" ALT="The GROWTH Investing Strategy">
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_head.gif" ALT="Riding the Surge of Hard-Charging Companies"><BR>
Growth style equity investors earn their spurs by roping in hot-performing companies and riding their rising earnings for as long as they can.
<P>
For the growth stockpicker, the game plan is simple: <B>Earnings drive stock prices, so invest in those companies that are outearning the market.</B> "We focus on the fastest growing sectors of the market or economy and invest in leading companies that have historically delivered consistent earnings growth. Most importantly, we look for growth stocks selling at a reasonable price," says Patrick Adams, portfolio manager of the $2.7 billion <A HREF="../../funds/growth.html">Kemper Growth Fund</A> (as of 9/30/96).
<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_criteria.gif" ALT="Kemper Growth Stock Selection Criteria">

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_subhd1.gif" ALT="Throwing A Lasso Around Growing Companies"><BR>
Growth stock followers scan the investment horizon, hoping to catch a glimpse of that rarest of breeds -- successful companies with the potential to sustain growth over the long term. Industry heavyweights like Microsoft, Disney, and Home Depot come to mind.
<P>
In searching for these stocks, analysts look for the indicators that point to a sunny earnings forecast. They pursue firms with healthy profits, rising sales, and rock-solid balance sheets. They dig beyond the numbers to unearth market leaders with strong management teams, superior products, and minimal competition. They scour the corporate landscape in search of innovative technologies.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_subhd2.gif" ALT="Seeking Less Risk, To Boot"><BR>
High-flying earnings potential, however, is only part of the Kemper growth equation. To avoid being saddled with unnecessary risks, you also have to factor in the price of your growth.
<P>
"The key is to reap the potential rewards of growth stock investing without overpaying for that growth," says Tom Regner, equity strategist for Zurich Kemper Investments. "It's a philosophy we at Kemper Funds call <B>'growth at the right price,' or 'GARP.'</B>"
<P>
It's also a philosophy that calls for even deeper levels of research, a strong suit of the Zurich Kemper Investment organization. A company's earnings must not only be accurately projected, they must also be measured against its stock price to determine whether the anticipated growth is underpriced, overvalued, or priced fairly.
<P>
"Look for opportunities where all the good news is not yet reflected in the stock's price," explains Mr. Regner. "If you can find a company that's 20% more expensive than the market but growing 40% faster, buy it."
<P>
But when to sell? Like any good investment style, the growth philosophy is ruled by clear-cut buy and sell disciplines. <B>The time to end the ride is when the stock reaches its fair market value or a decline in earnings is anticipated.</B>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_subhd3.gif" ALT="A Classic, Straightforward Approach To Growth"><BR>
Kemper's growth philosophy focuses on stocks that don't depend on the economy for their success. "We follow a bottom-up approach where company fundamentals, not the economy, steer us toward great companies at attractive prices," says Mr. Adams. As an example of this "growth at the right price" philosophy, he points to the stocks in the Kemper Growth Fund, which have enjoyed an 18% long-term growth rate (as of 9/30/96).
<P>
While the fortunes of some growth stocks may not be tied to the economy, <B>certain industries fare better in different cycles.</B> When the economy cools, for instance, growth managers tend to look toward health care and financial stocks. Their attention may shift, however, to technology and consumer products as the economy heats up.
<P>
Much of the results of a growth portfolio will typically come in the form of capital appreciation. As a general rule, growth companies pay low dividend yields, choosing instead to reinvest their earnings for continuing expansion.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_subhd4.gif" ALT="A Range of Growth Options"><BR>
While growth stocks share several key characteristics, they come in many shapes and sizes. In the <A HREF="../../funds/bluechip.html">Kemper Blue Chip Fund</A>, you'll find household names, such as Eli Lilly and B.F. Goodrich. The <A HREF="../../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund</A> features emerging companies like Tellabs. And the long-standing <A HREF="../../funds/technology.html">Kemper Technology Fund</A> holds today's leading innovators, including 3Com and U.S. Robotics. (Keep in mind that portfolio composition and holdings are subject to change, and investments in smaller companies present greater risk than investments in larger, more established companies.)
<P>
When compared to the value school, growth provides a more conventional, mainstream approach. And so, it appeals to droves of investors who are naturally lured by the sparkle of the brightest corporate lights, the promise of the market's latest trendsetters, and the prestige of some of Wall Street's best-known names -- companies that often change the way we live, work, and play.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/value_head.gif" ALT="Bravely Entering The Arena Of Contrarian Stocks"><BR>

Like the courageous matador, the value investor stands firm in the face of lowered expectations surrounding a stock.
<P>
<B>Value represents a contrarian style,</B> finding beautiful swans where the rest of the market sees ugly ducklings. It pursues the downtrodden and overlooked -- stocks of viable companies that are currently out-of-favor and on sale at bargain prices.
<P>
"We look for stocks that are unloved for the wrong reason," says David Dreman, chairman of Dreman Value Advisors and a leading champion of value investing. "We believe there will be enough positive earnings surprises or opinion changes, so that these companies will outperform the market over time." Regarded as a pioneer among contrarians, Mr. Dreman currently manages the <A HREF="../../funds/high_return.html">Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund</A>, ranked by Lipper as the number one mutual fund in the equity-income category over the one-year, five-year, and life-of-fund time periods as of 9/30/96.*  (One yr. - 1/147; five yr. - 1/57; life - 1/37)
<P>

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/value_subhd1.gif" ALT="Sidestepping Investor Fears"><BR>
In the topsy-turvy arena of investing, value disciples count on one predictable outcome: investor over-reaction to bad news, which inevitably sends short-term stock prices tumbling to levels much lower than their earnings would suggest. Bad news can come in many forms -- a disappointing earnings quarter, concerns over the economy in general, disturbing news out of the White House.
<P>
Investors were seeing red, for example, during the 1993 debate over health care reform. Health care stocks nosedived, and value investors picked up some quality companies usually found only in the growth sector. Since then, talk of revamping the medical system has quieted, while many of those health care stocks have rebounded nicely.
<P>
What does a Kemper-Dreman value stock look like? <B>Its most distinguishing characteristic is a low price-to-earnings ratio,</B> the holy grail pursued by most value investors. In addition to a small price tag, however, value stocks must show signs of financial strength, along with above-average dividend yields and historical growth of earnings and dividends -- qualities found today in companies such as Fannie Mae, Banc One, and Philip Morris.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/value_subhd2.gif" ALT="The Discipline To Stand Your Ground"><BR>
Value investing appeals to the bargain hunter in all of us. It's the same force that compels us to buy our swimwear and lawn furniture in the dead of winter.
<P>
But value also attracts the patient and disciplined investor. It takes time for out-of-favor companies to achieve the turnaround that value investors bank on. And it takes discipline to follow the strict principles of the Kemper-Dreman strategy, which means <B>selling stocks when P/E ratios approach the market average,</B> regardless of how favorable their prospects appear.
<P>
While some critics maintain that value is a riskier proposition, supporters maintain just the opposite. The stock's prices and expectations are already low, they argue, so additional downturns can't do much damage. "Put it this way. You will probably get hurt worse falling from a high ladder than from a small step stool," observes Mr. Dreman.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/value_subhd3.gif" ALT="The Finesse And Confidence Of The Contrarian"><BR>
Many recent academic studies suggest that contrarians may be onto something with their strategy of pursuing stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios.

</TABLE>

Mr. Dreman has devoted his life's work to studying the performance of low-priced stocks. His much-published analysis of 1,500 large companies has shown that low P/E stocks outperformed high P/Es over a 20-year period (see chart at right). In fact, the cheapest stocks in the study topped the market average for annual returns by a margin of 17.2% to 14.7%. The most expensive stocks, on the other hand, posted average annual returns of just 11.2%.
<P>
Mr. Dreman's research looks at total return, including both appreciation and dividends. Because value stocks pay higher-than-average dividends, they tend to weather down markets better than growth stocks. When times are tough, it's often those dividend returns that help to prop up stock prices and provide a measure of capital protection.

<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/value_subhd4.gif" ALT="A Variety Of Value Opportunities"><BR>
Other research shows that low-priced stocks performed better than big-ticket stocks among companies of all sizes. As a result, the Kemper-Dreman team has applied their contrarian school of thought to their entire line of value portfolios.
<P>
The <A HREF="../../funds/contrarian.html">Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund</A>, for example, pursues large cap companies such as General Electric and Mobil. At the other end of the spectrum, the Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund consists of smaller companies, like Bally Entertainment. And the Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund focuses mostly on larger companies, which currently include Amoco and Humana. As noted earlier, portfolio composition and holdings are subject to change.

By now, you've seen that growth and value are vastly different styles of equity investing. Growth pursues fashionable companies in the penthouse, while value roots around for buried treasures in the bargain basement. Value likes underpriced stocks; growth likes oversized earnings.
<P>
So the question may still linger: <B>Growth or value?</B> Which style is best suited to you as a long-term investor looking to help reduce risks? <B>Both.</B> Like cowboy boots and the matador's slippers, investment styles work best in pairs. For the savvy investor, the issue is not one of growth or value, but rather growth and value. Why? In a word, diversification.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_and_value_subhd1.gif" ALT="A Two-Handed Approach To Diversifying"><BR>
Every investment professional preaches the value of diversification. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, they advise. Spread your investments across several instruments as a way of helping lower risk.
<P>
Good advice, but many investors fail to realize that real diversification occurs when investments are also spread across the two styles of growth and value.
<P>
Yes, the two disciplines are radically different approaches to stock investing, but investors must come to view them as complementary, not competing. There's plenty of room for both in a well-rounded investment portfolio.
<P>
<B>"Using only one investment style is like rowing a boat with only one oar,"</B> says Steve Reynolds, chief investment officer of equities for Zurich Kemper Investments. "You may eventually reach your destination, but it's going to be a tougher trip."

</TABLE>

Despite their many differences, growth and value actually share some significant common threads. Both techniques pursue financially strong, quality companies with steady track records of growth. And, in the case of Kemper's "growth at the right price" philosophy, both also seek mispriced stocks that are selling below their real, or intrinsic, value. For the ambidextrous investor who's equally adept at growth and value, a blended portfolio of both styles may produce better results than a "one-handed" approach.
<P>
And then there's risk to think about.
<P>
If the diversification preachers are right, a portfolio of growth and value should carry lower risks than an all-growth or all-value strategy. And that's exactly what happens. An analysis (see chart at right) reveals that <B>a portfolio containing equal investments in the two styles would have had lower volatility than either style alone.</B>

<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_and_value_subhd2.gif" ALT="Stick To Your Guns"><BR>
Growth and value are both governed by sets of strict, uncompromising principles about the buying and selling of stocks. That's why both disciplines work so well over time. But in the short term, depending on the temperature of the economy, one style usually outshines the other.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
Annualized returns based on year-end data from S&amp;P 500 stock groupings. The chart shows performance of the S&amp;P/Barra Growth and Value Indexes. These unmanaged indexes are generally representative of U.S. growth stocks and U.S. value stocks, respectively. The indexes  assume reinvestment of distributions and do not reflect the effects of sales charges or brokerage commissions. Fund holdings and performance will differ. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
</FONT>
<P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

Growth and value tend to be counter-cyclical, with one style usually outperforming the other (see
table at left). This year, both styles are up, with growth surpassing value by a fairly healthy margin. Through the first nine months of 1996, the S&amp;P/Barra Growth Index was up 15.6%, compared to 13.5% for the S&amp;P 500 and 11.4% for the S&amp;P/Barra Value Index.
<P>
The tendency of growth and value to flip-flop positions as top performer can be both a blessing and a curse. For the wise investor who steadfastly commits to both schools, it means better diversification. For the impetuous investor, however, the temptation may be to switch back and forth between growth and value, pledging allegiance to whichever style happens to be in vogue at the time. Unfortunately, most of these chameleons tend to jump ship just when their abandoned style is about to set sail.
<P>
"Style switching is one of the main reasons investors and fund managers underperform the market," says Mr. Reynolds. "Style switchers almost never win. That's why it's so important to know that your fund managers are dedicated to their investment style."
<P>
<B>A portfolio of growth and value also provides an additional benefit -- less duplication of stocks.</B> A mutual fund investor, for instance, may choose three different growth funds that each invest in the same industries, maybe even the same companies. While there may be occasional overlaps between growth and value, the two styles generally cast their lines in entirely different waters.
<P>
In the end, the smart investor will resist the urge to time the market and remain faithful to the proven styles of growth and value. "Without a strong commitment to your investment styles, the market usually takes advantage of you instead of you taking advantage of the market," notes Mr. Reynolds.
<P>
So commit to an investment style. Better yet, commit to two. Armed with the cowboy's lasso in one hand and the matador's cape in the other, you'll be fully equipped to take the bull by the horns when you take on your investment challenges.
<P>
Please note that there is no guarantee that a particular management style will be successful and that the past performance of a particular style is not representative of future results.

Astute investors don't buy individual mutual funds; they build diversified portfolios of funds -- some growth and some value, some small cap and some large cap. The challenge is often not in the diversifying, but in finding one company that can provide such a variety of investment options.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/diversified_subhd1.gif" ALT="One Source For A Well-Rounded Portfolio"><BR>
<A HREF="../../about/aboutzki.html">Zurich Kemper Investments</A> is the nation's only mutual fund complex where growth and value are managed independently by separate organizations with their own headquarters, management teams, portfolio managers, analysts, and even two chief investment officers. Zurich Kemper Investments, located in Chicago, manages the firm's growth portfolios, while New York-based Dreman Value Advisors, Inc., founded by contrarian pioneer David Dreman, directs the value side.
<P>
Today, Zurich Kemper Investments continues to add new members to its worldwide organization, bringing in experienced experts who are well-versed and fully committed to the Kemper Funds' styles of growth and value investing, as well as their renowned fixed-income and international portfolios.
<P>
Zurich Kemper Investments' trademark since 1948 has been research. Both disciplines rely heavily on accurate primary research to identify quality stocks at affordable prices. Says Steve Reynolds, chief investment officer of equities: <B>"The cornerstone of the Kemper Funds investment process is solid research, both quantitative and qualitative.</B> It's research that enables our portfolio managers to recognize stocks that are selling at bargain prices in the growth and value sectors and are likely to experience significant price appreciation."
<P>

A change in total return, considered to be the
best measure of fund
performance, could occur as a result of a change
in a dividend paid, a
change in net asset value or a combination of
both. 
<BR><BR>

Income fund shareholders may be more sensitive to
changes in dividends
because of their relative higher reliance on
dividend income. In
addition, income funds often pay as frequently as
once a month. 
<BR><BR>

Dividends paid by an equity fund include
distributions of the dividends
paid by stocks owned by the portfolio and any
profits earned when
individual stocks are sold. Any gains are
distributed at least annually,
and it is reasonable to expect some variation in
the dividend payment
from period to period.
<BR><BR>

Information on the fund's performance compared to
funds with similar
investment objectives can provide an insight that
absolute return
numbers cannot. No investor is pleased with
negative returns, for
example, but there will always be economic
periods that are hostile to
investors.

fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less

sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects

<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<FONT SIZE=-1>*Based upon the fund's yield and the 42.9% combined federal and
State of California income tax rate.</FONT SIZE=-1>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1># Portfolios are subject to change. <BR>
## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales
charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 4.50% for Kemper California Tax-Free Income Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow

tax rate. Income may be subject to state and local taxes, but there is
no Florida income tax for individuals. The fund's shares are expected to

<FONT SIZE=-1># Portfolios are subject

sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 4.50% for Kemper Florida Tax-Free Income Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<FONT SIZE=-1> # Portfolios are subject
to change.<BR> ## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 4.50% for Kemper Michigan Tax-Free Income Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember

Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<FONT SIZE=-1>*Based on the fund's yield and the 40.9% combined New Jersey and federal income tax rate.</FONT><BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1># Portfolios are subject
to change.<BR> ## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 4.50% for Kemper New Jersey Tax-Free Income Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048), 
<A HREF="../prospectus_email.html">

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<FONT SIZE=-1>*Based upon the fund's yield and the
44.3% combined federal and
state of New York and New York City income tax rate.</FONT><BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1># Portfolios are subject
to change. <BR> ## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 4.50% for Kemper New York Tax-Free Income Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<FONT SIZE=-1>*Based upon the fund's yield and
the 41.4% combined marginal federal and Ohio income tax rate.</FONT><BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1># Portfolios are subject to
change. <BR> ## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 4.50% for Kemper Ohio Tax-Free Income Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<FONT SIZE=-1>*Based on fund's yield
and 38.9% combined Pennsylvania state and federal income tax rate.</FONT><BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1># Portfolios are subject to
change. <BR> ## These figures are adjusted for maximum
sales charge (Class A) or the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in
effect at the end of the specified period (Class B). The maximum initial
sales charge (Class A) is 4.50% for Kemper Pennsylvania Tax-Free Income Fund. The CDSC schedule
for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%.
Adjustment for a full annual period is at CDSC for the next annual level.
Thus, 1-year returns are adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced
or eliminated under certain conditions as described in the funds'
prospectuses.

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 4.50% for Kemper Texas Tax-Free Income Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for
years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full annual
period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a

<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from

#Portfolios are subject to change.<BR>
## These figures are adjusted for maximum sales charge (Class A) or the
contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) in effect at the end of the
specified period (Class B). The maximum initial sales charge (Class A)
is 3.50% for Kemper Cash Reserves Fund. The CDSC schedule for Class B shares for years 1 to 6 is 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2% and 1%. Adjustment for a full annual
period is at CDSC for the next annual level. Thus, 1-year returns are
adjusted for 3% CDSC. For C shares, performance is adjusted for the 1% 
CDSC for shares redeemed within one year. Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under
certain conditions as described in the funds' prospectuses.
</FONT><BR>
<P>

For more complete information on any Kemper Fund, including management
fees and expenses, please request a free prospectus from your
financial representative, Kemper Shareholder Services (1-800-621-1048), 
<A HREF="../prospectus_email.html">
e-mail us your request</A> for a prospectus through the mail or 
<A HREF="../prospectus_download.html">

<P>

Read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. Remember
that there is no assurance that the objective of any mutual fund will
be achieved and mutual fund returns and net asset value fluctuate.
Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or
less than their original cost. Money market funds seek to maintain a
net asset value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that
they will. Mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. 
government. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<B>Performance And Yield Notes</B>
<BR>
Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns
and net asset values fluctuate. Shares
are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than the original cost. Kemper Money Funds seek to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Average annual total return and total return measure net investment
income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming reinvestment
of dividends and, for average annual total return only, adjustments for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the end of the periods,
as applicable.  Average annual
total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects
aggregate change. During the periods noted, securities prices
fluctuated. For each money market fund, the current annualized yield is
the seven day annualized net investment income per share as of the
indicated date. Gains or losses are not included. Effective yield
reflects compounding of income.
<P>

<B>Special Risks</B>
<BR>
Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher
rated securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper
High Yield Fund). For portfolios that invest internationally
(principally Kemper International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund, Kemper
Europe Fund, Kemper Diversified Income Fund, Kemper Asian Growth Fund
and Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund), there
are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that
may adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully
discussed in the funds' prospectuses. 
Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund
and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund) presents greater risk of loss
than investment in large companies. Concentration in certain market
sectors (Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund) presents special risk
considerations.
<P>

Performance of funds may be compared to the performance of various
unmanaged indices including, but not limited to: the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which are generally representative of the U.S.
stock market; the Wilshire Large Company Growth Index, which is
generally representative of the market for stocks of larger growth
companies (selected on the basis of sales growth, return on equity and
dividend payout); the Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond index,
which is generally representative of intermediate and long-term
government and investment grade corporate debt securities; the Morgan
Stanley Capital International EAFE, which is generally representative of
international markets; the FT/S&amp;P - Actuaries World Index - Europe, which 
is generally representative of the equity securities of European companies; the Consumer Price Index, generally
representative of the level of inflation; the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index on a U.S. dollar total return basis with all dividends reinvested and is comprised of government bonds from 14 countries; the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index generally representative of intermediate-term government 
bonds, investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed
securities; the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, which includes
approximately 15,000 bonds; the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which is an 
unmanaged index comprised of common stocks of larger U.S. companies with 
greater than average growth orientation and represents the universe of
stocks from which "earnings/growth" money managers typically select; and the
Russell 2000 index, which is an unmanaged capitalization weighted price only 
index which is comprised of 2000 of the smallest stocks in the Russell
3000 index. The performance of funds may also be compared to the combined performance of several indices.
<P>

Returns for Kemper Asian Growth Fund, Kemper Value+Growth Fund, Kemper-Dreman Funds and Kemper Europe Fund include the effect of a temporary waiver of
management fees and/or an absorption of certain operating expenses by Zurich 
Kemper Investments, Inc., as investment advisor, for periods
specified in the prospectus, which improved results. The absorption and
waiver for certain Kemper State Tax-Free Income Funds has been reinstated. Income from
tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes except as
otherwise provided in the prospectus, and a portion of income may be
subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain investors.

<B>Activity Summary: </B> The Growth Fund of Spain, Inc. gained 3.31%
on a net asset value basis and 3.19% in market price during October,
both in U.S. dollars.  The Spanish stock market continued to perform
well, backed by the strength of the telecommunications sector,
the banking sector and the electric utilities sector which all
continue to benefit from deregulation and a lower interest-rate
environment.  The food sector suffered the biggest losses with
the recent tax hike on cigarettes starting to affect the profit
margins of tobacco producer Tabacalera.  Going forward, the managers
do not rule out a minor correction in the near term, but they
anticipate that the effects will be short lived.

<B>November 19, 1996, Chicago, Illinois --</B> Kemper High Income Trust
declared a monthly dividend on October 31, 1996, of $0.075 per
share, payable November 29, 1996, to shareholders of record on

dividend.
<P>
<B>Activity Summary:</B>  High yield bonds posted positive returns in
October but were inhibited somewhat by economic data that showed
a slow down in economic growth.  Kemper High Income Trust
gained 3.40% in market value and 0.72% in net asset value.  By
comparison, the Salomon Brothers Extended High Yield Market Index
gained 1.16%.
<P>
<B>Fund Objective:</B> To provide the highest current income obtainable,
consistent with reasonable risk with capital gains secondary.
Investment by the fund in lower rated bonds presents special risk
considerations.

<BR>























<B>November 19, 1996, Chicago, Illinois --</B> Kemper Intermediate Government
Trust declared a monthly distribution on October 31, 1996, of
$0.055 per share, payable November 29, 1996, to shareholders of
record on November 15, 1996. This is unchanged from the previous
monthly dividend. It is anticipated that, in the current interest
rate environment, a portion of the monthly distribution may constitute
a return of capital.
<P>
<B>Activity Summary:</B> Reports of slower economic growth and a rally
in the Treasury market supported strong returns in the government
bond market in October. Kemper Intermediate Government Trust
gained 1.72% in net asset value and 0.75% in market value. Treasuries
outperformed mortgages and were favored by the fund's portfolio
managers. The fund benefited as yields declined due to its modestly
extended duration.
<P>







<B>Fund Objective:</B>  To provide high current income consistent with
preservation of capital by investing in U.S. Government securities
and foreign government securities.  The fund's shares are not
guaranteed by the U.S. Government.

<B>November 19, 1996, Chicago, Illinois -- </B>Kemper Multi-Market Income
Trust declared a monthly dividend on October 31, 1996, of $0.0825
per share, payable November 29, 1996, to shareholders of record
on November 15, 1996. This amount is unchanged from the previous
monthly dividend.
<P>
<B>Activity Summary:</B> Kemper Multi-Market Income Trust, gained 1.14%
in net asset value and 1.99% in market price in October. The fund's
performance was inhibited by an underperformance of high yield
single B credits and media/cable related issues.  The fund's exposure
to high yield bonds was reduced to 35% from 40% in anticipation
of an underperformance of the high yield market as a whole.  This
reduction enabled the managers to increase the fund's position
in Treasuries and foreign non-dollar bonds.
<P>
<B>Fund Objective:</B>  High current income consistent with prudent total
return asset management by investing assets in a broad range of
income producing securities. Investment by the fund in lower rated
bonds and foreign securities presents special risk considerations.

<BR>
<B>November 19, 1996, Chicago, Illinois -- </B>Kemper  Municipal Income
Trust declared a monthly dividend on October 31, 1996, of $0.0725
per common share, payable November 29, 1996, to shareholders of
record on November 15, 1996. This is unchanged from the previous
monthly dividend.
<P>
<B>Activity Summary: </B> Kemper Municipal Income Trust gained 1.10% in
net asset value, while slipping 0.42% in market value in October.
<P>
The municipal market was volatile in October as investors debated
the outcome of the congressional elections and whether or not
the Federal Reserve Board would tighten rates. Supply was
moderately heavy ($14.8 billion) and was met with relatively modest
demand. <I>The Bond Buyer</I> 25-Bond Revenue Index, began the
month at 6.01% (9/26/96), dropped to 5.95% (10/3/96), then fell to
5.94% (10/31/96). The municipal to Treasury yield ratio rose to
89% from 87% during the month. Portfolio Manager Chris Mier looks
for rates to remain stable with a bias to move lower.  He anticipates
moderate supply.
<P>
<B>Fund Objective: </B> To provide a high level of current income exempt
from Federal income taxes by investing in a diversified portfolio
of investment grade tax-exempt municipal securities.   Income
may be subject to state and local taxes and a portion may be subject
to the alternative minimum tax for some investors.

<BR>







<B>November 19, 1996, Chicago, Illinois --</B> Kemper Strategic Income
Fund declared a monthly dividend on October 31, 1996, of $0.147
per share, payable November 29, 1996, to shareholders of record
on November 15, 1996. This amount is unchanged from the previous
monthly dividend.



<P>







<B>Activity Summary:</B> After several strong months of performance,
Kemper Strategic Income Fund decelerated somewhat in October.
 The fund returned 0.99% in net asset value (NAV), underperforming
the 1.61% average return of its Lipper peer group.  A 5.38% gain
in market price, however, boosted the fund's premium to 18% over
NAV. The weaker NAV performance was the result of holdings in Brazil,
which impaired performance in the emerging markets allocation.

<P>







<B>Fund Objective:</B>  To provide high current income by investing its
assets in a combination of (1) lower-rated corporate fixed-income
securities, (2) fixed-income securities of emerging market and
other foreign issuers and (3) fixed-income securities of the U.S.
Government and its agencies and instrumentalities and private
mortgage-backed issuers. Investment by the fund in lower rated
bonds and in foreign securities presents special risk considerations.

<BR>

<B>November 19, 1996 Chicago, Illinois --</B> Kemper Strategic Municipal
Income Trust declared a monthly dividend on October 31, 1996 of
$0.068 per share, payable November 29, 1996, to shareholders of
record on November 15, 1996.  This is unchanged from the previous
monthly dividend.
<P>
<B>Activity Summary: </B> Kemper Strategic Municipal Income Trust advanced
0.82% in net asset value and 1.60% in market value in October.
<P>
The municipal market was volatile in October as investors debated
the outcome of the congressional elections and whether or not
the Federal Reserve Board would tighten rates.<B> </B>Supply was
moderately heavy ($14.8 billion) and was met with relatively modest
demand. <I>The Bond Buyer</I> 25-Bond Revenue Index, began the
month at 6.01% (9/26/96), dropped to 5.95% (10/3/96), then fell to
5.94% (10/31/96). The municipal to Treasury yield ratio rose to
89% from 87% during the month. Portfolio Manager Chris Mier looks
for rates to remain stable with a bias to move lower.  He anticipates
moderate supply.
<P>

<B>Fund Objective: </B> To provide a high level of current income exempt
from Federal income taxes by investing in a diversified portfolio
of tax-exempt municipal securities. Income may be subject to state
and local taxes and a portion may be subject to the alternative
minimum tax for some investors.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
October 21, 1996</I>
<P>
Mr. Greenspan also called attention to the relationship between
inflation and profit margins during the current business cycle.
He reported that profit margins have risen to high levels in the
face of small price increases because of both modest wage growth
and the success which firms have enjoyed in boosting productivity.
If margins now erode because of accelerating wage growth or declining
productivity, firms will come under greater pressure to boost
prices in order to restore profitability.
<P>
<I>Most American forecasters believe that the U.S. corporate sector
will experience a profit squeeze during 1997. </I>On the basis
of the Blue Chip survey of the consensus, forecasters are projecting
a profit gain of only 3.3% during 1997 compared to 9.0% this year.
In 1996, forecasters expect profits to grow at a rate twice the
economy's projected nominal GDP growth rate of 4.6%. In 1997,
by contrast, they are expecting profit growth to lag behind their
estimate of nominal GDP growth of 4.7%. The pessimism of economists
about the profit outlook is not universally shared on Wall Street.
Surveys of corporate profits on the basis of forecasts by company
security analysts suggest that profit growth will be 10-15% next
year. Economists are pessimistic about profits because they believe
that rising wages and slower productivity growth will depress
margins. Analysts implicitly appear to believe that output growth
will either be stronger or that firms will obtain larger price
increases to offset rising wage costs.
<P>
<I>The performance of corporate profits next year will have a
major influence on both the longevity of the current business
cycle and the relative returns provided by debt and equity.</I>
If the corporate sector enjoys 10-15% profit growth during 1997,
the odds are high that output growth will remain close to 3.0%
and set the stage for at least two or three new rounds of Fed
tightening. If earnings growth is only about 3.0%, by contrast,
the odds are high that output growth will slow to only about 2.0%
and that firms will have absorbed rising labor cost pressures
in their profit margins. After declining corporate profits have
depressed investment and employment, the Fed would probably be
able to ease monetary policy during the second half of 1997. There
are sectors of the equity market which could perform well In the
face of a general contraction in profit margins. The winners would
include growth stocks operating independently of the business
cycle, multinational companies able to benefit from a recovery
in Europe and Japan, and financial stocks. But declining profitability
at large labor intensive and cyclical companies would inhibit
the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
<P>
In the early stages of the business cycle, it is possible for
firms to enjoy large increases in output with falling costs because
they enjoy the disinflation effects of depressed utilization rates,
high unemployment and large productivity gains. <I>But as the
business cycle matures and utilization rates rise, it is difficult
to sustain an environment which is positive for both profits and
inflation. </I>Unless wages continue to be insensitive to the
unemployment rate, the economy appears to be entering a zone in
which there will be negative trade-offs between profits and prices.
<P>
It is possible to rationalize the current equity market rally
as a pure liquidity phenomena resulting from easy monetary policy
all over the world. But it is difficult to imagine the U.S. equity
market sustaining its recent robust performance into 1997 if profit
margins are poised to contract as the price of restraining inflation.
In 1995, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan defended the stock market's
high valuation ratios as a reflection of corporate America's success
at boosting profits and developing new technology for enhancing
productivity. His reluctance to speak positively about the U.S.
stock market this autumn may reflect a concern that equity prices
are now exaggerating the corporate sector's ability to sustain
high profit growth without more upward pressure on inflation.
<P>
The financial markets have accepted the verdict of the opinion
polls that President Clinton that will win re-election by a healthy
margin, but they have not yet discounted the risk of a Democratic
takeover of the Congress. Many investors perceive that the American
people like divided government and thus will offset their vote
for the president by voting Republican in the congressional races.
There is no clear historical pattern to the coat-tail effects
of landslide presidential election victories. Ronald Reagan enjoyed
great coat-tails power in 1980 while Lyndon Johnson helped to
elect many Democrats to Congress in 1964, but Richard Nixon had
little drawing power in the congressional races during 1972 while
the Reagan re-election landslide of 1984 had only a modest impact
on the congressional races. <I>The fact is almost two thirds of
U.S. presidential elections since 1920 have been characterized
by landslide victories (margins over 10%). </I>Incumbent presidents
who enjoy successful first terms which do not generate primary
opposition also tend to expand their victory margins when seeking
re-election (Roosevelt in 1936, Eisenhower in 1956, Nixon in 1972
and Reagan in 1984). As a result, there would be nothing unique
about Clinton winning re-election with a victory margin of 10-15%
or what the opinion polls have been predicting recently. Political
analysts will long ponder the president's seeming immunity to
personal and financial scandals as well as his ability to shift
his extraordinary ideological profile so effectively, but the
voters appear to be reacting to perceptions of the economy and
the general international environment, not the issue of character
or partisan disagreements about tax policy. According to the University
of Michigan survey of consumer confidence during September, the
public has a more positive view of government economic policy
today than at any time since mid-1988.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 26, 1996</I>
<P>
The U.S. election campaign has not yet emerged as a major factor
in the financial markets despite the rebound in the president's
lead over Robert Dole in the opinion polls.  <I>But if October
polls point to a Democratic sweep which could alter control of
the Congress, business confidence in the 1997 economic outlook
could start to deteriorate.</I>  The leadership of the Democratic
Party in the Congress is so far to the left of the president that
some Washington analysts describe a potential victory for it as
&quot;a return of the Dinosaurs&quot;.  The committee chairmanships
of a  Democratic controlled Congress would be dominated by elderly
members from old urban centers in the northeast and middle west
who launched their political careers during the 1960's.  The new
House speaker would also be a member of Congress who has spent
the past decade advocating protectionist trade policies and populist
domestic policies. 
<P>
As the election of a Democratic Congress would raise many questions
about economic policy, it would cause the financial markets to
become even more sensitive than usual to the cabinet appointments
which the president announced during December and the signals
they provided about the future conduct of policy.  The current
Treasury team enjoys a high level of confidence in the financial
markets, and it is widely expected that Secretary Robert Rubin
will remain but investors expect to see new appointments for other
key positions, such as Trade Representatives, Secretary of Commerce,
and chairman of the National Economic Council.  They also will
be anxious to see who replaces Dick Morris as the president's
major advisor on political strategy.  While Morris had little
influence on economic policy, he did steer the president towards
the right on many social issues (family values) and gave the administration
a very conservative tone compared to 1993.  As Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan is a long experienced Washington operator, the large
Democratic lead in the opinion polls probably also had some influence
on the outcome of the September FOMC meeting.  Both Mr. Greenspan
and some Fed district presidents are aware that a Democratic Congress
would be far more intrusive into the affairs of the Federal Reserve
than the current Congress.

ALT="Can The Foreign Exchange Markets Ignore the Fed?"><BR>


The dollar remained relatively firm despite the Fed's failure
to tighten policy because other G-7 countries are still anxious
to promote dollar appreciation and the U.S. bond market reacted
positively to the Fed's policy.
<P>
The U.S. government's current account and capital account data
for the second quarter suggest that the dollar is being underpinned
by greater support from private investors, not just central banks.
The new data indicates that central bank intervention to support
the dollar fell to $13.2 billion during the second quarter from
$52 billion during the first quarter.  In place of official intervention,
foreign demand for U.S. Treasury securities shot up to $31.7 billion
from $11.8 billion during the first quarter while purchases of
 other securities fell only modestly to $28.6 billion from $36
billion during the first quarter.  Meanwhile, American demand
for foreign securities slumped to $20 billion during the second
quarter from $34.4 billion during the first quarter.  Foreign
direct investment was also nearly in balance, with outward investment
of $46 billion during the first half compared to $40 billion of
inward investment.  During 1995, by contrast, official intervention
to support the dollar was $110 billion compared to foreign purchases
of Treasury securities equal to $99 billion, foreign demand for
other securities of $95.2 billion and direct investment of $60
billion. In addition to a $148 billion current account deficit
during 1995, American demand for foreign securities was $98 billion
while outward direct investment was $96 billion.  <I>The magnitude
of the U.S. current account deficit and American demand for foreign
securities suggests the dollar will be vulnerable to renewed weakness
at some point but the willingness of future central banks to support
the  dollar is unlikely to change in the near future.</I>  In
fact, the IMF has just published its latest estimates of the distribution
of the world's foreign exchange reserves by currency.  According
to the IMF, the dollar's share of global foreign exchange reserves
rose modestly to 56.4% last year form 55.9% during 1994 and a
trough of 50.3% during 1990.  The D-mark's share fell to 13.7%
from 14.3% while the yen's share declined to 7.1% from 8.2%. 
It is the industrial countries which are spending most aggressively
to protect the dollar's international role.  The dollar's share
of their reserves rose to 52.8% from 51.2% while its share of
developing country reserves eased to 60.5% from 61.8%.  While
it is not surprising that Japan and Europe are trying to resist
dollar depreciation, it is remarkable that Asian and Latin American
central banks have not been more aggressive in diversifying their
foreign exchange reserves out of dollars.
<P>
Europe and Japan want to encourage a strong dollar because their
own economies are still weak and they need to promote exports.
 Many European countries are also trying to adhere to exchange
rate target bands against the D-Mark and thus don't want the D-mark
to appreciate against the dollar.  The Bundesbank itself also
favors a weak D-mark because it is trying to discourage the support
of German industry for introducing a new European currency.
<P>
<I>The currency which has been most vulnerable to a speculative
attack during recent weeks has been the French franc.</I>  The
French economy is weak and the economic slowdown is undermining
the efforts of the French government to achieve a budget deficit
of less than 3.0% of GDP in order to satisfy the Maastricht economic
preconditions for European monetary union in 1999.  In mid-September,
the French government announced a new budget which introduced
some interesting accounting changes in order to achieve its deficit
target.  The French government, for example, will realize an accounting
gain of 40 billion francs in the current fiscal year by assuming
responsibility for the national telephone company's pension fund
before it is privatized.  Several journalists chastised the French
government for using such unconventional revenue enhancement techniques
in order to achieve its deficit target but investors did not sell
the franc because they consider the French effort to achieve a
smaller deficit to be  preferable to the alternative EMU strategy
which had appeared to be evolving a few months ago.  In mid-summer,
it was widely perceived that Chancellor Kohl and President Chirac
would attempt to impose EMU while accepting budget deficits closer
to 4.0% of GDP. <I> Investors bought the French franc in mid-September
because they considered the French government's effort to achieve
a smaller deficit through a spending freeze and unconventional
revenue enhancement to be superior to an economic strategy which
simply sacrificed deficit reduction targets to the greater goal
of European monetary union.</I>
<P>
<I>The French budget has not eliminated all risks to implementation
of EMU in 1999.</I>  If the French economy stalls this winter,
the government will not be able to achieve its revenue targets
and it will have to consider imposing even greater fiscal austerity
on an economy which already has high unemployment.  As France
will have parliamentary elections in March 1998, it will be difficult
for President Chirac to introduce another restrictive budget during
1997.  <I>In the absence of a French economic upturn, the odds
are high that the Chirac government would be forced to introduce
a new economic strategy including large interest rate reductions,
a devaluation of the franc, and an indefinite deferral of monetary
union.</I>  As the Germans are terrified of a large franc devaluation,
they would probably reduce interest rate further this winter in
order to help revive the French economy and maintain France's
current exchange rate policy.  The good news for the French government
is that the German and British economies are showing such clear
signs of revival that there should be positive spillover effects
on France.  But as France is suffering from deep structural problems
in its labor market and banking system, it is unclear if export
growth alone will be able to revive business and household confidence
by enough to stimulate domestic spending.
<P>
As the French government is prepared to consider unconventional
revenue sources in order to achieve its Maastricht deficit targets,
it will be interesting to see if the French government investigates
the feasibility of obtaining more revenue from the Bank of France.
 The French central bank is now independent of the government
in the conduct of monetary policy but the French government continues
to  be its only shareholder.  As a result, it would be appropriate
for the French government to examine whether its central bank
is observing the same fiscal austerity as other departments of
the French government in promoting deficit reduction.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 2, 1996</I>

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/risingbondyields_subhead.gif" ALT="Why Is The Dollar Weak?"><BR>
The primary focus of the foreign exchange market during the next few weeks will be the relationship between the German mark and French franc.
<P>
The franc is under pressure because of growing investor concern about the prospects for European monetary union occurring on schedule in 1999.  The German economy is showing signs of recovery while the French economy remains lackluster.  As a result, it will be difficult for the French government to achieve its target of a fiscal deficit equal to 3.0% of GDP in 1997 unless it can enact further large cuts in public spending or tax hikes.  Such fiscal restraint will be unpopular because the tax share of GDP in France is already 55% while French unions have threatened to go on strike if the government pursues further large reductions in government payrolls and entitlement programs.  The Bundesbank has attempted to boost the franc and reduce upward pressure on the D-mark by lowering German interest rates 30 basis points but the market shrugged off the move because of perceptions that it will be Germany's last interest rate cut and awareness that France confronts such serious  fiscal problems that monetary fine tuning, alone, will be insufficient to resolve them.  The market is also apprehensive about the possible impact of a parliamentary investigation into the Credit Lyons scandal on the status of Jean Claude Trichet, president of the Bank of France.  The office of President Chirac denies that Mr. Trichet is vulnerable to the inquiry, but investors are apprehensive because Mr. Trichet has been the architect of French economic policy for several years.  Investors fear that if he were to leave, France might abandon its commitment to monetary union.
<P>
There are four possible solutions to the franc's problems.  First, the French economy could enjoy a stronger than expected recovery during 1997 in response to this year's monetary easing and produce an upsurge of tax receipts which would lower the budget deficit to 3.0-3.5% of GDP from 4.5% this year.  Secondly, the French government could be successful in enacting large cuts in public spending and achieve its fiscal target despite sluggish growth of the economy.  Thirdly, Chancellor Kohl could attempt to persuade other European governments and the German people to relax the budget deficit targets specified in the Maastricht Treaty on the grounds that France is moving in the right direction and that any delay of monetary union would create the risk of the whole project being deferred indefinitely.  Finally, France and Germany could agree to delay monetary union for one year on technical grounds but make it clear that the whole project will go ahead in the year 2000.
<P>
The most likely scenario at present is a combination of scenarios two and three.  The French government will succeed in enacting some spending cuts and Chancellor Kohl will try to persuade other governments to go ahead with European monetary union if the French deficit is less than 4.0% of GDP.  The positive surprise for the markets would be that the European monetary easing of the past two years produces a stronger than expected upturn which permits France and other countries to come closer to the Maastricht fiscal targets than now seems possible.
<P>
As a result of the monetary union issue, the bond markets of many European countries will behave quite differently than the U.S. bond market during the next twelve months.  In the U.S., the bond market now slumps whenever economic data shows signs of strength.  American bond investors dislike strong growth because the economy is close to full employment and it increases the risk of Federal Reserve tightening.  In Europe, by contrast, stronger economic growth helps to reduce government fiscal deficits and thus enhances the prospects of monetary union.  The currencies and bond markets which are most vulnerable to a collapse if monetary union is deferred are those which have used the goal of monetary union as a lever for pursuing deficit reduction, including France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal.  While Italy, Spain, and other southern European countries will not be in the first wave of monetary union, they will be pursuing a fiscal and monetary stabilization pact with the countries of the union in order to lay the groundwork for admission later.  Any setback to the monetary union project would therefore provoke investor concern about the ability of the governments in Rome, Madrid, and elsewhere to adhere to the macroeconomic targets which will be pursued in conjunction with the stabilization pact.  
<P>
The pressures on European exchange rates resulting from the uncertainties about monetary union caused investors to buy the D-mark and the Swiss franc at the expense of other currencies, including the U.S. dollar, during August.  The dollar also suffered from the failure of  the Fed to tighten monetary policy during late August, but the resilience of the U.S.equity market limited the damage resulting from the Fed's passivity.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
July 29, 1996</I>
<P>

Thirdly, if the Democrats win a majority in the House, their new speaker would
be Rep. Richard Gephardt.  After flirting with many "New Democrat" political
themes during the mid-1980's, Rep. Gephardt has devoted most of the past decade
to espousing protectionist trade policies, higher marginal income tax rates,
and other forms of government intervention in the economy.<p>
<p>
As a result of the ideological polarization which has occurred in the
congressional membership of both major political parties, a Democratic victory
in this November's congressional races would probably have three immediate
effects on the economy.<p>
<p>
It would encourage investors to sell both U.S. bonds and the U.S. dollar.<p>
<p>
It would probably cause all investors to reduce their exposure to Mexico as
well as other emerging market countries which might be vulnerable to
congressional demands for more restrictive trade polices.<p>
<p>
It would probably encourage many U.S. companies to defer decisions about new
investment and hiring until they had more visibility on how the election would
affect public policy in such critical areas as taxation and labor market
regulation.  Ironically, <i>such caution might cause bond yields to fall during
early 1997, when lower investment depressed the economy, but in late 1996 the
weakness of bond prices would itself help to set the stage for the economic
slowdown.</i><p>
<u></u><p>
As Congressman Gephardt has ambitions to run for president in the year 2000, it
is doubtful that the next Congress will be as left wing as the markets might
fear this autumn.  But Wall Street is apprehensive because it was surprised by
the upsurge of support for Patrick Buchanan in the Republican primaries during
early 1996.  With the unemployment rate so low, it was not prepared for such a
rapidly protectionist candidate to win the New Hampshire primary.<p>
<p>
Congressman Gephardt himself said after the early primaries that the politics
of the deficit was about to be replaced by the politics of income.  He
suggested that the Democratic Party would attempt to revive itself by focusing
on the economic insecurities and concerns about income inequality which had
helped to produce the Buchanan primary victories.  If the Democrats regain
control of Congress, they are likely to emphasize such themes in their
legislative agenda for 1997.<p>
<p>
The critics of the U.S. economy have three major complaints.  First, real wages
have been stagnant for several years.  Secondly, there is growing income
inequality on the basis of differentials in education.  Thirdly, corporations
provide excessive compensation for a few senior executives at the same time
that they are demanding pay cuts or other sacrifices from low and middle income
workers.  <p>
<p>
There is no doubt that real wage growth has slowed dramatically compared to the
growth rates which prevailed before the oil crises of the 1970's.  <i>But it is
far from clear that hourly wages deflated by the consumer price index are a
good proxy for what is happening to total U.S. compensation.</i>  There is
considerable evidence that the CPI now overstates inflation.  If we adjust
wages with the GDP deflator or the non-farm business deflator, there has
actually been moderate growth in real wages during recent years (see charts
21-25).  Many firms also offer their workers generous non-wage compensation in
order to avoid taxes, including pensions and health care.  Such benefits are
now equal to about 18% of total compensation compared to 5% in the late
1940's.<p>
<p>
There is growing income inequality based on education because new developments
in technology are forcing firms to bid up the price of educated workers
compared to people with fewer skills.  With the economy now close to full
employment, it is likely that unskilled workers will now have an opportunity to
improve their wage negotiating power because of labor scarcity in many regions.
The unemployment rate is now below 5.0% in states accounting for almost one
half of the national labor market and such a low level of unemployment has
always encouraged faster wage growth in the past.<p>
<p>
Corporations have been able to justify large compensation programs for their
executives during the 1990's because profits have boomed and share prices have
risen sharply.  The problem with the corporate sector is that only about 13% of
U.S. workers qualify for profit sharing plans while only another 3% belong to
ESOP programs (Employee Stock Ownership).  As a result, there is a weak link in
the U.S. corporate sector between employment and share ownership.  About 51
million Americans have exposure to the stock market through mutual funds,
defined contribution pension plans, and other forms of share ownership but they
do not enjoy the same preferential access to shares as senior executives in
most corporations. The perceived unfairness of this imbalance also has been
magnified  in the public mind by the fact that it is the large Fortune 500
companies which have done the most aggressive restructuring since 1980.  During
the past fifteen years, the old Fortune 500 companies have reduced their
employment from 16.5 million jobs to 11.5 million jobs despite the fact that
total U.S. employment has expanded by almost 28 million.  The high visibility
of the Fortune 500 layoffs in the media has produced a far greater sense of
insecurity among American workers than can be justified by the economy's
overall employment performance.<p>
<p>
While the American corporate sector can be faulted for narrow stock option
programs and insensitive public relations in the way it conducts
restructurings, the fact remains that the U.S. has the most successful labor
market for job creation in the industrial world.<p>
<p>
<i>Since 1980, the U.S. economy has created 28 million new jobs for a labor
force of 134 million and in the process absorbed 95% of all the new labor force
entrants.</i>  About 20 million American also change their job every years.
Since 1980, the European Union has created about 14 new million jobs for a
labor force of 194 million and absorbed only about one half of the new labor
force entrants.  As a result, unemployment in continental Europe is at doubt
digit levels for the population as a whole and much higher for young people.<p>
<p>
The U.S. also enjoys great social mobility compared to the other countries.
Among those in the bottom income quintile twenty years ago, 29% have gone to
the top income quintile, 30% to the second and 21% have moved to the third.
The number of American households earning over $100,000 per annum in 1994
dollars has risen from 1.0 million in 1967 and 2.7 million in 1980 to over 6
million today.<p>

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
June 21, 1996</I>
<P>

Goldman Sachs has compiled its own estimate of Tobin Q's solely
for companies in the S&amp;P 400 Industrial index. Goldman prefers
this formula because it focuses solely on manufacturing firms
with stock market listings, not the whole U.S. corporate sector.
Whereas the Fed measure of corporate net worth has declined during
the 1990's because of falling real estate prices, the Goldman
measure has grown at a rate of 3.8% per annum. <B>As a result
of the manufacturing sector's increasing net worth, the S&amp;P
400 measure of Tobin Q has risen only to 1.4 from 0.4 in the mid-1980's
and is still below its peak of 1.9 during the mid-1960's.</B>

<P>
<B>All measures of Tobin Q make it clear that the U.S. stock market
is expensive by the valuation standards of the 1970's and 1980's,
but industrial companies do not appear to be as overvalued as
the Federal Reserve estimate of current cost net worth might imply.</B>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and others also have warned
that book value does not provide useful information about the
true net worth of the large U.S. investment in technology and
human capital. The stock market is a discounting machine attempting
to determine the value of a future stream of earnings adjusted
for the return on low risk instruments such as Treasury bills.
The replacement cost of assets provides little information about
future earnings growth. As the deflation of commercial real estate
prices since 1990 will testify, replacement cost plays minor role
in determining transactions prices for property compared to estimates
of rental income.
<P>
There are numerous signs of excessive optimism in the U.S. equity
market today. The ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP
has risen to 91% from previous peaks of 81% in 1929 and 79% in
1972 while the ratio of stock and bond market capitalization is
now at 180% of GDP compared to 80% in 1982. <B>The dividend yield
has dropped to only about 2.1%.</B> The flow of money into mutual
funds is unprecedented both in absolute terms and relative to
national income. <B>Equity funds are also absorbing over 90% of
new money flows into the mutual fund sector compared to 30-40%
during the period 1985-1992.</B> The manager of Fidelity's largest
equity mutual fund felt compelled to resign because he had mistakenly
overweighted his fund in bonds. The volume of money raised from
equity I.P.O's is now running at 0.4% of GDP compared to a peak
of 0.52% in 1993 and 0.3-0.4% during the mid-1980's. At the University
of Chicago, a professor of finance recently announced that it
was possible for investors to outperform the market through careful
selection of value stocks whereas the school has traditionally
advocated a theory of market efficiency which suggested that stock
selection was a futile exercise. When so many yardsticks of popular
psychology suggest euphoria about the equity market, it is difficult
for an experienced professional investor not to feel pessimistic.
But the market continues to be supported by a positive outlook
for corporate profits, a modest level of inflation and interest
rate risk, and increasing signs of resurgence in the global economy.
There will probably have to be more evidence of imbalances in
the real economy or potential inflation risk to puncture the self-reinforcing
optimism which is now driving the demand for U.S. equities.
<P>
<B>The Dollar Consolidates</B> 
<P>
The dollar has entered a period of consolidation in response to
both economic and political news. There are more signs of economic
recovery in the other G-7 economies while the markets are increasingly
uncertain about the political outlook in the U.S. They do not
know if Mrs. Clinton will be indicted for obstruction of justice
nor are they certain how such a development would influence this
autumn's election. They perceive that the Dole candidacy is enjoying
a revival but some polls suggest that the outlook for both the
White House and the Congress is still wide open. American investors
have discounted a Clinton victory in the presidential race but
they have not adjusted bond prices and exchange rates for a Democratic
takeover of the Congress.
<P>
The yen has rallied because Japan recorded a GDP growth rate of
13% at annual rates during the first quarter. Some of the uptick
resulted from seasonal adjustment problems with the effect of
the Leap Year on the number of working days but the year on year
growth rate was still 3.3%. While seasonal factors could cause
GDP to shrink modestly during the second quarter, there is little
doubt that<B> Japan is shifting from an upturn driven primarily
by public investment to a more broadly based recovery in consumption
and business investment</B>. The first quarter upturn appears
to vindicate those forecasters who contended that Japanese monetary
policy was highly stimulative because of the tremendous foreign
exchange intervention which occurred to support the dollar during
1995.
<P>
The yen rallied in response to the Japanese GDP report because
inventors now expect the BOJ to hike short-term interest rates
during the autumn, but further yen rallies will be inhibited by
shrinkage of the Japanese trade surplus. It is likely to fall
to $60-70 billion this year from $129 billion during 1994 because
of stronger growth of domestic spending. The Bank of Japan will
also proceed very cautiously before raising interest rates because
of the large size of Japan's output gap, the lingering credit
quality problems of the banks and the Ministry of Finance commitment
to a tighter fiscal policy next year, including a hike in the
value added tax to 5% from 3%.
<P>
The D-mark has rallied because of signs that German output will
start to improve this summer and the strong showing of Mr. Yeltsin
in the first round of the Russian presidential election. The German
output gap is so large that the Bundesbank will retain a bias
towards ease for many months to come. Chancellor Kohl also intends
to go ahead with plans to reduce various entitlement programs
despite the fact that German trade unions have launched the largest
protest demonstrations in the post-war era. Most European economists
are projecting that German real GDP will expand by about 2.3-2.5%
next year compared to 0.4% this year, 2.1% during 1995, and 3.0%
during 1994. The German upturn should also be accompanied by 2.5-3.0%
output growth in the other major European economies.
<P>
The Russian election was never a dominant factor in the foreign
exchange market this spring but if Mr. Zyganov had come in first
place during the first round or appeared capable of launching
a broad based coalition with all anti-Yeltsin forces there is
little doubt that investors would have sold the D-mark. Instead
of holding the wide lead which he enjoyed during early 1996, Mr.
Zyuganov fell 3% behind Mr. Yeltsin while third place went to
a former general who has agreed to be Mr. Yeltsin's new national
security advisor. The supporters of other non-communist candidates,
such as Mr. Yavlinsky, will probably also rally around the president.
<P>
While Moscow equity prices have rallied sharply since the first
round of the Russian presidential elections, there are still risks
in the outlook. <B>The Yeltsin supporters could become complacent
and fail to turn out in large number on July third.</B> General
Lebed is unpopular with many army officers and some of them could
shift their support to Mr. Zyuganov. Mr. Yeltsin himself has had
two heart attacks during the past year and could easily experience
another one at any time. In fact, most Moscow journalists believe
that Russia will have another presidential election far before
his term officially ends in four years because of either his death
or renewed health problems.
<P>
<B>As Russia has never before had an open and free election for
the office of head of state, the recent electoral content represents
an important historical watershed.</B> On the basis of reports
by journalists and independent observers, Mr. Yeltsin appears
to have achieved first place on the basis of a fair and free election
last week. As recently as one month ago, by contrast, many Moscow
commentators had suggested that he would probably have to manufacture
at least 5-10 million votes in order to insure a victory over
Mr. Zyuganov.
<P>
<B>The resolution of the political uncertainty which resulted
from having an open presidential election will itself give a boost
to the Russian economy.</B> At present, the Russian government
is being forced to pay nominal interest rates of 150% on T-bill
instruments despite the fact that the Ruble has been stable for
a year, inflation has fallen to only 30%, and the ratio of central
government debt to GDP is less than 10%.
<P>
Investors have demanded large risk premiums because they could
not be certain that Mr. Zyuganov would either honor the government's
debt or maintain the exchange rate policy which has permitted
Russia to sharply reduce her inflation rate. The dominant short-term
challenges confronting Mr. Yeltsin this summer will be to improve
the efficiency of the tax system in order to reduce the government's
deficit (many firms suspended paying taxes before the election)
and to appoint a new team of ministers capable of pursuing the
other structural reforms needed to establish a viable market economy.
Russia has privatized many state enterprises, including the telecommunications
and utility sectors which are still under government control in
western Europe, but the structure of land ownership and the discretionary
nature of many government regulations (taxes, import duties, etc.)
have encouraged widespread corruption and thus inhibit investment
decision making.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
March 25, 1996</I>
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/usoutputgrowth_subhead.gif" ALT="Have Foreign Interest Rates Bottomed?">

<BR>

  Despite the economic weakness in the major G-7 countries, bond yields rose all over the world during the first quarter. Yet, the odds are high that there will be further monetary easing in much of continental Europe while Japanese monetary policy will probably remain on hold until at least the autumn.  

<P>

  Many pundits have suggested that the Bundesbank has delayed easing because of strong M3 growth <B>but the real reason is concern about Germany's wage negotiations.</B> Wage bargaining is now underway in the chemical, metal and construction industries while negotiations will begin next month in the banking and insurance sectors. Some of the unions are asking for 6% wage hikes and the Bundesbank wants employers to resist such demands because of the large employment losses now occurring in many German industries. (Manufacturing accounts for over a third of German GDP compared to 20% in the U.S.) If the negotiations produce moderate outcomes, the Bundesbank will probably ease further in late April or May. Monetary easing will be positive for the German financial markets but bond yields could continue to carry a large risk premium to compensate for uncertainty about the future of European monetary union. Many investors fear that Chancellor Kohl will attempt to pursue monetary union even if the key countries fail to achieve their Mastricht targets for deficit reductions. Alternative scenarios are also potentially dangerous for the markets. <B>Kohl, for example, could face so much resistance from his party and coalition partners that he would be forced to call a general election on the issue of monetary union and lose.</B> In such a scenario, a Socialist-Green coalition government could emerge at a time when Germany needs profound restructuring of its rigid labor market and costly welfare state.  

<P>

  The financial market in Tokyo were positively surprised by government reports of strong fourth quarter GDP growth. The resilience of final demand suggests that the economy has turned despite a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. The Ministry of Finance intervened aggressively in the foreign exchange market during February and also used moral suasion over major players, such as multinational corporations, to discourage repatriation of capital during the final weeks of the fiscal year. As the Japanese current account surplus has fallen sharply from the levels of one year ago, the yen should be able to stay in its current trading range if the Japanese institutions resume exporting capital during April. In the second half of 1995, Japanese investors were net sellers of U.S. bonds but were large purchasers of Eurobonds as well as Australian bonds. In January, they made modest purchases of U.S. bonds but sold Australian bonds. The great uncontrollable factor for the MOF is large swings in demand for yen by hedge funds and other highly leveraged investors. Such investors borrowed yen to buy dollar bonds during late 1995 but they were startled by the weakness of the U.S. bond market and the threat of a yen rally in February. The MOF has tried to work with such investors by providing more information about its intentions but such relationship building will count for little if there is a sudden change in market perceptions of the economic outlook. The coming upturn in the U.S. economy should help to bolster confidence in the dollar and encourage more Japanese demand for U.S. securities, but sentiment towards the dollar could turn negative if the upturn produces a sharp widening of the trade deficit or a correction in the bond market so severe that U.S. equities also fall sharply. The dollar also could suffer if the opinion polls suggest the Democrats might regain control of the U.S. House.  

<P>

  To summarize, the U.S. economy appears poised for a moderate growth rebound during the next few quarters. While severe winter weather and the government shutdown have delayed completion of the inventory adjustment in many sectors, there is sufficient resilience in final sales to suggest that inventory demand will emerge as a positive growth factor during the second quarter and boost output growth to 3.0-3.5%. Such a rebound will prevent further monetary easing in the U.S. but the Fed will not tighten policy unless it perceives that growth will remain at levels high enough to push capacity utilization back towards 85.0% and revive inflationary pressures. If, by contrast, output growth returns to the 2.0-2.5% range during the autumn, monetary policy could remain on hold through year-end. The U.S. dollar should benefit from improved perceptions of the American economy but it will be vulnerable to renewed capital outflows by U.S. mutual funds as well as an inventory driven rebound in the trade deficit during the second half of the year.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
February 29, 1996</I>

<P>

The other important dimension of the Buchanan victory was his ability to attract strong support from religious fundamentalists. He received 54% of the votes of people who consider themselves to be part of the religious right compared to 11% for Dole and Alexander. The religious right is a political phenomena unique to the United States among the major industrial nations. <B>About 45% of Americans go to church every Sunday compared to only 5-10% in Europe. As the U.S. was founded by religious dissenters, it has a free market in religion whereas in Europe religion is often a nationalized industry.</B> Britain has a state church under the nominal rule of the monarch while the Catholic church is the official church in many other countries. The number of Americans who classify themselves as evangelical Protestants is about 25% today or the same as thirty years ago. But during the interim, many evangelical Protestants have moved from a relatively modest and rural socio economic status firmly into the suburban middle class and thus greatly enhanced their ability to influence the political system. The population of mainstream Protestants, by contrast, has shrunk from 40% of the U.S. total in the 1960's to about 20% today. Catholics have been steady at about 25% of the population while the population of secularist (no religious affiliation) has expanded from 1-2% thirty years ago to about 15% currently. <B>The rise of the religious right has played a very important role in the revival of the Republican Party during recent years.</B> According to surveys of the 1994 congressional elections, the Republicans attracted the support of 78% of Mormons and 75% of evangelical Protestants, compared to 56% of the votes of mainline Protestants and 53% of Catholics. Without strong support from the religious right, Buchanan would probably have received less than 20% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary and thus come in third. He also benefited from the fact that New Hampshire permits Democrats and independents to vote in the Republican primary. As the Democrats had no presidential primary, some of their voters probably cast votes for Buchanan on the grounds that he would be the most divisive of Republican candidates.
<P>

<B>While Buchanan cannot win the Republican nomination, the question still hovering over the markets is how his electoral success will influence other candidates and public policy after 1996.</B> Will his victories encourage other candidates to support more protectionist trade policies? Will the issue of job insecurity cause other candidates to promise more federal money for job training, unemployment relief, or other safety net programs? Will resentment at growing income inequality encourage political support for a return to much higher marginal income tax rates on high income Americans, especially the corporate executives who collect large bonuses and stock option awards while reducing employment in their companies? In 1992, Bill Clinton had campaigned on a platform called "Putting People First" which had pledged to spend $200 billion of federal money on various human capital programs to bolster productivity and real wages. He abandoned most of these promises in order to pursue deficit reduction during 1993 and focus on health care in 1994. When the Republicans captured the Congress in 1994, he further retreated from the campaign themes of 1992 and stressed in his recent State of the Union message that the era of big government is over. Yet, the Buchanan electoral success suggests that there is a political market among less skilled people for campaign promises to bolster job security through some form of government intervention. As a result of the racial profile of his constituency, Mr. Buchanan focused far more heavily on trade protection than government sponsored income redistribution or worker training but it is not difficult to imagine other candidates putting forward federal programs linking the two issues.
<P>

<B>The Buchanan victory in New Hampshire probably creates three major risks for public policy after the election.</B> First, it will be more difficult for the next president to promote new free trade legislation, such as expanding NAFTA to include Chile. Secondly, despite the electoral success of Steve Forbes in Delaware and Arizona, it will be more challenging to develop broad bi-partisan support for a tax reform program to reduce marginal income tax rates or provide new tax allowances for savings. Thirdly, there will be greater willingness to tinker with new tax incentives for promoting certain forms of corporate behavior such as protecting jobs or increasing spending on human capital. In fact, two Democratic Senators will soon be introducing legislation to redesign the corporate tax code to provide new tax incentives for job protection and training programs. Mr. Robert Kuttner described the legislation in a recent issue of Business Week:
<P>

 "Bingaman and Daschle have therefore turned to the one avenue that might produce some traction: inducing corporations to embrace a 'stakeholder' model. The draft legislation, to be released in late February, proposes a new class of corporations, the R Corp.-'R' for Responsible. The idea is to reward corporations that invest in employees and communities instead of pursuing relentless downsizing that boosts short-term profits."
<P>

 "An R Corp. would receive lower taxes and streamlined regulatory treatment. Specifically, the plan replaces the corporate income tax with a 'business activity tax' of the sort proposed in 1994 by Senators John C. Danforth (R-MO) and David L. Boren (D-Okla.). This tax applies a fixed rate to all receipts, subtracting payments for most inputs. Employee training and R&#38;D expenses would be tax-deductible, while wages dividends, and interest would not. Under this plan, an R Corp. would be taxed at 11%, compared with 18% for conventional corporations. It would also pay reduced payroll taxes and be able to self-certify in several areas of regulation."
<P>

 "Compensation Ratio. To qualify, a corporation would be required to contribute 3% of payroll to a portable, multi-employer pension plan, devote 2% to employee training, pay half the costs of a qualifying health plan, and have a profit-sharing plan or employee stock ownership plan with employee trustees."
<P>

 "Another requirement would be to hold the compensation ratio of the highest to lowest paid employee to no more than 50 to 1, compared with the 130-to-1 ratio in some corporations . An R Corp. would have a 'community responsibility agreement' tempering relocations and layoffs. It would be unionized or have an employee-involvement plan. An R Corp. could not use child or prison labor anywhere in the world and half of its new investment and employment would have to be in the U.S."
<P>

 "The Bingaman plan includes a tax of the sort long proposed by Yale University economist James Tobin on the profits of short-term securities trades. The proceeds would finance a social capital fund for worker training, school-to-work transition programs, industrial extension, export promotion, and technology research and development."
<P>

If there has to be a federal programatic response to public concern about job insecurity, the new Democratic proposals are far superior to the Buchanan program of high tariffs. But attempts to use tax allowances to promote various forms of corporate behavior also raise troublesome questions about the efficiency of resource allcoation, including whether the government will simply end up subsidizing investments which corporations would have made anyway.
<P>

In Britain, the new Labor Party leader, Mr. Tony Blair, has been making numerous speeches about the theme of promoting "stakeholder capitalism" over the traditional form which merely protects the interests of shareholders. The theme of stakeholder capitalism has caught on with only a few Democratic Party intellectuals, such as Labor Secretary Robert Reich, but the Buchanan primary victories will encourage more discussion about American corporate behavior as the campaign progresses. <B>Although promoting discussion about "stakeholder capitalism" is an intelligent way for Washington policy wonks to channel populist outrage over foreign competition and corporate labor shedding into a coherent examination of public policy choices, it is difficult to imagine the next Congress enacting any substantive legislation to promote stakeholder capitalism.</B> First, the traditional models of stakeholder capitalism, such as Germany and Japan, have been suffering from prolonged recessions in part because their corporate sectors are carrying very high embedded social costs. In Germany, unemployment is rising sharply as German firms attempt to escape from the country's high social benefit costs by shifting jobs to the U.S., eastern Europe and other low wage countries. Secondly, corporations which need well trained workers are already spending heavily on education while small firms would regard legislation requiring investment in new federally mandated programs as a reason to curtail employment. Thirdly, the next Congress will still have to address the issue of federal deficit reduction, so expensive new tax allowances will be challenged by House and Senate committee chairmen. As with Bill Clinton's Putting People First program in 1993, the promises of presidential election campaigns will fade quickly if the American legislative branch remains as conservative about fiscal policy as it has been during recent years. Since the Buchanan and Forbes campaign are personality driven phenomena without any large scale organizations to influence congressional races, it is doubtful that the 1996 presidential race will produce major changes in congressional attitudes towards issues such as deficit reduction and federal spending. <B>But as the presidential contest will dominate political news coverage during the next few months, concern about right wing populism undermining support for deficit reduction and free trade in the Republican Party will probably continue to produce a higher political risk premium in U.S. bond yields.</B> This risk premium will be a de facto tax on the economy to compensate investors for the risk of extreme outcomes in the November elections for the White House and Congress.

<I>Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and Local
Privatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>
The need for state and local governments to play a greater role combating the
causes of America's new income inequality at a time when the federal government
is promoting devolution of other programs suggests that governors and
legislatures are going to face more formidable challenges during the decade
ahead than at any other time in the modern era.  Their policies in sectors such
as education will not simply affect the economy of their state.  They will also
have a major impact on the wage and employment trends which are driving the
national debate about trade policy, tax policy and federal regulation of the
labor market.  Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the struggle
over America's place in the new global economic order will depend as much on
the policies of state governments as the national government.<p>
<p>
The strength of the national economy and the growth of tax receipts should
permit state governments to manage these challenges during 1996 and 1997.  But
when the U.S. economy experiences another recession, state governments will
have to confront the triple challenge of faltering tax receipts, increased
spending on the unemployed and the impact of new federal block grant system on
the capacity of Washington to help them fund social programs.  In such a
scenario, the deficits of state governments could rise sharply and force them
to curtail spending on capital investment and other services, including
education.<p>
<p>
How will state governments cope with the fiscal hazards posed by devolution and
recession during the late 1990's?  There will be no simple answers because the
U.S. no longer enjoys a broad social consensus about the role of government at
either the federal or state level.  But one obvious solution which could appeal
to both the political left and right would be for state governments to raise
money by privatizing various assets which could be operated more effectively by
the private sector.<p>
<p>
During the past decade, privatization has been a dominant theme for economic
reformers in both the old industrial countries and the developing countries.
The British government privatized its utilities, water systems and airports
during the 1980's.  China, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines are
encouraging the private sector to develop an extensive network of toll roads.
Many Asian countries are also privatizing ports, electric systems, and phone
companies.  Argentina privatized its utility companies during the early 1980's
and is about to privatize its water companies.  In the U.S. private companies
supply about 85% of electricity but the public sector still owns practically
all of the airports and waterworks.  Toll roads played an important role in
America's early infrastructure development but today they account for only
about ten percent of the national highway system.  In 1994, toll roads
collected about $4.6 billion of revenue compared to $71.4 billion of government
receipts from highway user taxes. While it is difficult to put a precise value
on state and local government enterprises, the Reason Foundation has produced a
report suggesting they have a potential market value of about $227 billion.<p>
<p>
A few cities, such as Indianapolis, have promoted the privatization of public
services on the grounds of efficiency but the overall rate of change in the
U.S. has been very modest compared to other industrial countries because state
and local governments have not been confronting fiscal problems on a scale
large enough to require dramatic action. The U.S. federal tax system also
subsidizes public ownership of enterprises, such as airports and water systems,
by permitting state and local governments to sell tax exempt securities.<p>
<p>
Despite the great policy changes occurring in Washington today, state and local
governments enjoy a healthy financial position as a result of both the
economy's benign performance and the large increase in federal assistance which
occurred during the Bush administration.  But they should not permit their
current surpluses to lull them into complacency about the challenges which lie
ahead.<p>
<p>
If the Republicans retain control of Congress, there will be continuing
pressure to lower the federal deficit through reduced financial assistance to
the states.  If they win the White House, the odds would also increase of a
dramatic overhaul of the federal tax system which could jeopardize existing tax
allowances, such as the exemption on state and local government securities, as
a quid pro quo for reducing marginal income tax rates. If the Democrats win,
they will move more slowly to curtail federal spending but they will also be
unable to resist the demographic pressure for cuts in discretionary spending
programs over the long-term.  Devolution and the movement towards block grants
will be manageable for the states during periods of economic growth but when
the economy finally experiences a recession, they will have to finance large
increases in social spending without the support which has traditionally come
from the federal government.  If the federal tax allowance for state and local
securities are  eliminated, they will also have to pay higher interest rates on
their bonds.<p>
<p>
There is no way to predict exactly when these  pressures will converge in a new
crisis.  The timing of any future economic shock will depend upon political and
business cycle factors which are still unfolding.  But the basic thrust of
public policy is very clear.  The federal government will attempt to cope with
the coming upsurge in its entitlement spending for the elderly by shifting more
responsibilities onto the states.  The states will be able to cope with
devolution when the economy is prosperous but the caps on federal block grants
will cause future recessions to increase the pressure on their fiscal positions
by more than other economic downturns in the modern era.  As a result, the odds
are high that devolution will someday be looked back upon as the first stage of
a more comprehensive restructuring of the American public sector which
culminated in the widespread privatization of state and local government
enterprises during the early years of the 21st century.

<I>Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>




<H3>Social Security and Mutual Funds</H3>

The White House has commissioned a report on the future of the social security system and some members of the study group want to invest social security trust fund assets in the stock market.  The study will examine three possible options for investing social security assets in the equity market.  According to a preliminary version of the report,

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

&quot;The Council expressed interest in three different approaches for insuring social adequacy while improving individual equity.  One approach involves a slight increase in taxes on benefits, and then letting the Social Security system invest these and other funds directly in common stock, or equities.  Historically, returns on equities have exceeded those on government bonds (where all Social Security funds are now invested) and if this equity premium persists, it would be possible to increase benefits for future retirees without worsening social adequacy protections against low wages and retirement benefits, disability and the financial risk of a very long life.&quot;

<P>

&quot;Another very different approach is to create individual accounts within or alongside the Social Security system.  One option here would involve a slight reduction in the future growth of Social Security benefits alongside a mandatory contribution of 1.6 percent of covered payroll to individual accounts.  These individual accounts would be held by the OASDI Trust Funds but with constrained investment choices available to individuals.  If individuals were to devote the same share of the funds to equities as they do in private funds, they already own and manage, it would be possible to raise benefits for future retirees, again without harming social adequacy protections.&quot;

<P>

&quot;A third approach would go even further down this road of creating individual accounts by devoting a much larger share, 5 percent of covered payroll, to these individual accounts.  Were this approach to be followed, for younger workers the present Social Security system would move gradually in the direction of just providing a flat benefit to full career workers, along with disability and survivor's protection.  The individual accounts might be held by the central system or they might be held privately.  Again, individuals would have constrained choices on how the funds were managed.  There would need to be a tax of the equivalent of 1.56 percent of payroll necessary to finance the transition to this new regime, though the tax would not actually have to be a payroll tax.&quot;

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Ten years ago, it would have been unthinkable for the White House or the Congress to produce a report with such radical proposals for reforming social security but the aging of the baby boom generation is altering the parameters for political discussion about the nation's retirement system.  The senior citizens lobby can no longer supress debate about the subject because many studies are projecting a serious funding crisis when the baby boom generation retires and the first batch of baby boom children are now only fifteen years away from the official retirement age.  But even if the principle of equity investment in the social security fund is accepted, there could still be great controversy over the process by which such investment occurs.  Should the government create a fund management company to supervise a social security equity fund or should the government farm out the business to independent mangers?  If the government decides to encourage retirement saving through private security accounts, should it impose stringent regulatory standards on the firms which will be permitted to mange such accounts?  In Chile, the government permits only a small number of firms to compete for private pension fund accounts.  In the U.S. by contrast, there is little direct supervision of fund managers by the government.  The major goal of public policy is to provide adequate disclosure of information about the fund performance so that individuals can chose a manager on their own.  If the federal government selects a small group of fund management firms to supervise social equity accounts, it could encourage more rapid consolidation of the mutual fund industry than is already occurring.

<P>

The introduction of corporate equity and bonds into the social security trust fund will also have important implications for the government's own funding needs.  At present, the social security trust fund has assets of $360 billion which are invested in a special issue of Treasury debt.  If the cash flow of the social security system is diversified by 40-50% into corporate bonds and equities, the government could lose direct funding currently worth $300 billion per annum or a sum in excess of the present federal deficit.  Conversely, the mutual fund industry is now so large that the addition of $300 billion per annum of social security savings would broadly match the capital inflows already occurring.

<P>

While potential changes in the social security system to expand equity ownership will have only a modest impact on the mutual fund industry, the growth of defined contribution pension plans through mutual funds could have a major impact on the U.S. savings rate.  At present, many Americans are de facto target savers because they belong to defined benefit pension plans.  Under the traditional system of defined benefit pension plans, firms often responded to a rising stock market by reducing contributions to their pension plan.  The gain in asset prices made it possible for them to achieve their actuarial target with smaller savings contributions.  In the 1980's overfunded pension  plans also attracted corporate raiders who then financed their takeover bids by extracting surpluses from the pension plan.  Under defined benefit plans, by contrast, employees can contribute as much as they want and have no clear incentive to reduce contributions in the face of rising asset prices.  At a result of this change in savings incentives, the expansion of the defined contribution form of asset accumulation for retirement could have a more positive impact on the U.S. savings rate than past changes in the tax system.  According to IRS data, defined contribution plans (401-K's) accounted for 29% of pension assets in 1993 or a level three times as high as prevailed in 1984.   At present defined benefit pension plans have an average of 43% of their assets in equities but some firms go as high as 76%.

<P>

Some commentators are concerned that in a future stock market correction, the mutual fund sector could experience large scale redemptions which would intensify any bear market.  The industry already had a trial run of such a risk during 1994, when U.S. bonds experienced their greatest bear market since 1927 and several bond funds had large trading losses on derivatives.  As a result of the bear market in bonds, sales of bond funds slumped and the industry experienced four consecutive months of net redemptions in late 1994.  The redemptions peaked at $5.3 billion in November of 1994 compared to sales of $10-15 billion per month one year before.  But the industry stabilized in early 1995 and enjoyed renewed sales as bond markets rallied during the next nine months.  Equity funds have had no net redemptions since the current bull market began but sales have fluctuated in a range as low as $4.7 billion per month during late 1994 and as high as $24 billion during January, 1996.  In past bear markets, the mutual fund sector was also more resilient than many of today's pessimists probably realize.  After the 1987 stock market crash, the industry suffered net redemptions equal to 4.5% of assets in its equity funds but the outflows persisted for only a brief period because the market itself quickly stabilized.  The 1962 stock market crash did not have a major impact on mutual fund redemptions while there were only modest redemptions after the market corrections of 1970 and 1990.  The severe bear market of 1974  produced a sharp decline in financial asset prices and mutual fund sales but there was no large scale withdrawal of funds from the industry.  Instead, the industry suffered several years of modest net redemptions which ceased after interest rates fell sharply in 1983.  What remains unclear is whether the mutual fund industry was resilient during past bear markets because the ownership of assets was far more narrowly concentrated among upper income people.  Before the 1980's, the assets of equity mutual funds also were very modest compared to the household sector's direct ownership of equities.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
October 21,1996</I>

<P>
Mr. Greenspan also called attention to the relationship between
inflation and profit margins during the current business cycle.
He reported that profit margins have risen to high levels in the
face of small price increases because of both modest wage growth
and the success which firms have enjoyed in boosting productivity.
If margins now erode because of accelerating wage growth or declining
productivity, firms will come under greater pressure to boost
prices in order to restore profitability.
<P>
<I>Most American forecasters believe that the U.S. corporate sector
will experience a profit squeeze during 1997. </I>On the basis
of the Blue Chip survey of the consensus, forecasters are projecting
a profit gain of only 3.3% during 1997 compared to 9.0% this year.
In 1996, forecasters expect profits to grow at a rate twice the
economy's projected nominal GDP growth rate of 4.6%. In 1997,
by contrast, they are expecting profit growth to lag behind their
estimate of nominal GDP growth of 4.7%. The pessimism of economists
about the profit outlook is not universally shared on Wall Street.
Surveys of corporate profits on the basis of forecasts by company
security analysts suggest that profit growth will be 10-15% next
year. Economists are pessimistic about profits because they believe
that rising wages and slower productivity growth will depress
margins. Analysts implicitly appear to believe that output growth
will either be stronger or that firms will obtain larger price
increases to offset rising wage costs.
<P>
<I>The performance of corporate profits next year will have a
major influence on both the longevity of the current business
cycle and the relative returns provided by debt and equity.</I>
If the corporate sector enjoys 10-15% profit growth during 1997,
the odds are high that output growth will remain close to 3.0%
and set the stage for at least two or three new rounds of Fed
tightening. If earnings growth is only about 3.0%, by contrast,
the odds are high that output growth will slow to only about 2.0%
and that firms will have absorbed rising labor cost pressures
in their profit margins. After declining corporate profits have
depressed investment and employment, the Fed would probably be
able to ease monetary policy during the second half of 1997. There
are sectors of the equity market which could perform well In the
face of a general contraction in profit margins. The winners would
include growth stocks operating independently of the business
cycle, multinational companies able to benefit from a recovery
in Europe and Japan, and financial stocks. But declining profitability
at large labor intensive and cyclical companies would inhibit
the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
<P>
In the early stages of the business cycle, it is possible for
firms to enjoy large increases in output with falling costs because
they enjoy the disinflation effects of depressed utilization rates,
high unemployment and large productivity gains. <I>But as the
business cycle matures and utilization rates rise, it is difficult
to sustain an environment which is positive for both profits and
inflation. </I>Unless wages continue to be insensitive to the
unemployment rate, the economy appears to be entering a zone in
which there will be negative trade-offs between profits and prices.
<P>
It is possible to rationalize the current equity market rally
as a pure liquidity phenomena resulting from easy monetary policy
all over the world. But it is difficult to imagine the U.S. equity
market sustaining its recent robust performance into 1997 if profit
margins are poised to contract as the price of restraining inflation.
In 1995, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan defended the stock market's
high valuation ratios as a reflection of corporate America's success
at boosting profits and developing new technology for enhancing
productivity. His reluctance to speak positively about the U.S.
stock market this autumn may reflect a concern that equity prices
are now exaggerating the corporate sector's ability to sustain
high profit growth without more upward pressure on inflation.
<P>
The financial markets have accepted the verdict of the opinion
polls that President Clinton that will win re-election by a healthy
margin, but they have not yet discounted the risk of a Democratic
takeover of the Congress. Many investors perceive that the American
people like divided government and thus will offset their vote
for the president by voting Republican in the congressional races.
There is no clear historical pattern to the coat-tail effects
of landslide presidential election victories. Ronald Reagan enjoyed
great coat-tails power in 1980 while Lyndon Johnson helped to
elect many Democrats to Congress in 1964, but Richard Nixon had
little drawing power in the congressional races during 1972 while
the Reagan re-election landslide of 1984 had only a modest impact
on the congressional races. <I>The fact is almost two thirds of
U.S. presidential elections since 1920 have been characterized
by landslide victories (margins over 10%). </I>Incumbent presidents
who enjoy successful first terms which do not generate primary
opposition also tend to expand their victory margins when seeking
re-election (Roosevelt in 1936, Eisenhower in 1956, Nixon in 1972
and Reagan in 1984). As a result, there would be nothing unique
about Clinton winning re-election with a victory margin of 10-15%
or what the opinion polls have been predicting recently. Political
analysts will long ponder the president's seeming immunity to
personal and financial scandals as well as his ability to shift
his extraordinary ideological profile so effectively, but the
voters appear to be reacting to perceptions of the economy and
the general international environment, not the issue of character
or partisan disagreements about tax policy. According to the University
of Michigan survey of consumer confidence during September, the
public has a more positive view of government economic policy
today than at any time since mid-1988.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 26, 1996</I>

<P>
The U.S. election campaign has not yet emerged as a major factor
in the financial markets despite the rebound in the president's
lead over Robert Dole in the opinion polls.  <I>But if October
polls point to a Democratic sweep which could alter control of
the Congress, business confidence in the 1997 economic outlook
could start to deteriorate.</I>  The leadership of the Democratic
Party in the Congress is so far to the left of the president that
some Washington analysts describe a potential victory for it as
&quot;a return of the Dinosaurs&quot;.  The committee chairmanships
of a  Democratic controlled Congress would be dominated by elderly
members from old urban centers in the northeast and middle west
who launched their political careers during the 1960's.  The new
House speaker would also be a member of Congress who has spent
the past decade advocating protectionist trade policies and populist
domestic policies. 
<P>
As the election of a Democratic Congress would raise many questions
about economic policy, it would cause the financial markets to
become even more sensitive than usual to the cabinet appointments
which the president announced during December and the signals
they provided about the future conduct of policy.  The current
Treasury team enjoys a high level of confidence in the financial
markets, and it is widely expected that Secretary Robert Rubin
will remain but investors expect to see new appointments for other
key positions, such as Trade Representatives, Secretary of Commerce,
and chairman of the National Economic Council.  They also will
be anxious to see who replaces Dick Morris as the president's
major advisor on political strategy.  While Morris had little
influence on economic policy, he did steer the president towards
the right on many social issues (family values) and gave the administration
a very conservative tone compared to 1993.  As Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan is a long experienced Washington operator, the large
Democratic lead in the opinion polls probably also had some influence
on the outcome of the September FOMC meeting.  Both Mr. Greenspan
and some Fed district presidents are aware that a Democratic Congress
would be far more intrusive into the affairs of the Federal Reserve
than the current Congress.

ALT="Can The Foreign Exchange Markets Ignore the Fed?"><BR>


The dollar remained relatively firm despite the Fed's failure
to tighten policy because other G-7 countries are still anxious
to promote dollar appreciation and the U.S. bond market reacted
positively to the Fed's policy.
<P>
The U.S. government's current account and capital account data
for the second quarter suggest that the dollar is being underpinned
by greater support from private investors, not just central banks.
The new data indicates that central bank intervention to support
the dollar fell to $13.2 billion during the second quarter from
$52 billion during the first quarter.  In place of official intervention,
foreign demand for U.S. Treasury securities shot up to $31.7 billion
from $11.8 billion during the first quarter while purchases of
 other securities fell only modestly to $28.6 billion from $36
billion during the first quarter.  Meanwhile, American demand
for foreign securities slumped to $20 billion during the second
quarter from $34.4 billion during the first quarter.  Foreign
direct investment was also nearly in balance, with outward investment
of $46 billion during the first half compared to $40 billion of
inward investment.  During 1995, by contrast, official intervention
to support the dollar was $110 billion compared to foreign purchases
of Treasury securities equal to $99 billion, foreign demand for
other securities of $95.2 billion and direct investment of $60
billion. In addition to a $148 billion current account deficit
during 1995, American demand for foreign securities was $98 billion
while outward direct investment was $96 billion.  <I>The magnitude
of the U.S. current account deficit and American demand for foreign
securities suggests the dollar will be vulnerable to renewed weakness
at some point but the willingness of future central banks to support
the  dollar is unlikely to change in the near future.</I>  In
fact, the IMF has just published its latest estimates of the distribution
of the world's foreign exchange reserves by currency.  According
to the IMF, the dollar's share of global foreign exchange reserves
rose modestly to 56.4% last year form 55.9% during 1994 and a
trough of 50.3% during 1990.  The D-mark's share fell to 13.7%
from 14.3% while the yen's share declined to 7.1% from 8.2%. 
It is the industrial countries which are spending most aggressively
to protect the dollar's international role.  The dollar's share
of their reserves rose to 52.8% from 51.2% while its share of
developing country reserves eased to 60.5% from 61.8%.  While
it is not surprising that Japan and Europe are trying to resist
dollar depreciation, it is remarkable that Asian and Latin American
central banks have not been more aggressive in diversifying their
foreign exchange reserves out of dollars.
<P>
Europe and Japan want to encourage a strong dollar because their
own economies are still weak and they need to promote exports.
 Many European countries are also trying to adhere to exchange
rate target bands against the D-Mark and thus don't want the D-mark
to appreciate against the dollar.  The Bundesbank itself also
favors a weak D-mark because it is trying to discourage the support
of German industry for introducing a new European currency.
<P>
<I>The currency which has been most vulnerable to a speculative
attack during recent weeks has been the French franc.</I>  The
French economy is weak and the economic slowdown is undermining
the efforts of the French government to achieve a budget deficit
of less than 3.0% of GDP in order to satisfy the Maastricht economic
preconditions for European monetary union in 1999.  In mid-September,
the French government announced a new budget which introduced
some interesting accounting changes in order to achieve its deficit
target.  The French government, for example, will realize an accounting
gain of 40 billion francs in the current fiscal year by assuming
responsibility for the national telephone company's pension fund
before it is privatized.  Several journalists chastised the French
government for using such unconventional revenue enhancement techniques
in order to achieve its deficit target but investors did not sell
the franc because they consider the French effort to achieve a
smaller deficit to be  preferable to the alternative EMU strategy
which had appeared to be evolving a few months ago.  In mid-summer,
it was widely perceived that Chancellor Kohl and President Chirac
would attempt to impose EMU while accepting budget deficits closer
to 4.0% of GDP. <I> Investors bought the French franc in mid-September
because they considered the French government's effort to achieve
a smaller deficit through a spending freeze and unconventional
revenue enhancement to be superior to an economic strategy which
simply sacrificed deficit reduction targets to the greater goal
of European monetary union.</I>
<P>
<I>The French budget has not eliminated all risks to implementation
of EMU in 1999.</I>  If the French economy stalls this winter,
the government will not be able to achieve its revenue targets
and it will have to consider imposing even greater fiscal austerity
on an economy which already has high unemployment.  As France
will have parliamentary elections in March 1998, it will be difficult
for President Chirac to introduce another restrictive budget during
1997.  <I>In the absence of a French economic upturn, the odds
are high that the Chirac government would be forced to introduce
a new economic strategy including large interest rate reductions,
a devaluation of the franc, and an indefinite deferral of monetary
union.</I>  As the Germans are terrified of a large franc devaluation,
they would probably reduce interest rate further this winter in
order to help revive the French economy and maintain France's
current exchange rate policy.  The good news for the French government
is that the German and British economies are showing such clear
signs of revival that there should be positive spillover effects
on France.  But as France is suffering from deep structural problems
in its labor market and banking system, it is unclear if export
growth alone will be able to revive business and household confidence
by enough to stimulate domestic spending.
<P>
As the French government is prepared to consider unconventional
revenue sources in order to achieve its Maastricht deficit targets,
it will be interesting to see if the French government investigates
the feasibility of obtaining more revenue from the Bank of France.
 The French central bank is now independent of the government
in the conduct of monetary policy but the French government continues
to  be its only shareholder.  As a result, it would be appropriate
for the French government to examine whether its central bank
is observing the same fiscal austerity as other departments of
the French government in promoting deficit reduction.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 2, 1996</I>

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/risingbondyields_subhead.gif" ALT="Why Is The Dollar Weak?"><BR>
The primary focus of the foreign exchange market during the next few weeks will be the relationship between the German mark and French franc.
<P>
The franc is under pressure because of growing investor concern about the prospects for European monetary union occurring on schedule in 1999.  The German economy is showing signs of recovery while the French economy remains lackluster.  As a result, it will be difficult for the French government to achieve its target of a fiscal deficit equal to 3.0% of GDP in 1997 unless it can enact further large cuts in public spending or tax hikes.  Such fiscal restraint will be unpopular because the tax share of GDP in France is already 55% while French unions have threatened to go on strike if the government pursues further large reductions in government payrolls and entitlement programs.  The Bundesbank has attempted to boost the franc and reduce upward pressure on the D-mark by lowering German interest rates 30 basis points but the market shrugged off the move because of perceptions that it will be Germany's last interest rate cut and awareness that France confronts such serious  fiscal problems that monetary fine tuning, alone, will be insufficient to resolve them.  The market is also apprehensive about the possible impact of a parliamentary investigation into the Credit Lyons scandal on the status of Jean Claude Trichet, president of the Bank of France.  The office of President Chirac denies that Mr. Trichet is vulnerable to the inquiry, but investors are apprehensive because Mr. Trichet has been the architect of French economic policy for several years.  Investors fear that if he were to leave, France might abandon its commitment to monetary union.
<P>
There are four possible solutions to the franc's problems.  First, the French economy could enjoy a stronger than expected recovery during 1997 in response to this year's monetary easing and produce an upsurge of tax receipts which would lower the budget deficit to 3.0-3.5% of GDP from 4.5% this year.  Secondly, the French government could be successful in enacting large cuts in public spending and achieve its fiscal target despite sluggish growth of the economy.  Thirdly, Chancellor Kohl could attempt to persuade other European governments and the German people to relax the budget deficit targets specified in the Maastricht Treaty on the grounds that France is moving in the right direction and that any delay of monetary union would create the risk of the whole project being deferred indefinitely.  Finally, France and Germany could agree to delay monetary union for one year on technical grounds but make it clear that the whole project will go ahead in the year 2000.
<P>
The most likely scenario at present is a combination of scenarios two and three.  The French government will succeed in enacting some spending cuts and Chancellor Kohl will try to persuade other governments to go ahead with European monetary union if the French deficit is less than 4.0% of GDP.  The positive surprise for the markets would be that the European monetary easing of the past two years produces a stronger than expected upturn which permits France and other countries to come closer to the Maastricht fiscal targets than now seems possible.
<P>
As a result of the monetary union issue, the bond markets of many European countries will behave quite differently than the U.S. bond market during the next twelve months.  In the U.S., the bond market now slumps whenever economic data shows signs of strength.  American bond investors dislike strong growth because the economy is close to full employment and it increases the risk of Federal Reserve tightening.  In Europe, by contrast, stronger economic growth helps to reduce government fiscal deficits and thus enhances the prospects of monetary union.  The currencies and bond markets which are most vulnerable to a collapse if monetary union is deferred are those which have used the goal of monetary union as a lever for pursuing deficit reduction, including France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal.  While Italy, Spain, and other southern European countries will not be in the first wave of monetary union, they will be pursuing a fiscal and monetary stabilization pact with the countries of the union in order to lay the groundwork for admission later.  Any setback to the monetary union project would therefore provoke investor concern about the ability of the governments in Rome, Madrid, and elsewhere to adhere to the macroeconomic targets which will be pursued in conjunction with the stabilization pact.  
<P>
The pressures on European exchange rates resulting from the uncertainties about monetary union caused investors to buy the D-mark and the Swiss franc at the expense of other currencies, including the U.S. dollar, during August.  The dollar also suffered from the failure of  the Fed to tighten monetary policy during late August, but the resilience of the U.S.equity market limited the damage resulting from the Fed's passivity.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
July 29, 1996</I>

<P>

Thirdly, if the Democrats win a majority in the House, their new speaker would
be Rep. Richard Gephardt.  After flirting with many "New Democrat" political
themes during the mid-1980's, Rep. Gephardt has devoted most of the past decade
to espousing protectionist trade policies, higher marginal income tax rates,
and other forms of government intervention in the economy.<p>
<p>
As a result of the ideological polarization which has occurred in the
congressional membership of both major political parties, a Democratic victory
in this November's congressional races would probably have three immediate
effects on the economy.<p>
<p>
It would encourage investors to sell both U.S. bonds and the U.S. dollar.<p>
<p>
It would probably cause all investors to reduce their exposure to Mexico as
well as other emerging market countries which might be vulnerable to
congressional demands for more restrictive trade polices.<p>
<p>
It would probably encourage many U.S. companies to defer decisions about new
investment and hiring until they had more visibility on how the election would
affect public policy in such critical areas as taxation and labor market
regulation.  Ironically, <i>such caution might cause bond yields to fall during
early 1997, when lower investment depressed the economy, but in late 1996 the
weakness of bond prices would itself help to set the stage for the economic
slowdown.</i><p>
<u></u><p>
As Congressman Gephardt has ambitions to run for president in the year 2000, it
is doubtful that the next Congress will be as left wing as the markets might
fear this autumn.  But Wall Street is apprehensive because it was surprised by
the upsurge of support for Patrick Buchanan in the Republican primaries during
early 1996.  With the unemployment rate so low, it was not prepared for such a
rapidly protectionist candidate to win the New Hampshire primary.<p>
<p>
Congressman Gephardt himself said after the early primaries that the politics
of the deficit was about to be replaced by the politics of income.  He
suggested that the Democratic Party would attempt to revive itself by focusing
on the economic insecurities and concerns about income inequality which had
helped to produce the Buchanan primary victories.  If the Democrats regain
control of Congress, they are likely to emphasize such themes in their
legislative agenda for 1997.<p>
<p>
The critics of the U.S. economy have three major complaints.  First, real wages
have been stagnant for several years.  Secondly, there is growing income
inequality on the basis of differentials in education.  Thirdly, corporations
provide excessive compensation for a few senior executives at the same time
that they are demanding pay cuts or other sacrifices from low and middle income
workers.  <p>
<p>
There is no doubt that real wage growth has slowed dramatically compared to the
growth rates which prevailed before the oil crises of the 1970's.  <i>But it is
far from clear that hourly wages deflated by the consumer price index are a
good proxy for what is happening to total U.S. compensation.</i>  There is
considerable evidence that the CPI now overstates inflation.  If we adjust
wages with the GDP deflator or the non-farm business deflator, there has
actually been moderate growth in real wages during recent years (see charts
21-25).  Many firms also offer their workers generous non-wage compensation in
order to avoid taxes, including pensions and health care.  Such benefits are
now equal to about 18% of total compensation compared to 5% in the late
1940's.<p>
<p>
There is growing income inequality based on education because new developments
in technology are forcing firms to bid up the price of educated workers
compared to people with fewer skills.  With the economy now close to full
employment, it is likely that unskilled workers will now have an opportunity to
improve their wage negotiating power because of labor scarcity in many regions.
The unemployment rate is now below 5.0% in states accounting for almost one
half of the national labor market and such a low level of unemployment has
always encouraged faster wage growth in the past.<p>
<p>
Corporations have been able to justify large compensation programs for their
executives during the 1990's because profits have boomed and share prices have
risen sharply.  The problem with the corporate sector is that only about 13% of
U.S. workers qualify for profit sharing plans while only another 3% belong to
ESOP programs (Employee Stock Ownership).  As a result, there is a weak link in
the U.S. corporate sector between employment and share ownership.  About 51
million Americans have exposure to the stock market through mutual funds,
defined contribution pension plans, and other forms of share ownership but they
do not enjoy the same preferential access to shares as senior executives in
most corporations. The perceived unfairness of this imbalance also has been
magnified  in the public mind by the fact that it is the large Fortune 500
companies which have done the most aggressive restructuring since 1980.  During
the past fifteen years, the old Fortune 500 companies have reduced their
employment from 16.5 million jobs to 11.5 million jobs despite the fact that
total U.S. employment has expanded by almost 28 million.  The high visibility
of the Fortune 500 layoffs in the media has produced a far greater sense of
insecurity among American workers than can be justified by the economy's
overall employment performance.<p>
<p>
While the American corporate sector can be faulted for narrow stock option
programs and insensitive public relations in the way it conducts
restructurings, the fact remains that the U.S. has the most successful labor
market for job creation in the industrial world.<p>
<p>
<i>Since 1980, the U.S. economy has created 28 million new jobs for a labor
force of 134 million and in the process absorbed 95% of all the new labor force
entrants.</i>  About 20 million American also change their job every years.
Since 1980, the European Union has created about 14 new million jobs for a
labor force of 194 million and absorbed only about one half of the new labor
force entrants.  As a result, unemployment in continental Europe is at doubt
digit levels for the population as a whole and much higher for young people.<p>
<p>
The U.S. also enjoys great social mobility compared to the other countries.
Among those in the bottom income quintile twenty years ago, 29% have gone to
the top income quintile, 30% to the second and 21% have moved to the third.
The number of American households earning over $100,000 per annum in 1994
dollars has risen from 1.0 million in 1967 and 2.7 million in 1980 to over 6
million today.<p>

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
June 21, 1996</I>

<P>

Goldman Sachs has compiled its own estimate of Tobin Q's solely
for companies in the S&amp;P 400 Industrial index. Goldman prefers
this formula because it focuses solely on manufacturing firms
with stock market listings, not the whole U.S. corporate sector.
Whereas the Fed measure of corporate net worth has declined during
the 1990's because of falling real estate prices, the Goldman
measure has grown at a rate of 3.8% per annum. <B>As a result
of the manufacturing sector's increasing net worth, the S&amp;P
400 measure of Tobin Q has risen only to 1.4 from 0.4 in the mid-1980's
and is still below its peak of 1.9 during the mid-1960's.</B>

<P>
<B>All measures of Tobin Q make it clear that the U.S. stock market
is expensive by the valuation standards of the 1970's and 1980's,
but industrial companies do not appear to be as overvalued as
the Federal Reserve estimate of current cost net worth might imply.</B>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and others also have warned
that book value does not provide useful information about the
true net worth of the large U.S. investment in technology and
human capital. The stock market is a discounting machine attempting
to determine the value of a future stream of earnings adjusted
for the return on low risk instruments such as Treasury bills.
The replacement cost of assets provides little information about
future earnings growth. As the deflation of commercial real estate
prices since 1990 will testify, replacement cost plays minor role
in determining transactions prices for property compared to estimates
of rental income.
<P>
There are numerous signs of excessive optimism in the U.S. equity
market today. The ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP
has risen to 91% from previous peaks of 81% in 1929 and 79% in
1972 while the ratio of stock and bond market capitalization is
now at 180% of GDP compared to 80% in 1982. <B>The dividend yield
has dropped to only about 2.1%.</B> The flow of money into mutual
funds is unprecedented both in absolute terms and relative to
national income. <B>Equity funds are also absorbing over 90% of
new money flows into the mutual fund sector compared to 30-40%
during the period 1985-1992.</B> The manager of Fidelity's largest
equity mutual fund felt compelled to resign because he had mistakenly
overweighted his fund in bonds. The volume of money raised from
equity I.P.O's is now running at 0.4% of GDP compared to a peak
of 0.52% in 1993 and 0.3-0.4% during the mid-1980's. At the University
of Chicago, a professor of finance recently announced that it
was possible for investors to outperform the market through careful
selection of value stocks whereas the school has traditionally
advocated a theory of market efficiency which suggested that stock
selection was a futile exercise. When so many yardsticks of popular
psychology suggest euphoria about the equity market, it is difficult
for an experienced professional investor not to feel pessimistic.
But the market continues to be supported by a positive outlook
for corporate profits, a modest level of inflation and interest
rate risk, and increasing signs of resurgence in the global economy.
There will probably have to be more evidence of imbalances in
the real economy or potential inflation risk to puncture the self-reinforcing
optimism which is now driving the demand for U.S. equities.
<P>
<B>The Dollar Consolidates</B> 
<P>
The dollar has entered a period of consolidation in response to
both economic and political news. There are more signs of economic
recovery in the other G-7 economies while the markets are increasingly
uncertain about the political outlook in the U.S. They do not
know if Mrs. Clinton will be indicted for obstruction of justice
nor are they certain how such a development would influence this
autumn's election. They perceive that the Dole candidacy is enjoying
a revival but some polls suggest that the outlook for both the
White House and the Congress is still wide open. American investors
have discounted a Clinton victory in the presidential race but
they have not adjusted bond prices and exchange rates for a Democratic
takeover of the Congress.
<P>
The yen has rallied because Japan recorded a GDP growth rate of
13% at annual rates during the first quarter. Some of the uptick
resulted from seasonal adjustment problems with the effect of
the Leap Year on the number of working days but the year on year
growth rate was still 3.3%. While seasonal factors could cause
GDP to shrink modestly during the second quarter, there is little
doubt that<B> Japan is shifting from an upturn driven primarily
by public investment to a more broadly based recovery in consumption
and business investment</B>. The first quarter upturn appears
to vindicate those forecasters who contended that Japanese monetary
policy was highly stimulative because of the tremendous foreign
exchange intervention which occurred to support the dollar during
1995.
<P>
The yen rallied in response to the Japanese GDP report because
inventors now expect the BOJ to hike short-term interest rates
during the autumn, but further yen rallies will be inhibited by
shrinkage of the Japanese trade surplus. It is likely to fall
to $60-70 billion this year from $129 billion during 1994 because
of stronger growth of domestic spending. The Bank of Japan will
also proceed very cautiously before raising interest rates because
of the large size of Japan's output gap, the lingering credit
quality problems of the banks and the Ministry of Finance commitment
to a tighter fiscal policy next year, including a hike in the
value added tax to 5% from 3%.
<P>
The D-mark has rallied because of signs that German output will
start to improve this summer and the strong showing of Mr. Yeltsin
in the first round of the Russian presidential election. The German
output gap is so large that the Bundesbank will retain a bias
towards ease for many months to come. Chancellor Kohl also intends
to go ahead with plans to reduce various entitlement programs
despite the fact that German trade unions have launched the largest
protest demonstrations in the post-war era. Most European economists
are projecting that German real GDP will expand by about 2.3-2.5%
next year compared to 0.4% this year, 2.1% during 1995, and 3.0%
during 1994. The German upturn should also be accompanied by 2.5-3.0%
output growth in the other major European economies.
<P>
The Russian election was never a dominant factor in the foreign
exchange market this spring but if Mr. Zyganov had come in first
place during the first round or appeared capable of launching
a broad based coalition with all anti-Yeltsin forces there is
little doubt that investors would have sold the D-mark. Instead
of holding the wide lead which he enjoyed during early 1996, Mr.
Zyuganov fell 3% behind Mr. Yeltsin while third place went to
a former general who has agreed to be Mr. Yeltsin's new national
security advisor. The supporters of other non-communist candidates,
such as Mr. Yavlinsky, will probably also rally around the president.
<P>
While Moscow equity prices have rallied sharply since the first
round of the Russian presidential elections, there are still risks
in the outlook. <B>The Yeltsin supporters could become complacent
and fail to turn out in large number on July third.</B> General
Lebed is unpopular with many army officers and some of them could
shift their support to Mr. Zyuganov. Mr. Yeltsin himself has had
two heart attacks during the past year and could easily experience
another one at any time. In fact, most Moscow journalists believe
that Russia will have another presidential election far before
his term officially ends in four years because of either his death
or renewed health problems.
<P>
<B>As Russia has never before had an open and free election for
the office of head of state, the recent electoral content represents
an important historical watershed.</B> On the basis of reports
by journalists and independent observers, Mr. Yeltsin appears
to have achieved first place on the basis of a fair and free election
last week. As recently as one month ago, by contrast, many Moscow
commentators had suggested that he would probably have to manufacture
at least 5-10 million votes in order to insure a victory over
Mr. Zyuganov.
<P>
<B>The resolution of the political uncertainty which resulted
from having an open presidential election will itself give a boost
to the Russian economy.</B> At present, the Russian government
is being forced to pay nominal interest rates of 150% on T-bill
instruments despite the fact that the Ruble has been stable for
a year, inflation has fallen to only 30%, and the ratio of central
government debt to GDP is less than 10%.
<P>
Investors have demanded large risk premiums because they could
not be certain that Mr. Zyuganov would either honor the government's
debt or maintain the exchange rate policy which has permitted
Russia to sharply reduce her inflation rate. The dominant short-term
challenges confronting Mr. Yeltsin this summer will be to improve
the efficiency of the tax system in order to reduce the government's
deficit (many firms suspended paying taxes before the election)
and to appoint a new team of ministers capable of pursuing the
other structural reforms needed to establish a viable market economy.
Russia has privatized many state enterprises, including the telecommunications
and utility sectors which are still under government control in
western Europe, but the structure of land ownership and the discretionary
nature of many government regulations (taxes, import duties, etc.)
have encouraged widespread corruption and thus inhibit investment
decision making.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
March 25, 1996</I>

<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/usoutputgrowth_subhead.gif" ALT="Have Foreign Interest Rates Bottomed?">

<BR>

  Despite the economic weakness in the major G-7 countries, bond yields rose all over the world during the first quarter. Yet, the odds are high that there will be further monetary easing in much of continental Europe while Japanese monetary policy will probably remain on hold until at least the autumn.  

<P>

  Many pundits have suggested that the Bundesbank has delayed easing because of strong M3 growth <B>but the real reason is concern about Germany's wage negotiations.</B> Wage bargaining is now underway in the chemical, metal and construction industries while negotiations will begin next month in the banking and insurance sectors. Some of the unions are asking for 6% wage hikes and the Bundesbank wants employers to resist such demands because of the large employment losses now occurring in many German industries. (Manufacturing accounts for over a third of German GDP compared to 20% in the U.S.) If the negotiations produce moderate outcomes, the Bundesbank will probably ease further in late April or May. Monetary easing will be positive for the German financial markets but bond yields could continue to carry a large risk premium to compensate for uncertainty about the future of European monetary union. Many investors fear that Chancellor Kohl will attempt to pursue monetary union even if the key countries fail to achieve their Mastricht targets for deficit reductions. Alternative scenarios are also potentially dangerous for the markets. <B>Kohl, for example, could face so much resistance from his party and coalition partners that he would be forced to call a general election on the issue of monetary union and lose.</B> In such a scenario, a Socialist-Green coalition government could emerge at a time when Germany needs profound restructuring of its rigid labor market and costly welfare state.  

<P>

  The financial market in Tokyo were positively surprised by government reports of strong fourth quarter GDP growth. The resilience of final demand suggests that the economy has turned despite a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. The Ministry of Finance intervened aggressively in the foreign exchange market during February and also used moral suasion over major players, such as multinational corporations, to discourage repatriation of capital during the final weeks of the fiscal year. As the Japanese current account surplus has fallen sharply from the levels of one year ago, the yen should be able to stay in its current trading range if the Japanese institutions resume exporting capital during April. In the second half of 1995, Japanese investors were net sellers of U.S. bonds but were large purchasers of Eurobonds as well as Australian bonds. In January, they made modest purchases of U.S. bonds but sold Australian bonds. The great uncontrollable factor for the MOF is large swings in demand for yen by hedge funds and other highly leveraged investors. Such investors borrowed yen to buy dollar bonds during late 1995 but they were startled by the weakness of the U.S. bond market and the threat of a yen rally in February. The MOF has tried to work with such investors by providing more information about its intentions but such relationship building will count for little if there is a sudden change in market perceptions of the economic outlook. The coming upturn in the U.S. economy should help to bolster confidence in the dollar and encourage more Japanese demand for U.S. securities, but sentiment towards the dollar could turn negative if the upturn produces a sharp widening of the trade deficit or a correction in the bond market so severe that U.S. equities also fall sharply. The dollar also could suffer if the opinion polls suggest the Democrats might regain control of the U.S. House.  

<P>

  To summarize, the U.S. economy appears poised for a moderate growth rebound during the next few quarters. While severe winter weather and the government shutdown have delayed completion of the inventory adjustment in many sectors, there is sufficient resilience in final sales to suggest that inventory demand will emerge as a positive growth factor during the second quarter and boost output growth to 3.0-3.5%. Such a rebound will prevent further monetary easing in the U.S. but the Fed will not tighten policy unless it perceives that growth will remain at levels high enough to push capacity utilization back towards 85.0% and revive inflationary pressures. If, by contrast, output growth returns to the 2.0-2.5% range during the autumn, monetary policy could remain on hold through year-end. The U.S. dollar should benefit from improved perceptions of the American economy but it will be vulnerable to renewed capital outflows by U.S. mutual funds as well as an inventory driven rebound in the trade deficit during the second half of the year.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
February 29, 1996</I>

<P>

The other important dimension of the Buchanan victory was his ability to attract strong support from religious fundamentalists. He received 54% of the votes of people who consider themselves to be part of the religious right compared to 11% for Dole and Alexander. The religious right is a political phenomena unique to the United States among the major industrial nations. <B>About 45% of Americans go to church every Sunday compared to only 5-10% in Europe. As the U.S. was founded by religious dissenters, it has a free market in religion whereas in Europe religion is often a nationalized industry.</B> Britain has a state church under the nominal rule of the monarch while the Catholic church is the official church in many other countries. The number of Americans who classify themselves as evangelical Protestants is about 25% today or the same as thirty years ago. But during the interim, many evangelical Protestants have moved from a relatively modest and rural socio economic status firmly into the suburban middle class and thus greatly enhanced their ability to influence the political system. The population of mainstream Protestants, by contrast, has shrunk from 40% of the U.S. total in the 1960's to about 20% today. Catholics have been steady at about 25% of the population while the population of secularist (no religious affiliation) has expanded from 1-2% thirty years ago to about 15% currently. <B>The rise of the religious right has played a very important role in the revival of the Republican Party during recent years.</B> According to surveys of the 1994 congressional elections, the Republicans attracted the support of 78% of Mormons and 75% of evangelical Protestants, compared to 56% of the votes of mainline Protestants and 53% of Catholics. Without strong support from the religious right, Buchanan would probably have received less than 20% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary and thus come in third. He also benefited from the fact that New Hampshire permits Democrats and independents to vote in the Republican primary. As the Democrats had no presidential primary, some of their voters probably cast votes for Buchanan on the grounds that he would be the most divisive of Republican candidates.
<P>

<B>While Buchanan cannot win the Republican nomination, the question still hovering over the markets is how his electoral success will influence other candidates and public policy after 1996.</B> Will his victories encourage other candidates to support more protectionist trade policies? Will the issue of job insecurity cause other candidates to promise more federal money for job training, unemployment relief, or other safety net programs? Will resentment at growing income inequality encourage political support for a return to much higher marginal income tax rates on high income Americans, especially the corporate executives who collect large bonuses and stock option awards while reducing employment in their companies? In 1992, Bill Clinton had campaigned on a platform called "Putting People First" which had pledged to spend $200 billion of federal money on various human capital programs to bolster productivity and real wages. He abandoned most of these promises in order to pursue deficit reduction during 1993 and focus on health care in 1994. When the Republicans captured the Congress in 1994, he further retreated from the campaign themes of 1992 and stressed in his recent State of the Union message that the era of big government is over. Yet, the Buchanan electoral success suggests that there is a political market among less skilled people for campaign promises to bolster job security through some form of government intervention. As a result of the racial profile of his constituency, Mr. Buchanan focused far more heavily on trade protection than government sponsored income redistribution or worker training but it is not difficult to imagine other candidates putting forward federal programs linking the two issues.
<P>

<B>The Buchanan victory in New Hampshire probably creates three major risks for public policy after the election.</B> First, it will be more difficult for the next president to promote new free trade legislation, such as expanding NAFTA to include Chile. Secondly, despite the electoral success of Steve Forbes in Delaware and Arizona, it will be more challenging to develop broad bi-partisan support for a tax reform program to reduce marginal income tax rates or provide new tax allowances for savings. Thirdly, there will be greater willingness to tinker with new tax incentives for promoting certain forms of corporate behavior such as protecting jobs or increasing spending on human capital. In fact, two Democratic Senators will soon be introducing legislation to redesign the corporate tax code to provide new tax incentives for job protection and training programs. Mr. Robert Kuttner described the legislation in a recent issue of Business Week:
<P>

 "Bingaman and Daschle have therefore turned to the one avenue that might produce some traction: inducing corporations to embrace a 'stakeholder' model. The draft legislation, to be released in late February, proposes a new class of corporations, the R Corp.-'R' for Responsible. The idea is to reward corporations that invest in employees and communities instead of pursuing relentless downsizing that boosts short-term profits."
<P>

 "An R Corp. would receive lower taxes and streamlined regulatory treatment. Specifically, the plan replaces the corporate income tax with a 'business activity tax' of the sort proposed in 1994 by Senators John C. Danforth (R-MO) and David L. Boren (D-Okla.). This tax applies a fixed rate to all receipts, subtracting payments for most inputs. Employee training and R&#38;D expenses would be tax-deductible, while wages dividends, and interest would not. Under this plan, an R Corp. would be taxed at 11%, compared with 18% for conventional corporations. It would also pay reduced payroll taxes and be able to self-certify in several areas of regulation."
<P>

 "Compensation Ratio. To qualify, a corporation would be required to contribute 3% of payroll to a portable, multi-employer pension plan, devote 2% to employee training, pay half the costs of a qualifying health plan, and have a profit-sharing plan or employee stock ownership plan with employee trustees."
<P>

 "Another requirement would be to hold the compensation ratio of the highest to lowest paid employee to no more than 50 to 1, compared with the 130-to-1 ratio in some corporations . An R Corp. would have a 'community responsibility agreement' tempering relocations and layoffs. It would be unionized or have an employee-involvement plan. An R Corp. could not use child or prison labor anywhere in the world and half of its new investment and employment would have to be in the U.S."
<P>

 "The Bingaman plan includes a tax of the sort long proposed by Yale University economist James Tobin on the profits of short-term securities trades. The proceeds would finance a social capital fund for worker training, school-to-work transition programs, industrial extension, export promotion, and technology research and development."
<P>

If there has to be a federal programatic response to public concern about job insecurity, the new Democratic proposals are far superior to the Buchanan program of high tariffs. But attempts to use tax allowances to promote various forms of corporate behavior also raise troublesome questions about the efficiency of resource allcoation, including whether the government will simply end up subsidizing investments which corporations would have made anyway.
<P>

In Britain, the new Labor Party leader, Mr. Tony Blair, has been making numerous speeches about the theme of promoting "stakeholder capitalism" over the traditional form which merely protects the interests of shareholders. The theme of stakeholder capitalism has caught on with only a few Democratic Party intellectuals, such as Labor Secretary Robert Reich, but the Buchanan primary victories will encourage more discussion about American corporate behavior as the campaign progresses. <B>Although promoting discussion about "stakeholder capitalism" is an intelligent way for Washington policy wonks to channel populist outrage over foreign competition and corporate labor shedding into a coherent examination of public policy choices, it is difficult to imagine the next Congress enacting any substantive legislation to promote stakeholder capitalism.</B> First, the traditional models of stakeholder capitalism, such as Germany and Japan, have been suffering from prolonged recessions in part because their corporate sectors are carrying very high embedded social costs. In Germany, unemployment is rising sharply as German firms attempt to escape from the country's high social benefit costs by shifting jobs to the U.S., eastern Europe and other low wage countries. Secondly, corporations which need well trained workers are already spending heavily on education while small firms would regard legislation requiring investment in new federally mandated programs as a reason to curtail employment. Thirdly, the next Congress will still have to address the issue of federal deficit reduction, so expensive new tax allowances will be challenged by House and Senate committee chairmen. As with Bill Clinton's Putting People First program in 1993, the promises of presidential election campaigns will fade quickly if the American legislative branch remains as conservative about fiscal policy as it has been during recent years. Since the Buchanan and Forbes campaign are personality driven phenomena without any large scale organizations to influence congressional races, it is doubtful that the 1996 presidential race will produce major changes in congressional attitudes towards issues such as deficit reduction and federal spending. <B>But as the presidential contest will dominate political news coverage during the next few months, concern about right wing populism undermining support for deficit reduction and free trade in the Republican Party will probably continue to produce a higher political risk premium in U.S. bond yields.</B> This risk premium will be a de facto tax on the economy to compensate investors for the risk of extreme outcomes in the November elections for the White House and Congress.

<I>Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and Local
Privatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>
The need for state and local governments to play a greater role combating the
causes of America's new income inequality at a time when the federal government
is promoting devolution of other programs suggests that governors and
legislatures are going to face more formidable challenges during the decade
ahead than at any other time in the modern era.  Their policies in sectors such
as education will not simply affect the economy of their state.  They will also
have a major impact on the wage and employment trends which are driving the
national debate about trade policy, tax policy and federal regulation of the
labor market.  Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the struggle
over America's place in the new global economic order will depend as much on
the policies of state governments as the national government.<p>
<p>
The strength of the national economy and the growth of tax receipts should
permit state governments to manage these challenges during 1996 and 1997.  But
when the U.S. economy experiences another recession, state governments will
have to confront the triple challenge of faltering tax receipts, increased
spending on the unemployed and the impact of new federal block grant system on
the capacity of Washington to help them fund social programs.  In such a
scenario, the deficits of state governments could rise sharply and force them
to curtail spending on capital investment and other services, including
education.<p>
<p>
How will state governments cope with the fiscal hazards posed by devolution and
recession during the late 1990's?  There will be no simple answers because the
U.S. no longer enjoys a broad social consensus about the role of government at
either the federal or state level.  But one obvious solution which could appeal
to both the political left and right would be for state governments to raise
money by privatizing various assets which could be operated more effectively by
the private sector.<p>
<p>
During the past decade, privatization has been a dominant theme for economic
reformers in both the old industrial countries and the developing countries.
The British government privatized its utilities, water systems and airports
during the 1980's.  China, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines are
encouraging the private sector to develop an extensive network of toll roads.
Many Asian countries are also privatizing ports, electric systems, and phone
companies.  Argentina privatized its utility companies during the early 1980's
and is about to privatize its water companies.  In the U.S. private companies
supply about 85% of electricity but the public sector still owns practically
all of the airports and waterworks.  Toll roads played an important role in
America's early infrastructure development but today they account for only
about ten percent of the national highway system.  In 1994, toll roads
collected about $4.6 billion of revenue compared to $71.4 billion of government
receipts from highway user taxes. While it is difficult to put a precise value
on state and local government enterprises, the Reason Foundation has produced a
report suggesting they have a potential market value of about $227 billion.<p>
<p>
A few cities, such as Indianapolis, have promoted the privatization of public
services on the grounds of efficiency but the overall rate of change in the
U.S. has been very modest compared to other industrial countries because state
and local governments have not been confronting fiscal problems on a scale
large enough to require dramatic action. The U.S. federal tax system also
subsidizes public ownership of enterprises, such as airports and water systems,
by permitting state and local governments to sell tax exempt securities.<p>
<p>
Despite the great policy changes occurring in Washington today, state and local
governments enjoy a healthy financial position as a result of both the
economy's benign performance and the large increase in federal assistance which
occurred during the Bush administration.  But they should not permit their
current surpluses to lull them into complacency about the challenges which lie
ahead.<p>
<p>
If the Republicans retain control of Congress, there will be continuing
pressure to lower the federal deficit through reduced financial assistance to
the states.  If they win the White House, the odds would also increase of a
dramatic overhaul of the federal tax system which could jeopardize existing tax
allowances, such as the exemption on state and local government securities, as
a quid pro quo for reducing marginal income tax rates. If the Democrats win,
they will move more slowly to curtail federal spending but they will also be
unable to resist the demographic pressure for cuts in discretionary spending
programs over the long-term.  Devolution and the movement towards block grants
will be manageable for the states during periods of economic growth but when
the economy finally experiences a recession, they will have to finance large
increases in social spending without the support which has traditionally come
from the federal government.  If the federal tax allowance for state and local
securities are  eliminated, they will also have to pay higher interest rates on
their bonds.<p>
<p>
There is no way to predict exactly when these  pressures will converge in a new
crisis.  The timing of any future economic shock will depend upon political and
business cycle factors which are still unfolding.  But the basic thrust of
public policy is very clear.  The federal government will attempt to cope with
the coming upsurge in its entitlement spending for the elderly by shifting more
responsibilities onto the states.  The states will be able to cope with
devolution when the economy is prosperous but the caps on federal block grants
will cause future recessions to increase the pressure on their fiscal positions
by more than other economic downturns in the modern era.  As a result, the odds
are high that devolution will someday be looked back upon as the first stage of
a more comprehensive restructuring of the American public sector which
culminated in the widespread privatization of state and local government
enterprises during the early years of the 21st century.

<I>Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>




<H3>Social Security and Mutual Funds</H3>

The White House has commissioned a report on the future of the social security system and some members of the study group want to invest social security trust fund assets in the stock market.  The study will examine three possible options for investing social security assets in the equity market.  According to a preliminary version of the report,

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

&quot;The Council expressed interest in three different approaches for insuring social adequacy while improving individual equity.  One approach involves a slight increase in taxes on benefits, and then letting the Social Security system invest these and other funds directly in common stock, or equities.  Historically, returns on equities have exceeded those on government bonds (where all Social Security funds are now invested) and if this equity premium persists, it would be possible to increase benefits for future retirees without worsening social adequacy protections against low wages and retirement benefits, disability and the financial risk of a very long life.&quot;

<P>

&quot;Another very different approach is to create individual accounts within or alongside the Social Security system.  One option here would involve a slight reduction in the future growth of Social Security benefits alongside a mandatory contribution of 1.6 percent of covered payroll to individual accounts.  These individual accounts would be held by the OASDI Trust Funds but with constrained investment choices available to individuals.  If individuals were to devote the same share of the funds to equities as they do in private funds, they already own and manage, it would be possible to raise benefits for future retirees, again without harming social adequacy protections.&quot;

<P>

&quot;A third approach would go even further down this road of creating individual accounts by devoting a much larger share, 5 percent of covered payroll, to these individual accounts.  Were this approach to be followed, for younger workers the present Social Security system would move gradually in the direction of just providing a flat benefit to full career workers, along with disability and survivor's protection.  The individual accounts might be held by the central system or they might be held privately.  Again, individuals would have constrained choices on how the funds were managed.  There would need to be a tax of the equivalent of 1.56 percent of payroll necessary to finance the transition to this new regime, though the tax would not actually have to be a payroll tax.&quot;

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Ten years ago, it would have been unthinkable for the White House or the Congress to produce a report with such radical proposals for reforming social security but the aging of the baby boom generation is altering the parameters for political discussion about the nation's retirement system.  The senior citizens lobby can no longer supress debate about the subject because many studies are projecting a serious funding crisis when the baby boom generation retires and the first batch of baby boom children are now only fifteen years away from the official retirement age.  But even if the principle of equity investment in the social security fund is accepted, there could still be great controversy over the process by which such investment occurs.  Should the government create a fund management company to supervise a social security equity fund or should the government farm out the business to independent mangers?  If the government decides to encourage retirement saving through private security accounts, should it impose stringent regulatory standards on the firms which will be permitted to mange such accounts?  In Chile, the government permits only a small number of firms to compete for private pension fund accounts.  In the U.S. by contrast, there is little direct supervision of fund managers by the government.  The major goal of public policy is to provide adequate disclosure of information about the fund performance so that individuals can chose a manager on their own.  If the federal government selects a small group of fund management firms to supervise social equity accounts, it could encourage more rapid consolidation of the mutual fund industry than is already occurring.

<P>

The introduction of corporate equity and bonds into the social security trust fund will also have important implications for the government's own funding needs.  At present, the social security trust fund has assets of $360 billion which are invested in a special issue of Treasury debt.  If the cash flow of the social security system is diversified by 40-50% into corporate bonds and equities, the government could lose direct funding currently worth $300 billion per annum or a sum in excess of the present federal deficit.  Conversely, the mutual fund industry is now so large that the addition of $300 billion per annum of social security savings would broadly match the capital inflows already occurring.

<P>

While potential changes in the social security system to expand equity ownership will have only a modest impact on the mutual fund industry, the growth of defined contribution pension plans through mutual funds could have a major impact on the U.S. savings rate.  At present, many Americans are de facto target savers because they belong to defined benefit pension plans.  Under the traditional system of defined benefit pension plans, firms often responded to a rising stock market by reducing contributions to their pension plan.  The gain in asset prices made it possible for them to achieve their actuarial target with smaller savings contributions.  In the 1980's overfunded pension  plans also attracted corporate raiders who then financed their takeover bids by extracting surpluses from the pension plan.  Under defined benefit plans, by contrast, employees can contribute as much as they want and have no clear incentive to reduce contributions in the face of rising asset prices.  At a result of this change in savings incentives, the expansion of the defined contribution form of asset accumulation for retirement could have a more positive impact on the U.S. savings rate than past changes in the tax system.  According to IRS data, defined contribution plans (401-K's) accounted for 29% of pension assets in 1993 or a level three times as high as prevailed in 1984.   At present defined benefit pension plans have an average of 43% of their assets in equities but some firms go as high as 76%.

<P>

Some commentators are concerned that in a future stock market correction, the mutual fund sector could experience large scale redemptions which would intensify any bear market.  The industry already had a trial run of such a risk during 1994, when U.S. bonds experienced their greatest bear market since 1927 and several bond funds had large trading losses on derivatives.  As a result of the bear market in bonds, sales of bond funds slumped and the industry experienced four consecutive months of net redemptions in late 1994.  The redemptions peaked at $5.3 billion in November of 1994 compared to sales of $10-15 billion per month one year before.  But the industry stabilized in early 1995 and enjoyed renewed sales as bond markets rallied during the next nine months.  Equity funds have had no net redemptions since the current bull market began but sales have fluctuated in a range as low as $4.7 billion per month during late 1994 and as high as $24 billion during January, 1996.  In past bear markets, the mutual fund sector was also more resilient than many of today's pessimists probably realize.  After the 1987 stock market crash, the industry suffered net redemptions equal to 4.5% of assets in its equity funds but the outflows persisted for only a brief period because the market itself quickly stabilized.  The 1962 stock market crash did not have a major impact on mutual fund redemptions while there were only modest redemptions after the market corrections of 1970 and 1990.  The severe bear market of 1974  produced a sharp decline in financial asset prices and mutual fund sales but there was no large scale withdrawal of funds from the industry.  Instead, the industry suffered several years of modest net redemptions which ceased after interest rates fell sharply in 1983.  What remains unclear is whether the mutual fund industry was resilient during past bear markets because the ownership of assets was far more narrowly concentrated among upper income people.  Before the 1980's, the assets of equity mutual funds also were very modest compared to the household sector's direct ownership of equities.

ALT="Will the Japanese Election Alter Perceptions of the Optimal
Yen Rate?"><BR>

There has been such a broad based global rally in equity and bond
prices during recent weeks that the strength of Wall Street has
not had a major impact on the value of the dollar.
<P>
Buying and selling of the D-mark in response to changing perceptions
of the outlook for European monetary union has driven fluctuations
in the dollar/D-mark rate, not economic developments in the U.S.
itself.<I> The monetary union factor is likely to remain the dominant
influence on the D-mark for many months to come.</I> If the Russian
political situation deteriorates significantly in the aftermath
of Mr. Lebed's dismissal, there could be broad based selling of
European currencies but the market may ultimately respond positively
to the Lebed dismissal if it bolsters the odds of Mr. Chernomyrdin
replacing Mr. Yeltsin in the event that his health deteriorate
further. Mr. Lebed has little support in the military and his
positive showing in the recent presidential election resulted
from Mr. Yeltsin's financial backers giving him a boost in the
final weeks of the campaign. Russia has many new wealthy people
and they will rally around the current prime minister or mayor
of Moscow in the next presidential election.
<P>
The most recent German economic data confirms that the economy
experienced a healthy upturn during the third quarter, but French
data continues to show depressed confidence in both the corporate
and household sectors. Strikes will also disrupt the French economy
during the next few weeks. While the focal point of the market's
EMU concerns during recent days has been Spain and Italy, <I>it
is important to remember that monetary union could still be derailed
if the French economy fails to improve during the next few quarters.</I>
France will not be able to achieve its budget targets without
an economic upturn in 1997. The Juppe government could also suffer
major parliamentary losses in the 1998 parliamentary elections
if the economy fails to improve. Indeed, President Chriac will
probably abandon Mr. Juppe next spring if French unemployment
continues to increase.
<P>
Japan will hold elections for its national parliament (the Diet)
on October 20th. On the basis of current opinion polls, the LDP
will probably emerge as the dominant party again and may even
win an outright majority. As with New Zealand, the coming Japanese
election will be the first to be held under a system of proportional
representation. As a result, the old post-1955 division between
an entrenched LDP majority and a permanent socialist minority
will give way to a new equilibrium with two large centrist parties,
one moderate sized centrist party and a few fringe parties. If
the LDP fails to win a majority, it will have to form a coalition
with the small centrist party or persuade members of the other
large centrist party to defect. As the other parties have campaigned
for delaying next year's consumption tax hike and pursuing more
aggressive administrative reform than the LDP is advocating, such
a coalition would probably have a more positive impact on forecasts
of Japan' intermediate term growth outlook than a clear LDP majority.
<I>In fact, with the Japanese current account surplus now showing
signs of recovery, there is a risk that the return of a one party
LDP government could set the stage for renewed friction between
Washington and Tokyo over whether Japan is pursuing sufficient
macroeocnomic stimulus and microeconomic reform to stabilize the
trade surplus at moderate levels. </I>
<P>
The major case for a further large correction of the dollar against
the yen is the need for Japanese financial institutions to boost
the yields on their investment portfolios. The Japanese corporate
sector has a funding deficiency in its system of retirement savings
equal to about 25% of corporate equity. Japanese life insurance
companies have to generate a yield of at least 3.6% in order to
satisfy their policy holders while the yield on Japanese money
market assets is only 50 basis points. As a result of the constraints
on earning higher yields from Japanese assets, the most obvious
way for Japanese investment institutions to enhance their portfolio
return is to purchase more foreign debt and equities. There was
strong Japanese demand for U.S .bonds during August but this could
change quickly if there is any hint that the Clinton administration
will modify its exchange rate policy after the election. The White
House has favored a strong dollar since mid-1995 in order to lessen
the risk of a financial meltdown in Japan and encourage strong
foreign demand for U.S. securities at a time when the current
account deficit is still large. While the current exchange rate
policy should remain intact through the next few months, there
are many people in Washington who believe that deliberate dollar
depreciation/yen appreciation is an effective instrument for forcing
Japan to pursue more expansionary macroeconomics policies and
structural reform. They will not remain silent if the Japanese
trade surplus resumes widening during 1997 against a background
of static economic policy under a revitalized LDP.
<P>
<I><B>To summarize</B></I>, the resilience of financial markets
in countries as diverse as New Zealand, the Ukraine and Italy
during recent weeks confirms that the world is awash with surplus
liquidity and that investors have a robust appetite for increasing
risk in order to earn higher returns. The global financial markets
have not been in such a speculative mood since the second half
of 1993. The major threat to this new financial euphoria would
be a resurgence of U.S. output growth during the fourth quarter
which compelled the Fed to raise interest rates by 25-50 basis
points. There also could be a correction if President Clinton
wins re-election on a scale large enough to elect a Democratic
Congress with a house majority of 25 seats or more, but as the
New Zealand election demonstrates, investors might even downplay
the risks poised by a Democratic Congress on the grounds that
politicians have lost their ability to pursue policies hostile
to investors in the new global order of unrestricted electronic
transmission of information and capital. Ironically, though, the
election of a pro-business LDP government in Japan could set the
stage for new yen/dollar tensions during 1997 if it encourages
renewed complacency about microeconomic reform in Japan against
the backdrop of a resurgent trade surplus.

September 26, 1996</I>

<P>
<B>The Bank of France is a potentially interesting candidate for
revenue enhancement because it currently has one of the lowest
rates of profitability of all European central banks.</B>  Its
balance sheet has assets of $143 billion compared to $234 billion
for the Bundesbank, $193 billion for the Bank of Italy, and $114.5
billion for the Bank of Spain.  Yet, the after-tax profits of
the Bank of France were only $280 million during 1995 compared
to $7.6 billion for the Bundesbank, $443 million for the Bank
of Italy and $1.8 billion for the Bank of Spain.  Despite much
smaller balance sheets, the central banks of Holland, Britain
and Austria also produced much larger profits than the Bank of
France.
<P>
It is difficult to compare central banks across national borders
because of differences in their functions and responsibilities.
 The Federal Reserve, for example, employs 23,700 people because
it manages the U.S. check clearing system while the Bank of England
has turned over such functions to the private sector.  Some European
countries have their central banks engage in bank supervision
while others turn it over to independent agencies.  Some central
banks may also subsidize their commercial banks by undercharging
for certain services compared to the central banks of other countries.
<P>
The Bank of France could be a tempting target for rationalization
because it is so labor intensive (17,632 employees) in relation
to the size of the French economy and a recent study found that
the cost of producing bank notes is four times higher in France
than in Britain.  France also has not taken advantage of the new
gold leasing market developed by the Bank of England to obtain
rental income for its gold nor has it attempted to boost its profits
by realizing some of the large holding gains on its gold stock.
<P>
Before World War Two, many European central banks were owned by
private investors and thus had to be sensitive to investor pressure
for dividends.  Today, only two central banks still have private
shareholders, the Bank of Japan and the Bank for International
Settlements.  The Bank of Japan has almost 4,000 shareholders
who own about 49% of the bank's equity.  The stock rose sharply
during the late 1980's when the government was privatizing other
state enterprises but it then declined by nearly two thirds during
the 1990's Tokyo bear market.  As the Bank of Japan distributes
only 5 million yen of its 700 million yen of profits as dividends,
investors have lost interest in the stock and it now sells at
a 90% discount to book value.  The Bank of International Settlements
is a central bank for other central banks and trades on the Swiss
stock exchanges.  As it has a large portfolio of gold, its share
price often correlates with the gold price but its current share
price is still equal to only about one half of its potential asset
value.  After the nationalization of other central banks during
the late 1940's, issues such as shareholder accountability and
profitability ceased to be discussed.  But with many European
countries now moving towards monetary union it is difficult to
believe that governments will remain insensitive to the huge resources
which their central banks now have available to them.
<P>
The five central banks which will be at the core of monetary union
in 1997 (France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Austria) have collective
assets of $480 billion and 46,934 employees.  The five other European
countries which are strong candidates to join the EM by 2002 (Italy,
Finland, Ireland, Spain, Portugal) have an aggregate balance sheet
of $356 billion and employment of 22,291.  Hence if all nine banks
were to merge, they would have collective assets of $837 billion
and total employment of 69,225 compared to the Federal Reserve's
assets of $410 billion and employment of 23,727 and the Bank of
Japan's assets of $453 billion and employment of 6,300.
<P>
Under the Maastricht Treaty, the countries of Europe will continue
to have independent central banks with voting rights on the council
of the new European central bank.  These central banks will also
continue to have control over a large share of their countries
foreign exchange reserves.  But in view of the pressure for reducing
public sector deficits which exists in Europe today, it is difficult
to believe that the central banks of Europe can remain immune
to the fiscal austerity engulfing other government institutions.
<P>
In addition to rationalizing their central bank operations through
staff cuts, some European countries should consider introducing
radical changes in their systems of monetary control during the
transition to EMU in order to enhance investor confidence in their
convergence prospects.   <B>Estonia's monetary regime could provide
an interesting role model for countries in a long transition to
EMU, such as Italy, as well as for countries outside of  EMU which
want to maintain a strong exchange rate link  to the new European
currency.</B>  In 1992, Estonia established a currency board which
has evolved into one of the most successful monetary regimes in
the world.  At present, Estonia has nominal interest rates of
only 8-9% despite an inflation rate of 17-18% and a current account
deficit equal to 6-7% of GDP.  The central bank is also highly
profitable and employs only 300 people.  After adjusting for loan
loss reserves to offset bad debts purchased during the banking
crisis which followed independence, the Estonian central bank
should earn a profit of $15-20 million on an asset base of $650-700
million this year.  Countries such as Italy and Spain, which are
strongly committed to EMU but may not qualify until the early
years of the next century should give serious consideration to
converting their central banks into de facto currency boards linked
to the new European currency.  If the markets took the currency
board regime seriously, their interest rates would fall sharply
and thus accelerate the process of deficit reduction.  It is possible
that Spain and Portugal will be able to achieve sufficient deficit
reduction to qualify for EMU in 1997, but their odds of success
would improve if they introduced an interim monetary regimes which
enjoyed so much investor credibility that their interest rates
fell sharply during 1997 and 1998.  The ratio of public debt to
GDP in many European countries is now so high that it will be
difficult to achieve small fiscal deficits without large interest
rate declines.
<P>
<I><B>To summarize</B></I>, if the U.S. economy shows signs of
reviving to a growth rate in excess of 3.0% after the third quarter
slowdown, the odds are high that the Federal Reserve will raise
interest rates again.  Fed tightening could come as early as the
October 4th employment report or it could be delayed until the
mid-November FOMC meeting.  The buoyancy of consumer confidence
and the U.S. equity markets suggests that the third quarter slowdown
in final sales will be temporary but there is sufficient disagreement
about the outlook that the Federal Reserve will want confirmation
of resilient final demand before it tightens.  The French government
has been successful in selling its budget strategy to the markets
because investors had become so pessimistic about the prospects
for deficit reduction during the summer that they regarded the
new budget as a positive surprise.  But investor confidence in
the outlook for European monetary union could fade again if the
French economy stalls during the fourth quarter or there is widespread
public hostility to the government's fiscal austerity.  France
will have parliamentary elections in ealry 1998 and economic policy
will not remain static in the face of conitnuing recession.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 2, 1996</I>

<P>

The Bank of Japan's Tankan survey has further lessened the risk of Japanese monetary policy being tightened this autumn.  The survey showed a small decline in business confidence compared to widespread expectations that it would continue the uptrend which began late last year.  The survey indicates that Japan's manufacturing inventory adjustment is not yet over and that growth during the second half of 1996 will be far more subdued than it was during the first half.  The yen/dollar rate has been stable during recent weeks, but the MOF will probably attempt to encourage renewed dollar strength during the run-up to the IMF meetings in early October.  
<P>
The recovery of Robert Dole in the opinion polls  after the Republican convention and the selection of Jack Kemp as his vice-presidential running mate has helped to lessen investor concern about a potential Democratic sweep of both the presidential and congressional elections.  While the President continues to enjoy nearly a ten point lead over Mr. Dole, the Republicans are now only slightly behind the Democrats in opinion polls for the congress.
<P>
The decision of Mr. Dole to link his campaign so firmly to the theme of tax cuts suggests that if he scores an upset victory in the November election, the dollar will probably rally in expectation of the U.S. experiencing a replay of the fiscal policy of the early Reagan years. 
<P>
Investors remember that during the early 1980's the dollar rose sharply because the expansion of the federal deficit against the backdrop of a restrictive monetary policy required the U.S. to become a large scale capital importer.  It is doubtful, though that the Dole fiscal policy will have nearly as dramatic an impact on the dollar as the Reagan fiscal policy.  
<P>
First, under current law, no administration can enact a tax cut unless there are offsetting spending cuts.  This law was enacted in order to force the Congress to adhere to long-term targets for deficit reduction and it is doubtful that a president as cautious about fiscal policy as Mr. Dole would repeal it.  Indeed, the threat of a bond market collapse would probably constrain Congress from repealing the law even if the Dole-Kemp administration decided to revert to a high deficit fiscal policy.  The ratio of federal debt to GDP in the U.S. is now about 55% compared to only 28% when Mr. Reagan took office, so the initial conditions for a major fiscal reflation are much less suitable than they were in 1981. 
<P>
Secondly, the Dole administration has a broad based economic growth agenda of which personal tax cuts are only one part.  The Dole program is also committed to reducing the cost of government regulation and the legal system on U.S. business, slashing capital gains taxes and slowing the growth of Federal spending.  If the Dole program encourages corporations to invest more aggressively, interest rates could rise because of strong demand for capital in the private sector, not increased government borrowing.  But, as the Dole program has far more modest tax incentives for investment than the Reagan program of 1981, it will probably only have a modest impact on private capital demands and interest rates.  The Reagan program directly subsidized investment through large increases in depreciation allowances whereas the Dole program is focused on capital gains relief and regulatory reform.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
July 29, 1996</I>

<P>
<I>Most other industrial countries are deeply envious of the U.S.
labor market.</I>  In April, a German business magazine published
a cover story about how Germany should regard the U.S. economy
as a role model for labor market reform.  The cover showed a picture
of Chancellor Kohl (a man who weighs well over 200 pounds) trying
to squeeze into an Uncle Sam costume.  Shortly after the article
appeared, Chancellor Kohl announced several measures to encourage
job creation, including reduced payroll taxes and a proposal to
abolish many expensive government regulations on firms which employ
ten workers or less.  Under the previous law, such rules applied
to firms  employing more than 5 people.  In the U.S., by contrast,
firms are not subject to many federal labor laws until their total
employment exceeds 50 workers.
<P>
The U.S. needs new government policies to improve educational
opportunity while corporations should attempt to broaden employee
participation in stock option programs, but attempts to impose
new regulations on the labor market will be counter productive
to job creation without necessarily reducing wage inequality.
 As education in the U.S. is primarily a responsibility of state
and local governments, it will be difficult for Washington based
politicians to have much impact on the quality of education without
providing much greater federal funding or structural reforms to
promote more competition for the delivery of what is still a monopoly
public good in most communities.
<P>
<I>Several factors suggest that the Republicans should improve
their standing in the opinion polls during September.</I>  Aside
from convention publicity, they will be free from the official
restrictions on campaign spending which were imposed on Mr. Dole
because of his large outlays during the primary season.  Mr. Dole
is also starting to develop more effective campaign themes, such
as school vouchers and tax allowances for small business.  While
these themes will not resolve his problem with highly divisive
issues such as abortion, they should help to energize constituencies
who voted Republican during the 1980's.
<P>
The Clinton personal and financial scandals in Arkansas also will
continue to be a wildcard in the political outlook.  They have
not been a major factor yet because of Mr. Clinton's unique personal
circumstances compared to other presidents.  As Arkansas is perceived
to be a poor corrupt state, many people discount the Clinton financial
scandals as a natural outcome of the state's potential culture.
 As Mrs. Clinton is the most assertive first lady in the history
of the presidency, many male voters believe the president should
be entitled to have mistresses.  What remains unclear is whether
this tolerance for scandals will persist when voters actually
enter the polling booth.  The comments of Mr. Ken Starr to the
media could also have an important effect on voter attitudes.
 If he gives the impression that he might indict Mrs. Clinton
or the president next year, voters could turn against the president
in order to avoid a repetition of the paralysis which crippled
the government during Mr. Nixon's second term.
<P>
While the opinion polls suggest that the Democrats have an opportunity
to recapture the House, four factors suggest the Republicans should
be able to hold onto a small majority.  First, they have raised
a great deal of money and attracted many strong new candidates
as a result of their victory in 1994.  Secondly, many Democratic
incumbents will retire in the south and at least 15-20 of those
seats are potentially good prospects for a Republican takeover.
 Thirdly, there is a significant risk that the election for ten
congressional seats in Texas will be delayed until December in
order to redraw the boundaries to eliminate radical gerry-mandening.
Eight of the ten seats are Democratic seats with good Republican
potential for a take-over.  The delay in the congressional elections
could boost Republican victory prospects by depressing the turnout.
  In special elections, only committed voters turn out compared
to an average of 50-60% for presidential elections.  Finally,
the odds are high that there will be a conservative third party
in the presidential race offering Mr. Ross Perot as its candidate.
 As the Reform Party will not have any congressional candidates,
its voters will probably support the Republicans in most house
races.
<P>
The U.S. dollar fell sharply during July because of the decline
in U.S. bond and equity prices.  The D-mark also benefited from
the failure of the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates at its
pre-vacation meeting in late July.
<P>
As the U.S. economy is enjoying buoyant growth while the economies
of Germany and Japan are much less dynamic, <i>the only factor
which appears capable of producing a sustained dollar correction
is investor concern about the upcoming U.S. elections.  The Bundesbank
appears to have been deadlocked on a rate cut in late July because
several social democratic members of the council missed the meeting</I>.
 When they return in late August, the odds will increase of a
vote to ease further.  Recent Japanese economic data point to
a moderation in that country's growth rate after the spurt to
a 13% growth rate during the first quarter.  Government officials
also have gone out of their way to stress that the Bank of Japan
will not raise interest rates for several months.  Despite the
upturn in GDP growth during the first quarter, Japan continues
to suffer from severe credit quality problems in its banking system
and there are recurring rumors of new bank failures.  As Japanese
officials would be quite happy to see the yen depreciation to
the 110-115 range, they will not feel any impulsion to raise interest
rates even if the Federal Reserve hikes U.S. interest rates by
50 basis points during the next few months.  As a result of these
factors, the dollar should stabilize once U.S. securities market
establish a viable trading range and could rally if U.S. asset
markets bottom in the near future.
<P>
<I><B>To summarize, </B></I>the U.S. economy appears likely to
expand at a 3.0-3.5% annual rate during the third quarter or a
level about 1.0% above the Fed's perception of the economy's non-inflationary
growth rate.  As the unemployment rate is only 5.3% and there
are increasing signs of wage acceleration in the economy, the
odds are high that the Fed will decide to raise interest rates
during August in order to insure that output growth slows to the
2.0-2.5% rate by the fourth quarter.  The Fed tightening, coupled
with investor concern about this autumn's elections for the presidency
and the Congress, could produce a stock market correction during
the third quarter but such an adjustment is preferable to a larger
and more dramatic adjustment during the autumn if the Fed defers
tightening and then has to change its mind.  The poor showing
of Robert Dole in the opinion polls is increasing investor concern
about the Republicans losing control of the Congress but several
factors suggest the Republicans should be able to retain the House
and Senate even if Dole runs several percentage points behind
Clinton.  The dollar is vulnerable to continuing weakness in U.S.
bond and equity prices but it could improve during the late summer
when the Bundesbank finally lowers interest rates.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
June 21, 1996</I>

<P>
While many western commentators believe that Russia has a cultural
history which will discourage entrepreneurship and establishment
of a successful private sector, <B>it is important to remember
that Russia was a high growth economy during the decade before
the First World War.</B> With her large natural resource endowment
and well educated population, Russia should be able to duplicate
the 6-7% growth rates now apparent in Poland, Estonia, and other
former communist countries in eastern Europe. But such take-off
will not happen without further action to address core structural
problems, such as the integrity of the tax system and government
agencies in general. There will probably also be a debate about
whether the strength of the ruble is discouraging exports and
boosting imports excessively. After the devaluation of 1992, the
ruble stood at barely 10% of its purchasing power parity with
the dollar. At the end of 1995, it was 65% of its PPP value against
the dollar and it will probably soon reach a level equal to 75-80%
of its PPP value against the dollar. As Russian industry is still
in the midst of a major restructuring and trying to develop export
markets to compensate for the collapse of domestic spending, there
will probably be a powerful lobby arguing for a larger devaluation
of the ruble than Mr. Yeltsin's policy team and the IMF have so
far advocated.
<P>
As a result of the economic upturn now occurring in both the G-7
countries and the developing countries adversely affected by Mexico's
1995 financial crisis, the world economy should enjoy a growth
rate in excess of 4.0% this year for the first time since 1988.
As the recovery in Europe and Japan is much less mature than the
six year old recovery in the U.S., there is no reason why global
output growth should not remain above 4.0% next year as well.
<P>
<B>The global scope of the current upturn is reviving concerns
last heard during 1994 about the adequacy of global savings to
finance a resurgence of investment in the old-industrial countries
as well as the emerging market economies which now encompass about
45% of the world' output, 70% of its land area, and 85% of its
population.</B> The world economy's major source of surplus savings
during recent years has been the current account surplus of east
Asia while its largest consumer of savings has been the western
hemisphere. In 1995, Japan had a current account surplus of $110
billion, China had a current account surplus of $16 billion, Singapore
had a surplus of $11 billion and Taiwan had a surplus of $5 billion
compared to an aggregate current account deficit of $40 billion
in Korea and the other countries of Asean. In the western hemisphere,
by contrast, the U.S. and Canada had a current account deficit
of $160 billion while Latin America ran a deficit of $28 billion.
Latin America's deficit fell sharply from $45 billion during 1994
because of the Mexican crisis but Brazil, Columbia and Peru expanded
their borrowing modestly. Europe is far closer to financial equilibrium
than either Asia or the western hemisphere. Germany and Britain
had a current account deficit of $27 billion last year but this
was more than offset by current account surpluses of $27 billion
in the Benelux countries, $17 billion in France and $20 billion
in Italy.
<P>
In 1996, there will be large declines in the current account surpluses
of Japan and China while the deficit of the western hemisphere
will probably remain unchanged. The deficit of the U.S. will shrink
modestly but Latin America will expand its borrowing. The only
offset to the reduced surplus of east Asia will be a larger surplus
in Western Europe as the deficit of Germany shrinks while the
surpluses of other countries linger at high levels. But with eastern
Europe and Russia now poised for faster growth, the Visegard countries
will probably run a current account deficit of $8-10 while Russia
could shift from a large external surplus in 1995 to a small deficit
next by 1997.
<P>
The heavy emphasis on reduction of government borrowing in the
major industrial countries today suggests the coming shift in
the composition of the world's balance of payments should pose
fewer interest rate risks than the world economic upturn which
occurred during 1994 . <B>But the revival of capital flows to
Latin America, the large external deficits of the traditional
high savings societies of southeast Asia and the re-appearance
of eastern Europe as a major borrower indicates that some of the
upward pressure on real interest rates this year is a response
to changes in the global savings and investment balance, not just
concerns about rising inflation.</B> As a result of the Mexican
crisis many developing countries in Latin America and elsewhere
are putting much greater emphasis on boosting their domestic savings
rates and thus reducing their need for external capital. But it
is still unclear if savings rates will rise rapidly enough during
the next few years to satisfy all of the capital demands which
will develop as the global business cycle matures.
<P>
<I><B>To summarize</B></I>, the strength of U.S. data for employment,
retail sales and industrial production have increased the odds
that the Federal Reserve will hike short-term interest rates by
25 basis points this summer. The hike could also come in between
the next two FOMC meetings in order to avoid a conflict with the
Democratic National Convention in late August. The U.S. economy
will probably grow at a 3.5-4.5% annual rate during the third
quarter and hold in a growth range close to 3.0% during the second
half of the year. Inflation will not accelerate dramatically but
another three quarters of above trend growth would reduce unemployment
to 4.0% and encourage a revival of industrial commodity prices.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
February 29, 1996</I>

<P>

The growth rate of the U.S. economy slowed to only about 0.9% during the fourth quarter from 3.6% during the third quarter and 0.6% during the first half of the year.
<P>

<B>The most distressing feature of the fourth quarter report was the weakness of domestic final sales.</B> They expanded at only a 0.6% annual rate compared to 2.6% during the third quarter. But the fourth quarter data was depressed by special factors which should reverse during the first half of 1996. The Boeing strike produced a 10% decline in aircraft spending. Real federal government spending fell at a 12% annual rate because of the government shutdown late in the year. The government shut-down probably also contributed to weakness in private spending which requires government authorization, such as construction projects in environmentally sensitive areas of the west and exports of high technology goods with military potential.
<P>

On the basis of preliminary data, one of the weakest sectors of the economy during the fourth quarter was consumer spending. It grew at an annual rate of only 0.8% compared to 2.8% during the third quarter and 3.4% during the second quarter. But newly revised retail sales suggests that the growth rate of consumer spending was probably about 1.3% while the weakness of spending was heavily concentrated in October. January retail sales fell sharply because of severe weather and the shutdown of several federal agencies during the previous month (furloughed workers lost their paychecks for several weeks) but survey data for February suggests that consumer spending is now improving. If consumer spending is recovering, the economy should be able to complete its inventory adjustment during the current quarter and return to a growth rate of 2.0-3.0% during the second quarter.
<P>

Surveys of business confidence suggest that the corporate sector remains confident despite the weakness of the economy during the fourth quarter. According to the latest Dun and Bradstreet survey, corporate executives expect sales to improve during April after three months of weakness recently. The D&#38;B survey of new orders rose to 48 in January from 45 in December and 33 in November. Surveys of small business confidence are also generally positive. The January survey of National Federation of Independent Business noted,
<P>

<I>"The index of Small Business Optimism dropped 2.5 points in December from its highest reading in the expansion. The December reading of 101.5 is just 0.4 points below the average for the year of 101.9. The November 'sales bubble' burst in December and sales slipped to a mediocre level. The strong fourth quarter of 1994, which saw a good Christmas shopping season, culminated a year in which 3.3 million net new jobs were formed. Although the economy stayed close to this high employment level, it was not able to follow with yet another strong year of job creation in spite of record-high hiring plans in January. Without the buying power generated by the same volume of <B>new</B> paychecks, it was unlikely that the 1995 holiday season could significantly better the 1994 season in <B>nominal dollar terms</B>. But <B>in real terms</B>, the 1995 season might actually be better than 1994 because year-over-year, there was probably zero retail price inflation."</I>
<P>

The resilience of the small business sector is important because it accounts for most of the employment creation in the U.S. economy. The Manpower Employment Survey is cautious about hiring during the second quarter but in the NFIB survey, small business continues to report labor scarcity in many regions. Twenty-two percent of small firms have jobs which are hard to fill.
<P>

The buoyancy of U.S. financial markets should help to bolster consumer and business spending. The household sector has become a major beneficiary of rising equity prices because of its large holdings of mutual funds. In January, it owned $1.3 trillion of equity mutual funds compared to $418 billion in early 1992 and $811 billion of bond funds compared to $449 billion in early 1992. The total value of savings accounts, small time deposits, and retail money market funds, by contrast, is $2.597 trillion. <B>The mutual fund industry has grown so dramatically during recent years that its assets excluding money market funds will soon exceed the $2.3 trillion of assets in the country's national banks.</B> If we include retail money market funds, the mutual fund industry is now larger than the national banking system. 
<P>

The growth of the mutual fund industry has resulted from both changes in household savings flows and stock market appreciation. In January, the market capitalization of America's 7551 listed companies (including preferred stock) was about $6.63 trillion compared to $5 trillion (6925 companies) in January, 1994 and $3.957 trillion (5608 companies) in January 1992. <B>The ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP has risen to 87.5% compared to a previous all time high of 81.0% in 1929 and a post war peak of 79.0% in 1968.</B> The all time trough of stock market capitalization to GDP was 16.0% in 1941 while in the post war era it was 30% in 1974 and 1982. The average ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP since 1926 has been 48.0%. At first glance, the U.S. market appears to be as frothy as the Tokyo market in the late 1980's, when Japan's ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP rose to 130% from an average of 20-30% during the 1970's and early 1980's (this about 65% today). But since the U.S. corporate sector now has about one fifth of its output in other countries, the ratio of stock market capitalization of GDP should probably be adjusted to include the $1.6 trillion of sales which U.S. firms have in other countries. <B>If we adjust the U.S. market capitalization/GDP ratio for foreign sales, it drops to about 74% from 87.5%.</B> This ratio is still high but the fact remains that U.S. firms now have global sales opportunities on a scale unprecedented in economic history. At the peak of the Tokyo bull market, by contrast, Japanese firms had only about 7% of their output in foreign countries.
<P>

American investment spending will also benefit from rising equity prices by lowering the cost of business capital. At present, the ratio of equity prices to asset replacement costs for U.S. firms is about 1.7 or the highest level ever recorded in the modern era. The high value of equity in the U.S. stock market makes it possible for firms to finance new capital spending on attractive terms while enhancing the appeal of greenfield investment compared to corporate takeover activity.
<P>

<B>Inventory spending will probably be a drag on the economy during the first quarter but it should turn into a positive growth stimulant during the second quarter.</B> In the fourth quarter, firms reduced the rate of real non-farm inventory accumulation to $23.6 billion from $38.3 billion during the third quarter and $33.8 billion during the second quarter. The weakness of the purchasing agent survey during January suggests that real non-farm inventory accumulation could decline further during the first quarter of 1996. The total index fell to 44.2 from 46.0 during January while the new order component slid to 41.8 from 45.4. The inventory index increased to 47.7 from 44.2 but it is difficult to imagine that such gains were voluntary at a time when final demand was depressed by the weather and the federal government shut-down. Manufacturing inventories rose during the fourth quarter while retail and wholesale inventories fell. The weakness of final sales during January suggests that manufacturing inventories should decline further during the first quarter.
<P>

The major new risk facing the economy is rising bond yields. They have increased sharply because of investor concern about the fragmentation of the Republican Party in recent primaries, the apparent collapse of deficit reduction talks in Washington, and the disappointment of some aggressive investors about the economy avoiding a full scale recession this spring. If bond yields continue to increase, mortgage rates will rise, depressing the upturn which should occur in housing and consumer spending on furniture and appliances this spring.
<P>

<B>The February Blue Chip survey of the economic consensus continues to show a remarkable unanimity of views among private sector forecasters.</B> The average forecast for output growth in 1996 is 2.0% with the ten most optimistic analysts projecting a gain of 2.5% and the ten most pessimistic expecting a gain of 1.4%. In January, by contrast, the average forecast for 1996 projected 2.2% output growth. Analysts have lowered their 1996 forecasts because of downward revisions in growth estimates of the fourth quarter of 1995 as well as the first quarter of this year. In 1997, the consensus projects that output growth will accelerate to 2.1%. The ten most optimistic analysts are projecting 2.6% output growth compared to 1.6% for the ten most pessimistic.
<P>

The primary factor holding most private sector growth forecasts close to 2.0% is the perception of analysts that the economy has achieved full employment and thus can sustain output growth only slightly above 2.0% if inflation is going to remain below 3.0%. If analyst perceived that the economy had more supply potential, they would probably boost their growth forecasts but since the latest GDP revisions lowered estimates of the U.S. economy's recent growth performance <B>most forecasters are even more cautious about the economy's growth potential today than they were six months ago.</B>

<I>Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>





The next major test of the mutual fund industry will probably come when the world economy enjoys such a prolonged boom that inflation revives to a level which compels the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy by more than it did during 1994.  The Fed doubled the level of U.S. short-term interest rates two years ago but real interest rates did not exceed 3.0% and the economy slowed so abruptly in the months after the Mexican financial crisis that the Fed was able to ease interest rates during the summer of 1995.  If, by contrast, the economy had remained strong through 1995, short-term interest rates might have risen to 7.0-8.0% and provoked far larger redemptions in bond funds as well as a correction in the equity market large enough to encourage net redemptions of equity funds.

<P>

In the modern era, the primary channel through which monetary policy influenced the economy was the housing market.  In the era of Regulation Q ceilings on interest rates, monetary tightening would divert savings flows from thrift institutions and choke off  the supply of mortgage funds for housing.  After deregulation of the thrift industry, the Fed slowed the economy by pushing up interest rates to levels which depressed the demand for money in all sectors.  Such monetary tightening also sometimes encouraged dollar appreciation which increased the trade deficit.  As a result of the household sector's growing exposure to the stock and bond markets through mutual funds, changes in the value of household equity portfolios could emerge as a more important channel for monetary policy to influence the economy than in the past.  Most econometric research has shown a weak link between consumer spending and stock market fluctuations because of the heavy concentration of equity ownership in the top 10% of the population as measured by wealth, but the parameters of this relationship could gradually change if equities continue to expand as a share of household assets and ownership becomes more diffused throughout the population.  At present, the group which is probably most sensitive to the stock market driven changes in wealth is the households over the age of 65.  They own far more equity than any other group and have little wage and salary income.  In the past, they were referred to as fixed income people but as a result of the buoyant performance of financial markets compared to real wages during recent years, it is now people in their 20's and 30's, not senior citizens, who could be more accurately described as having fixed incomes.  Younger households can share in the wealth gains of the older generation through bequests but on the basis of current demographic tables only about 5.7% of corporate equity is bequeathed over a five year period compared to 24.4% over a fifteen year period.  During the past two year, households over the age of 65 have enjoyed an equity capital gain of about $250 billion compared to $125 billion for people in the age group 35-44 years and $196 billion for people in the age group 45-54 years.
Two months after Alan Greenspan became Federal Reserve chairman in 1987, the New York stock exchange experienced its largest one day correction since 1929 and the Dow fell by over 23%.  Since 1990, the New York market has enjoyed a seven year bull run without experiencing even the modest 5-10% corrections typical of past bull markets.  Mr. Greenspan's attempt to pursue a policy of monetary fine tuning rather than large and abrupt changes in the level of interest rates certainly has contributed to the market's good performance since 1990 but he has also enjoyed the benefits of a sustained period of global disinflation.  In the 1970's, by contrast, inflation shot up to double digit levels on two occasions because of oil price shocks, global crop failures, and the cost pass through pricing policies which characterized the U.S. corporate sector before the 1980's.

<P>

Not coincidentally, the global economic forces which have restrained inflation and boosted equity prices during recent years also have played a role in encouraging the economic anxieties about stagnant real wages and corporate restructuring which helped to produce victories for Patrick Buchanan in the early Republican primaries.  Many of the voters who have suffered from wage stagnation or job losses have not enjoyed compensating gains from rising equity prices despite the boom in mutual fund ownership.  At present, only 13% of U.S. workers belong to profit sharing plans and just 3% are enrolled in Employee Stock Ownership Plans.  There are even striking class divisions in the membership of 401-K plans.  About 46% of white collar workers belong to 401-K plans while only 26% of blue collar workers are enrolled in such plans.  The unequal sharing in the benefits of corporate rationalization and disinflation creates the risk of a political backlash against business and demands for more interventionist government policies to protect the interests of company stakeholders (employees, etc.), not just stockholders.  If the corporate sector wants to contain such political pressures, it should attempt to promote share ownership among the people who have not yet found their way into the equity market through mutual funds by promoting more widespread use of ESOP's.  In the past, trade unions opposed ESOP's and profit sharing but during the past decade some unions have turned to ESOP's in order to promote employee takeovers of troubled companies.  The major barriers to expanding ESOP membership in the 1990's have been the reluctance of workers to accept the double jeopardy of committing capital to the same firm where they work (they naturally prefer more diversification of risk), reduced tax benefits, and disagreements about how large a role workers should have in a company's management as their share of its equity expands.  More universal ownership of equity would not resolve all of the concerns about eroding real wages and job insecurity now plaguing America's labor force but it would at least help to contain the politics of envy now stirring in the U.S. presidential election campaign.  If envy emerges as a dominant theme in this year's election, the financial press will soon be carrying stories about the risks posed to the U.S. economy from household wealth losses in the stock market, not just stagnant real wages.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
October 21, 1996</I>

<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/areworld4_subhead.gif" 
ALT="Will the Japanese Election Alter Perceptions of the Optimal
Yen Rate?"><BR>

There has been such a broad based global rally in equity and bond
prices during recent weeks that the strength of Wall Street has
not had a major impact on the value of the dollar.
<P>
Buying and selling of the D-mark in response to changing perceptions
of the outlook for European monetary union has driven fluctuations
in the dollar/D-mark rate, not economic developments in the U.S.
itself.<I> The monetary union factor is likely to remain the dominant
influence on the D-mark for many months to come.</I> If the Russian
political situation deteriorates significantly in the aftermath
of Mr. Lebed's dismissal, there could be broad based selling of
European currencies but the market may ultimately respond positively
to the Lebed dismissal if it bolsters the odds of Mr. Chernomyrdin
replacing Mr. Yeltsin in the event that his health deteriorate
further. Mr. Lebed has little support in the military and his
positive showing in the recent presidential election resulted
from Mr. Yeltsin's financial backers giving him a boost in the
final weeks of the campaign. Russia has many new wealthy people
and they will rally around the current prime minister or mayor
of Moscow in the next presidential election.
<P>
The most recent German economic data confirms that the economy
experienced a healthy upturn during the third quarter, but French
data continues to show depressed confidence in both the corporate
and household sectors. Strikes will also disrupt the French economy
during the next few weeks. While the focal point of the market's
EMU concerns during recent days has been Spain and Italy, <I>it
is important to remember that monetary union could still be derailed
if the French economy fails to improve during the next few quarters.</I>
France will not be able to achieve its budget targets without
an economic upturn in 1997. The Juppe government could also suffer
major parliamentary losses in the 1998 parliamentary elections
if the economy fails to improve. Indeed, President Chriac will
probably abandon Mr. Juppe next spring if French unemployment
continues to increase.
<P>
Japan will hold elections for its national parliament (the Diet)
on October 20th. On the basis of current opinion polls, the LDP
will probably emerge as the dominant party again and may even
win an outright majority. As with New Zealand, the coming Japanese
election will be the first to be held under a system of proportional
representation. As a result, the old post-1955 division between
an entrenched LDP majority and a permanent socialist minority
will give way to a new equilibrium with two large centrist parties,
one moderate sized centrist party and a few fringe parties. If
the LDP fails to win a majority, it will have to form a coalition
with the small centrist party or persuade members of the other
large centrist party to defect. As the other parties have campaigned
for delaying next year's consumption tax hike and pursuing more
aggressive administrative reform than the LDP is advocating, such
a coalition would probably have a more positive impact on forecasts
of Japan' intermediate term growth outlook than a clear LDP majority.
<I>In fact, with the Japanese current account surplus now showing
signs of recovery, there is a risk that the return of a one party
LDP government could set the stage for renewed friction between
Washington and Tokyo over whether Japan is pursuing sufficient
macroeocnomic stimulus and microeconomic reform to stabilize the
trade surplus at moderate levels. </I>
<P>
The major case for a further large correction of the dollar against
the yen is the need for Japanese financial institutions to boost
the yields on their investment portfolios. The Japanese corporate
sector has a funding deficiency in its system of retirement savings
equal to about 25% of corporate equity. Japanese life insurance
companies have to generate a yield of at least 3.6% in order to
satisfy their policy holders while the yield on Japanese money
market assets is only 50 basis points. As a result of the constraints
on earning higher yields from Japanese assets, the most obvious
way for Japanese investment institutions to enhance their portfolio
return is to purchase more foreign debt and equities. There was
strong Japanese demand for U.S .bonds during August but this could
change quickly if there is any hint that the Clinton administration
will modify its exchange rate policy after the election. The White
House has favored a strong dollar since mid-1995 in order to lessen
the risk of a financial meltdown in Japan and encourage strong
foreign demand for U.S. securities at a time when the current
account deficit is still large. While the current exchange rate
policy should remain intact through the next few months, there
are many people in Washington who believe that deliberate dollar
depreciation/yen appreciation is an effective instrument for forcing
Japan to pursue more expansionary macroeconomics policies and
structural reform. They will not remain silent if the Japanese
trade surplus resumes widening during 1997 against a background
of static economic policy under a revitalized LDP.
<P>
<I><B>To summarize</B></I>, the resilience of financial markets
in countries as diverse as New Zealand, the Ukraine and Italy
during recent weeks confirms that the world is awash with surplus
liquidity and that investors have a robust appetite for increasing
risk in order to earn higher returns. The global financial markets
have not been in such a speculative mood since the second half
of 1993. The major threat to this new financial euphoria would
be a resurgence of U.S. output growth during the fourth quarter
which compelled the Fed to raise interest rates by 25-50 basis
points. There also could be a correction if President Clinton
wins re-election on a scale large enough to elect a Democratic
Congress with a house majority of 25 seats or more, but as the
New Zealand election demonstrates, investors might even downplay
the risks poised by a Democratic Congress on the grounds that
politicians have lost their ability to pursue policies hostile
to investors in the new global order of unrestricted electronic
transmission of information and capital. Ironically, though, the
election of a pro-business LDP government in Japan could set the
stage for new yen/dollar tensions during 1997 if it encourages
renewed complacency about microeconomic reform in Japan against
the backdrop of a resurgent trade surplus.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 26, 1996</I>

<P>
<B>The Bank of France is a potentially interesting candidate for
revenue enhancement because it currently has one of the lowest
rates of profitability of all European central banks.</B>  Its
balance sheet has assets of $143 billion compared to $234 billion
for the Bundesbank, $193 billion for the Bank of Italy, and $114.5
billion for the Bank of Spain.  Yet, the after-tax profits of
the Bank of France were only $280 million during 1995 compared
to $7.6 billion for the Bundesbank, $443 million for the Bank
of Italy and $1.8 billion for the Bank of Spain.  Despite much
smaller balance sheets, the central banks of Holland, Britain
and Austria also produced much larger profits than the Bank of
France.
<P>
It is difficult to compare central banks across national borders
because of differences in their functions and responsibilities.
 The Federal Reserve, for example, employs 23,700 people because
it manages the U.S. check clearing system while the Bank of England
has turned over such functions to the private sector.  Some European
countries have their central banks engage in bank supervision
while others turn it over to independent agencies.  Some central
banks may also subsidize their commercial banks by undercharging
for certain services compared to the central banks of other countries.
<P>
The Bank of France could be a tempting target for rationalization
because it is so labor intensive (17,632 employees) in relation
to the size of the French economy and a recent study found that
the cost of producing bank notes is four times higher in France
than in Britain.  France also has not taken advantage of the new
gold leasing market developed by the Bank of England to obtain
rental income for its gold nor has it attempted to boost its profits
by realizing some of the large holding gains on its gold stock.
<P>
Before World War Two, many European central banks were owned by
private investors and thus had to be sensitive to investor pressure
for dividends.  Today, only two central banks still have private
shareholders, the Bank of Japan and the Bank for International
Settlements.  The Bank of Japan has almost 4,000 shareholders
who own about 49% of the bank's equity.  The stock rose sharply
during the late 1980's when the government was privatizing other
state enterprises but it then declined by nearly two thirds during
the 1990's Tokyo bear market.  As the Bank of Japan distributes
only 5 million yen of its 700 million yen of profits as dividends,
investors have lost interest in the stock and it now sells at
a 90% discount to book value.  The Bank of International Settlements
is a central bank for other central banks and trades on the Swiss
stock exchanges.  As it has a large portfolio of gold, its share
price often correlates with the gold price but its current share
price is still equal to only about one half of its potential asset
value.  After the nationalization of other central banks during
the late 1940's, issues such as shareholder accountability and
profitability ceased to be discussed.  But with many European
countries now moving towards monetary union it is difficult to
believe that governments will remain insensitive to the huge resources
which their central banks now have available to them.
<P>
The five central banks which will be at the core of monetary union
in 1997 (France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Austria) have collective
assets of $480 billion and 46,934 employees.  The five other European
countries which are strong candidates to join the EM by 2002 (Italy,
Finland, Ireland, Spain, Portugal) have an aggregate balance sheet
of $356 billion and employment of 22,291.  Hence if all nine banks
were to merge, they would have collective assets of $837 billion
and total employment of 69,225 compared to the Federal Reserve's
assets of $410 billion and employment of 23,727 and the Bank of
Japan's assets of $453 billion and employment of 6,300.
<P>
Under the Maastricht Treaty, the countries of Europe will continue
to have independent central banks with voting rights on the council
of the new European central bank.  These central banks will also
continue to have control over a large share of their countries
foreign exchange reserves.  But in view of the pressure for reducing
public sector deficits which exists in Europe today, it is difficult
to believe that the central banks of Europe can remain immune
to the fiscal austerity engulfing other government institutions.
<P>
In addition to rationalizing their central bank operations through
staff cuts, some European countries should consider introducing
radical changes in their systems of monetary control during the
transition to EMU in order to enhance investor confidence in their
convergence prospects.   <B>Estonia's monetary regime could provide
an interesting role model for countries in a long transition to
EMU, such as Italy, as well as for countries outside of  EMU which
want to maintain a strong exchange rate link  to the new European
currency.</B>  In 1992, Estonia established a currency board which
has evolved into one of the most successful monetary regimes in
the world.  At present, Estonia has nominal interest rates of
only 8-9% despite an inflation rate of 17-18% and a current account
deficit equal to 6-7% of GDP.  The central bank is also highly
profitable and employs only 300 people.  After adjusting for loan
loss reserves to offset bad debts purchased during the banking
crisis which followed independence, the Estonian central bank
should earn a profit of $15-20 million on an asset base of $650-700
million this year.  Countries such as Italy and Spain, which are
strongly committed to EMU but may not qualify until the early
years of the next century should give serious consideration to
converting their central banks into de facto currency boards linked
to the new European currency.  If the markets took the currency
board regime seriously, their interest rates would fall sharply
and thus accelerate the process of deficit reduction.  It is possible
that Spain and Portugal will be able to achieve sufficient deficit
reduction to qualify for EMU in 1997, but their odds of success
would improve if they introduced an interim monetary regimes which
enjoyed so much investor credibility that their interest rates
fell sharply during 1997 and 1998.  The ratio of public debt to
GDP in many European countries is now so high that it will be
difficult to achieve small fiscal deficits without large interest
rate declines.
<P>
<I><B>To summarize</B></I>, if the U.S. economy shows signs of
reviving to a growth rate in excess of 3.0% after the third quarter
slowdown, the odds are high that the Federal Reserve will raise
interest rates again.  Fed tightening could come as early as the
October 4th employment report or it could be delayed until the
mid-November FOMC meeting.  The buoyancy of consumer confidence
and the U.S. equity markets suggests that the third quarter slowdown
in final sales will be temporary but there is sufficient disagreement
about the outlook that the Federal Reserve will want confirmation
of resilient final demand before it tightens.  The French government
has been successful in selling its budget strategy to the markets
because investors had become so pessimistic about the prospects
for deficit reduction during the summer that they regarded the
new budget as a positive surprise.  But investor confidence in
the outlook for European monetary union could fade again if the
French economy stalls during the fourth quarter or there is widespread
public hostility to the government's fiscal austerity.  France
will have parliamentary elections in ealry 1998 and economic policy
will not remain static in the face of conitnuing recession.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 2, 1996</I>

<P>

The Bank of Japan's Tankan survey has further lessened the risk of Japanese monetary policy being tightened this autumn.  The survey showed a small decline in business confidence compared to widespread expectations that it would continue the uptrend which began late last year.  The survey indicates that Japan's manufacturing inventory adjustment is not yet over and that growth during the second half of 1996 will be far more subdued than it was during the first half.  The yen/dollar rate has been stable during recent weeks, but the MOF will probably attempt to encourage renewed dollar strength during the run-up to the IMF meetings in early October.  
<P>
The recovery of Robert Dole in the opinion polls  after the Republican convention and the selection of Jack Kemp as his vice-presidential running mate has helped to lessen investor concern about a potential Democratic sweep of both the presidential and congressional elections.  While the President continues to enjoy nearly a ten point lead over Mr. Dole, the Republicans are now only slightly behind the Democrats in opinion polls for the congress.
<P>
The decision of Mr. Dole to link his campaign so firmly to the theme of tax cuts suggests that if he scores an upset victory in the November election, the dollar will probably rally in expectation of the U.S. experiencing a replay of the fiscal policy of the early Reagan years. 
<P>
Investors remember that during the early 1980's the dollar rose sharply because the expansion of the federal deficit against the backdrop of a restrictive monetary policy required the U.S. to become a large scale capital importer.  It is doubtful, though that the Dole fiscal policy will have nearly as dramatic an impact on the dollar as the Reagan fiscal policy.  
<P>
First, under current law, no administration can enact a tax cut unless there are offsetting spending cuts.  This law was enacted in order to force the Congress to adhere to long-term targets for deficit reduction and it is doubtful that a president as cautious about fiscal policy as Mr. Dole would repeal it.  Indeed, the threat of a bond market collapse would probably constrain Congress from repealing the law even if the Dole-Kemp administration decided to revert to a high deficit fiscal policy.  The ratio of federal debt to GDP in the U.S. is now about 55% compared to only 28% when Mr. Reagan took office, so the initial conditions for a major fiscal reflation are much less suitable than they were in 1981. 
<P>
Secondly, the Dole administration has a broad based economic growth agenda of which personal tax cuts are only one part.  The Dole program is also committed to reducing the cost of government regulation and the legal system on U.S. business, slashing capital gains taxes and slowing the growth of Federal spending.  If the Dole program encourages corporations to invest more aggressively, interest rates could rise because of strong demand for capital in the private sector, not increased government borrowing.  But, as the Dole program has far more modest tax incentives for investment than the Reagan program of 1981, it will probably only have a modest impact on private capital demands and interest rates.  The Reagan program directly subsidized investment through large increases in depreciation allowances whereas the Dole program is focused on capital gains relief and regulatory reform.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
July 29, 1996</I>

<P>
<I>Most other industrial countries are deeply envious of the U.S.
labor market.</I>  In April, a German business magazine published
a cover story about how Germany should regard the U.S. economy
as a role model for labor market reform.  The cover showed a picture
of Chancellor Kohl (a man who weighs well over 200 pounds) trying
to squeeze into an Uncle Sam costume.  Shortly after the article
appeared, Chancellor Kohl announced several measures to encourage
job creation, including reduced payroll taxes and a proposal to
abolish many expensive government regulations on firms which employ
ten workers or less.  Under the previous law, such rules applied
to firms  employing more than 5 people.  In the U.S., by contrast,
firms are not subject to many federal labor laws until their total
employment exceeds 50 workers.
<P>
The U.S. needs new government policies to improve educational
opportunity while corporations should attempt to broaden employee
participation in stock option programs, but attempts to impose
new regulations on the labor market will be counter productive
to job creation without necessarily reducing wage inequality.
 As education in the U.S. is primarily a responsibility of state
and local governments, it will be difficult for Washington based
politicians to have much impact on the quality of education without
providing much greater federal funding or structural reforms to
promote more competition for the delivery of what is still a monopoly
public good in most communities.
<P>
<I>Several factors suggest that the Republicans should improve
their standing in the opinion polls during September.</I>  Aside
from convention publicity, they will be free from the official
restrictions on campaign spending which were imposed on Mr. Dole
because of his large outlays during the primary season.  Mr. Dole
is also starting to develop more effective campaign themes, such
as school vouchers and tax allowances for small business.  While
these themes will not resolve his problem with highly divisive
issues such as abortion, they should help to energize constituencies
who voted Republican during the 1980's.
<P>
The Clinton personal and financial scandals in Arkansas also will
continue to be a wildcard in the political outlook.  They have
not been a major factor yet because of Mr. Clinton's unique personal
circumstances compared to other presidents.  As Arkansas is perceived
to be a poor corrupt state, many people discount the Clinton financial
scandals as a natural outcome of the state's potential culture.
 As Mrs. Clinton is the most assertive first lady in the history
of the presidency, many male voters believe the president should
be entitled to have mistresses.  What remains unclear is whether
this tolerance for scandals will persist when voters actually
enter the polling booth.  The comments of Mr. Ken Starr to the
media could also have an important effect on voter attitudes.
 If he gives the impression that he might indict Mrs. Clinton
or the president next year, voters could turn against the president
in order to avoid a repetition of the paralysis which crippled
the government during Mr. Nixon's second term.
<P>
While the opinion polls suggest that the Democrats have an opportunity
to recapture the House, four factors suggest the Republicans should
be able to hold onto a small majority.  First, they have raised
a great deal of money and attracted many strong new candidates
as a result of their victory in 1994.  Secondly, many Democratic
incumbents will retire in the south and at least 15-20 of those
seats are potentially good prospects for a Republican takeover.
 Thirdly, there is a significant risk that the election for ten
congressional seats in Texas will be delayed until December in
order to redraw the boundaries to eliminate radical gerry-mandening.
Eight of the ten seats are Democratic seats with good Republican
potential for a take-over.  The delay in the congressional elections
could boost Republican victory prospects by depressing the turnout.
  In special elections, only committed voters turn out compared
to an average of 50-60% for presidential elections.  Finally,
the odds are high that there will be a conservative third party
in the presidential race offering Mr. Ross Perot as its candidate.
 As the Reform Party will not have any congressional candidates,
its voters will probably support the Republicans in most house
races.
<P>
The U.S. dollar fell sharply during July because of the decline
in U.S. bond and equity prices.  The D-mark also benefited from
the failure of the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates at its
pre-vacation meeting in late July.
<P>
As the U.S. economy is enjoying buoyant growth while the economies
of Germany and Japan are much less dynamic, <i>the only factor
which appears capable of producing a sustained dollar correction
is investor concern about the upcoming U.S. elections.  The Bundesbank
appears to have been deadlocked on a rate cut in late July because
several social democratic members of the council missed the meeting</I>.
 When they return in late August, the odds will increase of a
vote to ease further.  Recent Japanese economic data point to
a moderation in that country's growth rate after the spurt to
a 13% growth rate during the first quarter.  Government officials
also have gone out of their way to stress that the Bank of Japan
will not raise interest rates for several months.  Despite the
upturn in GDP growth during the first quarter, Japan continues
to suffer from severe credit quality problems in its banking system
and there are recurring rumors of new bank failures.  As Japanese
officials would be quite happy to see the yen depreciation to
the 110-115 range, they will not feel any impulsion to raise interest
rates even if the Federal Reserve hikes U.S. interest rates by
50 basis points during the next few months.  As a result of these
factors, the dollar should stabilize once U.S. securities market
establish a viable trading range and could rally if U.S. asset
markets bottom in the near future.
<P>
<I><B>To summarize, </B></I>the U.S. economy appears likely to
expand at a 3.0-3.5% annual rate during the third quarter or a
level about 1.0% above the Fed's perception of the economy's non-inflationary
growth rate.  As the unemployment rate is only 5.3% and there
are increasing signs of wage acceleration in the economy, the
odds are high that the Fed will decide to raise interest rates
during August in order to insure that output growth slows to the
2.0-2.5% rate by the fourth quarter.  The Fed tightening, coupled
with investor concern about this autumn's elections for the presidency
and the Congress, could produce a stock market correction during
the third quarter but such an adjustment is preferable to a larger
and more dramatic adjustment during the autumn if the Fed defers
tightening and then has to change its mind.  The poor showing
of Robert Dole in the opinion polls is increasing investor concern
about the Republicans losing control of the Congress but several
factors suggest the Republicans should be able to retain the House
and Senate even if Dole runs several percentage points behind
Clinton.  The dollar is vulnerable to continuing weakness in U.S.
bond and equity prices but it could improve during the late summer
when the Bundesbank finally lowers interest rates.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
June 21, 1996</I>

<P>
While many western commentators believe that Russia has a cultural
history which will discourage entrepreneurship and establishment
of a successful private sector, <B>it is important to remember
that Russia was a high growth economy during the decade before
the First World War.</B> With her large natural resource endowment
and well educated population, Russia should be able to duplicate
the 6-7% growth rates now apparent in Poland, Estonia, and other
former communist countries in eastern Europe. But such take-off
will not happen without further action to address core structural
problems, such as the integrity of the tax system and government
agencies in general. There will probably also be a debate about
whether the strength of the ruble is discouraging exports and
boosting imports excessively. After the devaluation of 1992, the
ruble stood at barely 10% of its purchasing power parity with
the dollar. At the end of 1995, it was 65% of its PPP value against
the dollar and it will probably soon reach a level equal to 75-80%
of its PPP value against the dollar. As Russian industry is still
in the midst of a major restructuring and trying to develop export
markets to compensate for the collapse of domestic spending, there
will probably be a powerful lobby arguing for a larger devaluation
of the ruble than Mr. Yeltsin's policy team and the IMF have so
far advocated.
<P>
As a result of the economic upturn now occurring in both the G-7
countries and the developing countries adversely affected by Mexico's
1995 financial crisis, the world economy should enjoy a growth
rate in excess of 4.0% this year for the first time since 1988.
As the recovery in Europe and Japan is much less mature than the
six year old recovery in the U.S., there is no reason why global
output growth should not remain above 4.0% next year as well.
<P>
<B>The global scope of the current upturn is reviving concerns
last heard during 1994 about the adequacy of global savings to
finance a resurgence of investment in the old-industrial countries
as well as the emerging market economies which now encompass about
45% of the world' output, 70% of its land area, and 85% of its
population.</B> The world economy's major source of surplus savings
during recent years has been the current account surplus of east
Asia while its largest consumer of savings has been the western
hemisphere. In 1995, Japan had a current account surplus of $110
billion, China had a current account surplus of $16 billion, Singapore
had a surplus of $11 billion and Taiwan had a surplus of $5 billion
compared to an aggregate current account deficit of $40 billion
in Korea and the other countries of Asean. In the western hemisphere,
by contrast, the U.S. and Canada had a current account deficit
of $160 billion while Latin America ran a deficit of $28 billion.
Latin America's deficit fell sharply from $45 billion during 1994
because of the Mexican crisis but Brazil, Columbia and Peru expanded
their borrowing modestly. Europe is far closer to financial equilibrium
than either Asia or the western hemisphere. Germany and Britain
had a current account deficit of $27 billion last year but this
was more than offset by current account surpluses of $27 billion
in the Benelux countries, $17 billion in France and $20 billion
in Italy.
<P>
In 1996, there will be large declines in the current account surpluses
of Japan and China while the deficit of the western hemisphere
will probably remain unchanged. The deficit of the U.S. will shrink
modestly but Latin America will expand its borrowing. The only
offset to the reduced surplus of east Asia will be a larger surplus
in Western Europe as the deficit of Germany shrinks while the
surpluses of other countries linger at high levels. But with eastern
Europe and Russia now poised for faster growth, the Visegard countries
will probably run a current account deficit of $8-10 while Russia
could shift from a large external surplus in 1995 to a small deficit
next by 1997.
<P>
The heavy emphasis on reduction of government borrowing in the
major industrial countries today suggests the coming shift in
the composition of the world's balance of payments should pose
fewer interest rate risks than the world economic upturn which
occurred during 1994 . <B>But the revival of capital flows to
Latin America, the large external deficits of the traditional
high savings societies of southeast Asia and the re-appearance
of eastern Europe as a major borrower indicates that some of the
upward pressure on real interest rates this year is a response
to changes in the global savings and investment balance, not just
concerns about rising inflation.</B> As a result of the Mexican
crisis many developing countries in Latin America and elsewhere
are putting much greater emphasis on boosting their domestic savings
rates and thus reducing their need for external capital. But it
is still unclear if savings rates will rise rapidly enough during
the next few years to satisfy all of the capital demands which
will develop as the global business cycle matures.
<P>
<I><B>To summarize</B></I>, the strength of U.S. data for employment,
retail sales and industrial production have increased the odds
that the Federal Reserve will hike short-term interest rates by
25 basis points this summer. The hike could also come in between
the next two FOMC meetings in order to avoid a conflict with the
Democratic National Convention in late August. The U.S. economy
will probably grow at a 3.5-4.5% annual rate during the third
quarter and hold in a growth range close to 3.0% during the second
half of the year. Inflation will not accelerate dramatically but
another three quarters of above trend growth would reduce unemployment
to 4.0% and encourage a revival of industrial commodity prices.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
February 29, 1996</I>

<P>

The growth rate of the U.S. economy slowed to only about 0.9% during the fourth quarter from 3.6% during the third quarter and 0.6% during the first half of the year.
<P>

<B>The most distressing feature of the fourth quarter report was the weakness of domestic final sales.</B> They expanded at only a 0.6% annual rate compared to 2.6% during the third quarter. But the fourth quarter data was depressed by special factors which should reverse during the first half of 1996. The Boeing strike produced a 10% decline in aircraft spending. Real federal government spending fell at a 12% annual rate because of the government shutdown late in the year. The government shut-down probably also contributed to weakness in private spending which requires government authorization, such as construction projects in environmentally sensitive areas of the west and exports of high technology goods with military potential.
<P>

On the basis of preliminary data, one of the weakest sectors of the economy during the fourth quarter was consumer spending. It grew at an annual rate of only 0.8% compared to 2.8% during the third quarter and 3.4% during the second quarter. But newly revised retail sales suggests that the growth rate of consumer spending was probably about 1.3% while the weakness of spending was heavily concentrated in October. January retail sales fell sharply because of severe weather and the shutdown of several federal agencies during the previous month (furloughed workers lost their paychecks for several weeks) but survey data for February suggests that consumer spending is now improving. If consumer spending is recovering, the economy should be able to complete its inventory adjustment during the current quarter and return to a growth rate of 2.0-3.0% during the second quarter.
<P>

Surveys of business confidence suggest that the corporate sector remains confident despite the weakness of the economy during the fourth quarter. According to the latest Dun and Bradstreet survey, corporate executives expect sales to improve during April after three months of weakness recently. The D&#38;B survey of new orders rose to 48 in January from 45 in December and 33 in November. Surveys of small business confidence are also generally positive. The January survey of National Federation of Independent Business noted,
<P>

<I>"The index of Small Business Optimism dropped 2.5 points in December from its highest reading in the expansion. The December reading of 101.5 is just 0.4 points below the average for the year of 101.9. The November 'sales bubble' burst in December and sales slipped to a mediocre level. The strong fourth quarter of 1994, which saw a good Christmas shopping season, culminated a year in which 3.3 million net new jobs were formed. Although the economy stayed close to this high employment level, it was not able to follow with yet another strong year of job creation in spite of record-high hiring plans in January. Without the buying power generated by the same volume of <B>new</B> paychecks, it was unlikely that the 1995 holiday season could significantly better the 1994 season in <B>nominal dollar terms</B>. But <B>in real terms</B>, the 1995 season might actually be better than 1994 because year-over-year, there was probably zero retail price inflation."</I>
<P>

The resilience of the small business sector is important because it accounts for most of the employment creation in the U.S. economy. The Manpower Employment Survey is cautious about hiring during the second quarter but in the NFIB survey, small business continues to report labor scarcity in many regions. Twenty-two percent of small firms have jobs which are hard to fill.
<P>

The buoyancy of U.S. financial markets should help to bolster consumer and business spending. The household sector has become a major beneficiary of rising equity prices because of its large holdings of mutual funds. In January, it owned $1.3 trillion of equity mutual funds compared to $418 billion in early 1992 and $811 billion of bond funds compared to $449 billion in early 1992. The total value of savings accounts, small time deposits, and retail money market funds, by contrast, is $2.597 trillion. <B>The mutual fund industry has grown so dramatically during recent years that its assets excluding money market funds will soon exceed the $2.3 trillion of assets in the country's national banks.</B> If we include retail money market funds, the mutual fund industry is now larger than the national banking system. 
<P>

The growth of the mutual fund industry has resulted from both changes in household savings flows and stock market appreciation. In January, the market capitalization of America's 7551 listed companies (including preferred stock) was about $6.63 trillion compared to $5 trillion (6925 companies) in January, 1994 and $3.957 trillion (5608 companies) in January 1992. <B>The ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP has risen to 87.5% compared to a previous all time high of 81.0% in 1929 and a post war peak of 79.0% in 1968.</B> The all time trough of stock market capitalization to GDP was 16.0% in 1941 while in the post war era it was 30% in 1974 and 1982. The average ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP since 1926 has been 48.0%. At first glance, the U.S. market appears to be as frothy as the Tokyo market in the late 1980's, when Japan's ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP rose to 130% from an average of 20-30% during the 1970's and early 1980's (this about 65% today). But since the U.S. corporate sector now has about one fifth of its output in other countries, the ratio of stock market capitalization of GDP should probably be adjusted to include the $1.6 trillion of sales which U.S. firms have in other countries. <B>If we adjust the U.S. market capitalization/GDP ratio for foreign sales, it drops to about 74% from 87.5%.</B> This ratio is still high but the fact remains that U.S. firms now have global sales opportunities on a scale unprecedented in economic history. At the peak of the Tokyo bull market, by contrast, Japanese firms had only about 7% of their output in foreign countries.
<P>

American investment spending will also benefit from rising equity prices by lowering the cost of business capital. At present, the ratio of equity prices to asset replacement costs for U.S. firms is about 1.7 or the highest level ever recorded in the modern era. The high value of equity in the U.S. stock market makes it possible for firms to finance new capital spending on attractive terms while enhancing the appeal of greenfield investment compared to corporate takeover activity.
<P>

<B>Inventory spending will probably be a drag on the economy during the first quarter but it should turn into a positive growth stimulant during the second quarter.</B> In the fourth quarter, firms reduced the rate of real non-farm inventory accumulation to $23.6 billion from $38.3 billion during the third quarter and $33.8 billion during the second quarter. The weakness of the purchasing agent survey during January suggests that real non-farm inventory accumulation could decline further during the first quarter of 1996. The total index fell to 44.2 from 46.0 during January while the new order component slid to 41.8 from 45.4. The inventory index increased to 47.7 from 44.2 but it is difficult to imagine that such gains were voluntary at a time when final demand was depressed by the weather and the federal government shut-down. Manufacturing inventories rose during the fourth quarter while retail and wholesale inventories fell. The weakness of final sales during January suggests that manufacturing inventories should decline further during the first quarter.
<P>

The major new risk facing the economy is rising bond yields. They have increased sharply because of investor concern about the fragmentation of the Republican Party in recent primaries, the apparent collapse of deficit reduction talks in Washington, and the disappointment of some aggressive investors about the economy avoiding a full scale recession this spring. If bond yields continue to increase, mortgage rates will rise, depressing the upturn which should occur in housing and consumer spending on furniture and appliances this spring.
<P>

<B>The February Blue Chip survey of the economic consensus continues to show a remarkable unanimity of views among private sector forecasters.</B> The average forecast for output growth in 1996 is 2.0% with the ten most optimistic analysts projecting a gain of 2.5% and the ten most pessimistic expecting a gain of 1.4%. In January, by contrast, the average forecast for 1996 projected 2.2% output growth. Analysts have lowered their 1996 forecasts because of downward revisions in growth estimates of the fourth quarter of 1995 as well as the first quarter of this year. In 1997, the consensus projects that output growth will accelerate to 2.1%. The ten most optimistic analysts are projecting 2.6% output growth compared to 1.6% for the ten most pessimistic.
<P>

The primary factor holding most private sector growth forecasts close to 2.0% is the perception of analysts that the economy has achieved full employment and thus can sustain output growth only slightly above 2.0% if inflation is going to remain below 3.0%. If analyst perceived that the economy had more supply potential, they would probably boost their growth forecasts but since the latest GDP revisions lowered estimates of the U.S. economy's recent growth performance <B>most forecasters are even more cautious about the economy's growth potential today than they were six months ago.</B>

<I>Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>





The next major test of the mutual fund industry will probably come when the world economy enjoys such a prolonged boom that inflation revives to a level which compels the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy by more than it did during 1994.  The Fed doubled the level of U.S. short-term interest rates two years ago but real interest rates did not exceed 3.0% and the economy slowed so abruptly in the months after the Mexican financial crisis that the Fed was able to ease interest rates during the summer of 1995.  If, by contrast, the economy had remained strong through 1995, short-term interest rates might have risen to 7.0-8.0% and provoked far larger redemptions in bond funds as well as a correction in the equity market large enough to encourage net redemptions of equity funds.

<P>

In the modern era, the primary channel through which monetary policy influenced the economy was the housing market.  In the era of Regulation Q ceilings on interest rates, monetary tightening would divert savings flows from thrift institutions and choke off  the supply of mortgage funds for housing.  After deregulation of the thrift industry, the Fed slowed the economy by pushing up interest rates to levels which depressed the demand for money in all sectors.  Such monetary tightening also sometimes encouraged dollar appreciation which increased the trade deficit.  As a result of the household sector's growing exposure to the stock and bond markets through mutual funds, changes in the value of household equity portfolios could emerge as a more important channel for monetary policy to influence the economy than in the past.  Most econometric research has shown a weak link between consumer spending and stock market fluctuations because of the heavy concentration of equity ownership in the top 10% of the population as measured by wealth, but the parameters of this relationship could gradually change if equities continue to expand as a share of household assets and ownership becomes more diffused throughout the population.  At present, the group which is probably most sensitive to the stock market driven changes in wealth is the households over the age of 65.  They own far more equity than any other group and have little wage and salary income.  In the past, they were referred to as fixed income people but as a result of the buoyant performance of financial markets compared to real wages during recent years, it is now people in their 20's and 30's, not senior citizens, who could be more accurately described as having fixed incomes.  Younger households can share in the wealth gains of the older generation through bequests but on the basis of current demographic tables only about 5.7% of corporate equity is bequeathed over a five year period compared to 24.4% over a fifteen year period.  During the past two year, households over the age of 65 have enjoyed an equity capital gain of about $250 billion compared to $125 billion for people in the age group 35-44 years and $196 billion for people in the age group 45-54 years.
Two months after Alan Greenspan became Federal Reserve chairman in 1987, the New York stock exchange experienced its largest one day correction since 1929 and the Dow fell by over 23%.  Since 1990, the New York market has enjoyed a seven year bull run without experiencing even the modest 5-10% corrections typical of past bull markets.  Mr. Greenspan's attempt to pursue a policy of monetary fine tuning rather than large and abrupt changes in the level of interest rates certainly has contributed to the market's good performance since 1990 but he has also enjoyed the benefits of a sustained period of global disinflation.  In the 1970's, by contrast, inflation shot up to double digit levels on two occasions because of oil price shocks, global crop failures, and the cost pass through pricing policies which characterized the U.S. corporate sector before the 1980's.

<P>

Not coincidentally, the global economic forces which have restrained inflation and boosted equity prices during recent years also have played a role in encouraging the economic anxieties about stagnant real wages and corporate restructuring which helped to produce victories for Patrick Buchanan in the early Republican primaries.  Many of the voters who have suffered from wage stagnation or job losses have not enjoyed compensating gains from rising equity prices despite the boom in mutual fund ownership.  At present, only 13% of U.S. workers belong to profit sharing plans and just 3% are enrolled in Employee Stock Ownership Plans.  There are even striking class divisions in the membership of 401-K plans.  About 46% of white collar workers belong to 401-K plans while only 26% of blue collar workers are enrolled in such plans.  The unequal sharing in the benefits of corporate rationalization and disinflation creates the risk of a political backlash against business and demands for more interventionist government policies to protect the interests of company stakeholders (employees, etc.), not just stockholders.  If the corporate sector wants to contain such political pressures, it should attempt to promote share ownership among the people who have not yet found their way into the equity market through mutual funds by promoting more widespread use of ESOP's.  In the past, trade unions opposed ESOP's and profit sharing but during the past decade some unions have turned to ESOP's in order to promote employee takeovers of troubled companies.  The major barriers to expanding ESOP membership in the 1990's have been the reluctance of workers to accept the double jeopardy of committing capital to the same firm where they work (they naturally prefer more diversification of risk), reduced tax benefits, and disagreements about how large a role workers should have in a company's management as their share of its equity expands.  More universal ownership of equity would not resolve all of the concerns about eroding real wages and job insecurity now plaguing America's labor force but it would at least help to contain the politics of envy now stirring in the U.S. presidential election campaign.  If envy emerges as a dominant theme in this year's election, the financial press will soon be carrying stories about the risks posed to the U.S. economy from household wealth losses in the stock market, not just stagnant real wages.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 2, 1996</I>

<P>

The overall scope of  the Dole fiscal program is also very modest compared to the tax changes which occurred during the Reagan years.  The Dole program would reduce the top marginal tax rate to 34% whereas during the Reagan years it declined to 28%.  If Congress enacted every tax change proposed by the Dole-Kemp platform without cutting spending, the net fiscal stimulus to the economy would be only $58 billion during 1998 compared to a nominal GDP of $8 trillion.  It is also quite likely that the capital gains tax cut would produce such a huge revenue windfall that the federal deficit would shrink during the twelve to twenty four months after the enactment of the Dole tax program.  As a result of the equity bull market since 1991, the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP in the U.S. is now 95% compared to a previous all time peak of 82% in 1929 and a sixty year moving average of 48%.  If the household sector could realize capital gains with a tax rate of only 14%, there would be a realignment of portfolios on a scale so large that the Treasury would experience a massive revenue windfall.
<P>
Thirdly, if the Dole-Kemp team takes over the White House and the Republicans retain control of the White House, there would be a far greater likelihood of radical reform in the nation's hitherto uncontrolled entitlement programs than if the nation continues with its current mix of divided government or a return to full Democratic control over the executive and legislative branches.  The Republicans would be more willing to impose limitations on the growth of
Medicare spending.  There is also strong support in the Republican congressional caucus for privatization of the social security system.   The experience of other countries suggests that privatization of the social security system could have a very benign impact on U.S. interest rates by encouraging a rise in the household savings rate.   The growth of defined contribution pension plans has already helped to sustain the private savings rate in the face of a stock market boom which will depress corporate contributions to defined benefit plans.  The privatization of the social security would only accelerate this trend.
<P>
There were further signs during August that the world economy's developing countries will enjoy more buoyant growth during late 1996 and 1997 than during 1995.  Mexico reported a 7% year on year increase in total output during the second quarter while the peso has been so resilient that the Bank of Mexico has eased interest rates to the lowest level since the late 1994 peso crises.  China announced a cut in both its lending and deposit interest rates for the second time this year.  The Bank of China stresses that it will continue to restrain credit growth through non-price mechanisms such as lending quotas, but the interest rate cuts will still help to reduce the losses of the country's heavily indebted state enterprises and encourage more consumption and investment.  As China accounts for about 9% of total world output, any upturn in her economy will have important implications for commodity demand as well as trade flows in the Asia-Pacific region.  In June, the U.S. had a larger trade deficit with China than Japan but if China pursues a policy of reflation her import demand will rise and lower her trade surplus.
<P>
The economies of southeast Asia and Korea, by contrast, are now reporting a growth slowdown because of their heavy dependence upon the electronics industry.  Korea accounts for 20% of world semi-conductor production and the price of chips has fallen almost 80% this year.  The electronics sector accounts for almost two thirds of Singapore's industrial production, with much of the output being produced by the branch plants of U.S. multinational companies.  The slowdown in the sector should last for only a few quarters but it is a reminder of the trade vulnerability which still exists in many of Asia's high growth economies.
<P> 
<B><I>To summarize,</I></B> the government's data reports in the month of  September are likely to have a major impact on both investor and Federal Reserve perceptions of the intermediate term economic outlook.  If final demand continues to expand at a steady rate, there will be a sustained upturn in corporate inventory demand and production strong enough to justify at least one Federal Reserve interest rate hike before the November presidential election.  If domestic final demand slows sharply from the 4.6% growth rate which occurred during the first half of 1996, the Fed will probably be able to remain passive through year end.  The preliminary data for August suggests that the economy will display sufficient strength to justify a tightening move but the Fed is unlikely to arrive at a consensus on the question until he sees the employment and retail sales reports.  The dollar has weakened because of investors purchasing the D-mark to hedge against the risk of European monetary union being deferred.  The D-Mark could remain firm until there is more evidence of stronger European economic growth or successful fiscal policy tightening in France.  The August Tanken survey confirms the Japanese economy is recovering at a very gradual pace.  The Japanese economy's weakness will encourage the MOF to promote renewed yen depreciation during the run-up to October's IMF meeting.

<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
February 29, 1996</I>

<P>

When President Clinton attacked the Republican Congress for rejecting his plans to nominate Felix Rohatyn as vice chairman of the Fed, he said that he wanted to encourage a debate about whether the U.S. economy can sustain a higher growth rate. The persistence of low inflation will undoubtedly encourage such a debate at some point but as of today the American forecasting community continues to perceive that the economy's potential growth rate is only about 2.0-2.5%. If the economy's growth rate dips below that range, they believe that the Fed will ease further in order to hold unemployment close to its current level of 5.7%. If, by contrast, the economy suddenly rebounds to a 3.0-4.0% growth rate and the unemployment rate drops below 5.5%, they expect that the Fed will tighten.
<P>

In his recent Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan addressed the issue of the economy's potential growth rate. He admitted that recent breakthroughs in technology should increase the economy's optimal growth rate but he was reluctant to offer any higher estimates of the economy's optimal growth rate. He said,
<P>

 <I>"In light of the quickened pace of technological change, the question arises whether the U.S. economy can expand more rapidly on an ongoing basis than the 2 to 2 1/4 percent range for measured GDP forecaster for 1996 by government agencies and most private forecasters without adding to inflationary pressures, which in turn would undermine growth. The Federal Reserve would certainly welcome faster growth-provided that it is sustainable."
<P>

 "The particular rate of maximum sustainable growth in an economy as complex and ever-changing as ours is difficult to pin down. Fortunately, the Federal Reserve does not need to have a firm judgment on such an estimate, for persistent deviations of actual growth from that of capacity potential will soon send signals that a policy adjustment is needed. Should the nation's true growth potential exceed actual growth, for example, the disparity and lessened strain would be signaled in shorter lead times on the delivery of materials, declining overtime, and ebbing inflationary pressures. Conversely, actual growth in excess of the economy's true potential would soon result in tightened markets and other distortions which ,as history amply demonstrates, would propel the economy into recession. Consequently, we must be cautious in reaching conclusions that growth in productivity and hence of potential output has as yet risen to match the evident step-up in technological advance."
<P>

 "The hypothesis that advancing technology has enhanced productivity growth would be more persuasive if national data on productivity increases showed a district improvement. To a degree, the lack of any marked pick-up may be a shortcoming of the statistics rather than a refutation of the hypothesis. Faulty data could be arising in part because business purchases are increasingly concentrated in items that are expensed but which market prices suggest should be capitalized. Growing disparities between book capital and its valuation in equity markets may in part reflect widening effects of this misclassification. If this problem is indeed growing, we may be underestimating the growth of our GDP and productivity."
<P>

"While the Federal Reserve does not need to establish targets - and definitely not limits - for long-term growth, it is helpful in coming to shorter-run policy insights to have some judgments about the growth in potential GDP in the past and what it is likely to be in the future. Judgments of potential, quite naturally, are based on experience. Through the four quarters of 1994, for example, real GDP, pressed by strong demand, rose 3 1/2 percent. If that were the true rate of increase in the economy's long-run potential, then we would have expected no change in rates of resource utilization. Instead, industrial capacity utilization rose nearly 3 percentage points and the unemployment rate dropped a percentage point. Moreover, we began to see signs of strains on facilities; deliveries of materials slowed appreciably and factory overtime rose sharply. These signs of developing pressures on capacity suggest that the growth rate in economic potential in 1994 was below 3 1/2 percent. In general, as we get close to presumed potential, we are required to step up our surveillance for inflation pressures."</I>
<P>

While Greenspan was unwilling to offer any bold new estimate of optimal GDP growth, there should be little doubt that he will reduce interest rates further if the U.S. economy's growth rate appears likely to remain in a range of 1.0-2.0% or less. The sharp drop in the price component of the purchasing agent survey indicates that there is little cost pressure in the industrial sector. It is true that average hourly earnings have recently began to move higher but this development reflects changes in the composition of new job creation, not wage cost-push. Employment in the highest paid managerial and professional workers group has increased by 4% during the past year while employment has fallen elsewhere. As the managerial group has a wage level about 60% above other groups, its growing share of the workforce is boosting the overall level of compensation. In the fourth quarter, there also was an uptick in the employment cost index to a 0.9% rate of change compared to 0.6% previously, but most of this gain occurred in the benefit component while wage growth remained steady.
<P>

As the unemployment rate is below 6.0%, any further Fed easing will continue to be cautious but the excellent performance of cyclical inflation measures such as the purchasing agent index will cause policy makers to retain a bias towards promoting growth. <B>The geographic composition of the economy's current weakness also will give the Fed a bias towards ease because of how the votes of Federal Reserve district presidents are allocated on a regional bias.</B> The current boundaries of the Federal Reserve district banks were established in 1914 and designed to permit commercial bankers to reach their Federal Reserve regional bank for ready cash after a train ride of less than twenty four hours. As a result the boundaries of the Fed's regional banks no longer correlate well with the current distribution of economic activity and population in the U.S. Because geographic boundaries of the Federal Reserve's twelve districts were created in 1914, the east coast is over represented on the FOMC compared to the west (see Table 25). The San Francisco district accounts for 18% of national employment but is still allowed to cast a lone vote only once every three years. The Cleveland district accounts for 6.3% of total employment and is allowed to rotate with Chicago (15.1% of national employment) in voting every two years. There are also independent Federal Reserve districts with only 4.0-5.0% of national employment in Philadelphia and Boston while the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank has the same voting power as San Francisco despite the fact that its district accounts for only 3.3% of national employment. At present, the west coast is experiencing a steady but belated upturn in business activity while Cleveland and Philadelphia have slowed after buoyant growth two years ago. Regional district presidents do not vote solely on the basis of their local economies but their perceptions of the business outlook are influenced in part by what is happening in their district. The over-representation of the eastern and central states at the expense of the western states during recent years probably encouraged monetary policy to be too restrictive during the early 1990's (when California was in a severe recession) but may now have the reverse effect because the eastern and central states are suddenly experiencing more weakness than the west.

"While the Federal Reserve does not need to establish targets - and definitely not limits - for long-term growth, it is helpful in coming to shorter-run policy insights to have some judgments about the growth in potential GDP in the past and what it is likely to be in the future. Judgments of potential, quite naturally, are based on experience. Through the four quarters of 1994, for example, real GDP, pressed by strong demand, rose 3 1/2 percent. If that were the true rate of increase in the economy's long-run potential, then we would have expected no change in rates of resource utilization. Instead, industrial capacity utilization rose nearly 3 percentage points and the unemployment rate dropped a percentage point. Moreover, we began to see signs of strains on facilities; deliveries of materials slowed appreciably and factory overtime rose sharply. These signs of developing pressures on capacity suggest that the growth rate in economic potential in 1994 was below 3 1/2 percent. In general, as we get close to presumed potential, we are required to step up our surveillance for inflation pressures."</I>
<P>

While Greenspan was unwilling to offer any bold new estimate of optimal GDP growth, there should be little doubt that he will reduce interest rates further if the U.S. economy's growth rate appears likely to remain in a range of 1.0-2.0% or less. The sharp drop in the price component of the purchasing agent survey indicates that there is little cost pressure in the industrial sector. It is true that average hourly earnings have recently began to move higher but this development reflects changes in the composition of new job creation, not wage cost-push. Employment in the highest paid managerial and professional workers group has increased by 4% during the past year while employment has fallen elsewhere. As the managerial group has a wage level about 60% above other groups, its growing share of the workforce is boosting the overall level of compensation. In the fourth quarter, there also was an uptick in the employment cost index to a 0.9% rate of change compared to 0.6% previously, but most of this gain occurred in the benefit component while wage growth remained steady.
<P>

As the unemployment rate is below 6.0%, any further Fed easing will continue to be cautious but the excellent performance of cyclical inflation measures such as the purchasing agent index will cause policy makers to retain a bias towards promoting growth. <B>The geographic composition of the economy's current weakness also will give the Fed a bias towards ease because of how the votes of Federal Reserve district presidents are allocated on a regional bias.</B> The current boundaries of the Federal Reserve district banks were established in 1914 and designed to permit commercial bankers to reach their Federal Reserve regional bank for ready cash after a train ride of less than twenty four hours. As a result the boundaries of the Fed's regional banks no longer correlate well with the current distribution of economic activity and population in the U.S. Because geographic boundaries of the Federal Reserve's twelve districts were created in 1914, the east coast is over represented on the FOMC compared to the west (see Table 25). The San Francisco district accounts for 18% of national employment but is still allowed to cast a lone vote only once every three years. The Cleveland district accounts for 6.3% of total employment and is allowed to rotate with Chicago (15.1% of national employment) in voting every two years. There are also independent Federal Reserve districts with only 4.0-5.0% of national employment in Philadelphia and Boston while the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank has the same voting power as San Francisco despite the fact that its district accounts for only 3.3% of national employment. At present, the west coast is experiencing a steady but belated upturn in business activity while Cleveland and Philadelphia have slowed after buoyant growth two years ago. Regional district presidents do not vote solely on the basis of their local economies but their perceptions of the business outlook are influenced in part by what is happening in their district. The over-representation of the eastern and central states at the expense of the western states during recent years probably encouraged monetary policy to be too restrictive during the early 1990's (when California was in a severe recession) but may now have the reverse effect because the eastern and central states are suddenly experiencing more weakness than the west.

<H2>What We do</H2> 
<dl><IMG SRC="GIF/blueball.gif"> 
<I>We take a synergistic and interdisciplinary approach to apply space-based
observations, ground-based measurements, and numerical model to study the
coupled ocean-atmosphere system. <BR>
<IMG SRC="GIF/blueball.gif"> 
We improve the monitoring, from space, of ocean-atmosphere exchanges in
momentum, heat and water.  <BR>
<IMG SRC="GIF/blueball.gif"> 
We study how these exchanges force ocean circulation and distribute the
heat, water, greenhouse gases, and nutrients stored in the ocean.<BR>
<IMG SRC="GIF/blueball.gif"> 
We examine the effect of these exchanges on the enery and hydrologic
balances in the atmosphere. <BR>
<IMG SRC="GIF/blueball.gif"> 
We focus on seasonal-to-interannual variability and predictability, but
also examine how such variability is affected by shorter time scales
(intra-seasonal) changes and longer time scales (decadal) trend.  We are
planning to study the manifest of long-term and global variability in local
and near-term hazards, such as hurricane and monsoon. <BR><I>

<IMG SRC="GIF/hua1.gif"></center><P>
Hua Hu received a B.S. degree in Earth and Space Science from 
University of Science and Technology of China in 1985, and a Ph.D. in 
Geophysics from University of Washington in 1994. 
From 1994.2 to 1995.4, she was a postdoc in Atmospheric Chemistry Element 
at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
After May 1995 She became a Member of Technical Staff in Ocean Science Element at JPL.
The title of Hua's Ph.D. dissertation is "Global and local electrical phenomena in 
the stratosphere", focusing on effects of thunderstorms, lightning, fair-weather
electric fields, and cosmic rays on near-earth electrical environment.
Her graduate work involved extensive balloon-borne experiements which gave her 
lots of hands-on hardware and software experience. During her postdoc, 
she studied the variability of atmospheric trace gases, e.g., CO, CH4, N2O, 
and had participated in 45 ER-2 aircraft flights during a NASA ozone 
experiement. Hua's current research interest
focused on water vapor feedback in a global warming scenario, and heat and 
momentum transfer in the planetary boundary layer.
Hua received an Excellent B.S. Thesis
Award in 1985, and a NASA Group Achievement Award in 1995.

<P>
All data between 9/96 and 10/96 accessible to us 
are converted to equivalent neutral winds (ENW) at both 10 m and 19.5 m height.  There
are different kinds of buoy mixed together, not all of which are suitable
for evaluating NSCAt winds; see station identifier.  The definition and
method of computing ENW is described in Liu and Tang [JPL Publication
96-17, 1996].  Conditions under which ENW is derived are indicated by Flag
(see README file).

<H2>Hourly TAO Equivalent Neutral Wind Coincident with NSCAT</H2>
<P>
Hourly TAO buoy data coincident with NSCAT observations provided through
the courtesy of Mike Caruso are converted to equivalent neutral winds (ENW)
at both 10 m and 19.5 reference height.  The definition and method of
computing ENW are described by Liu and Tang [JPL External Publication
96-17, 1996], the text of which is displayed in this homepage.  Conditions
under which ENW is derived are indicated by a Flag (see definition below).
The colocated TAO buoy and NSCAT data are accessible through Mike Caruso's
homepage http://rsag.whoi.edu/nscat/tao/nscat_tao.html.  The TAO buoys and
instrument were deployed and the data collected by the NOAA Pacific Marine
Environmental Laboratory.

<P>
!!ATTENTION!!
The TAO relative humidity data given by Mike Caruso are in %, so they need
to be converted to fraction (divided by 100) in the LKB code.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Scatterometer (NSCAT), 
a microwave radar, will measure near-surface wind velocity (both speed
and direction) over the global oceans. The information derived is critical in 
determining regional weather patterns and global climate.

Japan's Advanced Earth Observing Satellite, </A> scheduled for launch in early 1996.
<A HREF="http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/calendar/nscat.html">The Jet Propulsion Laboratory

<H3>Instrument Description</H3>

<UL>
<LI> Mass: 300 kg.

<LI> Power: 275 W.
 
<LI> Data rate: 2.9 kbps.</UL> <P>

The NSCAT
will measure wind speeds and directions over at least 90% of the ice-free
global oceans every 2 days - under all weather and cloud conditions. Winds are
a critical factor in determining regional weather patterns and global 
climate.  At present, weather data can be acquited over land, but our only 
knowledge of surface winds over oceans comes from infrequent and sometimes
inaccurate reports from ships. Since oceans cover approximately 70% of
Earth's surface, NSCAT data will play a key role in scientist's efforts to
understand and predict complex global weather patterns and climate systems.<P>

NSCAT has two major systems - the spaceborne instrument system and the
ground data processing system. The flight instrument is a specialized microwave
radar designed to measure winds over the oceans. It will be launched 
into a near-polar Sun-synchronous orbit on the 
Japanese Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS), scheduled for flight in
early 1996. Like its predecessor on the Seasat satellite, NSCAT will use
an array of antennas that radiate microwave pulses at a frequency of 14 GHz
across broad regions on Earth's surface. This array of six, 3-m-long antennas
will scan two 600-km bands of ocean - one band on each side of the instrument's
orbital path, separated by a gap of approximately 330 km. Obtaining backscatter
and wind vector information nearly continuously, NSCAT will be able to make
190,000 wind measurements per day - more than 100 times the amount of ocean
wind information presently available from ships. <P>

Ground computers will produce wind measurements within 2 weeks of receiving
raw NSCAT data from the ADEOS spacecraft, with no backlog, throughout
the 3-year mission. Arrangements may be made to allow near-real-time access
to these wind data by agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. NSCAT data products will include global backscatter data;
50-km resolution ocean wind vectors in the measurement swaths, and spatially
and temporally averaged, gridded, wind field maps.<P>

As part of the NSCAT project, NASA is also sponsoring a team of 15 scientific
investigators who serve as project advisors during the development of the
instrument and ground data processing system and who will conduct research
based on NSCAT data. Their studies are expected to lead to improved methods of
global weather forecasting and modeling - and possibly to a better 
understanding of environmental phenomena (such as El Nino) that greatly 
affect world economies. <P>

Satellite scatterometers are microwave radar instruments designed specifically
to measure near-surface wind velocity (both speed and direction) over the 
global oceans under all weather conditions. Wind stress is the single 
largest source of momentum to the upper ocean, driving oceanic motions on 
scales ranging from surface waves to basin-wide current systems. Winds over 
the ocean modulate air-sea fluxes of heat, moisture, gases and particulates, 
regulating the crucial coupling between atmosphere and ocean that 
establishes and maintains global and regional climate. Measurements of 
surface wind velocity can be assimilated into regional and global 
numerical weather models, improving our ability to predicate future weather. 
As the only remote sensing systems able to provide accurate, frequent, 
high-resolution measurements of ocean surface wind speed and direction 
under both clear-sky and cloudy conditions, scatterometers will play an 
increasingly important role in oceanographic, meteorological and climatic 
studies during the 1990s and beyond. <P>

Scatterometers use a highly indirectly technique to measure wind velocity
over the ocean, since the atmospheric motions themselves do not 
substantially affect the radiation emitted and received by the radar. 
These instruments transmit microwave pulses and receive backscattered power 
from the ocean surface.  Changes in wind velocity cause changes in 
ocean surface roughness, modifying the radar cross section of the ocean 
and the magnitude of the backscattered power. Scatterometers measure 
this backscattered power, allowing estimation of the normalized radar 
cross section of the sea surface. Backscatter cross
section varies with both wind speed and direction when measured at moderate
incidence angles. Multiple, collocated, nearly simultaneous
normalized radar cross section measurement acquired from several detections can
thus be used to solve simultaneously for wind speed and direction. <P>

The first spaceborne scatterometer flew as part of the Skylab mission in
1973 and 1974, demonstrating that spaceborne scatterometers were 
indeed feasible. The Sea-sat-A Satellite Scatterometer (SASS) 
operated from June to October 19878 and proved that accurate wind 
velocity measurements could be made form
space. The SASS cross section measurements have been used to significantly
refine the empirical model relating backscatter to wind velocity, and the
SASS data have been applied to a variety of oceanographic and meteorological
studies. A single-swath scatterometer operating at C-band is presently
flying on the European Space Agency's Remote Sensing Satellite-1 mission.
When it is launched as part of the ADEOS mission in 1996, NSCAT will be
the first dual-swath, Ku-band scatterometer to fly since Seasat. Additional 
spaceborne scatterometers will be flown in the later 1990s on European and
U.S. spacecraft. <P>

<H2>The Role of Air-Sea Exchanges and Ocean Circulation in Climate Variability</H2><P>
<B>Principal Investigator</B> - <I> <A HREF="liu.html"> W. Timothy Liu </A> </I><P>

<H2>Perspective</H2>

  The ocean is forced at the surface largely through the exchanges of water,
momentum, and heat.  Without surface forcing, the ocean would just be a
dead pool of water.  The exchanges drive the transport and change the
storage of heat, water, and greenhouse gases and thus moderate the world's
climate.  The ocean feedback to climate changes must be manifested through
these exchanges, without which the Earth would be a more hostile habitat.
We need to study ocean circulation and air-sea exchanges to understand
natural global changes and to discern the anthropogenic effects.<P>

  The ocean is an under-sampled turbulent fluid with non-linear interactions;
processes at one scale affect processes at other scales.  Adequate
observations at significant temporal and spatial scales can only be
achieved from the vantage point of space.  A suite of complementary
spaceborne sensors is needed to unravel the complex processes of
ocean-atmosphere interaction.  Our study will demonstrate that the value of
flying the suite of sensors together continuously far outweighs the sum of
the benefits of flying individual sensor one at a time, the essence of the
<A HREF="http://spso.gsfc.nasa.gov/spso_homepage.html">EOS.</A> 
Spaceborne sensors, however, cannot probe deep ocean and, therefore,
in situ measurements are also needed.  Ocean general circulation models
have the potential of providing the dynamic interpolation and integration
of these data.  Our study will take advantage of the historic opportunity
created by the advance of computer technology and the maturity of ocean
general circulation models in the era of EOS sensors and data systems.<P>

<H2>Goal</H2>

  To improve diagnosis and prognosis of global changes through the
understanding of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system.<P>

<H2>Objectives</H2>

<UL>
<LI> To improve existing and to develop new methodologies for estimating
global ocean-atmosphere fluxes in momentum, energy, water, and carbon
dioxide.

<LI> To study the changes in the transport and storage of heat, water, and
greenhouse gases by the ocean in response to surface forcing.

<LI> To understand the energy and hydrologic balances of the atmosphere and
their relation with ocean surface fluxes.<P>
<BR></UL>

<H2> Strategy</H2>

  The strategy of our investigation evolves over time, but it is be based
largely on the synergistic and interdisciplinary approaches of applying
satellite data, ground-based measurements, and numerical models.<P>
<DL>
<DT> <I>Satellite Observations</I>
<DD> Our team has strong experience in estimating ocean surface forcing using
satellite data.  We are currently using SSMI and AVHRR to estimate
evaporation and latent heat; ISCCP to compute solar irradiance; GPCP
(Global Precipitation Climatology Project) to provide rain; and
scatterometer (ERS1) to derive wind stress.  We are also using altimeter
sea level (from Geosat and Topex), sea surface temperature (from AVHRR) to
study the ocean's dynamic and thermal responses.  In the near future, we
will continue to use operational data from AVHRR, TOVS, SSMI, SSMT2
(humidity sounding), ISCCP, and GPCP; from scatterometers and altimeters on
ERS1 and 2; from SeaWifs (ocean productivity); from NSCAT and OCTS on
ADEOS-1; from TRMM; from GLI and AMSR on ADEOS-2.  We are actively
preparing for the increase in accuracy and resolution of expected EOS
sensors, such as, SeaWinds, ocean altimeter, MIMR, AIRS (MHS), MODIS, CERES
at the turn of the century.<P>

<DT> <I>In Situ Monitoring and Field Campaign</I>
<DD>Our team members have participated in the design of in situ monitoring
programs and the execution of field campaigns for the Tropical Ocean of
Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Program and World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE).  We shall continue in the analysis of data from experiments, such
as, TOGA-COARE (Couple Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment) and are
actively planning and will participate in new programs, such as, the Global
Drifter Program and the Atlantic Climate Change Experiment.<P>
<DT><I>Global Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM)</I>
<DD>Eddy-resolving OGCM with realistic thermodynamics are being studied.
Realistic surface forcing derived from satellite data is being used to
force the OGCM, and the model responses are being compared with
observations both from spaceborne and ground based sensors.  We will learn
to interpret the difference in terms of specific physical processes and
model weakness.  Data assimilation techniques are being vigorously pursued,
both for improving model performance and for interpolation and integration
of data.  Surface flux derived inversely by constraining the model with
data will also be examined.  We plan to extend our study to coupled
ocean-atmosphere models in the future.<P>

<H2>Recent Warming Event in the Pacific May or May Not Be an El Ni&ntilde;o</H2>

[From Liu et al., 1995: Eos, Trans. of Amer. Geophys. Union, 76, No. 43,
P. 429 and 437.] <P>
 
<center><IMG SRC="GIF/nino94.gif"></center> <P>

A recent anomalous warming event in the tropical Pacific consists of a
series of intraseanal episodes, observations from four spaceborne sensors
and simulation by an ocean general circulation model show.  The figure
includes time-longitude variations, along the equator, of the 1994-1993
difference in (a) zonal wind component, (b) sea level, (c) sea surface
temperature, and (d) atmospheric water-vapor, as derived from spacebased
observations and corresponding simulation of sea level (e) and sea surface
temperature (f) by the Modular Ocean Model developed at the Geophysical
=46luid Dynamics Laboratory when forced by realistic wind.  The vertical axis
represents time in months; the horizontal axis represents longitude, 
running from Indonesia, across the Pacific, to the
Galapagos Islands.  The zonal wind component is derived from observations
by the microwave scatterometer on the European spacecraft ERS-1.  The
sea-surface height is derived from the observations by the microwave
altimeter on the joint U.S.-French Topex/Poseidon Mission.  The sea-surface
temperature is produced through optimal interpolation of data from the
Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer blended with in situ data.  The
atmospheric integrated water vapor is derived from observations by the
Special Sensor Microwave Imager. <P>
 
Along the equator, the Trade Wind usually blows from east to west and
should be negative, following our convention.  Four distinct groups of
equatorial westerly (positive) wind anomalies near the date line were
observed by the scatterometer from July through December 1994.  The wind
anomalies initiated eastward-propagating, downwelling Kelvin waves. These
waves, in turn, caused a rise in sea-level that was registered by the
altimeter. Surface-warming episodes related to the Kelvin waves were
observed by a visible-infrared radiometer.  Anomalous integrated water
vapor observed by the microwave radiometer indicate that the westerly wind
and warming episodes are also associated with enhanced atmospheric
convection.  The observed variations in sea level and sea surface
temperature anomalies agree with simulation by an ocean general circulation
model when forced by realistic winds, both in time and location but with
slightly different magnitudes. <P>
 
Unlike the El Ni&ntilde;o events of the 1980s, equatorial warming events in the
1990s are more frequent, last for shorter periods, and are less intense.
Whether the 1994 warming can be classified as an El Ni&ntilde;o is being debated.
The realistic simulation provides a theoretic link between the observed
forcing and responses and will help to further our understanding in the
interaction between the episodic changes associated with Kelvin waves and
the low-frequency changes of El Ni&ntilde;o.  <A HREF="NSCAT.html"> The NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) Project</A> 
which is scheduled to be launched in August 1996 will provide improved wind field. <P>

<center><IMG SRC="GIF/thermal.gif"><P></center>

The distributions of correlation coefficient between monthly-mean sea
surface temperature tendency (time differential) and 7 years of surface
solar irradiance (upper figure) and 4 years of latent heat flux (lower figure)
indicate that solar heating and evaporative cooling have a strong influence on
the seasonal variation of sea surface temperature over most of the ocean.  The
low correlation along the equatorial waveguide in the upper figure delineate
the region where ocean dynamic is more important than surface heating.<P>  
The solar irradiance is derived from cloud information provided by the
International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) and the
latent heat flux is derived using wind and humidity from the Special
Sensor Microwave Imager <A HREF="http://wwwdaac.msfc.nasa.gov/wetnet/wetnet.html">
(SSMI)</A> and sea surface temperature from the 
Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer <A HREF="http://sst-www.jpl.nasa.gov/">
(AVHRR)</A>.  A combination of satellite data available from the Earth
Observing System Data and Information System
<A HREF="http://harp.gsfc.nasa.gov:1729/eosdis_documents/">(EOSDIS)</A>
help to provide unprecedented visualization of
the thermodynamics coupling of the global ocean and atmosphere.  Details

Typhoon Violet is revealed by the wind vectors (dark arrows) and the
precipitable water (color image) on 21 September 1996, just before it hits
the Honshu Island of Japan, causing damage and death.  The wind  and water
vapor are derived from the observations by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration Scatterometer [NSCAT] on the Japanese Advanced Earth
Observing Satellite [ADEOS] and the Special Sensor Microwave / Imager
[SSM/I] on the operational spacecraft, F-13, of the Defense Meteorological
Space Program, along their respective ascending orbits which are roughly
five hours apart.  Since the start of ocean observing mode on 15 September,
NSCAT has observed the evolution of Violet from a tropical cyclone into an
extratropical storm with developing frontal structure (in the northeast),
increasing asymetry, and intrusion of drier air into the core.<P>
 
The overlay of wind on precipitable water dramatically visualizes not only
the structure of this evolving system, but also the relation between the
dynamics and the hydrologic balance in the mesoscale.  The figure also
demonstrates the capability of microwave sensors under both clear and
cloudy conditions.  The detailed structure of the wind-field also
illustrates the high spatial resolution of NSCAT.

<H2>Surface Wind and Pressure Around Tropical Cyclone Observed by a Scatterometer </H2>
<IMG SRC="GIF/rainbow.gif"></A><P>

<center><IMG SRC="GIF/pressure.gif"></center><P>

The figure demonstrated that the high spatial resolution of spacebased scatterometer
observations are useful in monitoring the location and intensity of tropical cyclone (also called typhoon
in East Asia or hurricane in N. America). Spaceborne scatterometer can penetrate the cloudy region 
around tropical cyclones and resolve the surface wind velocity and pressure field in detail
over data sparse ocean. <P>

This figure shows tropical cyclone Olive during the Austral summer of 1992, located in the
southern tropical Pacific (northest of Australia) where surface observations are sparse.
The bottom figure shows the operational weather prediction products of European Center for 
Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF); the color image is the surface pressure field, the arrows
represent the surface wind velocities, and the isobars are in white. In the upper figure, the 
surface wind vectors are from ERS-1 scatterometer and the pressure field is derived from the 
scatterometer wind field by using the planetary boundary layer model by Brown and Liu (1982) together 
with a gradient wind formula. In the ECMWF results, the center of the low pressure is dislocated 
from the center of the cyclonic flow. The improvement by the scatterometer observations are obvious.
<P>

Details of the results are described in Hsu and Liu (J. Geophys. Res., 101, 17021-17027, 1996).

This image shows ocean surface wind speeds and directions over the Pacific
Ocean on 21 September 1996, 12 UTC, derived from observations by the NASA
Scatterometer (NSCAT) onboard Japan's Advanced Earth Observing Satellite
(ADEOS).  The background color indicates wind speed and the white arrows
show the direction of the wind.  The basin-wide wind field is typical of
near-Equinox atmospheric circulation.  The strong (red color)Trade Winds
blow steadily from the cooler subtropical ocean to the warm water of the
Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) located just north the Equator.
Instead of blowing in the north-south direction, the winds are deflected
westward by the Corriolis Force due to the Earth's rotation.  The air rises
over the warm water of ITCZ and sinks in the subtropics at the Horse
Latitudes, forming the Hadley Circulation.  Both the convergence area at
the ITCZ and the divergence area at the Horse Latitudes are indicated by
low wind speed of blue color.  In the mid-latitudes, the high vorticity due
to strong Corriolis Force generates cyclones (yellow spirals) moving in the
eastward direction.  Two typhoons are observed in the western Pacific.
Typhoon Violet is just south of Japan.  After these data were taken,
Typhoon Violet struck the East Coast of Japan causing damage and deaths.
Typhoon Tom is located further east and did not land.
<P>
 
The image is based on preliminary processing of the first set of NSCAT
observations, using prelaunch model function and calibration. The NSCAT
data is objectively interpolated into 12 hourly and 1 degree longitude by
1 degree latitude grids, using the methodology described by Tang and Liu [JPL
Publication 96-19, 1996], but with no other data used for initialization.
This preliminary analysis clearly demonstrates that the high spatial
resolution of NSCAT and its observing capability under cloudy conditions
improve the monitoring of sever storms, such as typhoon, whose location and
intensity are usually not well-defined by conventional methods.  It also
shows that the repeated global coverage provides a better description of
atmospheric circulation over ocean, which has not been adequately sampled
in the past.

<H2>Anomalous Ocean Response to Wind Forcing in the tropical Pacific 1987-1990</H2>
<IMG SRC="GIF/rainbow.gif"><P>

<IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="GIF/wind_forcing.gif"> <P>

<I>[From Liu, W.T., W. Tang, and R. Atlas, 1996: Responses of the tropical
Pacific to wind forcing as observed by spaceborne sensors and simulated by
an ocean general circulation model  [J. Geophys. Res., 101, 16,345-16,359,
1996]</I> <P>
 
Satellite observations, in situ measurements, and model simulations are
combined to assess the oceanic response to surface wind forcing in the
equatorial Pacific.  The surface wind fields derived from observations by
the spaceborne Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI) and from the
operational products of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF) are compared.  The top figure shows significant mean
difference between the two wind-stress fields.  When SSMI winds are used to
force a primitive-equation ocean general circulation model (OGCM), they
produce 3C more surface cooling than ECMWF winds for the eastern
equatorial Pacific during the cool phase of an El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) event, as shown in the middle figure.  The stronger cooling by SSMI
winds is in good agreement with measurements at the moored buoys and
observations by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).
While the most significant wind differences are found off the equator
(centered at 15N and 5S), the largest differences in ocean temperature
responses are found on the equator and below the surface (as shown in the
bottom figure).  The bottom figure, together with the heat budget analysis
using OGCM simulated data under different winds, infers that vertical heat
advection and uplifting of the thermocline are the dominant factors in the
anomalous cooling of the ocean mixed layer.  The results of this study
indicate that the spacebased winds are superior to winds from weather
prediction model in forcing realistic oceanic response, particularly the
sea surface anomalies during an ENSO event.  The study demonstrates certain
maturity and also deficiency in OGCM, and identifies the dominant mechanism
for anomalous upper ocean cooling in the 1980s (which may be different from
the events in 1990s as discussed by Liu et al., 1996, Eos, 76, 429 and
437).  It is an example of combining spacebased ocean observing sensors and
OGCM for significant contribution to our understanding of
seasonal-to-interannual variability and predictability.
<P>
<I>Figure Caption</I><BR>
The top figures shows the distribution of the absolute value of Student's t
which is the mean difference between SSMI and ECMWF zonal wind stresses
divided by the standard error.  The areas where the mean difference has
more than 1% probability to come by pure chance from wind stresses of equal
means are colored.  The middle figure shows a comparison of first-level
(5-m) temperatures produced by the OGCM, when forced by SSMI and ECMWF
winds, with AVHRR and buoy SST at a location along the equator.  The
climatological annual cycle derived from the AVHRR SST is also shown.  The
bottom figure shows the time-depth variation of the difference between OGCM
temperature simulations under SSMI and ECMWF winds.

<B>A KEY, AN ENVELOPE --</B> Both are historic means for communicating
 privately and protecting personal information.  Today, encryption tools provide this
 privacy in the electronic world.<P>

The Golden Key Campaign is being launched to raise awareness and support
for the preservation of the right to communicate privately and the
availability of new techniques which make it possible.<P>

Privacy, a fundamental human right, has been affirmed by the US Supreme 
Court, the constitutions and laws of many countries, and the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Privacy must be preserved as we 
move from paper to electronic communications.<P>

<HR WIDTH=40%>
<BR>

<B>JOIN THE GOLDEN KEY CAMPAIGN --</B> Display the logo, link to a Golden Key 
site, and show your support for private communication online.<P>

The <B>Internet Privacy Coalition</B> is urging members of the net community to
 display 
a Golden Key & Envelope symbol on their Web pages to show support for the 
right of privacy and the freedom to use <B>good tools of privacy without 
government restraints.</B><P>

We have chosen a key and envelope because we are all familiar with
these privacy tools in the physical world. Throughout history we have
recognized that individuals and organizations need the ability and the 
have <B>the right to build bonds of trust,</B> to protect new ideas and
 confidential information, and to promote the growth of smaller communities within the 
larger society.<P>

Today, we look to new tools to protect the privacy and security of
information in the on-line world.  As electronic communications
technology develops, <B>tools that enable privacy,</B> including anonymity
and authentication, are also being developed, offering historic privacy 
benefits in the new medium to individuals, organizations, and businesses
around the world.<P>

Presently, many <B>governments are trying to understand</B> how to apply and
interpret privacy laws and rights in the new electronic world.  During
this time, <B>individuals and corporations should join in the discussion</B> 
and debate to ensure that sensible policies result.<P>

We do not object to the right of government to conduct lawful investigation. 
We recognize that <B>the enforcement of law is a central concern</B> in every 
democratic society. But no government has the right to restrict the ability 
of its citizens to make use of tools to protect their own privacy. Nor should 
any  government put crime investigation before crime prevention.<P>

The <B>explosive growth of the Internet</B> and online communications requires 
that governments  re-examine and remove policies that evolved in 
era that has now passed. Cryptography and the tools of privacy are now 
the tools of commerce, and are the electronic keys and envelopes of 
the information age.<P>

We must promote privacy and security on the Internet, and other online 
services and networks, through public availability of strong encryption and 
the deregulation of cryptography.<P>

<B>If you share our goals,</B> please display a Golden Key & Envelope logo on
your Web pages or other online offerings, and express your support for the 
Golden Key Campaign.  An electronic version of the Golden Key symbol is 
available at over 1000 sites, including the following locations:<P>

<PRE>


IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES


Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. PRESSLER, Mr. LEAHY, Mr.
DOLE, Mr.FAIRCLOTH, Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. McCAIN, Mr.
WYDEN, Mr. ASHCROFT and Mr. NICKLES) introduced the
following bill which was read twice and referred to the
Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.


                             A BILL

To promote electronic commerce by facilitating the use of 
       strong encryption, and for other purposes.

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the "Promotion of Commerce
On-Line
in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996"

SEC.2.FINDING;PURPOSE

   (a) FINDINGS.___ The Congress finds the following:
          
           (1) The ability to digitize information makes
        carrying out tremendous amounts of commerce and 
        personal communication electronically possible.
           (2) Miniaturization, disturbed computing, and
        reduced transmission costs make communication via
        electronic networks a reality.
           (3) The explosive growth in the Internet and 
        other computer networks reflects the potential
        growth of electronic commerce and personal
        communication.
           (4) The Internet and the global information
        infrastructure have the potential to revolutionize
        the way individuals and businesses conduct business.
           (5) The full potential of the Internet for the
        conduct of business cannot be realized as long as it 
        is an insecure medium in which confidential business
        information and sensitive personal information       
        remains at risk of unauthorized viewing, alteration,
        and use.
           (6) Encryption of information enables busi-
        nesses and individuals to protect themselves against
        the unauthorized viewing, alteration, and use of 
        information by employing widely understood and  
        readily available science and technology to ensure
        the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of
        information.
           (7) In order to promote economic growth and
        meet the needs of businesses and individuals in the
        United States, a variety of encryption products and
        programs should be available to promote good, flexi-
        ble, and commercially acceptable encryption capab-
        ilities.
           (8) United States computer, computer software and
        hardware, communications and electronics business are      
  
        leading the world technology revolution as those
        businesses have developed and are prepared to offer 
        immediately to computer users worldwide a variety of 
        communications and computers hardware and computer
        software  that provide good, robust, and easy-to-use
        encryption.
           (9) United States businesses seek to market the
        products described in paragraph(8) in competition
        with scores of foreign businesses in many countries
        that offer similar, and frequently stronger, encryp-
        tion products and programs.
            (10) UNITED STATES businesses have been
discouraged
        from further developing and marketing products with 
        encryption capabilities because of regulatory efforts
        by the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the 
        National Institute Os Standards and Technology, to
        promulgate standards and guidelines in support of 
        government-designed solutions to encryption problems 
        that
              (A) were not developed in the private sector;
                  and
              (B) have not received widespread commercial
                  support.
          (11) Because of outdated Federal controls, United
        States businesses have been prohibited from exporting
        goods encryption products and programs.
          (12) The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the
        National Institute of Standards and Technology on the     
        part of the President has attempted to leverage the     
        desire of United States businesses to sell commercial
        products to the United States Government, and sell a
        single product worldwide, to force the businesses to
        include features in products sold by the businesses in 
        the United States and in foreign countries that will    
        allow the Federal Government easy access to the plain 
        text of all electronic information and communications.       
 
          (13) Specifically, the Secretary of Commerce, acting
        through the National Institute of Standards and  
        Technology, has proposed that United states businesses  
        be allowed to sell products and programs offering good  
        encryption to the United States Government, and in  
        foreign countries only if the products and programs 
        inside a feature guaranteeing the Federal 
        Government access to a key that decrypts information
        (hereafter in this section referred to as "key escrow  
        encryption")
          (14) The key escrow encryption approach to regulating 
        encryption is reflected in the approval in 1994 by the 
        National Institute of Standards and Technology of a 
        Federal information processing standard for the 
        "clipper chip", that was flawed and controversial.
          (15) The Federal Government-
               (A) has designed key escrow encryption to solve 
                   a perceived problem: and
               (B) has ignored the fact that-
                   (i) there is no demonstrated commercial 
                      demand for features which give 
                      governments easy access to information; 
                      and  
                   (ii) numerous nonkey escrow encryption
                      alternatives are available commercially 
                      from foreign suppliers and free of charge
                      from the Internet.
          (16) In order to promote electronic commerce in the
               twenty-first century to realize the full 
               potential of the Internet and other computer
               networks-            
               (A) United States businesses should be       
                   encouraged to develop and market products
                   and programs offering encryption 
                   capabilities; and 
               (B) the Federal Government should be prohibited
                   from promulgating regulations and adopting
                   policies that discourage the use and sale of
                   encryption.
   (b) PURPOSE- The purpose of this Act is to promote
electronic
commerce through the use of strong encryption by-
          (1) recognizing that businesses in the United States 
        that offer computer hardware and computer software made 
        in the United States that incorporate encryption
        technology are ready and immediately able, with respect 
        to electronic information that will be essential to
        conducting business in the twenty-first century to-
               (A) protect the confidentiality of that
                   information: and
               (B) ensure the authenticity and integrity
                   of that information;
          (2) restricting the Department of Commerce with
        respect to the promulgation or enforcement of regulations,
        or the application of policies, that impose government-
        designed encryption standards; and     
          (3) promoting the ability of United States businesses
        to sell to computer users worldwide computer software
and
        computer hardware that provide the strong encryption
        demanded by such users by-
               (A) restricting Federal or State regulation of the
                   sale of such products and programs in
                   interstate commerce;
               (B) prohibiting mandatory key escrow encryption
                   systems; and
               (C) establishing conditions for the sale of
                   encryption products and programs in foreign
                   commerce.

Subject: Open Letter to Internet Community From Senator Burns<BR>
From: senburns@aol.com (Sen Burns)<BR>

OPEN LETTER TO THE INTERNET COMMUNITY<P>

May 2, 1996<P>

Dear friends:<P>

As an Internet user, you are no doubt aware of some of the hurdles the
federal government has put up that limit the growth and full potential of
exciting, emerging technologies.  One of the most egregious of these has
been the governmentally set limits on so-called "encryption" technologies.
 Today I am introducing a bill to address this major problem for
businesses and users of the Internet.<P> 

If the telecommunications law enacted this year is a vehicle to achieve
real changes in the ways we interact with each other electronically, my
bill is the engine that will allow this vehicle to move forward.  The bill
would promote the growth of electronic commerce, encourage the widespread
availability to strong privacy and security technologies for the Internet,
and repeal the out-dated regulations prohibiting the export of encryption
technologies.<P>

This legislation is desperately needed because the Clinton administration
continues to insist on restricting encryption exports, without regard to
the harm this policy has on American businesses' ability to compete in the
global marketplace or the ability of American citizens to protect their
privacy online.  Until we get the federal government out of the way and
encourage the development of strong cryptography for the global market,
electronic commerce and the potential of the Internet will not be
realized.<P>

The last thing the Net needs are repressive and outdated regulations
prohibiting the exports of strong privacy and security tools and making
sure that the government has copies of the keys to our private
communications.  Yet this is exactly the situation we have today.<P>

My new bill, the Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era
(Pro-CODE) Act of 1996, would:<P>

- Allow for the unrestricted export of "mass-market" or "public-domain"
encryption programs, including such products as Pretty Good Privacy and
popular World Wide Web browsers.<P>

- Require the Secretary of Commerce to allow the unrestricted export of
other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are
generally available outside the United States.<P>

- Prohibit the federal government from imposing mandatory key-escrow
encryption policies on the domestic market and limit the authority of the
Secretary of Commerce to set standards for encryption products.<P>

Removing export controls will dramatically increase the domestic
availability of strong, easy-to-use privacy and security products and
encourage the use of the Internet as a forum of secure electronic
commerce. It will also undermine the Clinton Administration's "Clipper"
proposals which have used export restrictions as leverage to impose
policies that guarantee government access to our encryption keys.<P>

The Pro-CODE bill is similar to a bill I co-authored with Senator Patrick
Leahy of Vermont, except that it highlights the importance of encryption
to electronic commerce and the need to dramatically change current policy
to encourage its growth.  My bill does not add any new criminal provisions
and does not establish legal requirements for key-escrow agents.<P>

Over the coming months, I plan to hold hearings on this bill and encourage
a public debate on the need to change the Clinton Administration's
restrictive export control policies.  I will need your support as we move
forward towards building a global Internet that is good for electronic
commerce and privacy.  I look forward to working with the Internet
community, online activists, and the computer and communications industry
as this proposal moves through Congress.<P>

I'd like to hear from you, so please join me on two upcoming online events
to talk about the new bill.  The first is on America Online in the News
Room auditorium at 9 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on May 6.  The second will
be on Hotwired's Chat at 9 p.m. EDT on May 13.<P>

In the meantime, I need your help in supporting the effort to repeal
cryptography export controls.  You can find out more by visiting my web
page http://www.senate.gov/~burns/.  There you will find a collection of
encryption education resources that my Webmaster has assembled.  I trust
that the entire Internet community, from the old-timers to those just
starting to learn about encryption, will find this information useful.<P>

This bill is vital to all Americans, from everyday computer users and
businesses to manufacturers of computer software and hardware.  I very
much look forward to working with you on this issue.<P>

Conrad Burns<BR>
United States Senator<P>

Recently, I received the following letters by email from Central Europe.
The letters provides food for thought in our public debates over the role
of cryptography in the relationship between a government and its people.
With the sender's permission, I am releasing the letters to the public,
with the sender's name deleted, and some minor typos corrected.
This material may be reposted, unmodified, to any other Usenet newsgroups

Subject: Thanks from Central Europe
To: Philip Zimmermann <prz@ACM.ORG>

Dear Phil,

This is a short note to say a very big thank you for all your work with 
PGP.

We are part of a network of not-for-profit agencies, working among other 
things for human rights in the Balkans.  Our various offices have been 
raided by various police forces looking for evidence of spying or 
subversive activities.  Our mail has been regularly tampered with and our 
office in Romania has a constant wiretap.

Last year in Zagreb, the security police raided our office and 
confiscated our computers in the hope of retrieving information about the 
identity of people who had complained about their activites.

In every instance PGP has allowed us to communicate and protect 
our files from any attempt to gain access to our material as we PKZIP 
all our files and then use PGP's conventional encryption facility to 
protect all sensitive files.

Without PGP we would not be able to function and protect our client 
group.  Thanks to PGP I can sleep at night knowing that no amount of 
prying will compromise our clients.

I have even had 13 days in prison for not revealing our PGP pass phrases,
but it was a very small price to pay for protecting our clients.

I have always meant to write and thank you, and now I am finally doing 
it.  PGP has a value beyond all words and my personal gratitude to you is 
immense.  Your work protects the innocent and the weak, and as such 
promotes peace and justice, quite frankly you deserve the biggest medal 
that can be found. 

Please be encouraged that PGP is a considerable benefit people in need, 
and your work is appreciated.

Could you please tell us where in Europe we can find someone who can 
tell us more about using PGP and upgrades etc.  If you can't tell us 
these details because of the export restriction thing, can you point us 
at someone who could tell us something without compromising you.

Many thanks.

  [ I sent him a response and asked him if I could disclose his inspiring
    letter to the press, and also possibly use it in our ongoing
    legislative debates regarding cryptography if the opportunity arises
    to make arguments in front of a Congressional committee.  I also
    asked him to supply some real examples of how PGP is used to protect
    human rights.  He wrote back that I can use his letters if I delete
    his organization's name "to protect the innocent".  Then he sent me
    the following letter.  --PRZ ]

>From: [name and email address deleted] 
Subject: More News from [Central Europe]
To: Philip Zimmermann <prz@ACM.ORG>

Dear Phil,

I have been thinking of specific events that might be of use to your 
Congressional presentation.  I am concerned that our brushes with 
Governments might be double-edged in that Congress might not like the 
idea of Human Rights groups avoiding Police investigation, even if such 
investigations violated Human Rights.

However we have one case where you could highlight the value of PGP to 
"Good" citizens, we were working with a young woman who was being 
pursued by Islamic extremists.  She was an ethnic Muslim from Albania who 
had converted to Christianity and as a result had been attacked, raped 
and threatened persistently with further attack.

We were helping to protect her from further attack by hiding her in 
Hungary, and eventually we helped her travel to Holland, while in 
Holland she sought asylum, which was granted after the Dutch Government 
acknowledged that she was directly threatened with rape, harrassment and 
even death should her whereabouts be known to her persecutors.

Two weeks before she was granted asylum, two armed men raided our office 
in Hungary looking for her, they tried to bring up files on our 
computers but were prevented from accessing her files by PGP.  They took 
copies of the files that they believed related to her, so any simple 
password or ordinary encryption would eventually have been overcome. 
They were prepared to take the whole computer if necessary so the only 
real line of defence was PGP.

Thanks to PGP her whereabouts and her life were protected.  This incident 
and the young woman's circumstances are well documented.

We have also had other incidents where PGP protected files and so 
protected innocent people.  If the US confirms the dubious precedent of 
denying privacy in a cavalier fashion by trying to deny people PGP , it 
will be used as a standard by which others will then engineer the 
outlawing of any privacy.  Partial privacy is no privacy.  Our privacy 
should not be by the grace and favour of any Government.  Mediums that 
ensured privacy in the past have been compromised by advances in 
technology, so it is only fair that they should be replaced by other 
secure methods of protecting our thoughts and ideas, as well as 
information.

I wish you well with your hearing.

Yours most sincerely

<A HREF="gopher://dosfan.lib.uic.edu:70/1D-1%3A8932%3A1994%20Report">Full State Department Report</A>
<p>
</CENTER>
<p>
<b>AFGHANISTAN</b><p>
<p>
Widespread forced entry into homes and looting occurred in the northern cities
of Mazar-i-Sharif and Kunduz early in the year during intense fighting there.
There were fewer reports of looting in Kabul compared with 1993, probably
because much of the city was in ruins and many items of value had already been
carried off.  A U.N. facility in Mazar-i-Sharif and the Pakistani Embassy in
Kabul were ransacked in early 1994.  The Afghanistan National Archives were
looted in May.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ALBANIA</b><p>
<p>
The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions states that Albania guarantees "the
human rights and fundamental freedoms as accepted in international documents."
The Law on Fundamental Freedoms and Human Rights addresses protections
associated with privacy, family, home, and correspondence.<p>
<p>
Although Article 16 provides for protection of the home from arbitrary entry or
search, the Penal Code permits warrantless searches for weapons.  Article 17
calls for privacy of correspondence except "for a judgment in the interest of
criminal proceedings or by the approval of a competent government body,
assigned by law, in cases where it (encroachment) is considered indispensable
for reasons of national security."<p>
<p>
The Government is considering plans to open and examine the files of the
Sigurimi (the former secret police of the Communist regime), but no legislation
has been passed, and the files remain under the control of the SHIK.  Senior
government officials have indicated that not all files are intact and some may
have been tampered with in the final days of the Communist regime.  The AHC is
concerned that information from the files may have been used for political
purposes and protested the lack of legislation on their disposition.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ALGERIA</b><p>
<p>
Although the Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, the state
of emergency authorizes regional governors to issue exceptional search warrants
at any time.  Security forces often enter residences illegally.  The Government
fails to ensure that the police adhere to lawful procedures for entering houses
or monitoring correspondence.  In addition, there were increasingly frequent
incidents of entry into private homes by armed opposition elements, either to
kidnap residents or to steal weapons or valuables.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ANDORRA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides safeguards against arbitrary interference with
"privacy, honor, and reputation," and the authorities honor these.  No searches
of any private premises may be conducted without a juridically issued warrant.
The law also protects private communications.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ANGOLA</b><p>
<p>
The Government routinely maintains surveillance of certain groups, such as
UNITA and other opposition National Assembly deputies, opposition party
leaders, known or suspected Angolan or foreign UNITA sympathizers, and foreign
diplomats.  The law requires judicial search warrants, and in practice the law
is respected.  However, as far as known there were no search warrants issued
before the roundup of Lebanese and other foreign businessmen in 1993.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The Constitution provides for these rights, and there were no reports of
arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.  The
police must obtain a warrant from an officer of the court before searching
private premises.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ARGENTINA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution prohibits the Government from interfering in the private lives
of its citizens, and the Government rarely does so.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ARMENIA</b><p>
<p>
Apart from the provisions of the International Covenant, there is no legal
protection for the privacy of citizens, their communications, and their
correspondence.  Procedurally, the Directorate of National Security must
petition the General Prosecutor's office for permission to tap a phone or
intercept correspondence.  The General Prosecutor's office purportedly must
find a compelling need for a wiretap before it will grant the agency permission
to proceed.  One of the leading opposition parties claimed to have discovered
unauthorized wiretaps on its office telephones, but there was no official
investigation of these allegations.<p>
<p>
There were many instances of interference with privacy during waves of army
conscription in 1994.  Military recruiters appeared at houses where draft-age
men were reported to live and often threatened or detained the occupants or
inflicted material damage.  They seized draft-age men in public places, such as
markets, theaters, and the subway.  There are credible reports that Armenian
and Nagorno-Karabakh officials forcibly conscripted refugees from
Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>AUSTRALIA</b><p>
<p>
By law, the authorities may not conduct searches without a judicially issued
warrant, and in practice they do not do so.  The Government respects the
privacy of family, home, and correspondence.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>AUSTRIA</b><p>
<p>
The law provides for the protection of personal data collected, processed, or
transmitted by government agencies, public institutions, or private entities.
The Constitution protects the secrecy of mail and telephone communications.  A
1991 law introduced permanent parliamentary control over the state police and
the military secret service.  Parliamentary subcommittees to oversee these
organs were established in September 1993.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>AZERBAIJAN</b><p>
<p>
The Soviet surveillance apparatus, reorganized as the Ministry of National
Security, became more active than under the previous Elcibey government.  It is
widely and credibly believed that the Ministry taps telephones, especially
those of foreigners and prominent political and business figures.  The police
have periodically raided the offices of opposition press and political parties
on the grounds of a search for illicit weapons.  The post-October emergency
legislation, extended in December by the legislature until early February 1995,
made explicit the right to conduct such searches.  The police also make
periodic sweeps in search of young men evading the draft.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>THE BAHAMAS</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure.  The law
usually requires a court order for entry into or search of a private residence,
but a police inspector or more senior police official may authorize a search
without a court order where probable cause of a weapons violation exists.  Such
an official may also authorize the search of a person (which extends to the
vehicle in which the person is traveling) without a court order should probable
cause exist for drug possession.  The Government neither censors mail nor
restricts receipt of foreign correspondence or publications.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BAHRAIN</b><p>
<p>
The law empowers the Ministry of Interior to authorize entry into private
premises without specific judicial authorization.  The authorities monitor some
domestic and international telephone calls and correspondence.  Police informer
networks are extensive and sophisticated.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BANGLADESH</b><p>
<p>
The law requires authorities to obtain a judicial warrant before entering a
home.  However, human rights monitors assert that the police rarely obtain
warrants and officers violating the procedure are not punished.<p>
<p>
In addition, the SPA permits searches without a warrant.  Some opposition
members and CHT tribal leaders maintain that the intelligence services
illegally monitor their telephones and mail.  Sheikh Hasina, leader of the
opposition Awami League, charged that the Government taps her telephones and
has her under surveillance.  The Government denied tapping her telephone, but
admitted that the "surveillance" was provided for her protection.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BARBADOS</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure, and the law
requires warrants to be issued before privately owned property may be entered
and searched.  The Government does not routinely interfere in the private lives
of its citizens.  Nonetheless, there continued to be credible reports that, in
response to increased drug-related crime, the police resorted to searches of
homes in certain neighborhoods, sometimes without warrants.  The Government
neither censors mail nor restricts the receipt of foreign correspondence or
publications.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BELARUS</b><p>
<p>
Electronic monitoring of residences and telephones reportedly continued.  The
KDB, the MVS, and certain border guard detachments have the right to request
permission to install wiretaps but must legally obtain a prosecutor's
permission before installing it.  Except in cases of pursuit, a prosecutorial
search warrant is needed in order to enter a private home.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>BELGIUM</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Freedom from arbitrary state interference with privacy is guaranteed by law and
respected in practice.  Search warrants issued by a judge are required unless
the inhabitants of a domicile agree to a search.<p>
<p>
In 1994 Parliament passed legislation under which law enforcement officials may
apply to a magistrate for permission to use wiretaps.  Permission is generally
granted only for limited periods of time and only for the investigation of
major crimes.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BELIZE</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the protection of personal property, privacy of
home and person, and recognition of human dignity, and the Government generally
honors these provisions.  The law requires police to obtain judicial warrants
before searching private property, except when they have a reasonable suspicion
that a crime is being committed and do not have time to obtain a warrant.  The
police observe this requirement in practice.  Customs officers do not need a
warrant to search private property.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BENIN</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for, and the Government respected in practice, the
inviolability of private property and the home, as well as the privacy of
personal correspondence and communications.  Police are required to obtain a
judicial warrant before entering a private home, a requirement observed in
practice.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BHUTAN</b><p>
<p>
There are no laws providing for these rights, but cultural traditions are
highly respectful of personal privacy.  However, the Government has undermined
these traditions by its emphasis on promoting national integration.  For
example, a royal decree issued in 1989 made Drukpa national dress compulsory
for all citizens.  Anyone found violating the decree may be fined or sentenced
to jail for a week.  Although observance of the decree is lax, there are
occasional drives to stiffen enforcement, which exposes ethnic Nepalese to
intimidation.  According to human rights groups, police regularly conduct
house-to-house searches for suspected dissidents without explanation or legal
justification.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BOLIVIA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the sanctity of the home and the privacy of
citizens' lives, and the Government usually respected these provisions.  There
were credible allegations of UMOPAR abuses, including thefts of property from
homes and illegal searches.  Opponents charged that security services conducted
illegal phone taps and other surveillance; these charges could not be
confirmed.  The Government respects the rights of individuals to determine
family size, religion, and political affiliations.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA</b><p>
<p>
The Republic's Constitution provides for the right to privacy, protection of
the family and of children, and property.  Governmental respect for these
rights was the rule rather than the exception in 1994.  Bosnian authorities
attempted to monitor communications that impinged on military or other national
security concerns.<p>
<p>
Local Serbian authorities in Serb-occupied territories in Sarajevo, such as
Grbavica, instituted a policy of summarily confiscating the property of
mixed-marriage couples with sons who had either fled abroad or to Federation
territory.  According to a credible observer, Serbian authorities in Grbavica
threatened to confiscate the property of a mixed Serb-Muslim family whose son
fled from Grbavica to Bosnian-controlled Sarajevo and who was dating a loyalist
Serb, if the son did not return to fight for a "Greater Serbia."  There are
five other mixed families living in the same building with sons who have fled,
who also were threatened with having their property confiscated unless their
sons acceded to the draft.<p>
<p>
The persistence of the Serbian policy of ethnic cleansing constituted sustained
arbitrary interference with family and home.  Serbs continued to enter Bosnian
and Croatian homes in Serb-held territory without search warrants.  In the
towns of Banja Luka, Bijeljina, and Rogatica, the pattern of ethnic cleansing
usually began with unauthorized entry into non-Serb homes by the BSA, Serbian
police, or other paramilitary forces who demanded weapons and threatened
residents with violence if they did not leave.  In the village of Janja, in the
Bijeljina township, Serbs regularly placed Serbian refugee families in Muslim
homes, forcing the owners to live in one room.  In general, in Serb-occupied
Bosnia, police powers were intrusive and only minimally restricted by law or
custom.  Letters carried through Serbian lines were regularly opened.<p>
<p>
In addition to forcible eviction, extortion, and robbery, Bosnian Serb
authorities routinely harassed and terrorized non-Serbs in Serb-held
territories by breaking into homes with dynamite and threatening to blow up the
occupants; by destroying graveyards so that deceased family members had to be
buried in family gardens; and by destroying farm animals and crops to starve
out the population.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BOTSWANA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the protection of privacy and the security of the
person, and the Government respects these rights.  While judicial search
warrants are normally required, police officers above the rank of sergeant may
enter, search, and seize property if they have reasonable grounds to suspect
that evidence might be destroyed or that a crime is in progress.  Evidence
gathered without a search warrant is admissible in court, but judges may and do
disqualify such evidence if it can be shown that the police had time to obtain
a warrant.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BRAZIL</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary intrusion into the home.
There were no reports of illegal entry for political reasons, but illegal entry
into homes without a warrant occurs in searches for criminal suspects.  A
women's rights group in the city of Porto Alegre reported suspected police
involvement in five break-ins at its offices--each time its files on spousal
abuse and finances were ransacked.  Wiretaps are unconstitutional except when
authorized by a judicial authority for purposes of criminal investigation and
prosecution.  The inviolability of private correspondence is respected.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BRUNEI</b><p>
<p>
Although the law permits government intrusion into the privacy of individual
persons, families, or homes, this rarely happens.  There are sporadic reports
of mail having been opened prior to delivery.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BULGARIA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for inviolability of the home, protects the freedom
and confidentiality of correspondence, and provides for the right to choose
one's place of work and residence.  Parliament passed a bill in June regulating
the activities of the NSS, which is responsible for civilian
counterintelligence.  The law allows the Interior Minister to authorize
electronic surveillance for up to 24 hours without informing other government
agencies, if he determines there is imminent danger to national security.  Some
human rights groups asserted that the Government has carried out unjustified
surveillance of religious groups and of the outlawed Macedonian group
UMO-Ilinden (see Section 2.b.).  Labor leader Krustyo Petkov charged that
security services monitored union activities during the period before a
threatened general strike in May.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BURKINA FASO</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for these rights, and, in practice, the authorities
generally do not interfere in the daily lives of ordinary citizens.  In
national security cases, however, a special law permits surveillance, searches
and monitoring of telephones and private correspondence without a warrant.  By
law and under normal circumstances, homes may be searched only with the
authority of a warrant issued by the Minister of Justice.  Except in certain
cases, such as houses of prostitution and gambling dens, such warrants must be
executed during "legal hours," defined as between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>BURMA</b><p>
<p>
The military rules unchecked by any outside authority and the State continued
to interfere extensively and arbitrarily into the lives of private citizens.
Through its extensive intelligence network, the Government closely monitored
the travel, whereabouts, and activities of many citizens, particularly those
known to be politically active.  Security personnel selectively screened
private correspondence and telephone calls and conducted warrantless searches
of private premises.  Government employees were required to obtain advance
permission before meeting with foreigners.<p>
<p>
The SLORC continued to move people out of cities to peripheral new town
settlements throughout the country, albeit on a smaller scale than in past
years.  While facilities in some of these areas have improved over time,
residents targeted for displacement continued to be given no option but to
move, usually on short notice.  The military also continued to forcibly
relocate villages in rural areas, especially those with large ethnic minority
populations.<p>
<p>
Also, those able to remain in established cities and towns were subject to
arbitrary seizure of their property.  Many residents of Mandalay were compelled
early in the year to cede large parcels of prime downtown real estate to the
authorities for road-widening projects decided upon without any public
consultation or endorsement.  Widespread reports indicate the Mandalay city
government threatened to charge demolition costs to those in affected areas who
wavered in tearing down their own homes.  Beyond these seizures for public
purposes there were consistent reports of pressure being applied to force
individuals to cede parts of their property to government or military
officials, in some cases for these officials' personal use.  Automobiles and
other movable property also remained vulnerable to arbitrary seizure.  In rural
areas, military personnel confiscated livestock and food supplies during
periodic sweeps to procure porters.<p>
<p>

The Constitution provides for the right to privacy and the authorities
generally respect the law requiring search warrants.  Security forces can
monitor telephones and are commonly assumed to do so.<p>
<p>
<b>CAMBODIA</b><p>
<p>
According to human rights observers, the police routinely make arrests and
conduct searches without warrants.  However, the number of forced entries into
homes and offices decreased, after a high incidence during the 1993 political
campaign.  Reports of surveillance continued, but decreased as the security
apparatus of the SOC continued to be dismantled.  According to newspaper
reports, the Government often monitored private citizens' telephone calls and
asked telephone companies for records of conversations.  There were no reported
incidences of forced political party membership.  Persons in Khmer Rouge zones
are subject to rigid social controls and accorded no right to privacy.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CAMEROON</b><p>
<p>
Both invasions of the home and tampering with correspondence are illegal, but
there were numerous credible reports that police and gendarmes harassed
citizens and conducted searches without warrants.  Security forces, including
police, frequently set up roadblocks to extract bribes from travelers.  This
longstanding practice appears to have increased as the economy declined.  In
June a high-ranking CPDM official involved in a commercial dispute with a
foreign citizen, rather than resolve his dispute through legal means, employed
the police to seize the citizen's property unlawfully.  The foreign citizen
then sought redress through the courts.  At year's end, the dispute remained
before the courts without resolution.<p>
<p>
On August 23, the national police breached accepted diplomatic immunity in
forcibly entering U.S. Government diplomatic property (USAID and Administrative
Compound) in Yaounde, removing three vehicles and miscellaneous items.  The
bailiff claimed he had authority to seize the property pursuant to a court
decision.  The bailiff also claimed to have an order of execution (warrant)
signed by the Attorney General.  Police and bailiffs again forcibly entered the
grounds on August 26 and again attempted to seize U.S. Government property.
The Embassy in both instances protested vigorously this violation of diplomatic
immunity and twice received high-level apologies.  Government officials
repeatedly promised that the vehicles would be returned to the Embassy, but at
year's end their return was still pending.<p>
<p>
There were numerous credible reports that the Government kept some opposition
activists and dissidents under surveillance.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CANADA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution affords Canadians strong legal protection from arbitrary
interference, and federal and provincial governments generally do not interfere
with an individual's basic rights without due process.  Intrusive searches may
be carried out only when there is a demonstrable, reasonable basis for
presuming the affected person is involved in criminal activity.  Police
officials face judicial penalties for abuse of a person's privacy if they do
not obtain a judicial search warrant in advance.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CAPE VERDE</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the inviolability of domicile, correspondence,
and other means of communication, and the Government respects these rights in
practice.  The law requires a judicial warrant before homes may be searched.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC</b><p>
<p>
The Government rarely abused legal prohibitions on invasion of the home without
a warrant in civil and criminal cases.  Title IV of the Penal Code, which
covers certain political and security cases, allows police to search private
property without written authorization.  Early in the year, police conducted
such searches as part of investigations into illegal weapons caches.  In at
least one other attempt, when the police did not invoke national security
provisions, irate neighbors thwarted a politically inspired search.  The
Government used telephone monitoring to maintain a close watch on opposition
figures.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CHAD</b><p>
<p>
The Transitional Charter provides for citizens' rights to privacy of home and
correspondence, freedom from arbitrary arrest and search, and liberties of
association.  The Penal Code further stipulates that police may search homes
only during daylight hours and only with a legal warrant.  In practice,
security forces conducted searches without legal warrant, day and night.  In
some cases, they mistreated and extorted money from their victims.<p>
<p>
The Government also engaged in telephone surveillance of its citizens without
judicial supervision.<p>
<p>
<b>CHILE</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution prohibits searches of the home and  interception of private
communications, unless either a civilian or military court issues a search
warrant for specific locations.  The 1984 antiterrorist law allows court
supervised surveillance of those suspected of terrorist crimes, and for the
interception, opening, or recording of private communications and documents in
such cases.  Privacy laws do not permit the release of telephone records nor
the use of caller identification services.<p>
<p>
Since the return to civilian rule, there have been a number of incidents
involving supposed espionage.  In a 1992 political eavesdropping scandal, it
was clear that an army unit was recording cellular telephone conversations of
political leaders of all persuasions, including members of Congress.  While it
is against stated government policy to engage in this kind of political
espionage, it is not clear whether or not it continues.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CHINA</b><p>
<p>
Changes in the economic structure, including the growing diversity of
employment opportunities and the increasing market orientation of many work
units, are undermining the ability of the authorities to monitor and regulate
personal and family life as closely as in the past, particularly in rural
areas.  In urban areas, however, most people still depend on their
government-linked work unit for housing, permission to have a child, approval
to apply for a passport, and other aspects of ordinary life.  The work unit,
along with the neighborhood committee, is charged with monitoring activities
and attitudes.<p>
<p>
Although the law requires search warrants before security forces can search
premises, this provision is often ignored.  In addition, both the Public
Security Bureau and procuracy apparently can issue search warrants on their own
authority.  The 1982 Constitution states that "freedom and privacy of
correspondence of citizens ... are protected by law," but in practice,
authorities record some telephone conversations and some mail is opened and
censored.  Government security organs monitor and sometimes restrict contact
between foreigners and Chinese citizens, particularly dissidents.  Rules issued
in July implementing the State Security Law define "activities of individuals
outside the country (including non-Chinese citizens resident in China) who
disregard dissuasion and meet with personnel in the country who have endangered
state security or who are seriously suspected of endangering state security" as
a violation of the State Security Law.<p>
<p>
The Government has continued its effort to control citizens' access to outside
sources of information, selectively jamming Chinese language broadcasts of the
Voice of America (VOA) and British Broadcasting Corporation.  The effectiveness
of the jamming varies considerably by region, with audible signals of VOA and
other broadcasters reaching most parts of China.<p>
<p>
China's population has roughly doubled in the past 40 years to 1.18 billion
people.  In the 1970's and 1980's, China adopted a comprehensive and highly
intrusive one-child family planning policy.  This policy most heavily affects
Han Chinese in urban areas.  Urban couples seldom obtain permission to have a
second child.  However, exceptions are allowed for the 70 percent of Han who
live in rural areas, and ethnic minorities are subject to less stringent
population controls.  Enforcement of the family planning policy is
inconsistent, varying widely from place to place and year to year.<p>
<p>
The population control policy relies on education, propaganda, and economic
incentives, as well as more coercive measures, including psychological pressure
and economic penalties.  Rewards for couples who adhere to the policy include
monthly stipends and preferential medical and educational benefits.
Disciplinary measures against those who violate the policy include fines,
withholding of social services, demotion, and other administrative punishments,
such as loss of employment.  Unpaid fines have sometimes resulted in
confiscation or destruction of personal property.  Because penalties for excess
births can be levied against local officials and the mothers' work units, many
individuals are affected, providing multiple sources of pressure.<p>
<p>
Physical compulsion to submit to abortion or sterilization is not authorized,
but Chinese officials acknowledge privately that there are instances of forced
abortions and sterilizations.  Officials maintain that, when discovered,
responsible officials are disciplined and undergo retraining.  They admit,
however, that stronger punishment is rare.  Individuals can also sue officials
who have exceeded their authority in implementing family planning policy, but
government officials have not provided data on the number of successful suits
on these grounds.<p>
<p>
Regulations forbid sex-selective abortion, but because of the traditional
preference for male children, particularly in rural areas, some families have
used ultrasound to identify and abort female fetuses.  Use of ultrasound for
this purpose was specifically prohibited by the Maternal and Child Health Law
passed in October, which prescribes penalties for medical practitioners who
violate this provision.  The Chinese press has reported that the ratio of male
to female births is 114 to 100, based on a nationwide average, while the
statistical norm is 106 male births to 100 female.  The ratio excludes many
female births, especially the second or third in a family, which are unreported
to permit the parents to keep trying to conceive a boy, but may also reflect
the abuse of sonography.  Female infanticide may also be a factor in some areas
of China.<p>
<p>
At least five provincial governments have implemented regulations seeking to
prevent people with severe mental handicaps from having children.  In October
China passed a national Maternal and Child Care Law calling for premarital and
prenatal examinations to determine whether couples have acute infectious
diseases, certain mental illnesses (not including mental retardation), or are
at risk for passing on debilitating genetic diseases.  The law goes into effect
on June 1, 1995, and implementing regulations defining which diseases or
conditions will be covered have not yet been completed.  The law will be
implemented by the Ministry of Health, not the State Family Planning
Commission, and while it includes provisions for abortion or sterilization in
some cases based on medical advice, it provides for obtaining a second opinion
and mandates that patients or their guardians give written consent to such
procedures.  (See also Section 5 on People with Disabilities.)<p>
<p>
There were no reported cases of prosecution of parents for teaching their
children religion in the privacy of their home.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>COLOMBIA</b><p>
<p>
The law generally requires a judicial order for authorities to enter a private
home, except in cases of hot pursuit.  In remote regions of the country, the
military forces have civilian prosecutorial units delegated to them.  Human
rights groups charged that these delegate units were unconstitutional, and
Congress refused to grant them permanent status.  Nonetheless, there were
credible reports that they continued to function, often facilitating army
searches with little regard for judicious issuance of search warrants.  In one
example, the Nueva Granada battalion carried out over 60 searches and
detentions in the rural areas surrounding Barrancabermeja between January and
March.  Many of the detainees reported that soldiers mistreated and unjustly
interrogated them.<p>
<p>
A judge must authorize telephone wiretaps and the interception of mail.  This
protection extends to prisoners incarcerated in the penal system.<p>

<p>
<b>CONGO</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution protects the privacy of homes as well as correspondence and

require a warrant, but in practice warrants are not uniformly served.  There is
widespread belief that the Government continues to tap telephones.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>COSTA RICA</b><p>
<p>
There were no reports of extralegal invasions of privacy conducted by, or with
the knowledge of, the Government.  The law requires judicial warrants to search
private homes, and police seldom fail to comply.  In August the Legislative
Assembly approved legislation permitting government-authorized wiretaps in
certain restricted circumstances, primarily to combat narcotics trafficking.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>COTE D'IVOIRE</b><p>
<p>
The Code of Penal Procedure specifies that a police official or investigative
magistrate may conduct searches of homes without a judicial warrant if there is
reason to believe that there is evidence on the premises concerning a crime.
The official must have the prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects seized
in the search and is required to have witnesses to the search, which may not
take place between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m.  In practice, police sometimes use a
general search warrant without a name or address.  On occasion, police have
entered homes of non-Ivorian Africans (or rounded them up on the streets),
taken them to local police stations, and extorted small amounts of money for
alleged minor offenses.<p>
<p>
Security forces have reportedly monitored some private telephone conversations,
but the extent of the practice is unknown.  There is no evidence that private
written correspondence is monitored.<p>
<p>
In Cote d'Ivoire's multiparty political system, citizens are free to join, or
not join, any political party.  However, the State has reportedly transferred
government employees (e.g., teachers) active in the opposition because of their
political activities.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CROATIA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution declares the home inviolable.  Only a court may issue a search
warrant, stating the justification for the search of a home or other premises.
Police may enter a home without a warrant or the owner's consent only if
necessary to enforce an arrest warrant, apprehend a suspect, or prevent serious
danger to life or important property.  In practice, the authorities often
failed to adhere to these constitutional requirements.<p>
<p>
Military or civil police carried out evictions by force, involving several
hundred families, ethnic Serbs and Croats as well as Muslims.  In Split, 230
families were reported to be seeking through the courts to remove soldiers who
had seized their apartments.  Almost all of these cases involved apartments
previously owned by the JNA, over which the Ministry of Defense asserted
ownership.  Referring to property laws which remove tenancy rights as a result
of any 6-month absence or if the tenant is ruled to have acted against the
interests of Croatia, the Ministry of Defense granted soldiers tenancy of
occupied flats.  The soldiers then frequently took residences by force of arms,
either evicting the current tenants or forcing them to cohabitate.<p>
<p>
During the year, human rights organizations became increasingly effective at
calling public attention to forced evictions, and their members turned up in
large numbers at the announced time of the eviction.  But in at least two
cases, police beat and injured human rights monitors seeking to obstruct an
eviction.  In May the Defense Ministry issued public orders to remove any
soldiers who had illegally forced their way into an apartment, using force if
necessary.  But military police never carried out these orders, reporting
privately to observers that their commanders had told them to refrain from
arresting the soldiers.  The tenants of these apartments were typically Serbian
families or the spouses and children of Serbs in the JNA who had left Croatia.
At a July 12 press conference, President Tudjman justified the forced evictions
by linking them to the Serbian aggression against Croatia and eviction of
one-quarter million Croats.<p>
<p>
The Constitution guarantees the secrecy and safety of personal data, but it was
unclear if such guarantees were adhered to in practice.<p>
<p>
Serbian authorities in the UNPA's showed no compunction about interfering with
the privacy rights of the inhabitants of those areas, particularly non-Serbs.
UNPROFOR continued to provide 24-hour patrols of several minority villages to
protect the inhabitants from armed bands.  The practice of forcibly moving
Serbian refugees or soldiers into the homes of non-Serb residents continued as
well, which was clearly designed to pressure the non-Serbs to leave.  One
couple in Sector West was forced to live in their pantry after Serbian soldiers
took over the remainder of the house and Serbian refugees moved into their
outbuildings.  Inhabitants were even denied the right to talk on the telephone,
with the authorities putting severe restrictions on international observers who
provided mobile telephones to villagers during visits to permit them to call
relatives on the other side of the line.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CUBA</b><p>
<p>
Although the Constitution provides for the inviolability of one's home and
correspondence, official surveillance of private and family affairs by
government-controlled mass organizations, such as the CDR's, remains one of the
most pervasive and repressive features of Cuban life.  The State has assumed
the right to interfere in the lives of citizens, even those who do not actively
oppose the Government and its practices.  The Communist Party controls the mass
organizations which permeate society, although to a lesser extent than in the
past because of the collapsing economy.  Their ostensible purpose is to
"improve" the citizenry, but in fact their goal is to discover and discourage
nonconformity.<p>
<p>
The authorities utilize a wide range of social controls.  The educational
system teaches that the State's interests have precedence over all other
commitments.  In September Minister of Higher Education Fernando Vecino Alegret
affirmed that commitment to the revolution, including a willingness to defend
the revolution in the streets, was a condition for admission to the university.
The Ministry of Education requires teachers to evaluate students' ideological
character and note it in records the students carry throughout their schooling,
which affect their future educational and career prospects.<p>
<p>
The Interior Ministry employs an intricate system of informants and block
committees (the CDR's) to monitor and control public opinion.  Guardians of
social conformity, CDR's are neighborhood security committees tasked with
closely monitoring the daily lives of residents.  CDR's often report on
suspicious activity, including conspicuous consumption, unauthorized meetings--
including those with foreigners--and defiant attitudes toward the Government
and the revolution.<p>
<p>
State security often reads international correspondence and monitors overseas
telephone calls and conversations with foreigners.  Citizens do not have the
right to receive publications from abroad.  Security agents subject dissidents,
foreign diplomats, and journalists to surveillance.  In March the Government
lodged a formal complaint against two U.S. diplomats for distributing enemy
propaganda; the diplomats had given a few copies of a Miami newspaper to fellow
passengers on a train to Santa Clara.<p>
<p>
The authorities regularly search people and their homes without probable cause
to intimidate and harass them.  In August police searched the home of Pastor
Herrera, a leader of the human rights group "Alternative Criteria," and
confiscated written human rights allegations, membership information, copies of
a Miami newspaper, and Herrera's appointment pass to visit the U.S. Interests
Section.<p>
<p>
The authorities regularly detained human rights advocates after they visited
the U.S. Interests Section, confiscated their written reports of human rights
abuses, and seized copies of U.S. newspapers and other informational materials.
Police stopped two women, Isabel del Pino and Maria Valdes Rosado of the
dissident religious group "Christ the King" on March 9, took them to a nearby
police station, and subjected them to a strip search.  Police carefully
searched their belongings and confiscated reports of human rights violations
they had written.  Two state security officials then threatened them with
arrest if they did not stop their activities.  In November the authorities
detained several activists following their meetings with a visiting Spanish
official.<p>

<b>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</b><p>
<p>
The Government does not arbitrarily interfere with the private lives of persons
or families and generally observes constitutional provisions against invasion
of the home.  The authorities may not search a residence except in the presence
of a prosecutor or an assistant prosecutor, in instances of "hot pursuit," or
when there is probable cause to believe that a crime is in progress.  During
the 1994 electoral campaign and the post-electoral crisis, there were numerous
credible allegations of widescale interception of telephone conversations and
surveillance of individuals which may have involved the Government as well as
political parties.  In addition, opposition politicians charged that government
raids on their homes, ostensibly to search for firearms, were politically
motivated.  They also charged that the security service officials who rounded
up many of the detainees mentioned in Section 1.d. employed illegal raids on
their homes to capture them.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ECUADOR</b><p>
<p>
The law requires police to have a warrant to enter a private home or business,
except in the case of hot pursuit.  The police generally respect the sanctity
of private homes and correspondence.  Police surveillance is permitted, but the
Constitution prohibits wiretapping, and the results of a wiretap are not
admissible as evidence in court.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>EGYPT</b><p>
<p>
In 1994 there continued to be substantial abridgment, under the Emergency Law,
of constitutional provisions regarding the right to privacy.  Under the
Constitution, homes, correspondence, telephone calls, and other means of
communication "shall have their own sanctity, and their secrecy shall be
guaranteed." Police must obtain warrants before undertaking searches and
wiretaps.  Courts have dismissed cases in which warrants were issued without
sufficient cause.  Police officials who conduct searches without proper
warrants are subject to criminal penalties, although these are seldom
imposed.<p>
<p>
The Emergency Law empowers the State to search persons or places without
warrants.  Security agencies frequently place political activists, suspected
subversives, journalists, and writers under surveillance, screen their
correspondence (especially international mail), search them and their homes,
and confiscate personal property.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>EL SALVADOR</b><p>
<p>
According to the Constitution, the police must have the resident's consent, a
warrant, or a reasonable belief that a crime is being or is about to be
committed, before entering a private dwelling.  In practice, however, the
authorities used forced entry to carry out arrests and investigations.
Wiretapping of telephone communications by the Government, private persons, and
political parties is illegal but occurs.<p>

There does not appear to be systematic interference with correspondence, and
there is no coercive population control or forced resettlement.<p>

<b>ERITREA</b><p>
<p>
Under the Criminal Code, warrants are required to monitor mail, telephones, or
other means of communication.  Warrants are required in routine searches and
seizures, except in cases where authorities believe individuals may attempt to
escape or destroy evidence.  In the past this restriction has often not been
observed, but there were no reports of illegal surveillance or searches in
1994.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ESTONIA</b><p>
<p>
Estonian law requires a search warrant for search and seizure of property.
Prosecutors, rather than judges, issue such warrants during the investigative
stage upon a showing of probable cause.  Once a case has gone to trial,
however, judges then issue search and seizure warrants.<p>
<p>
The Constitution guarantees secrecy of the mail, telegrams, telephones, and

<p>
<p>
<b>ETHIOPIA</b><p>
<p>
The law requires judicial search warrants, but government critics allege they
are seldom used in practice.  The TGE implemented a nationwide campaign to
uncover and confiscate unregistered firearms.  Government security officials
conducted searches of private and commercial vehicles, as well as private
homes.  Leaders of political opposition groups claim their members have been
singled out for illegal searches and often unfairly detained during this
campaign.  These charges were given additional credibility when 44 of 46 ENDP
members, detained following accusations of illegal weapons possession in the
Southern Ethiopian People's Region, were subsequently released without charge
(see Section 1.d.).  Many people allege they are under surveillance for
expressing antigovernment views.<p>

In general, privacy of the home is respected.  However, the Intelligence
Service has powers to search people and property, open mail, and tap telephones
when a warrant is issued by the National Security Council, within specific
operational guidelines outlined in the government decree which created it.  The
Intelligence Service does conduct surveillance of persons it believes represent
a security threat.  Some political dissidents believe their telephones and mail
are monitored, but they have not provided substantiating evidence.<p>

The law provides for the right to privacy and the sanctity of the home, and it
specifically prohibits eavesdropping and mail tampering.  The authorities fully
respect these provisions.  The law authorizes police to conduct wiretapping
under certain conditions of suspected criminal activity.  Senior police
officials, rather than judges, have the authority to issue search warrants;
there is no indication this power is abused.  By law, the police are subject to
judicial scrutiny.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>FRANCE</b><p>
<p>
French law provides for freedom from invasion of privacy, and the authorities
respect this.  Police must obtain a judicial warrant in order to search a
private residence, except when responding to a crime in progress.  They can
conduct such a search only between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m., except in special
circumstances such as a crime in progress or a drug case.  Telephone
conversations may be monitored only under a court order in conjunction with
criminal proceedings, except in national security cases.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GABON</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides protection from surveillance, from searches without
warrant, and from interference with private telecommunications or
correspondence.  As part of criminal investigations, police may issue search
warrants, which are easily obtainable and often granted after the fact.  The
Government has used them to gain access to the homes of opposition figures and
their families.  Government authorities also routinely monitor private
telephone conversations, personal mail, and the movements of citizens.  Human
rights monitors, opposition figures, union leaders, foreign diplomats, and even
members of the Government have all reported being followed, watched, or
otherwise monitored by authorities at various times.<p>
<p>
The state of alert in effect from the beginning of the year until April 10
imposed a curfew and granted the Government numerous extralegal powers to limit
an individual's constitutional rights.  Security forces routinely entered and
searched private homes, offices, and vehicles without a warrant during this
period.  In February government troops attacked and ransacked an opposition
radio station and the homes of two leading opposition politicians (see Section
2.a.), confiscating or destroying a considerable amount of property.<p>
<p>
After August, when most of the reshuffling of personnel within ministries was
complete, there were no further confirmed reports of dismissal of government or
military personnel due to political affiliation.  One of the opposition's
negotiating demands in pursuit of a government of national unity was
reinstatement of persons so dismissed.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>THE GAMBIA</b><p>
<p>
Although constitutional safeguards against arbitrary search remain in place,
AFPRC priorities in security matters and corruption investigations override
these safeguards.  Police seized private documents and property without due
process and placed armed guards at homes and other properties suspected of
having been acquired with embezzled or misappropriated funds.  The AFPRC froze
accounts of persons under suspicion and prohibited by decree the transfer of
their property.  It denied persons under house arrest access to international
telephone service.  Police must generally have court orders to conduct searches
related to crimes unless the individual concerned agrees or it is deemed to
involve an urgent matter of national interest.  The Government has not
generally intruded in family matters, and this has remained true under the
AFPRC.  Security officials are believed to monitor telephone communications.<p>

<b>GEORGIA</b><p>
<p>
Intelligence agencies, including both Georgian and Russian services, are
credibly reported to monitor private telephone conversations.  Prior to his
assassination, Gia Chanturia, the head of the National Democratic Party,
complained publicly that his office was electronically monitored.<p>
<p>
Both paramilitary and law enforcement representatives enter homes without legal
sanction.  However, most Soviet-era forms of interference diminished.<p>
<p>
Telephone communications with Abkhazia and South Ossetia are almost impossible
because local authorities exercise control over them.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GERMANY</b><p>
<p>
The Basic Law provides for inviolability of the home, and the authorities
respect these provisions.  Prior to forcibly entering a home, police must
obtain a warrant from a judge or, in an emergency, a public prosecutor.  For
electronic surveillance of telephone lines or monitoring of mail, police must
obtain a court order.<p>

<p>
<b>GHANA</b><p>
<p>
Observers assume the Government continues to engage in surveillance of citizens
engaged in activity which it deems objectionable.  In the past, this included
monitoring of telephones and mail.<p>
<p>
Although the law requires judicial search warrants, police do not always obtain
them.  The Constitution provides that a person shall be free from interference
within the privacy of his home, property, correspondence, or communication.
This article has yet to be tested.<p>

<p>
<b>GREECE</b><p>
<p>
Although the Constitution prohibits invasion of privacy and searches without
warrants, and the law permits monitoring personal communications only under
strict judicial controls, the variety of persons and groups subjected to
government surveillance in recent years raises questions about safeguards.
Targets included human rights monitors, non- Orthodox religious groups, and
activist members of minority groups.<p>
<p>
In June a parliamentary investigation committee recommended indictment of
former Prime Minister Mitsotakis and 30 persons from the former Mitsotakis
administration on charges of wiretapping political opponents from 1989 to 1991.
In January 1995, the Parliament voted to drop all charges against Mitsotakis.
The others will be tried in criminal courts in 1995.<p>
<p>
The security services continued to monitor human rights and minority group
representatives and foreign diplomats who met with such individuals.  Human
rights monitors also reported the continuation of suspicious openings and
diversions of mail, some of which was never delivered but was subsequently
published in newspapers with apparent links to Greek security services.  So far
as is known, the Government took no steps to stop such practices or to
prosecute those involved.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GRENADA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for protection from these abuses, and there were no
reports of such actions.  The law generally requires judicially issued warrants
for searching homes, except in cases of hot pursuit.  The Firearms Act of 1968
and the Drug Abuse Prevention Act No. 7 of 1992 contain other exceptions which
give the police and security units legal authority to search persons and
property without warrants in certain circumstances.  In practice, police obtain
warrants in the majority of cases before conducting any search.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GUATEMALA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home, correspondence, and
private documents, but the authorities do not always respect these provisions.
Elements of the security forces continue to monitor private communications.
Many human rights monitors reported receiving threats in the form of
surveillance, telephone calls, and anonymous letters.<p>
<p>
On March 11, a year after an arrest warrant had been issued, Juan Jose Garcia
Orellana, a postal control officer charged with operating a mail espionage ring
in the post office for the presidential security staff under the Serrano
administration, turned himself in to judicial authorities.  The authorities are
still gathering evidence in this case.<p>
<p>
Through July, officials enforcing the military draft continued to stop vehicles
and enter homes and places of business without legally required court orders.
Prior to August, under recruitment practices adopted in some departments,
potential draftees receive three induction notices, after which they are
arrested if they do not report for enlistment.  Under the law, such arrests
must be effected pursuant to a court order.<p>
<p>
On June 14, Amilcar Mendez, the founder of CERJ, filed a lawsuit against
Defense Minister Enriquez charging that the armed forces' forced recruitment
practices violated constitutional provisions regarding obligatory military
service.  However, a court ruled the judicial branch did not have jurisdiction
over this matter because the Minister of Defense had immunity from prosecution,
which only Congress could remove.  It referred the immunity question to the
Congress, which ruled that the case lacked legal merit, thus effectively
dismissing the entire lawsuit.<p>
<p>
Through July 30, the Archbishop's human rights office handled 89 individual
cases of forced recruitment.  In the same period, the Human Rights Ombudsman's
office reported receiving 663 complaints of forced recruitment.  The office
obtained the release of 268 persons from military service, of whom 79 were
minors.  On June 29, Defense Minister General Enriquez announced a 6-month
moratorium on forced recruitment, which was confirmed by President De Leon
during the June 30 Army Day celebrations.  However, the Ombudsman reported
three separate instances of forced conscription in July.  On August 28, the
Defense Ministry once again ordered a suspension of forced recruitment; since
then, there were no further reports of forced recruitment.  The army has
continued the practice of setting up draft boards consisting of the zone
military commander, the local representative of the Human Rights Ombudsman's
office, and other civilian leaders.<p>
<p>
The Constitution requires that PAC service be voluntary.  However, army
officers, military commissioners, and PAC leaders often pressure men in areas
of conflict to become members.  Nevertheless, PAC's do appear to enjoy some
popular support; a majority of respondents in a recent academic survey
conducted for the Human Rights Ombudsman in seven departments claimed to be
pleased with the PAC membership and with the PAC presence in their communities.
However, some human rights monitors have charged that PAC members may have felt
intimidated by fellow PAC members and did not give completely candid answers.<p>
<p>
In June and July, CERJ filed a legal complaint on behalf of former PAC member
Juan Antonio Chumel with local judicial authorities and the IACHR stating that
since 1988, when Chumel left the PAC's, PAC members threatened and intimidated
Chumel to the extent that he was forced to leave his community for fear of his
life.  There are other credible reports that others who refused to serve in the
PAC's suffered threats and other abuses.<p>

<p>
<b>GUINEA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home and judicial search
warrants are required by law.  Police frequently ignore these procedures,
however, or do not strictly follow them, and interference in citizens' lives
continued, primarily through police harassment.  Police and paramilitary police
often ignore legal procedures in the pursuit of criminals and frequently detain
private citizens at night roadblocks in order to extort money to supplement
their incomes.  It is widely believed that security officials monitor mail and
telephone calls.<p>
<p>
Local businesses, especially expatriate companies, often complain of
intimidation and harassment by public officials and authorities.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GUINEA-BISSAU</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the inviolability of domicile, person, and
correspondence, but the Government does not always respect these rights.  The
authorities examine international and domestic mail, the security forces seldom
use judicial warrants, and the police sometimes force entry into private
homes.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>GUYANA</b><p>
<p>
The Government generally respects the right to privacy, although some
opposition politicians have claimed instances of government surveillance of
political meetings and rallies.  (Uniformed police officers are routinely
present at such rallies.)  Police generally respected the laws requiring
judicially issued search warrants.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>HAITI</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides that no house search or seizure of papers may take
place except in accordance with the law.  Correspondence is also defined as
inviolable.<p>
<p>
Prior to September 19, soldiers and other armed persons frequently entered
private homes for illegal purposes in Port-au-Prince and the provinces.  In
August there was a rash of attacks on the homes of politicians, including
parliamentarians and the mayor of Petionville, the capital's main suburb.
Attaches and FRAPH members were involved in raids on homes, but victims also
reported seeing soldiers personally known to them and dressed in civilian
clothing among their attackers.  In addition, gangsters violently raided entire
neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince, taking advantage of their ties to police and
the general climate of impunity to steal and rape.  When the armed persons
entered looking for a particular individual, they frequently beat or otherwise
harmed family members during the search.<p>
<p>
The police, along with armed civilians acting at their behest, frequently used
roadblocks to conduct illegal searches, especially during periods of real or
perceived political tension.  The discovery of pro-Aristide posters or
literature during a police search of a house or vehicle frequently resulted in
physical abuse and illegal arrest.  There were credible reports that police and
military also seized private correspondence during such searches.<p>
<p>
After the arrival of the MNF and the restoration of the legitimate Government,
such abuses were dramatically reduced.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>HONDURAS</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution specifies that a person's home is inviolable and that persons
authorized by the State may enter only with the owner's consent or with the
authorization of a competent authority.  Entry may take place only between 6
a.m. and 6 p.m. or at any time in the event of an emergency or to prevent the
commission of a crime.  However, as in previous years, there were credible
charges that police and armed forces personnel failed at times to obtain the
needed authorization before entering a private home.  Despite a new system of
"duty judges" and "duty prosecutors" to issue search orders, they appeared to
lack the discipline to make themselves available 24 hours per day, 7 days a
week.  Coordination among the police, the court, and the Public Ministry is
improving.  However, interagency liaison problems still undermine the
effectiveness of the system.<p>
<p>
Judges may authorize government monitoring of mail or telephones for specific
purposes, such as criminal investigation or national security.  However, the
armed forces reportedly continued to use its operation of the national
telephone company to monitor illegally telephone lines of influential people in
the Government, the military, and the private sector without authorization from
the appropriate civilian judicial authority.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>HONG KONG</b><p>
<p>
The law provides for the right of privacy, and the Government generally
respects this right.  The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is
vested with powers which are normally exercised only by a judicial officer.
Amendments to ordinances governing the ICAC deprived it of this independent
authority to issue arrest or search warrants (it must now go to the courts),
but it still operates on the assumption that any excessive, unexplainable
assets held by civil servants are considered ill-gotten until proven
otherwise.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>HUNGARY</b><p>
<p>
The law provides that the prosecutor's office may issue search warrants
independently.  Police must carry out house searches in the presence of two
witnesses and must prepare a written inventory of items removed from the
premises.  Wiretapping, which may be done for national security reasons and for
legitimate criminal investigations, requires a court's permission.  These
provisions are observed in practice.<p>
<p>
A search warrant is not necessary, however, in cases in which the police are
making checks on the validity of the identity papers of foreigners.  In a
series of raids in September, police conducted arbitrary identity checks in
restaurants and residences frequented by foreigners.  In Budapest, a dozen
policemen went to the residence of an American business executive at 2:45 a.m.
to demand identification.  The businessman was not home.  The policemen left
after the businessman's wife produced the appropriate documents for herself and
her small children.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ICELAND</b><p>
<p>
Under the Constitution and in practice, there is deep respect for the autonomy
and rights of individuals.  A warrant from a court is required to enter a
private house, except in cases of hot pursuit.  There have been no known
arbitrary intrusions by official entities, political organizations, or any
other organized group into the private beliefs or personal liberties of
individuals.<p>
<p>
<b>INDIA</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The police must obtain warrants for searches and seizures.  In a criminal
investigation, the police may conduct searches without warrants to avoid undue
delay, but they must justify the searches in writing to the nearest magistrate
with jurisdiction over the offense.  The authorities in Jammu and Kashmir,
Punjab, and Assam have special powers to search and arrest without a warrant.<p>
<p>
The Indian Telegraph Act authorizes the surveillance of communications,
including monitoring telephone conversation and intercepting personal mail--in
cases of public emergency or "in the interest of the public safety or
tranquility."  These powers have been used by every state government.<p>
<p>
On May 25, the Punjab state government ordered the authorities to intercept any
mail addressed to or mailed by various Sikh political, student, and lawyer
groups, persons residing in Pakistan, or any group or person considered a
danger to the state.  On July 25, the state High Court ordered the state
government to suspend implementing the order.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>INDONESIA</b><p>
<p>
Judicial warrants for searches are required except for cases involving
suspected subversion, economic crimes, and corruption.  However, security
agencies regularly make forced or surreptitious entries.  They also intimidate
by surveillance of persons and residences and selective monitoring of local and
international telephone calls without legal restraint.  Government security
officials monitor the movements and activities of former members of the PKI and
its front organizations, especially persons the Government believes were
involved in the abortive 1965 Communist-backed coup.  The Government stated in
late 1990 that this latter group then totaled 1,410,333 people.  These persons
and their relatives sometimes are subject to surveillance, required check-ins,
periodic indoctrination, and restrictions on travel outside their city of
residence.  Their legally required identification cards carry the initials
"E.T." which stand for "Ex-Tapol," or former political prisoner, which readily
identifies them to prospective employers or government officials.<p>
<p>
The Government's transmigration program which moved large numbers of people
from overpopulated islands to more isolated and backward ones has been
criticized by nongovernmental human rights monitors.  They say that it not only
violates the rights of indigenous people but also those of the transmigrants,
claiming that they are frequently duped into leaving their home villages
without any means of return (see Section 5.).<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>IRAN</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution states that "reputation, life, property, (and) dwelling(s)"
are protected from trespass except as "provided by law."  However, security
forces enter homes and offices, monitor telephone conversations, and open mail
without court authorization.  The wife of writer Saidi-Sirjani reported that,
after her husband's arrest in March, the Anti-Vice Department of the
Revolutionary Prosecutor's office raided her home, seized her husband's papers,
and sealed the library (see Section 1.a.).<p>
<p>
Paramilitary volunteer forces known as the Basiji and other security forces
monitor the social activities of citizens.  Such organizations may harass or
arrest women whose clothing does not cover the hair and all of the body except
hands and face, or those who wear makeup.  Enforcement of such standards of
public morality varies with the political climate and the jurisdiction.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>IRAQ</b><p>
<p>
The Government frequently disregards the constitutional right to privacy,
particularly in cases in which national security is alleged to be involved.
The law defines security offenses so broadly that authorities are virtually
exempt from the legal requirement to obtain search warrants.  In 1994 the
authorities subjected the Shi'a religious clergy, Shi'a Muslim inhabitants of
the southern marshes, and various ethnic minorities to searches without
warrants (see Section 1.g.).  The regime routinely ignores the constitutional
provisions safeguarding the confidentiality of mail and telegraphic
correspondence and telephone conversations.<p>
<p>
The security services and the Ba'ath Party maintain pervasive networks of
informers to deter dissident activity and instill fear in the public.  As the
Special Rapporteur noted in his February report, "the fear of informers and
subsequent severe reprisals have prevented virtually the entire population from
expressing genuinely held opinions which are not consistent with those of the
Government."<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>IRELAND</b><p>
<p>
The Supreme Court has affirmed that, although not specifically provided for in
the Constitution, the inviolability of personal privacy, family, and home must
be respected in law and practice; and the Government honors this.<p>
<p>
However, the Constitution provides that the State shall enact no law permitting
divorce.  A 1986 nationwide referendum overwhelmingly defeated a proposal to
amend the Constitution to permit divorce in limited circumstances.  In the same
year, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the prohibition of divorce
is not a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Ireland is
a party.  The Government has pledged to hold another referendum on divorce,
which now seems likely to occur in 1995.<p>

<b>ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Although privacy of the individual and the home are generally protected by law,
authorities sometimes interfere with mail and monitor telephone conversations.
In criminal cases, the law permits wiretapping by court order; in security
cases, the order must be issued by the Ministry of Defense.  Under emergency
regulations, authorities may open and destroy mail on security grounds.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ITALY</b><p>
<p>
The law safeguards the privacy of the home, and the authorities respect this

judicial warrant and in carefully defined circumstances.  There have been no
reports of any other kinds of violations of privacy.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>JAMAICA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State into the private
life of the individual.  The revised Jamaica Constabulary Force Act, however,
continues to give security personnel the sort of broad powers of search and
seizure which were consistently abused under the Suppression of Crimes Act.
Although the use of telephone taps without a court order is officially limited
to cases involving the drug trade, terrorism, and subversion of the Government,
politicians, trade union officials, and local journalists have charged that the
authorities were tapping their telephones in recent years.  The accused
authorities did not respond to these charges.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>JAPAN</b><p>
<p>
Under the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made upon separate
warrant issued by a judge.  Standards for issuing such warrants exist to guard
against arbitrary searches.  There were no reports that the Government or any
other organization arbitrarily interfered with privacy, family, home, or
correspondence.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>JORDAN</b><p>
<p>
The police must obtain a warrant from the Prosecutor General or a judge before
conducting searches in most cases.  However, in security cases, authorities
sometimes, and in violation of the law, obtain warrants retroactively or obtain
preapproved warrants.  Security officers reportedly monitor telephones, read
correspondence, and engage in surveillance of persons that allegedly pose a
threat to the regime.  While these practices are not believed to be widespread,
the law permits them if the Government obtains a court order.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>KAZAKHSTAN</b><p>
<p>
The KNB and Ministry of Internal Affairs, with the concurrence of the
Procuracy, may arbitrarily interfere with privacy, family, home, and
correspondence, a legacy of Soviet rule.  The law requires criminal police, who
remain part of the internal security structure, to obtain a search warrant from
a prosecutor before conducting a search, but they sometimes search without a
warrant.  There were credible reports in 1994 that police occasionally planted
evidence.<p>
<p>
The KNB has the right to monitor telephone calls and mail, but under the law it
must inform the Procuracy within 3 days of such activity.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>KENYA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution permits searches without warrants in certain instances "to
promote the public benefit," such as in security cases.  Although security
officials generally obtain judicially issued search warrants, at times they
conduct searches without warrants to apprehend suspected criminals or to seize
property believed to be stolen.  The courts have admitted evidence obtained
without search warrants to support convictions.<p>
<p>
Security forces employ various means of surveillance, including electronic
surveillance and a network of informers.  Police routinely monitored the
activities of political opponents and their associates.  In a June letter to
the Director of State Intelligence, FORD-K M.P. Paul Muite complained that
several specific vehicles with civilian license plates constantly shadowed his
movements and that of his family.  Muite, who is also the lead defense attorney
in the Wamwere case, reported that the cars even followed him from Nairobi to
the Nakuru courtroom and back again--a 4-hour trip.<p>
<p>
The Government monitored and intercepted correspondence as well.  In August the
U.S.-based Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights mailed two
packages to the Kenya Human Rights Commission.  The local Nairobi post office
refused to release the packages, claiming that the reports were "political" and
"hitting at the Government."  In April police detained and interrogated an
18-year-old student for several hours after police intercepted a letter she had
sent to opposition M.P. Paul Muite.<p>
<p>
City council security officers, or "Askaris," continued to destroy the kiosks
of licensed and unlicensed vendors in several Kenyan cities.  On February 9 and
15, Nairobi Askaris demolished and burned a stretch of vendors' booths at the
Machakos country bus terminal, destroying several thousand dollars' worth of
property.  On February 16, Askaris beat and arrested the chairman of the
Vendors' Association when he visited the Machakos bus terminal.  Askaris also
arrested and confiscated goods from vendors at the Kisumu town center in
February.<p>
<p>
Although Kenyans are theoretically free to choose their political affiliation,
government employees continued to be warned to support the ruling party or be
fired.  In May the Government dismissed a permanent secretary in the Ministry
of Labor after he reportedly made contact with an opposition party member.<p>
<p>
<p>

<p>
<b>REPUBLIC OF KOREA</b><p>
<p>
In general, the Government honors the integrity of the home and family.  In the
past, the security services conducted varying degrees of surveillance,
including wiretaps, of political dissidents.  The Antiwiretap Law and the law
to reform the NSP were designed to curb government surveillance of civilians,
and appear largely to have succeeded.  The Antiwiretap Law lays out broad
conditions under which the monitoring of telephone calls, mail, and other forms
of communication are legal  It requires government officials to secure a
judge's permission before placing wiretaps, or, in the event of an emergency,
soon after placing them, and it provides for jail terms for those who violate
this law.  Some human rights groups argue that a considerable amount of illegal
wiretapping is still taking place and say the lack of an independent body to
investigate whether police have employed illegal wiretaps hinders the
effectiveness of the antiwiretapping law.<p>
<p>
South Koreans are not allowed to listen to North Korean radio in their homes or
read books published in North Korea if the Government determines that they are
doing so for the purpose of helping North Korea.  Student groups make plausible
claims that government informants are posted around university campuses.
Persons with backgrounds as political or labor activists may find it difficult
to obtain some forms of employment or advance in such fields as government,
broadcast media, and education.<p>

<p>
<b>KUWAIT</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for individual privacy and sanctity of the home.  The
police must obtain a warrant to search both public and private property, unless
they are in hot pursuit or suspect the presence of alcohol or narcotics.  The
warrant can be obtained from the state prosecutor or, in the case of private
property, from a judge.  The security forces occasionally monitor the
activities of individuals and their communications.<p>
<p>
By law males must obtain government approval to marry foreign-born women.
However, the Government does not vigorously enforce the restriction, and
Kuwaitis routinely obtain exemptions from the Ministry of Justice.  The
Government also advises women against marrying foreign nationals.<p>

<p>
<b>KYRGYZ REPUBLIC</b><p>
<p>
The 1993 Constitution prohibits unlawful entry into a home against the wishes
of the occupant and states that a person's private life, privacy of
correspondence, and telephonic and telegraphic communications are protected by
law.  Current law and procedures require the General Procurators's approval for
wiretaps, searches of homes, interception of mail, and similar procedures.<p>
<p>
Personnel and organizations responsible for violations during the Soviet period
have remained largely in place; however, no widespread and systematic
violations of the privacy of citizens were reported in 1994, but the local
press often cited harassment of individuals by police on the street as a
problem.  Some citizens active in politics or interested in human rights
believe that the privacy of their communications was violated in 1994.
Credible evidence is not available.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>LAOS</b><p>
<p>
Concomitant with economic liberalization, the Government relaxed some elements
of state control, including its rigorous police monitoring of personal and
business activities and enforcement of the nighttime curfew.  However, while
the Constitution prohibits arrests or searches in homes without possessing a
warrant or authorization, the security bureaus authorize search and seizure by
themselves rather than by judicial authority.  The Government and the party
continue to monitor the citizenry sporadically through a system of neighborhood
and workplace committees.  The neighborhood committees also have responsibility
for maintaining public order and reporting "bad elements" to the police.  These
committees usually concern themselves more with street crime and instances of
moral turpitude than with political activism.  The degree of surveillance and
control varies from province to province.<p>
<p>
The Penal Code forbids telephone monitoring without proper authorization, but
the security bureaus are believed to authorize such monitoring themselves.
Monitoring of international mail and telephone calls continued, although the
increasing number of such calls limited its extent.<p>
<p>
The 1991 Constitution stipulates that the "national community" owns all land.
Private "ownership" is in the form of land use certificates, which can be
bought, sold, and transferred to heirs.  Many Lao who fled the country after
1975 regained confiscated property after demonstrating their intent to
repatriate.<p>

<p>
<b>LEBANON</b><p>
<p>
While the authorities generally show little interest in controlling the
personal lives of citizens, they are not reluctant to interfere with the
privacy of persons regarded as foes of the Government.  Laws require that
prosecutors must obtain warrants before entering houses, except when the army
is in hot pursuit of an armed attacker.  Militias and non-Lebanese forces
operating outside areas of central government authority have frequently
violated rights of privacy.  Various factions and the Government use informer
networks and monitor telephones to gather information on their foes.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>LESOTHO</b><p>
<p>
Although search warrants are usually required under normal circumstances, the
ISA provides police with wide powers to stop and search persons and vehicles
and to enter homes and other places for similar purposes without a warrant.
After the May LMP mutiny, police officers entered without warrant dozens of
residences in the Maseru neighborhoods of Sea Point and Matimposo, allegedly
seeking looted property.  The security services are believed to monitor
routinely telephone conversations of Basotho and foreigners on national
security grounds.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>LIBERIA</b><p>
<p>
While the Constitution provides for these rights, there were many serious
abuses of privacy and home--including confiscation of property and failure to
obtain required warrants--by the police and fighters of all the warring
factions.  According to the Constitution, the police must have a warrant or a
reasonable belief that a crime is in progress, or is about to be committed,
before entering a private dwelling.  In practice, the police engaged in forced
entry without a warrant to carry out arrests and investigations.<p>
<p>
Combatants of all the warring factions looted villages during the year, with
ULIMO-Krahn and ULIMO-Mandingo factions in Bomi and Cape Mount counties and LPC
and NPFL fighters in southeastern counties and elsewhere drawing considerable
public outrage.  These forces pilfered virtually any item of value and
regularly demanded scarce food and personal valuables from already impoverished
residents or displaced persons, often robbing them of their clothes and
physically abusing them, particularly at checkpoints.  Confiscation of private
homes and vehicles was common practice.<p>
<p>
These factions also used forced entry for purposes of intimidation.  For
example, AFL soldiers made two raids on the Monrovia residence of a legislative
representative to harass the representative for his support of the new police
director.  In one instance, an AFL soldier shot the representative's guard in
the leg.  The representative sent a formal letter to the Transitional
Legislative Assembly accusing four members of the AFL high command of attempted
murder.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>LIBYA</b><p>
<p>
The Government does not respect the right to privacy.  Security agencies often
disregard the legal requirement to obtain warrants before entering a private
home.  They also routinely monitor telephone calls.<p>
<p>
The security agencies and the Revolutionary Committees oversee an extensive
informant network.  Libyan exiles report that mere family ties to suspected
regime opponents may result in government harassment and detention.  The
Government may seize and destroy property belonging to the "enemies of the
people" or those who "cooperate" with foreign powers.  In early 1994, citizens
reported that Mr. Qadhafi warned that members of the extended family of any
regime opponent risk the death penalty.<p>
<p>
In August Mr. Qadhafi proposed a program to seize private wealth, deeming all
private assets above a nominal amount to be the fruits of exploitation or
corruption.  He encouraged local cadres to investigate and report any citizen
retaining "excessive" private assets after the expiration of a grace period,
during which citizens could turn over such assets to the Government.<p>

The Constitution provides for personal liberty, and for inviolability of the

have been reported.  Police need a judicial warrant to search private
property.<p>

<p>
<b>LITHUANIA</b><p>
<p>
The authorities do not engage in indiscriminate or widespread monitoring of the
correspondence or communications of citizens.  With the written authorization
of a procurator or judge, however, police and the security service may engage
in surveillance and monitoring activities on grounds of national security.
Except in cases of hot pursuit or the danger of disappearance of evidence,
police must obtain a search warrant signed by a prosecutor before they may
enter premises.<p>
<p>
It is widely assumed, however, that law enforcement agencies have increased the
use of a range of surveillance methods to cope with the expansion of organized
crime.  There is some question as to the legal basis of this police
surveillance, but there are no known legal cases challenging the legality of
the surveillance.  The former president of the Lithuanian National Bank, who
charged that eavesdropping devices were found in his office in 1993, publicly
called on the Procurator General to investigate the incident.  The press
reported that, although the devices were in fact found and are in the
possession of the new bank management, the authorities failed to pursue
investigation of the incident.<p>

<p>
<b>FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA</b><p>

(VMRO) charged that the state security service tapped their telephones<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>MADAGASCAR</b><p>
<p>
The home is inviolable by tradition and law, and the State does not intervene
in the private aspects of the lives of the people.  The law requires judicially
issued warrants to search houses, but there were reportedly some instances in
which private citizens used police acquaintances to intimidate others without
proper warrants.  Telephones and correspondence are not monitored.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>MALAWI</b><p>
<p>
Under the law, search warrants are required, and there were no reported
incidents of illegal search of homes or businesses.  However, postal
authorities occasionally opened and inspected private correspondence, seemingly
at random.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>MALAYSIA</b><p>
<p>
These rights are normally respected and protected by law.  Provisions in the
security legislation (see Section 1.d.), however, allow the police to enter and
search without a warrant the homes of persons suspected of threatening national
security.  Police may also confiscate evidence under these acts.  In some cases
each year, police have used this legal authority to search homes and offices,
seize books and papers, monitor conversations, and take people into custody
without a warrant.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>MALDIVES</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution prohibits security officials from opening or reading letters,
telegrams, and wireless messages or monitoring telephone conversations, "except
in accordance with the specific provisions of the law."  The NSS may open the
mail of private citizens and monitor telephone conversations if authorized in
the course of a criminal investigation.<p>
<p>
Although the Constitution requires the authorities to respect private premises

The Attorney General or a commanding officer of the police must approve the
search of private residences.<p>

<p>
<b>MALI</b><p>

The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, and the Government
respects this right in practice.  Police searches are infrequent, and require

of individuals and groups believed to be threats to internal security; with
court approval, police may maintain technical surveillance as well.  There were
no instances of forced resettlement.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>MALTA</b><p>

<b>MAURITANIA</b><p>
<p>
The law requires judicial warrants in order to execute home searches, but the
authorities often ignore this requirement.  During the roundup of some 60
Islamists in September and October, as well during the detention of human
rights monitor Cheik Saad Bouh Kamara, police searched detainees' homes and
seized papers without a search warrant.<p>

There were fewer reports of government surveillance of suspected dissidents
than in previous years, although the extent to which the Government used
informants is unknown.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>MAURITIUS</b><p>
<p>
The sanctity of the home is provided for in law and generally respected in
practice.  The search of personal property or premises is allowed only under
clearly specified conditions by court order or by police action in stopping a

intelligence apparatus continued to carry out illegal surveillance of local
opposition leaders and other major figures.<p>

<b>MOLDOVA</b><p>
<p>
According to the 1990 police law, prosecutors, rather than judges, issue search
warrants.  There have been numerous instances in which searches were conducted
without warrants, and courts do not exclude evidence that was illegally
obtained.  There is no judicial review of search warrants.<p>
<p>
The new Constitution specifies that searches must be carried out "in accordance
with law" but does not specify the consequences if the law is not respected.
It also forbids searches at night, except in the case of flagrant crime.<p>
<p>
Opponents of the Government continue to claim that security forces monitored
and harassed them, especially during the election campaign.  It is widely
believed that the security forces continued to use electronic monitoring of
residences and telephones in some cases, although confirmation of such
activities is lacking.  By law, the prosecutor's office must authorize wiretaps
and may do so only if a criminal investigation is under way.  In practice, the
prosecutor's office lacks the ability to control the security organs and police
and prevent them from using wiretaps illegally.<p>

<p>
<b>MOZAMBIQUE</b><p>
<p>
The 1990 Constitution provides for the right to privacy and expressly prohibits
the use of surveillance techniques.  By law, police need a warrant to enter
homes and businesses, but in practice most policemen routinely operate without
them.  During the war, police and security forces entered homes at will, used a
variety of surveillance techniques, and often forced civilians to move into
government-protected villages.  However, since the signing of the Rome Accords,
the number of reported incidents of intrusive government actions declined
markedly.<p>
<p>
Although there are fewer reports of such activity, incidents of illegal
telephone wiretapping by Government intelligence agencies allegedly still
occur.  In November the independent weekly Savana reported what it considered
convincing evidence that a telephone conversation between two of its
journalists was tapped.  The SISE denied the charge.<p>

<b>NAURU</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution generally provides protection from these abuses.  Searches not
sanctioned by court order are prohibited, and there is no surveillance of
individuals or of private communications.  Nauruan citizenship and inheritance
rights are traced through the female line.  Until very recently, laws
restricted intermarriage of Nauru men and women with non-Nauruans.  Although
the laws have changed and such intermarriage is practiced and permitted,
intermarriage between Nauru women and foreign males still draws substantial
social censure.  The spouses--male or female--of Nauru citizens have no
automatic right of abode in Nauru.  They are, however, normally granted
short-term "visits" sponsored by the Nauru spouse or they may apply for
longer-term work permits.  Foreign spouses are not eligible for Nauru
citizenship.<p>

Such warrants must be approved within 24 hours by the Chief District Officer in
misdemeanor cases and court judges in felony cases.<p>

<b>NICARAGUA</b><p>

The Constitution establishes that all persons have the right to privacy of
their family and to the inviolability of their home, correspondence, and
communications.  It also requires warrants for searches of private homes and
excludes from legal proceedings illegally seized letters, documents, and
private papers.  However, in April the police burst into the home of the Bishop
of Leon looking for the driver of an illegally parked truck.  The driver and
two workmen were delivering material to a nearby chapel and had sought refuge
in the Bishop's residence after being chased by the police.  The police entered
the residence without a warrant, caught the workmen, and beat them in front of
the Bishop.  The police later released the three uncharged persons, and Vice
Minister of Government Frank Cesar personally visited and apologized to the
Bishop (the police also apologized).  The Bishop made no formal complaint.<p>
<p>
Article 26 of the new Military Code prohibits the Defense Intelligence

<b>NIGERIA</b><p>
<p>
Provisions of the 1979 and 1989 Constitutions provide for the rights to privacy
in the home, in correspondence, and in oral electronic communications.
However, the military Government regularly interfered in the lives of its
citizens, and if the authorities desired to use a warrant in a particular
search case, they often secured it from a military tribunal rather than a
regular court.  Human rights leaders reported that security agents regularly
followed them and cut or tapped their organizations' telephones.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The constitutional stipulation that "citizens are guaranteed the inviolability
of person and residence and the privacy of correspondence" does not reflect
reality.  The Government relies upon an extensive system of informers to
identify critics and potential troublemakers.  In some cases, entire families
are detained for alleged political offenses committed by one member of the
family.<p>
<p>
The authorities subject citizens in all age groups and occupations to political
and ideological indoctrination.  Even after Kim Il Sung's death, his cult of
personality and glorification of his family and the official "juche"
(self-reliance) ideology continued to be omnipresent.  The cult approaches the
level of a state religion.  The goal of indoctrination remains to ensure
loyalty to the Kim Il Sung system and his son and heir Kim Jong Il, as well as
conformity to the State's ideology and authority.  Indoctrination is carried
out systematically not only through the mass media, but also in schools and
through worker and neighborhood associations.  Citizens with relatives who fled
to South Korea at the time of the Korean War appear to be still classified as
part of the "hostile class" in the DPRK's elaborate loyalty system.  Because
approximately 10 million families were separated by the war, this category
encompasses a significant percentage of the North Korean population.<p>
<p>
The defector Cho Kap Chae estimated that the class of those considered
politically "impure" may comprise 25 to 30 percent of the population.  Members
of this class may still be subject to some discrimination, although Cho claimed
that their treatment has improved greatly in recent years.<p>

<b>NORWAY</b><p>
<p>
The privacy of the family and the person is free from arbitrary interference by
the Government.  Police may conduct searches of the home only with court
approval and in instances of hot pursuit or when they fear evidence is being
destroyed.  There were no allegations of forced entry into homes in 1994.  In
most cases, wiretaps are prohibited by law, but they may be used in cases
involving state security or narcotics offenses when officially approved by the
court within carefully drawn legal guidelines.  Correspondence may be opened
only by court order in cases involving state security.<p>

<p>
<b>THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES (INCLUDING AREAS SUBJECT TO JURISDICTION OF THE
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY)</b><p>
<p>
Israeli military authorities in the West Bank may enter private Palestinian
homes and institutions without a warrant on security grounds when authorized by
an officer of the rank of lieutenant colonel.  In conducting searches, the IDF
has used forced entries, and has sometimes beaten occupants and destroyed
property.  Undercover units have also engaged in destructive and violent
behavior during searches, as well as harassment of families of wanted
Palestinians.  Israeli authorities claim that forced entry may lawfully occur
only when incident to an arrest and when entry is resisted.  They maintain that
beatings and arbitrary destruction of property during searches are punishable
violations of military regulations, and that compensation is due to victims in
such cases.  The Government does not provide information regarding such
compensation.<p>
<p>
Authorities sealed 5 houses in 1994 for security reasons, a sharp decline from
27 houses sealed in 1993.  Security forces may demolish or seal the home of a
suspect, whether he is the owner or tenant, without any trial.  The decision to
seal or demolish a house is made by several high-level Israeli officials,
including the coordinator of the Civil Administration and the Defense Minister.
Owners of houses ordered demolished have 48 hours to appeal to the area
commander; a final appeal may be made to the High Court.  A successful appeal
generally results in the conversion of a demolition order to sealing.  After a
house is demolished, military authorities confiscate the land and prohibit the
owner from rebuilding or removing the rubble.<p>
<p>
In November part of a house was demolished by military order for security
reasons after an appeal to the Israeli High Court was rejected.  This was the
first house demolition, albeit partial, since 1992.  The home was the residence
of the Palestinian responsible for the October bus bombing in Tel Aviv and
belonged to his parents.  Many human rights groups maintain that the sealing or
demolishing of homes is a form of collective punishment because such acts
target families and children.<p>
<p>
Owners may apply to regional military commanders for permits to rebuild or
unseal their homes.  In 1994 the Government processed 94 requests to open
sealed rooms and houses; 61 applications were approved.  In June the
Palestinian Center for the Study of Nonviolence began a campaign to reopen many
homes sealed during the occupation.  At the Center's urging, activists and
family members opened 130 of more than 350 sealed houses before they were
arrested.  Authorities resealed several of the homes.  In December the Israeli
Government decided to allow the opening or rebuilding of homes sealed or
demolished as a result of security offenses committed by a family member who
had been released from prison.  Each former prisoner must apply for a
rebuilding or unsealing permit after which the Government will approve or
reject the application.<p>
<p>
Israeli security services sometimes monitor mail and telephone conversations.
The authorities sometimes interrupt telephone service and electricity to
specific areas.<p>
<p>
In Gaza and Jericho, the existing law requires that a chief prosecutor issue
warrants for entry and searches of private property.  These requirements were
ignored in October, when the Palestinian police conducted a sweep of several
districts in the Gaza Strip to search for a kidnaped Israeli soldier.  Homes
were searched without the consent of their owners; in some cases, the police
forcibly entered premises, destroying doors and windows.  Palestinian human
rights groups and political leaders protested the police's conduct, but the PA
did not officially respond.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>OMAN</b><p>
<p>
The police are not required by law to obtain search warrants.  There is a
widespread belief that the Government eavesdrops on both oral and written
communications, and Omanis are guarded in both areas.  Citizens must obtain
permission from the Ministry of Interior to marry foreigners.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PAKISTAN</b><p>
<p>
By law the police must obtain a warrant to search a house but do not need a
warrant to search a person.  However, the police often enter homes without a
warrant.  In the absence of a warrant, a policeman is subject to charges of
criminal trespass.  However, policemen are seldom punished for illegal entry.<p>
<p>
The Government maintains several domestic intelligence services which monitor
politicians, political activists, suspected terrorists, and suspected foreign
intelligence agents.  Credible reports indicate that the authorities commonly
resort to wiretapping and occasionally intercept and open mail.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PANAMA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home and communications.
The authorities may not examine personal documents, monitor communications, or
enter and search private residences except by written order.  However, there
were credible complaints that PTJ agents failed to follow legal requirements
for arrest and search warrants and instead conducted indiscriminate searches of
entire apartment buildings or housing complexes.  Such complaints continued
during the first months of the Perez Balladares Government.<p>
<p>
Despite the view of some that the Constitution prohibits all wiretapping, the
Government maintains that wiretapping with judicial branch approval is legal.
Under the guidelines established by new antinarcotics legislation passed in
July, the Public Ministry may engage in undercover operations, including the
use of "videotaping and recording of conversations."  The Supreme Court will
ultimately have to decide whether wiretapping is constitutional and, if so,
under what circumstances.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PAPUA NEW GUINEA</b><p>
<p>
While the authorities generally respect privacy rights, police in the highlands
and the PNGDF in Bougainville have burned homes to quell intertribal conflict
and punish communities suspected of harboring suspected criminals.  Also,
police often force entry into homes during searches for criminals or stolen
goods.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PARAGUAY</b><p>
<p>
While the Government and its security forces generally did not interfere in the
private lives of citizens, there were exceptions.  The Constitution provides
that police may not enter private homes except to prevent a crime in progress
or when the police possess a judicial warrant.  There were credible reports
that at times the authorities ignored this legal guarantee, particularly in the
country's interior.  There were also allegations that the Government
occasionally spied on individuals and monitored communications for political
and security reasons.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PERU</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution requires security forces to have a judicial warrant to enter a
private dwelling, but this requirement is suspended in the emergency zones, and
security forces in those areas routinely conduct searches of private homes
without warrants.  The law requires that a Public Ministry prosecutor be
present during searches.  There were plausible reports that, on occasion,
police planted subversive pamphlets in the homes of persons they suspected of
terrorism but could not otherwise arrest for lack of evidence.  There were
frequent credible reports of illegal telephone wiretaps.  In August and
September, several prominent journalists, opposition politicians, and retired
military officers made credible claims that the Government's intelligence
services followed them, videotaped them, and recorded their private
conversations.<p>
<p>
In Lima and other urban areas, the army conducted "sweep" operations in which
soldiers surrounded and sealed off targeted neighborhoods to conduct
house-to-house searches.  They detained persons wanted for a crime and held for
questioning those found with unregistered weapons, subversive material, or
without identity documents.  Public prosecutors routinely accompany these
operations, and citizens made few complaints of serious abuses stemming from
them.<p>
<p>
A number of rural communities--with arms, training, and encouragement from the
army--have organized self-defense forces, or rondas, to protect themselves
against terrorist and bandit incursions.  These have had a noticeable impact on
curbing Sendero's presence in certain areas of the country.  In some parts of
Peru, rondas have existed for centuries as a form of social organization and to
protect communities from invaders and rustlers.  However, military authorities
organized many of the newer rondas and sometimes coerced peasants into
participating.  As a regular practice and to a far greater degree, Sendero also
forced peasants to join its military ranks, often for extended periods,
coercing their participation in terrorist attacks and executions.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>THE PHILIPPINES</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides that search warrants may be issued by a judge on a
finding of probable cause.  Restrictions on search and seizure are generally
observed, although raids without search warrants on private homes are
occasionally reported.  In the past, judges have thrown out evidence obtained
illegally.<p>
<p>
The Government does not interfere with the free personal use of the mails or
other public communications except upon issuance of a court order in the course
of an investigation.<p>
<p>
Some human rights NGO's are increasingly concerned about the Government's
forced resettlement of tenant farmers to make way for development projects.
These resettlement schemes are designed to clear the land for industrial,
agroindustrial, and tourism projects.  In urban settings, squatters are moved
to make way for infrastructure, commercial, and housing projects.  The
Government has made efforts to resettle squatters, as required by law, but
NGO's contend that in both rural and urban settings, those being relocated are
sometimes given little or no notice and are violently ejected.  Land rights
issues are made more difficult by the slow process of the Government's exercise
of eminent domain and complex zoning regulations.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>POLAND</b><p>
<p>
The Government does not arbitrarily monitor private mail or telephones.  There
is no Polish legislation that guarantees the right to privacy, although Poland
has signed the European Convention on Human Rights, which provides for that
right.  Poles do have the legal right to privacy of correspondence, and there
was no evidence of violations.<p>
<p>
The Government introduced draft legislation in Parliament in September which
would give the police the power--with the personal approval of the chief
prosecutor and the Interior Minister--to monitor private mail and telephone
conversations in cases involving serious crimes, drugs, money laundering, or
illegal arms sales.  The parliamentary opposition sought assurances that these
expanded police powers would be subject to appropriate human rights safeguards
but generally supported the need to expand the police force's ability to combat
crime.<p>
<p>
Polish law forbids arbitrary forced entry into homes.  Search warrants issued
by a prosecutor are required in order to enter private residences.  In
emergency cases when a prosecutor is not immediately available, police may
enter a residence with the approval of the local police commander.  In the most
urgent cases, in which there is not time to consult with the police commander,
police may enter a private residence after showing their official
identification.  There were no reports that Polish police abused search warrant
procedures in 1994.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PORTUGAL</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution forbids forced entry into homes and searches without a
judicial warrant.  In addition, entry into a person's home at night requires
the consent of the occupant.  The Government may intercept private
correspondence, or make wiretaps, only on the basis of a court order.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>QATAR</b><p>
<p>
Traditional attitudes of respect for the sanctity of the home provide a great
deal of protection against arbitrary intrusions for most citizens and residents
of Qatar.  A warrant must normally be obtained before police may search a
residence or business, except in cases involving national security or
emergencies.  However, warrants are issued by police officials themselves
rather than by judicial authorities.  There were no reports of unauthorized
searches of homes in 1994.  The police and security forces are believed to
monitor the communications of suspected criminals, those considered to be
security risks, and selected foreigners.<p>
<p>
With prior permission, which is usually granted, Qataris may marry foreigners
of any nationality and apply for residence permits for their spouses.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ROMANIA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for legal protection against the search of a
residence without a warrant, but this protection is subordinate to "national
security or public order."  The 1992 National Security Law defines national
security very broadly and lists as threats to national security not only crimes
such as terrorism, treason, espionage, assassination, and armed insurrection
but also totalitarian, racist, and anti-Semitic actions or attempts to change
the existing national borders. Security officials may enter residences without
proper authorization from a prosecutor if they deem a threat to national
security "imminent."<p>
<p>
The Constitution further states that the privacy of legal means of
communication is inviolable; thus, the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI) is
legally prohibited from engaging in political acts (e.g., monitoring the
communications of a political party). However, the laws on national security
allow it to engage in such monitoring on national security grounds.  Similarly,
although the law requires the SRI to obtain a warrant from a prosecutor to
carry out intelligence activities involving "threats to national security," it
may engage in a wide variety of operations, including "technical operations,"
in order to determine if a situation meets the legal definition of a "threat to
national security."<p>
<p>
In 1994 arbitrary interference with individual citizens' rights to privacy was
infrequent; however, some nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) and Protestant
church groups alleged that current or former government intelligence services
opened their mail and tapped their telephones.  The tenor of official responses
to such complaints was always that the SRI itself was not involved, but that
unreconstructed agents of the Securitate, the Communist-era internal
intelligence service, or independent individuals were involved.  In addition,
both Romanian citizens and foreign diplomats credibly reported opened mail,
personal surveillance, and harassment.<p>
<p>
The Government took some measures to investigate reports of such continuing
abuses.  In September the prosecutor's office brought to trial the former head
of the SRI in Maramures county, accused of illegally tapping wires for the PUNR
in the 1992 local elections.  The SRI had dismissed the accused immediately
following the alleged incident, but his trial attracted increased public
attention after the appointment of the new Minister of Telecommunications, who
is a member of the PUNR and was head of the telecommunications service in
Maramures at the time of the alleged infraction.  However, the court dismissed
the case in October on procedural grounds before trying it.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>RUSSIA</b><p>
<p>
Article 25 of the Constitution states that the right to privacy in the home may
be violated only on the basis of a court decision or in accordance with federal
laws.  In practice, law enforcement organs and internal security forces fail to
do this and continue to observe the Soviet-era requirement of informing the
prosecutor's office of intent to enter private premises.<p>
<p>
Article 23 of the Constitution provides for privacy of correspondence and
electronic communications, except in cases in which a judge issues a warrant.
Many Russians believe electronic monitoring of residences and telephone
conversations continues, even if at reduced levels in comparison to the Soviet
era.<p>
<p>
Refugee organizations claim that law enforcement officials routinely use
informer networks to track the whereabouts of persons from the Caucasus,
whether resident in Russia legally or illegally.  General societal
discrimination against people from the Caucasus area and reports of harassment
against these people by law enforcement officials lend credence to such
assertions.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>RWANDA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the respect of privacy of individuals,
correspondence, and communications and declares that the home is inviolable.
Police generally respected these provisions before the events of April.  In the
3-month period that followed, political and military officials of the interim
government abandoned any pretense of respecting privacy laws and committed
wholesale abuses.<p>
<p>
There are no reports that the new Government interfered with these rights, nor
does it reportedly engage in surveillance of political parties, associations,
or individuals.  However, Hutu civilians and displaced persons in the northwest
and southwest complained of abuses by RPA troops searching for weapons and
suspected war criminals.  After capturing Kigali, both RPA soldiers and
civilians committed widespread looting and vandalism.<p>

The authorities respect the concept of privacy of the home.  The law requires
judicial warrants for searches, and provides also for protection of the privacy
of correspondence, including telephonic communications.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the integrity of the person and the right to
privacy of home, correspondence, and private communication.  The Government
does not engage in intrusive practices, such as surveillance of individuals or
communications.  The Judicial Police are responsible for criminal
investigations and must obtain authorization from the Ministry of Justice to
conduct searches.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SENEGAL</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution prohibits arbitrary invasion of the home, and there was little
government interference in the private lives of citizens, particularly in the
rural areas.  Normally, search warrants are required and only judges may issue
them.  In practice, however, searches without warrants occasionally take
place.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SERBIA-MONTENEGRO</b><p>
<p>
Federal law gives republic ministries of the interior sole control over the
decision to monitor potential criminal activities, a power routinely abused.
Authorities regularly monitored opposition and dissident activity, eavesdropped
on conversations, read mail, and tapped telephones.  In December human rights
advocates objected to an announcement by the Federal post office that it had
been registering all mail from abroad, ostensibly to protect mail carriers from
charges of theft.<p>
<p>
Although the law includes restrictions on searches, officials often ignored
such restrictions.  In Kosovo and Sandzak, police systematically subjected
ethnic Albanians to random searches of their homes, vehicles, and offices,
asserting they were searching for weapons.  The CDHRF reported that in the
first 3 months of 1994 police searched over 1,000 Kosovar Albanian homes, often
physically abusing the inhabitants.<p>
<p>
As an example of such methods, on a typical day in Kosovo (July 22), police
raided Hetmen and Nezir Makolli's Pristina home and seized a licensed hunting
rifle, searched the home of Hysen Hasani and his sons in Lipljan, and raided
the home of Hasan Fetaj in Suva Reka, threatening to draft him into the
Yugoslav army.  Similar scenes were repeated thousands of times in Kosovo and
Sandzak.<p>
<p>
In January and February, police conducted a series of massive house-to-house
searches in Prijepolje (Sandzak).  Police also routinely stopped private
vehicles in Kosovo and Sandzak and searched them and the passengers without
probable cause.  Authorities often confiscated foreign currency from drivers
and passengers, although it is not illegal to possess foreign currency.<p>
<p>

<b>SEYCHELLES</b><p>

The Constitution provides for the right to privacy and freedom from arbitrary

generally respected this requirement in practice.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SIERRA LEONE</b><p>
<p>
Although the Constitution prohibits arbitrary invasion of the home, the
authorities still have broad authority under NPRC decrees to monitor actions or
conversations within homes, to prevent a person from acting in a manner
prejudicial to public safety, to impose restrictions on employment or business,
to control association or communication with other persons, and to interfere
with correspondence.<p>
<p>
In practice, there were numerous occasions of abusive treatment of ordinary
citizens by ill-disciplined soldiers and police, both within and outside of the
war zone.  These abuses included forced entry into homes, robberies, and
assaults, some of them fatal.  Superior officers frequently punished offending
soldiers when caught.  In November the government executed 12 soldiers who had
been found guilty by a court-martial for crimes ranging from armed robbery to
murder (see Section l.e.).<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SINGAPORE</b><p>
<p>
The Government can use its wide discretionary powers if it determines that
national security is threatened.  In most cases, the law requires search
warrants, normally issued by the magistrate court, for intrusion into the home.
Law enforcement officers may, however, search a person, home, or property
without a warrant if they decide searches are necessary to preserve evidence.<p>
<p>
The Misuse of Drugs Act and the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act also
permit warrantless searches in dealing with drug- and secret society-related
offenses.  The courts may undertake judicial review of such searches at the
request of the defendant.  Divisions of the Government's law enforcement
agencies, including the ISD and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Board
(CPIB), have wide networks for gathering information.  The authorities have the
capability to monitor telephone and other private conversations and conduct
surveillance, but there were no proven allegations that they did so in 1994.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SLOVAK REPUBLIC</b><p>
<p>
The Criminal Code requires police to obtain a judicial search warrant in order
to enter a home.  The court may issue such a warrant only if there is a
well-founded suspicion that important evidence or persons accused of criminal
activity are present inside or if there is some other important reason.  Police
must present the warrant before conducting the house search or within 24 hours
after the search.<p>
<p>
The 1993 police law regulates wiretapping and mail surveillance for the
purposes of criminal investigation, which may be conducted, on the order of a
judge or prosecutor, only in cases of extraordinarily serious premeditated
crimes or crimes involving international treaty obligations.  There were no
reports of illegal surveillance of persons or communications or of mail
tampering.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SLOVENIA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides protection for privacy and the inviolability of the
home, mail, and other means of communication.  These rights and protections are
usually respected in practice.  However, in March parts of a university
professor's private correspondence, critical of a minister in the Government,
were read out in a broadcast on a government-controlled television station.
The issue is now in the courts.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SOLOMON ISLANDS</b><p>
<p>
In addition to legal provisions, the traditional culture provides strong
protection against these types of abuses.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SOMALIA</b><p>
<p>
These rights were regularly violated by the warring factions.  During fighting
in Mogadishu, heavily armed bandits systematically looted the property of rival
groups.  Similar incidents occurred after the fighting in Kismayo in February.
During military operations, the major factions have conducted home searches and
evictions, and homes and property belonging to the former government and
international bodies have been looted and destroyed.  Although there has been
some discussion about property claims, the continued fighting has rendered the
issue moot.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SOUTH AFRICA</b><p>
<p>
Police and security forces retained the legal authority to engage in domestic
surveillance activities, including the use of informers.  However, informed
observers believe that under the country's dramatically changed political
environment the use of this authority has been limited to the pursuit of
legitimate law enforcement and national security objectives.<p>
<p>
Before the Interim Constitution came into force, police had sweeping powers of
search and seizure in magisterial districts that had been declared "unrest
areas," under the provisions of the Public Safety Act.  The provisions of the
Act that allowed for the declaration of "unrest areas" are no longer operative,
and police searches in all of South Africa must now be conducted in accordance
with the Criminal Procedure Act of 1977.  This Act requires that a warrant be
issued by a magistrate before a search can be conducted, unless there are
reasonable grounds to suspect that evidence would be destroyed in the time that
it would take to obtain one.  Despite the widespread anticipation that some
provisions of the Criminal Procedures Act will be challenged as being
unreasonable infringements of the right to privacy, all South Africans now
generally enjoy protection from unreasonable searches and seizures.<p>
<p>
The legacy of apartheid has left vast numbers of South Africans landless; more
than 8 million people now live in squatter camps which often surround settled
communities.  The Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act gives landowners and
local governments the authority to remove informal settlements without
reference to the courts.  Despite widespread preparedness on the part of the
central Government and many local authorities to seek accommodation with
squatters, some municipalities, landowners, and, in one case, rightwing
vigilantes, have demolished shacks as a means of forcing squatters to move.<p>
<p>
Although the problem of forced relocation of residents of informal settlements
was most pronounced prior to the April election, forced relocations continued
throughout the year.  The most notable of these incidents occurred in early
June when the Johannesburg City Council, without securing a court order or
legal judgment, demolished two squatter settlements on city land.  Unauthorized
land invasions by squatters also continued sporadically throughout the year, a
practice severely decried by the Government as inimical to the housing strategy
it devised as part of its Reconstruction and Development Program.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SPAIN</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution protects the privacy of the home and correspondence.  Under
the Criminal Code, government authorities must obtain court approval before
searching private property, wiretapping, or interfering with private
correspondence.  The antiterrorist law authorizes the Minister of the Interior
to act prior to obtaining court approval "in cases of emergency."   There have
been no complaints of abuse of this authority.<p>
<p>
The Congress of Deputies passed legislation in 1992 broadening police authority
to makes searches and detentions without a court order, mostly in antinarcotics
operations, but in 1993 this law was ruled unconstitutional.  During the 20
months it was in force, this law led to 340 raids and 940 arrests.  Many damage
claims have been filed against the Government.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SRI LANKA</b><p>
<p>
The Government generally respects the constitutional protections of individual
privacy and the sanctity of the family and home.  The police obtain proper
warrants for arrests and searches conducted under ordinary law.<p>
<p>
However, the security forces are not required to obtain warrants for searches
conducted under the PTA (see Section 1.e.).  The Secretary of Defense is
responsible for providing oversight for such searches.  There is no judicial
review or other means of redress for alleged illegal searches under the PTA.<p>
<p>
The Government is believed to monitor telephone conversations and
correspondence on a selective basis.  The security forces routinely open mail
destined for the LTTE-controlled areas and seize contraband.<p>
<p>
The LTTE routinely invades the privacy of citizens.  In 1990 the LTTE evicted
thousands of Muslim residents from their homes in the north.  They currently
live in refugee camps.<p>

<b>SUDAN</b><p>
<p>
The Government routinely interferes with its citizens' privacy.  Throughout
1994 security forces frequently conducted night searches without warrants.
They targeted persons suspected of political crimes or also, in northern Sudan,
of distilling or consuming illegal alcoholic beverages.  For example, in March
security forces broke up a family ceremony in a private home in memory of 28
officers executed in 1991 for coup plotting.  They arrested and beat 30
participants at the memorial service.<p>
<p>
A wide network of government informants conducted pervasive surveillance in
schools, universities, markets, workplaces, and neighborhoods.  The authorities
kept key opposition figures under frequent surveillance.  The Government also
continued its practice of summarily dismissing military personnel and other
government employees whose loyalty it suspected.  Dozens lost their jobs
throughout the year.  Security personnel routinely opened and read mail and
tapped telephones.<p>
<p>
Government-instituted neighborhood "popular committees," ostensibly a mechanism
for political mobilization, served as a means for monitoring households.  These
committees caused many Sudanese to be wary of neighbors who could report them
for "suspicious" activities, including "excessive" contact with foreigners.
The committees also furnished or withheld documents essential for obtaining an
exit visa from Sudan.  In high schools, students were sometimes pressured to
join proregime youth groups.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SURINAME</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the right to privacy.  The law requires warrants
for searches, which are issued not by judges but by quasi-judicial officers who
supervise criminal investigations.  The police obtain them in the great
majority of investigations.  The new military command curbed invasions of
privacy by the military such as the illegal monitoring of telephone calls,
monitoring the movements of human rights advocates, and threatening government
officials, policemen, politicians, human rights workers, and journalists.
Although some persons continued these activities on occasion, the military
authorities reportedly did not authorize them to do so.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SWAZILAND</b><p>
<p>
The law requires a warrant from a magistrate before police may search homes or
other premises, and police generally respect this requirement in practice.
However, police officers with the rank of subinspector or higher have the right
to search without a warrant if they believe evidence might be lost through
delay in obtaining a warrant.  While searches without warrants occur
occasionally, the issue of legality of evidence rarely arises in court.
Opponents of the Government complained of unlawful police searches and seizures
but did not seek judicial relief in 1994.<p>
<p>
There is no evidence that the Government systematically monitors private
correspondence or conversations.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SWEDEN</b><p>
<p>
The law limits home searches to investigations of crimes punishable by at least
2 years' imprisonment, such as murder, robbery, rape, arson, sabotage,
counterfeiting, or treason.  The authorities respect this provision.  Normally,
police must obtain court approval for a search or wiretap; however, a senior
police officer may approve a search if time is a critical factor or there
appears to be a threat to life.  A parliamentary committee each year reviews
all monitoring of telephones, faxes, or computers.<p>

Although laws provide for the freedom from arbitrary interference, the

The authorities arbitrarily set up security checkpoints on streets and roads.
At these sites, security officials search persons and vehicles without
warrants, looking for weapons, drugs, subversive literature, and smuggled
goods.<p>

The security services selectively monitor telephone conversations and facsimile
transmissions and interfere with the mail.  In some cases, censors have
prevented the delivery to private citizens of foreign human rights
publications.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>TAIWAN</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution and sections of the criminal and civil codes contain
provisions for privacy.  The authorities generally do not make warrantless
searches, which were common before the lifting of martial law.  A warrant,
issued by a prosecutor or a judge, must be obtained before a search, except
when incidental to arrest.  Critics, however, claim that the "incidental to
arrest" provision is not only unconstitutional but often interpreted broadly by
police to justify searches of locations other than actual sites of arrests.
Moreover, police continue to search cars routinely at roadblocks.<p>
<p>
According to the National Police Administration, warrantless searches are
allowed only in specialized circumstances, such as to arrest an escapee or if
facts indicate a person is in the process of committing a crime and the
circumstances are urgent.  In any such case, the police must file a report with
the prosecutor or court within 24 hours.  Evidence collected without a warrant,
according to regulations, is not excluded from introduction during a trial;
however, a policeman who carries out an illegal search can be sued for illegal
entry and sentenced up to 1 year's imprisonment.<p>
<p>
Although in the past allegations were made that police and security agencies
interfere with the right to privacy through such means as surveillance and
interception of correspondence and telephone calls, there were no reports of
such interference for political purposes in 1994.  According to EY regulations,
judicial and security authorities may file a written request to a prosecutor's
office to monitor telephone calls to collect evidence against a suspect
involved in a major crime.<p>

<b>TAJIKISTAN</b><p>
<p>
Articles 22 and 23 of the new Constitution and the Criminal Code provide for
the inviolability of the home and prohibit interference with correspondence,
telephone conversations, and postal and communication rights, except "in cases
prescribed by law."  Police may not enter and search a private home without the
approval of the procurator.  In some cases, police may enter and search a home
without permission, but they must then inform the procurator within 24 hours.
Police are permitted to enter and search homes without permission if they have
compelling reason to believe a delay in obtaining a warrant would impair
national security.  There is no judicial review of police searches conducted
without a warrant.  In September the penalties for the violation of the privacy
of correspondence were increased to several years in prison.  Also in
September, the Supreme Soviet raised the maximum sentence for invasion of
privacy of the home from between 2 and 5 years to between 5 and 8 years in
prison.<p>
<p>
Numerous examples of arbitrary illegal search and seizure by government forces
included the August raid by Interior Ministry forces against a predominantly
Garmi and Pamiri neighborhood in the Yuzhni district of Dushanbe.  Security
forces presented no warrants as they rounded up young men, apparently at
random, and took them away.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>TANZANIA</b><p>
<p>
The State continued to interfere with these rights, which are generally
provided for in the Constitution.  The CCM has historically penetrated all
levels of society through local cells, varying in size from single-family homes
to large apartment buildings and containing from 10 to 200 persons.  Unpaid
party officials serve as 10-cell leaders with authority to resolve problems at
the grassroots level and to report to authorities any suspicious behavior,
event, or noncompliance with compulsory night patrol service in the
neighborhood.  In 1993 elections were held for new grassroots leaders to
replace the CCM 10-cell leaders in nonparty business.  Because the Government
reversed its position and subsequently held the elections on a party basis,
most of the opposition parties boycotted the elections.  In fact, few voters
participated in these elections, and the former CCM 10-cell leaders retained
nearly all of their power and influence.<p>
<p>
CCM membership is voluntary and is estimated at approximately 2 to 3 million
cardholders.  While in the past CCM membership had been necessary for
advancement in political and other areas, the importance of such membership is
waning.<p>
<p>
The Criminal Procedure Act of 1985 authorizes police officials (including the
civilian anticrime units) to issue search warrants; however, the Act also
authorizes searches of person and premises without a warrant if necessary to
prevent the loss or destruction of evidence connected with an offense or if
circumstances are serious and urgent.  In practice, warrants are rarely
requested, and the police and others search private homes and business
establishments at will.  The security services reportedly monitor telephones
and correspondence of some citizens and selected foreign residents.<p>
<p>
Compulsory participation in local anticrime groups known as "Wasalama" and
"Sungusungu" continued in some areas.  Historically, these groups have operated
only in rural areas to combat cattle rustling and other criminal activity;
however, government ministers continued to promote them vigorously in urban
areas to combat crime.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>THAILAND</b><p>
<p>
The law requires police to obtain a warrant prior to a search.  Warrants are
issued by the police with prior Ministry of Interior or provincial governor
approval and are not subject to judicial review.  There were some credible
reports that officers sometimes endorse warrants in advance and then allow
their noncommissioned subordinates to apply them as needed.  The Anti-Communist
Activities Act allows officials engaged in "Communist suppression operations"
to conduct searches without warrants, but these powers rarely have been invoked
in recent years and were not invoked in 1994.<p>

However, security services monitor persons espousing leftist or controversial
views, including foreign visitors.<p>

<b>TOGO</b><p>
<p>
In criminal cases, a judge or senior police official may authorize searches of

ignored in cases in which the authorities consider that state security is
involved or in which a "flagrant crime" is deemed to have been committed.<p>
<p>
The authorities continued to monitor the activities of Islamists and leftists
and searched their homes without warrants.  They frequently harassed the
relatives and associates of such persons by repeatedly interrogating them.
During the year, several human rights monitors and oppositionists accused the
Government of harassment and intimidation.  Police presence in urban areas is
heavy.  Traffic officers routinely stop motorists to examine their identity and
vehicular documents.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>TURKEY</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for the inviolability of a person's domicile and the
privacy of correspondence and communication.  Government officials may enter a
private residence or intercept or monitor private correspondence only upon
issuance of a judicial warrant.  These provisions are generally respected in
practice outside the state of emergency region.<p>
<p>
A judge must decide whether to issue a search warrant for a residence.  If
delay may cause harm, prosecutors and municipal officers authorized to carry
out prosecutors' instructions may conduct a search.  Searches of private
premises may not be carried out at night, unless the delay will be damaging or
the search will result in the capture of a prisoner at large.  Exceptions
include persons under special observation by the Security Directorate General,
places anyone can enter at night, places where criminals gather, places where
materials obtained through the Commission of Crimes are kept, gambling
establishments, and brothels.  In the 10 provinces under emergency rule, the
Regional Governor can and does empower security authorities to search without a
warrant residences or the premises of political parties, businesses,
associations, or other organizations.  According to the HRF, the practice of
security authorities in these provinces to search, hold, or seize without
warrant persons, letters, telegrams, and documents is unconstitutional.
Roadblocks are commonplace in the southeast, and security officials regularly
search vehicles and travelers.<p>
<p>
Security forces have compelled the evacuation of villages in the southeast to
prevent villagers from giving aid and comfort to the PKK (see Section 1.g.).
The Government admits to village and hamlet evacuations but claims they occur
as the consequence of pressures by and fear of the PKK and because security
operations against the PKK in the region make continued occupancy unsafe.<p>

legal means to regulate the conduct of surveillance by the state security
apparatus, which regularly monitors the activities of opponents and critics of

However, under the EPA, on-duty members of the armed forces or policemen in
Northern Ireland may enter any premises  if they believe they have "reasonable
grounds of suspicion" that the entry is necessary to preserve peace and
order.<p>
<p>
In Catholic communities in Northern Ireland, where distrust of the Government
has deep historical roots, many believe that the conduct of some members of the
security forces in carrying out security checks constitutes unwarranted
harassment and intimidation.  Such allegations also occur in Protestant
neighborhoods, albeit less frequently.  The Government intensively trains
security personnel in proper procedures, but acknowledges that violations of
the rules occasionally occur.<p>

Search warrants issued by prosecutors, not judges, are required and utilized in
most cases.  The SBU may, however, conduct intrusive surveillance and searches
without a warrant on national security grounds.  Human rights observers report
receiving no complaints of invasion of privacy by the SBU.  According to the
SBU charter, persons subject to surveillance must be informed after a month's
time.  The Prosecutor General's office has oversight responsibility over the
SBU, but the extent to which it utilizes that authority to monitor SBU
activities and to curb excesses by security officials is unknown.<p>
<p>
The remnants of Soviet control mechanisms survive in many guises.  The militia
stops vehicles arbitrarily in cities, at the borders of cities and towns, and
throughout the countryside.  It needs no probable cause to stop vehicles for an
extensive document check and inspection of all parts of the vehicle and its
contents.  This has become a great source of and inducement to corruption in
the militia:  citizens who often have committed no violation, or only a minor
one, prefer to pay a bribe to avoid time-consuming inspections.  Westerners and
Western vehicles are popular targets of this treatment.  Persons who have
committed serious violations also escape justice by paying bribes to officials,
further undermining the concept of the rule of law.<p>

The Constitution prohibits entry into homes without the owner's permission,

a warrant and without demonstrating probable cause, an officer's actions in
searching premises are subject to review, and he is subject to disciplinary
action if he acts irresponsibly.  Officials other than a police officer must
have a court order to enter a private home.  Local custom places a high value
on privacy, and entry into private homes without the owner's permission is
rare.  There is no known surveillance of private correspondence.<p>

incidents of searches without warrants by security forces.  According to the
media, DISIP searched the homes of a prominent Caracas businessman and of a
noted intellectual, and the DIM similarly searched 30 homes in the city of
Cumana.  In recent years, there have been some complaints of telephone
surveillance, and human rights monitors accused the security forces of illegal

in his office were being wiretapped, apparently by former employees of his

<p>
<b>VIETNAM</b><p>
<p>
The Government continued to operate a nationwide system of surveillance and
control through household registration and party-appointed block wardens who
use informants to keep track of individual activities.  However, many foreign
observers believe this monitoring was done with less scope and efficiency than
in the past, with authorities concentrating on those suspected of involvement
in unauthorized political or religious activities.  Anecdotal evidence suggests
Government monitoring is stricter in the south, especially in Ho Chi Minh City.
Particularly in urban areas, most Vietnamese citizens were free to contact,
talk, and work with foreigners, although many remained nervous about extensive
social contacts.<p>
<p>
The Government continued to selectively censor mail, confiscate packages, and
monitor telephone and facsimile transmissions.  In the past, the Party pressed
people to belong to one or more mass organizations, which exist for villages,
city districts, schools, work (trade unions), youth, and women.  However, with
the growth of the private sector, these organizations play a less important
role than in the past.<p>

While membership in the VCP remains an aid to advancement in the Government or
in state companies, and vital to promotion to senior levels of the Government,
the Party faced increased difficulty attracting members.  In response, the
Government increased its recruitment efforts and was marginally successful in
attracting new members from the private sector.<p>
<p>
The Government continued to implement a family-planning policy that urges all
families to have no more than two children.  It  sometimes penalized people who
have more than two children by denying promotions or permission to change
jobs.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>WESTERN SAHARA</b><p>
<p>
(no information)<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>WESTERN SAMOA</b><p>
<p>
Western Samoan law provides for protection from invasion of the home or seizure
of property without substantive and procedural safeguards, including search
warrants, which are issued by the judicial branch.  Practically, however, there
is little or no privacy in the village.  Village officials by law must have
permission to enter homes, but there can be substantial social pressure to
grant such permission.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>YEMEN</b><p>
<p>
Despite constitutional provisions against such interference, security forces
routinely search homes, monitor telephones, read personal mail, and otherwise
intrude into personal matters for alleged security considerations.  Such
activities are conducted without warrants issued by legal authorities or other
judicial supervision.  Many citizens believe that the security forces monitor
telephone conversations.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ZAIRE</b><p>
<p>
Security forces routinely ignore the Constitution's provision for the
inviolability of the home and of private correspondence.  They ignore the
requirement for a search warrant, entering and searching homes at will.  Under
the pretext of searching for arms, troops entered and looted the home of a
leader of the radical opposition in Kinshasa; troops also looted the home of an
urban commissar in Kolwezi.  Human rights monitors and the press report
numerous other instances in which gangs believed to be security forces entered
and looted private homes, sometimes abusing or threatening the residents.  In
many of these cases, simple robbery, rather than political intimidation,
appeared to be the motive.  Citizens widely assume that the Government monitors
mail and telephone communications.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ZAMBIA</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution provides for respect for privacy and the inviolability of the
home, and the authorities generally respected these rights in practice.  Except
during a state of emergency, the law requires a warrant before police may enter
a home.  Roundups of suspected illegal aliens in the home or workplace
continued.  According to the government Commissioner for Refugees, immigration
officials are empowered under the law to conduct these roundups without a
warrant.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ZIMBABWE</b><p>
<p>
The Constitution protects citizens from arbitrary search or entry, and since
the lifting of the State of Emergency (SOE) in June 1990, these protections
have been generally respected.  It is widely known, however, that the
Government monitors private correspondence and telephones, particularly
international communications.<p>
<p>
Although the need for land reform in Zimbabwe is almost universally accepted,
pursuant to the 1992 Land Acquisition Act farmers whose lands have been
designated for acquisition may only appeal the amount of compensation in
administrative courts, not the decision to acquire their farms.<p>
<p>
The Act has been implemented largely along racial lines; the Government stated
that black-owned commercial farms would not be subject to designation.  In some
cases, land has been designated for acquisition to achieve political goals.
The designation of former Member of Parliament (M.P.) Henry Ellsworth's home
farm for acquisition, highlighted in the 1993 Human Rights Report as an example
of the Land Acquisition Act's use as a political tool, has been revoked.
However, opposition party leader Ndabaningi Sithole is still fighting the
Government's acquisition of his Churu farm.  After the Government's late 1993
attempt to evict more than 2,500 families living on the property, several
thousand Churu farm residents were resettled on a holding farm where several
died as the result of abysmal sanitary conditions.  The situation at Churu farm
remained at a standoff until October 1994, when the ZRP evicted the remaining
1,600 residents and resettled them at a camp formerly used by Mozambican
refugees.<p>

PRIVACY
INTERNATIONAL</HEAD></FONT></B></FONT></CENTER></H1>
<p>
For more than two decades, governments and companies have used powerful computer technology
to collect, process and disseminate a vast spectrum of personal information. Since the late
1980s, when computer and telecommunications systems began to converge, this process has
accelerated. The result is that personal privacy is endangered as never before.
<p>
During 1990, in response to a growing number of privacy threats, more than a hundred leading
privacy experts and Human Rights organizations from forty countries linked arms to form a
world organization for the protection of privacy. Members of the new body, including computer
professionals, academics, lawyers, journalists, jurists and human rights activists,   had a
common interest in promoting an international understanding of the importance of privacy and
data protection. Meetings of the group, which took the name Privacy International, were held
throughout that year in North America, Europe, Asia and the South Pacific, and members agreed
to work toward the establishment of effective privacy protection throughout the world.
<p>
The formation of Privacy International is the first successful attempt to establish a
structured world focus on this crucial area of human rights. Privacy International is an
independent, non-government organization with the primary role of advocacy and support.
<p>

<p>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Campaigns and Networking</B></FONT></CENTER>
<p>

Privacy International has been most  prominent  in North America, Europe and Asia, where it
has liaised with local human rights organisations to raise awareness about the development of
national surveillance systems. The network has also been used by law reform and human rights
organisations in more than twenty countries to assist local privacy issues. In Thailand and
the Philippines, for example, Privacy International worked with local human rights bodies to
develop national campaigns against the establishment of government identity card systems. In
Canada, New Zealand, the United States, Hungary, Australia and the United Kingdom we have
promoted privacy issues through national media and through public campaigns.

<p>
Privacy International organises two conferences each year.  These are held at the time of the
International Conference of Privacy and Data Protection Commissioners, and the US based
Computers, Freedom and Privacy conference. These conferences have been held in Sydney,
Washington, Manchester, Chicago, San Francisco and the Hague. They bring together an
unprecedented diversity of interest groups and expertise.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Structure and Finances</B> </FONT></CENTER>
<p>

Privacy International has received funding and support from a range of Foundations, academic
establishments and non-government organisations. These include The Stern Foundation
(Washington DC), The German Marshall Fund (Washington DC), Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility (CPSR, Washington DC) and the University of New South Wales (Sydney). The
organisation is also minimally financed through membership fees and newsletter subscriptions.
Privacy International is administered through the Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington DC.

<p>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Activities for 1996</B></FONT></CENTER>
<p>

In 1996, Privacy International will produce a Privacy Activists Handbook for distribution to
consumer, privacy and human rights groups throughout the world. The book will explain how
privacy issues can be identified and fought through campaigns, political action and media
activity.  The book will be a vital part of other strategies being initiated by Privacy
International. Privacy International will also be holding a conference in Ottawa,
Canada, on the subject of advanced technologies of surveillance. Amongst these are genetic
technology, satellite surveillance, advanced Geographic Information Systems, Intelligent
Vehicle Highway Systems, microchip implants and nanotechnology. The conference will be held
September 16.

Introduction</U><P>
On March 25th, 1996 Industry Canada hosted a workshop on <B>Exploring the Oversight Function for Personal Data Protection in the Marketplace.</B> In the morning session representatives from the Netherlands, New Zealand, Quebec, Hong Kong and the United States explained how data protection law is administered and enforced in their respective societies. In the afternoon, the participants engaged in a roundtable discussion on the implementation of data protection policy in the Canadian context. The Canadian representatives included officials from federal government departments, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC), the provincial Information and Privacy Commissioner and Ombudsman offices, and the Canadian Standards Association (CSA). <P>
I was asked by Industry Canada to be the rapporteur for this workshop and to write a report on the day's events. The views expressed in this paper, however, are not a strict report of all that was said at the workshop and no views are attributed to any of the participants. Rather the paper is a set of personal reflections on the various options for extending privacy protection rules to the private sector in the light of the very informative discussion on this occasion. These views are mine and mine alone, even though they have been shaped by numerous conversations with experts and officials both before and after the March 25th workshop. <P>
The paper also builds upon my own previous work on the implementation of privacy protection policy in other countries, especially <I>Regulating Privacy: Data Protection and Public Policy in Europe and the United States</I>, and upon the research conducted on the implementation of the Canadian Standards Association's <I>Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information </I>(Q830). The paper also draws upon other comparative and Canadian analysis of the implementation of privacy protection policy. In particular, the 1995 report by Ian Lawson set out a complete range of regulatory options for the protection of privacy on the information highway. This paper attempts to narrow the focus, and to concentrate on the most practical regulatory options for Canada.<P>
Although there is plenty of scope to draw lessons from Canadian and overseas experience, we are not working with a <I>tabula rasa.</I> There are public sector laws at the federal level, and in most provinces. In Quebec's Bill 68, we have the only legislation in Canada that regulates private sector practices. Each of these statutes grants a different range of powers and responsibilities to the respective offices of Information and Privacy Commissioners (see Appendices). In addition, there are a plethora of other provisions within provincial and federal statutes that relate to the collection, storage, processing and transmission of personal data. Many businesses have also developed voluntary "codes of practice." It is impossible to "wipe the slate clean" and to build a privacy protection regime from the ground up. The policy process will be inescapably incremental. It must build upon the instruments and provisions that are already in place. <P>
The paper will also not grapple with the complicated issue of federal/provincial constitutional authority. To a large extent, questions about the appropriate oversight and compliance mechanisms will apply whether or not legislation is crafted with a comprehensive scope, or whether it applies more narrowly to federally regulated entities. This paper addresses the functions that need to be performed in any effective regime for personal data protection. Those functions will require careful analysis whether they are performed at the federal and/or provincial levels, or on a comprehensive or sectoral basis. This paper is about the level of regulation. Jurisdictional conflicts will continue to occur under any legislated or self-regulatory scheme. <P>
I am, therefore, indebted to those people who attended the March 25th workshop. This paper cannot purport to offer any consensus on the results of that meeting. Nevertheless, I hope that those present recognize from this paper the most important themes and issues discussed on that occasion. I am also grateful to Ritu Mahil for her research assistance. <BR>

<B>I. <U>The National Standard for Privacy Protection</B></U><P>
In its 1995 report the Information Highway Advisory Council (IHAC) advised the federal government to: <P>
create a level playing field for the protection of personal information on the Information Highway by developing and implementing a flexible legislative framework for both public and private sectors. Legislation would require sectors or organizations to meet the standard of the CSA model code, while allowing the flexibility to determine how they will refine their own codes.<P>
The report goes on to recommend that the federal government "in cooperation with the CSA Working Group on Privacy and other interested parties, study the development of effective oversight and enforcement mechanisms." This paper is a contribution to that effort. <P>
On May 23, Industry Minister Manley released the government's response to the IHAC report in which it was concluded that "the right to privacy must be recognized in law, especially in an electronic world of private databases where it is all too easy to collect and exploit information about individual citizens." Hence: <BR>
As a means of encouraging business and consumer confidence in the Information Highway, the Ministers of Industry and Justice, after consultation with the provinces and other stakeholders, will bring forward proposals for a legislative framework governing the protection of personal data in the private sector.<P>
The government's response explicitly mentions the <I>Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information</I> from the Canadian Standards Association as a legislative framework. The following principles have been widely agreed by representatives from government, industry and consumer associations. They represent an important consensus on the basic principles of a privacy protection policy: <P>
<BR>
<I>&#133; <U>Accountability</U><BR>
An organization is responsible for personal information under its control and shall designate an individual or individuals who are accountable for the organization's compliance with the following principles.</I><BR>
<I>&#133; <U>Identifying Purposes</U><BR>
The purposes for which personal information is collected shall be identified by the organization at or before the time the information is collected<BR>
&#133; <U>Consent</U><BR>
The knowledge and consent of the individual are required for the use, or disclosure of personal information, except where inappropriate.<BR>
&#133; <U>Limiting Collection</U><BR>
The collection of personal information shall be limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by the organization. Information shall be collected by fair and lawful means.<BR>
&#133; <U>Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention</U><BR>
Personal information shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required by law. Personal information shall be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.<BR>
&#133; <U>Accuracy</U><BR>
Personal information shall be as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.<BR>
&#133; <U>Safeguards</U><BR>
Personal Information shall be protected by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.<BR>
&#133; <U>Openness</U><BR>
An organization shall make readily available to individuals specific information about its policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.<BR>
&#133; <U>Individual Access</U><BR>
Upon request, an individual shall be informed of the existence, use, and disclosure of his or her personal information and shall be given access to that information. An individual shall be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate.<BR>
&#133; <U>Challenging Compliance</U><BR>
An individual shall be able to address a challenge concerning compliance with the above principles to the designated individual or individuals accountable for the organization's compliance.<BR>
</I><P>
<B>The goal of any national privacy protection policy should be to implement these principles throughout all organizations that process personal data (in both public and private sectors).</B> <P>
This goal requires voluntary action from the "bottom-up" as well as regulatory action from the top-down. There are a range of tools within the repertoire of possible policy instruments. Four are outlined within Industry Canada's 1994 publication<I> Privacy and the Canadian Information Highway:</I> legislation and regulation; voluntary codes and standards; technological solutions; and consumer education. Although this paper concentrates on the relationship between law, regulation, codes and standards, it should never be forgotten that technologies of privacy (such as public-key encryption) have a crucial role to play in any privacy policy. Moreover, no policy can succeed without the actions of an informed and vigilant citizenry. Each of these four approaches contributes to a "mosaic of solutions." Each is a necessary condition for privacy protection on the information highway; none is a sufficient condition. <P>
<B>II. <U>The Value of the Privacy Standard</B></U><P>
The status quo has been described as a "privacy patchwork." A comprehensive data protection law covering all private sector organizations in Quebec contrasts with a hodgepodge of voluntary codes and isolated statutory provisions in the rest of the country. Partly as a response to this incoherence, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) has recently developed a <I>Code for the Protection of Personal Information </I>in association with stakeholders from government, consumer groups and key industry sectors (banking, telecommunications, insurance, direct-marketing, credit-reporting). This Code was ratified without any dissent in September 1995 and was released in March 1996. It was designed to add some uniformity to data protection policy and practice within the Canadian private sector. <P>
At first glance, the <I>CSA Model Code</I> might seem a Canadian version of the <I>OECD Guidelines -- </I>a rearrangement and translation of the key principles into the Canadian context. At the moment, it is just that -- a model that any organization can use and adapt to their specific circumstances. But it does represent a very important consensus, brokered among the major stakeholders. Moreover, it has doubtless been very valuable for participants in the process to think about the privacy protection problem from scratch and to grapple with these complex issues. <P>
Although no decision has yet been made about the mechanisms for implementation and oversight, the <I>CSA Model Code</I> is a "standard" that might be subjected to the same kind of certification and registration procedures that are used for other standards. Privacy, of course, is not the kind of "hard" standard typically used within manufacturing industry. Nevertheless it does have certain parallels with the range of "quality management standards" within the ISO-9000 series that have been rapidly permeating the Canadian and American private sectors, as well as with environmental standards in the ISO 14000 series. Thus, in the same way that a company might be forced to register to ISO-9000 to convince its clients and customers that it has adopted a level of "quality assurance" the same system of accreditation could be developed to the privacy standard, where effective data protection is demanded within the Canadian or international marketplace. The price of maintaining a registration to the standard would be an agreement to have independent and regular privacy audits. <P>
Of course, not all businesses would be expected to go to the kind of trouble and expense of registering to ISO-9000. The registration scheme for privacy would also require procedures applicable to the smaller business. The scheme requires an appropriate balance between the encouragement of registration on the one hand, and the prevention of symbolic claims about policies and practices on the other. It also requires an appropriate publicity vehicle, so that any consumer can find out who has registered to the standard and who has not. A "Privacy Good Book" in the form of a <I>Privacy Register </I>would have to accompany the registration scheme.<P>
If a credible registration process is established, the <I>CSA Model Code</I> ceases to be a "voluntary" mechanism. Organizations would have to produce a code and a related set of operational guidelines and be subjected to regular and independent auditing of their practices. The system would build a more consistent and credible system of verification than occurs at the moment. It could satisfy international and contractual requirements. It could provide a more common and consistent yardstick by which to observe and evaluate company practices. Such a system would be able to monitor the claims made by organizations about their policies and practices. <P>
I have suggested that the privacy standard might filter throughout the marketplace by a number of different inducements to registration: by moral suasion; by the desire to avoid adverse publicity; by the desire to gain a competitive advantage; by the reference to the standard in private contract; by the registration to the privacy standard in conjunction with registration to ISO-9000; by the reference to the standard when government "contracts out" data processing services; by pressure from research-funding agencies; by the regulation of interprovincial data flows in Quebec's Bill 68; and by the use of the "adequacy" provisions by European data protection authorities. Canadian and foreign regulatory bodies can insist that the receipt of personal data within Canada be accompanied by a registration to the <I>CSA Model Code. </I><P>
As outlined, the<I> </I>registration to the <I>CSA Model Code </I>would provide a better yardstick for the evaluation of personal information practices. It could promote higher levels of consumer awareness. It could raise the levels of responsibility and accountability within Canadian business. It can initiate more and better privacy auditing. But the process would still be incremental and piecemeal. It could never achieve the kind of uniform legal standard in Canada, the "seamless protection" that the Federal Privacy Commissioner has called for. <P>
<BR>
<B>III. <U>The Value-Added of Data Protection Law</B></U><P>
Leaving aside the peculiar constitutional dilemmas within Canada, what would a legal regime add to the standards-approach monitored through a registration regime administered through an accredited standards-registration body? Five arguments are persuasive.<P>
First, only law can express the <I>standards of the community</I>, the line beyond which no organization should be allowed to cross. This is what Bruce Phillips has in mind when he argues that "unless some sensible rules of traffic management are a part of these systems, the first roadkill will be our personal privacy and dignity." The metaphor of the "information highway" does lead naturally to the undeniable argument that there needs to be some consistent "rules of the road." For many businesses the rules of the road might be attractive to create a "level-playing field" &#173; a clear and consistent set of privacy rules that apply across the entire Canadian marketplace. <P>
Law does not <I>necessarily</I> provide that standard. "Far too frequently," Oscar Gandy reminds us, "we tend to talk about the law as the even-handed instrumentality that ensures that the universal values claimed for any society are protected and guaranteed." Any advocate for a legal regime must recognize the vast inequalities within the operation of the law, especially when it is used as a "strategic weapon" rather than as "an expression of a basic moral vision, a set of guiding principles that serve as foundations supporting relations among persons."<P>
Second, those "rules of the road" are more likely to be even-handedly applied under the guidance of an impartial "traffic cop." The <I>CSA Model Code </I>states that each organization shall designate an individual who is responsible for compliance, and that organizations shall make it clear how consumers might challenge compliance with the principles (Principles One and Ten). Under current circumstances, the highest mechanism for complaint resolution within most sectors is within the business that is processing the personal data. Only legislation can establish a final arbiter external to the organization. Only legislation can involve the institutions that to date have the best experience with resolving privacy complaints within Canada -- the offices of the federal and provincial Information and Privacy Commissioners. <P>
Third, only law can bring the recalcitrants into line. However successfully the <I>CSA Model Code </I>can regulate the practices of the most responsible businesses, there will always be a minority that will see a competitive advantage in processing personal data in contravention of the standard. Undoubtedly, the fear of the CDMA that the image of its responsible members is being tarnished by a minority of non-members motivated its call for national legislation based on the CSA standard. This move is fascinating. It indicates that at a certain point for some sectors, legislation becomes the acceptable alternative to continued bad publicity. <P>
Fourth, an economic argument can be advanced. As Ian Lawson has argued: "To the extent that business obtains and uses personal information without a market mechanism to govern the exchange, business is a classic free rider in the economy. It consumes a common property resource without covering the externalities related to its extraction and use." So when organizations benefit from the use of the information, either themselves or by trading that information to third parties, no benefits accrue to the original information provider. That situation has perpetuated because of the reluctance of many businesses to be transparent about their practices and to establish mechanisms to obtain informed consent when they wish to use personal information for "secondary uses." Business remains a "free rider" so long as individuals are kept in the dark about how their information is being used and disclosed. <P>
Classic economic theorizing would contend that an imperfect marketplace can be rectified by two mechanisms. First, one can give a value to personal information so that the costs and benefits of transactions are allocated more appropriately. There have been some proposals for market-based solutions to this imbalance; all rest on schemes to give individuals some property rights over their information with appropriate compensation when it is used for purposes other than those for which it was originally supplied. The other solution is regulatory intervention to redress the marketplace imbalance. It is contestable, of course, that economic theorizing has any role to play in the protection of a fundamental human right. Nevertheless, even according to the principles of neoclassical economic reasoning, the arguments for regulatory intervention are hard to resist. <I><P>
</I>Fifth, only the law can harmonize the standards of the public and the private sectors. Where the "public" sector ends and the "private" sector begins is increasingly difficult to determine. Questions raised about the application and meaning of the privacy provisions in the Federal <I>Privacy Act</I> and related provincial statutes will have an evolving impact on the practices of the private sector. It can also be expected that the increased publicity that privacy issues will receive in the media as a result of the efforts of the Privacy Commissioners will continue to have some spill-over effect. The need for "seamless protection" between the private and public sectors was one key factor behind the passage of the New Zealand <I>Privacy Act</I>. <P>
The distinction is also being eroded by efforts to privatize or hive-off government functions. Thus "private" organizations are increasingly performing "public" functions, and often require the use of "public" data to fulfill those obligations. Illustrations include: the use of smart cards and ATM machines for the dispensing of government benefits; the matching of data on welfare recipients with bank or financial records to ascertain eligibility; the trading of government personal information to enhance revenue; the use of credit reports for security checks, and so on. The pervasiveness and flexibility of the new technologies will make it increasingly difficult to determine which data are "in" the public sector, and which "in" the private. <BR>
<I><BR>
</I>Finally, and the least important reason, concerns the interpretation of Article 25 of the new European Directive on data protection:<P>
The Member States shall provide that the transfer to a third country of personal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing after transfer may take place only if, without prejudice to compliance with the national provisions adopted pursuant to the other provisions of this Directive, the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection.<P>
Notwithstanding the stipulation in Article 26 that "professional rules and security measures which are complied with" may be taken into account in determining the "adequacy of protection," Article 25 could mean that European regulators might legitimately interrupt flows of data to every part of Canada except Quebec, unless legal protections are forthcoming. An "adequate level of protection" could be interpreted to mean a legislated regime, overseen by an independent "supervisory authority." At the very least, it should be noted that any professional rules (such as codes of practice) have to be <I>complied with. </I>Any data protection system in Canada has to demonstrate that it is seriously and effectively implemented. <BR>
<B>IV. <U>Legislating to the Standard</B></U><P>
Unlike voluntary codes of practice, the CSA standard can be referenced in law. Around one-third of CSA's published standards have been referenced either in federal and/or provincial legislation. Most of these standards relate to the technical standards for products procured by government. Increasingly, however, performance standards, such as those for quality management or environmental protection, are being used in order to implement statute, regulation and court-order. There is nothing to stop federal and/or provincial authorities using Q830 in a similar way. <P>
The report of the Information Highway Advisory Council, however, envisages a more comprehensive approach -- a "flexible legislative framework for both public and private sectors. Legislation would require sectors or organizations to meet the standard of the CSA model code, while allowing the flexibility to determine how they will refine their own codes.<B>" </B>This seems to contemplate "framework" or "shell" legislation at the federal level; a statement of principles and obligations, leaving the functions of complaints resolution, investigation, auditing, and so on, as a matter for further analysis "in cooperation with the CSA Working Group on Privacy." But there have been a number of different interpretations of what IHAC means and of what it means to "legislate to the standard." <P>
The Canadian Direct Marketing Association, for example, called upon Minister Manley:<P>
to place before Parliament framework federal legislation that requires each industry sector to develop its own specific privacy code that meets a national standard. We do not think this legislation needs to be complex, nor would it be expensive to administer. We suggest a similar model to that of the Canada Health Act that sets minimum national standards but allows each province to develop and run its own health care system to meet its specific needs. <P>
The CDMA goes on to explain that "each code would reflect the needs of the individual sector and meet the standards set by the OECD and/or draft CSA codes." Moreover, the CDMA also has "concerns that regulatory authority could be used to make the principles more onerous. We think the concept of allowing industries to create standards that protect privacy and meet their particular needs will prevent undue regulatory interference." The CDMA would delegate a small complaints-resolution function to the Federal Privacy Commissioner.<P>
There is a key distinction between <I>voluntarism </I>and <I>self-regulation</I>. The former implies that public policy should remain indifferent to the policies and practices pursued. It implies that government should simply trust business to pursue privacy-friendly practices but has no interest in setting an overall standard. This has been the position of the Canadian and American federal governments to date. A <I>self-regulatory</I> regime, on the other hand, establishes in law the standard and grants business the authority to regulate its own practices. The key difference is that a legislated standard is set, and that both individual and organization knows that when self-regulation breaks down, the policy instruments established under the law can intervene. <P>
The Federal Privacy Commissioner has a slightly different vision, suggesting that the <I>CSA Model Code </I>could form an amendment to the <I>Privacy Act. </I>This option is attractive to the Privacy Commissioner as it would "embody in law a set of rules devised by a committee representing a broad cross-section of Canadian private enterprise." However, the Privacy Commissioner says nothing about "codes." For him the advantage of legislating to the standard is that "observance of the CSA standards would become a legal obligation and would be supported by a system of independent oversight."<P>
Ian Lawson also recognizes the "unique consensus that is emerging between government, consumers and industry players" and that is reflected in the <I>CSA Model Code. </I>For him, the "higher purpose of the <I>Model Code</I> is for it to be adopted-by-reference as a legislative standard to which the private sector must comply as a condition of using personal information on the information highway." <I><BR>
</I><BR>
Lawson outlines three possible options for federal regulation based on standards-enforcement. Under his "Light Version", framework legislation is enacted by the federal government with the operating provision that data users must comply with the <I>CSA Model Code </I>by developing an appropriate code that meets the industry standard. The model would rely entirely on the CSA as the monitoring instrument, and embodies no obvious role (beyond moral suasion) for the Privacy Commissioners. <P>
Under his "Medium Version", the Privacy Commissioners would be "mandated to receive complaints from consumers relating to the data user's compliance with its code." The Commissioners apply "existing problem-solving techniques, including education, persuasion, and mediation." This then adds a layer of oversight to the <I>CSA Model Code</I>, in addition to any code verification and registration process established through an accredited registrar. It perhaps adds a more coherent and focussed method of redress for the aggrieved individual, and locates overall oversight responsibility within the institutions that have sole responsibility for, and expertise in, the privacy issue. <P>
Under Lawson's "Heavy Version", the Privacy Commissioners would not only resolve complaints but would be "empowered to issue orders requiring data users to comply with their codes; disobedience of such orders is a criminal offence." The legislation would also establish civil liability for failure of a data user to comply with its code." Only under Lawson's "Heavy Version" would registration be underpinned by a set of legally enforceable rights, and be subjected to the general oversight of the Privacy Commissioners. Only under this version would a system of data protection be constructed that brings the full range of compliance mechanisms to bear on the problem.<P>
The remainder of this paper builds upon Lawson's analysis and addresses in more detail the oversight functions under a system in which the <I>CSA Model Code </I>is referenced in federal and/or provincial legislation. If the law says that any business operating in Canada must comply with the <I>CSA Model Code </I>as a condition for using personal information on the information highway, what further responsibilities and obligations need to be assigned? <P>
<BR>
<B>V. <U>The Oversight Functions</B></U><P>
A functional approach to policy analysis begins with a statement of the functions that might be performed within any public policy, and only then considers the public and private agencies that might perform them. The discussion at that workshop on March 25th was organized according to the following functions: the receipt, verification and approval of privacy codes; the receipt, investigation and resolution of complaints; enforcement powers; the auditing of organizations; advice on the privacy implications of new technology practices; education and research; and remedies and sanctions. This analysis is organized according to the same framework. <P>
<BR>
1) <U>The Receipt, Verification and Approval of Privacy Codes</U><P>
There are probably more instruments that can be called "privacy codes" in Canada than in any other society. I have concluded that "almost by default, Canada has become the only country in the advanced industrial world that has begun seriously the process of promoting privacy protection from the bottom up." Codes of practice are, and will continue to be, a feature of privacy protection policy in Canada. The question is, what role should they play under a legislated regime?<P>
Peter Hustinx, the President of the Netherlands <I>Registratiekamer </I>(the Dutch Data Protection Authority)<I>, </I>has concluded that codes of practice do offer some clear advantages even within a legislated data protection regime. The procedure of negotiating codes enhances the understanding of the privacy problem within different sectors. It also allows his office to gain a better appreciation of the relevant privacy issues and directly to influence the self-regulatory mechanisms. Codes are quite flexible instruments and once negotiated can be adapted to changing economic and technological developments. Codes also allow organizations to publicize their privacy policies and to remove suspicions about the improper collection, processing and dissemination of personal data. They allow an "enhanced measure of understanding on both sides." Similar advantages have been noted by Canadian analyses of the subject. <P>
Codes of practice have been developed for a number of different motivations. Peter Hustinx has noted four: to avoid legislation; to anticipate legislation; to implement legislation; and to supplement legislation. The development of a legislative system in Canada would signal a move from the first two incentives, to the second two. Codes of practice should offer detailed guidance to employees in an organization about how to implement the privacy principles contained within the law. Codes should clarify legal obligations without weakening or obscuring the legislative standard. To the extent that this can be achieved, they should continue to play an important role within a Canadian system of personal data protection.<P>
There is, however, a difficult problem concerning the relationship between privacy codes of practice and the privacy law. There are three subtly different models that have evolved in those countries that use or countenance privacy codes. <P>
The first, and in many ways most stringent, is represented by the system under the New Zealand <I>Privacy Act.</I> The system for negotiating and promulgating codes of practice is spelled out in greater detail in the New Zealand legislation than in any other law. The provisions have also been supplemented by a detailed guidance note from the Privacy Commissioner. Thus, where the <I>Privacy Act</I> specifies the functions of a code, and to whom (or what) a code may apply. The law allows, among other things, for standards that are less stringent than the information privacy principles, as well as for exemptions.<P>
The crucial aspect of the New Zealand approach is that codes of practice negotiated under the <I>Privacy Act</I> have the force of law. The statutory force of codes is expressed as follows:<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Where a code of practice is in force --<BR>
a) The doing of any action that would otherwise be a breach of an information privacy principle shall, for the purposes of Part VII of this Act, be deemed not to be a breach of that principle if the action is done in compliance with the code;<BR>
b) Failure to comply with the code, even though that failure is not otherwise a breach of any information privacy principle, shall, for the purposes of Part VII of this Act, be deemed to be a breach of an information privacy principle.<P>
Codes of practice in New Zealand therefore have "teeth." A breach of a ratified code of practice is as serious as a breach of the information privacy principles expressed in the law, which would then trigger the complaints and enforcement procedures in the legislation. Final remedies for such a breach can be obtained from the Complaints Review Tribunal.<P>
The Privacy Commissioner subsequently published a "Guidance Note" to explain his understanding of these provisions. He notes that a "code of practice is a legal document. It is enforceable through the Commissioner and the Complaints Review Tribunal (although not usually through) the ordinary courts." The codes might restate the principles and provide for "specific departures, procedures, standards or exceptions. Or a new set of rules can substitute for the principles. <I>Either way there must be a rule or standard against which a complaint can be measured.</I> <I>The purpose of a code of practice is to increase relevance, certainty, precision and clarity, not to substitute some other language which might create uncertainty."</I><P>
Thus far, only three codes have been issued. The first is a comprehensive code for the processing of health information, a fifty-page document that goes through each of the privacy principles and applies them (with commentary) to the health field. The second (produced relatively quickly at the instigation of the Privacy Commissioner) governs the operations of GCS Limited, the government-owned corporation that supplies computer processing services to major government departments. The third was developed in conjunction with the Association of Superannuation Funds. Each is affixed with the "Seal of the Privacy Commissioner" to signify that the code is consistent with the <I>Privacy Act</I>, and was developed in accordance with its procedures. This is the most formal endorsement process in existence in any country. The fact that only three codes have been issued, however, suggests that many associations have been reluctant to devote the necessary time and resources to code development. However, others are currently under development.<P>
The second, slightly more flexible regime, exists in the Netherlands. The Dutch system is similar in most respects to that in New Zealand. There is a lengthy and careful process of code negotiation. At the end of the day, however, the codes are not formally binding on the courts. Certainly if an organization can prove that it has met the requirements of its code, then it will have a strong case. Conversely, if a complainant can demonstrate that the provisions of the code have been breached, then this constitutes <I>prima facie</I> evidence of liability under the law. Codes then have indirect, rather than direct, legal effect. However, the <I>Registratiekamer </I>is still expected to give its approval to the code, a process that often has been difficult and contentious. Several key sectors have still to develop codes of practice under this system. Some codes (such as that in the Dutch banking sector) have been rejected. <P>
In Britain, thirdly, the Data Protection Registrar is empowered by the <I>Data Protection Act </I>to <I>"</I>encourage trade associations or other bodies representing data users to prepare, and to disseminate to their members, codes of practice for guidance in complying with the data protection principles." Privacy codes had been a feature of the British data protection landscape since the early 1970s. Codes under the 1984 legislation are not "statutory" in this sense, although they do play a significant role in the interpretation of the data protection principles and in the enforcement of the law. <P>
The first Data Protection Registrar, Eric Howe, was initially very enthusiastic about the importance of codes within the British data protection regime. In his very first annual report in 1985, he stated: "I have become increasingly convinced that codes of practice will be a valuable assistance to compliance with the data protection principles. Such codes should be positive and practical. They must support and propagate good practice and not simply consist of well intentioned but vague statements." In his Second Report the following year, he outlined a preliminary statement about how codes of practice ought to be developed: "To command respect Codes of Practice must not simply paraphrase the Act or be exhortative -- they must state clear practical actions which are to be followed." <P>
The purpose and operation of codes of practice in Britain is still somewhat unclear, however. The former Registrar was generally careful not to "endorse" codes, in the fear that their provisions might come into possible conflict with the legislation. He therefore tended to "welcome" them as offering helpful guidance to employees, thus reducing the need for regular intervention from the staff of the office. He also rejected the notion that detailed statutory codes should be prepared for each sector and that compliance with the codes would replace compliance with the law: "The great effort required to define sectors and develop precise codes in fine detail would, in my view, divert resources from encouraging compliance with the powerful and flexible principles." The negotiation of codes can be time-consuming, and possible conflicts can occur in interpretation with unforeseen consequences. This issue still requires discussion in Britain as a result of the provisions within Article 27 of the EU Directive.<P>
Codes of practice therefore have a role under a variety of regulatory conditions. They have also become increasingly popular; they are used most in those countries which have legislated in the 1980s rather than before. The complexities and diversification of personal data processing have produced observed needs for more specific guidance on how the vague and broad fair information principles can be translated into the day-to-day lives of complex organizations. <P>
A measure of the increasing interest in codes is the provision within the <I>EU Data Protection Directive</I>:<P>
1) The Member States and the Commission shall encourage the drawing up of codes of conduct intended to contribute to the proper implementation of the national provisions adopted by the Member States pursuant to this Directive, taking account of the specific features of the various sectors. <P>
2) Member states shall make provision for trade associations and other bodies representing other categories of controllers which have drawn up draft national codes or which have the intention of amending or extending existing national codes to be able to submit them to the opinion of the national authority. Member states shall make provision for this authority to ascertain, among other things, whether the drafts submitted to it are in accordance with the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. If it sees fit, the authority shall seek the views of data subjects or their representatives.<P>
This provision also needs to be read in conjunction with Recital 60: "Whereas Member States and the Commission, in their respective spheres of competence, must encourage the trade associations and other representative organizations concerned to draw up codes of conduct so as to facilitate the application of this Directive." It appears that codes of practice are no longer an optional instrument within European data protection systems.<P>
Codes of practice underpinned by a legislative framework obviously embody a greater compulsion that those currently in force in Canada. The role of the data protection agency is more central to code development and enforcement. Moreover, the process of code development can be more valuable than the result. Consultation over codes can ensure that organizations become more familiar with their own practices and more well-versed in their privacy obligations.<P>
On the other hand, there is a central dilemma with the use of codes of practice within systems that have a comprehensive data protection law. If they are not formally endorsed by a data protection authority, then they may contain language that conflicts with the wording of the law, and confusion about applicability and enforcement might ensue (as in Britain). If a more formal ratification process is laid out, then (as in New Zealand and the Netherlands) this can lead to the bureaucratization of a process that, in theory, is supposed to allow the flexibility of self-regulation. <P>
The advantages of codes of practice are mitigated by some other problems. Submission of codes in some sectors is often hindered by competition within sectors, and by unclear boundaries and overlaps that weaken the claim that the association submitting the code is sufficiently "representative." This has sometimes led to the submission of "codes" which merely recite the legislative provisions, to avoid the work necessary to adapt the law into a practical and detailed set of guidelines. Moreover, codes do not always help the data subject. The relationship between the code and the law is often unclear to someone seeking access and correction of personal data, for example. The data subject also rarely knows the difference between a code which has received the approval of the data protection agency, and one that has not.<P>
Finally, under any legislated regime, it is necessary to make a distinction between the Privacy Code, that is the formal expression of policy within business or industry, the set of operational guidelines that are communicated to employees to remind them of their obligations, and the briefer statements of policy designed to give assurances to consumers. To date there has been little consistency in the codification of privacy codes. If these instruments are to have any wider statutory or evidentiary value under a legislated regime, then it will be necessary to distinguish the Privacy Code (with a large 'C') from the other diverse material that is published by business on privacy. <P>
<BR>
2) <U>The Receipt, Investigation and Resolution of Complaints</U><P>
The Federal Privacy Commissioner's self-declared mission is first "to be an effective ombudsman's office, providing thorough and timely complaint investigation to ensure Canadians enjoy the rights set out in the <I>Privacy Act." </I>Even Commissioners' offices that are not formally established on the "ombudsman model" are expected to receive and investigate complaints from data subjects. All also act as clearinghouses for more routine inquiries about the respective legislation. <P>
Principle 10 (Challenging Compliance) of the <I>CSA Model Code </I>states that "an individual shall be able to address a challenge concerning compliance with the above principles to the designated individual or individuals accountable for the organization's compliance." One weakness of the <I>CSA Model Code </I>(as it stands) is that complaint resolution mechanisms are largely located within the organization or industry. There are some exceptions: for example, the CRTC accepts complaints about the personal-information handling practices of the telecommunications industry; the CDMA receives complaints about direct-marketing practices. Moreover, complaints also reportedly go to regulatory bodies that have no jurisdiction over privacy. Complaints also go to the institutions with responsibility for privacy, but which have no jurisdiction over the private sector. The current process for the receipt and resolution of privacy complaints is variable and confusing. <P>
The complaints resolution function is central to any effective oversight of personal data protection, but it can also be a time-consuming and a significant drain on resources. It is important not to exaggerate the importance of this function for the overall implementation of the privacy principles within the private sector. More pro-active techniques can be far more effective. The system for complaints-handling needs careful consideration and rationalization. Three questions require consideration: Who should be responsible for the <I>receipt </I>of complaints? Who should then <I>investigate</I> complaints and what further powers are necessary to fulfill that function? And what process of complaints <I>resolution </I>is appropriate at federal/provincial levels? <P>
(i) <U>The Receipt of Complaints</U><P>
Complaints under a legislated CSA standard would still continue to be resolved principally at the level of the organization concerned. The first principle of the <I>CSA Model Code</I> stipulates the designation of an individual or individuals who shall be responsible for compliance with the privacy principles. Under certain circumstances, trade associations (such as those within the cable or direct-marketing industries) may also play a mediation role. The more credible and effective the complaints resolution at lower levels, the less the need for a complicated regime at governmental levels. Given the fact that complaints resolution is potentially the most time-consuming and least attractive of all the oversight functions that need to be performed, it is appropriate that the Privacy Commissioners should be the avenue of <I>last</I> resort -- the means of redress when resolution within the business, the trade or professional association, or even within a federal or provincial regulatory authority fails. <P>
All Canadian legislation gives a complaints-handling role to their respective oversight offices (See Appendix One). This is emphasised more heavily in the Quebec and federal legislation than in that of BC, Alberta and Ontario. Each office has, therefore, developed expertise in this area and can handle complaints about the private sector more efficiently than any other federal or provincial agencies. <P>
The filtering of complaints about the private sector will obviously require careful coordination between existing commissioners. Problems of jurisdictional competence can arise when for example the federal Privacy Commissioner receives a complaint about a provincially regulated enterprise. Under these circumstances any federal legislation might have to delegate powers of complaints resolution to the provincial commissioners. A regime needs to be established whereby provincial and federal agencies can cooperate through administrative arrangements to handle complaints at the most appropriate level. <P>
(ii) <U>The Investigation of Complaints</U><P>
The more contentious issue is the investigation of complaints and what powers should be granted to allow this function to be performed. Again each provincial agency has powers of investigation vested in them. Normally these include the power to enter premises, to require records to be produced, and to summon the appearance of responsible persons (see Appendix One). These powers seem to be more extensive at the federal level than anywhere else. <P>
Under Bill 68 in Quebec, the Commissioner may authorize an entrusted agent to make inquiries on his behalf. Any authorized person may "enter at any reasonable time, the facilities of an enterprise carried on by a person collecting, holding, using or communicating personal information to third persons." This reflects the belief that, as in the public sector, the Commissioner does need powers of on-site inspection if he suspects non-compliance with the data protection principles. <P>
The larger question is whether or not the Commissioner be expressly empowered to conduct investigations in the absence of a complaint. Most offices in Canada also have the power to initiate an investigation on their own initiative. Such investigations may result from a pattern of complaints about a particular practice. Complaints tend to highlight concerns of a more general nature. Subsequent investigations would then take on the form of a more systemic "audits" of the personal information practices of an organization and would go beyond the particular grievance of the original complainant(s) (see below). <P>
(iii) <U>The Resolution of Complaints</U><P>
The resolution of complaints about privacy may take a number of different forms and may also culminate in binding enforcement order. Canadian privacy legislation already displays a variety of procedures for the resolution of complaints that range from along the continuum of possible policy instruments. <P>
The federal <I>Privacy Act</I> is based squarely on the ombudsman approach; complaints are received, investigated and findings and recommendations issued. Under certain circumstances, the Commissioner may apply for review by a Federal Court, if his recommendations are not acted upon. Most of this process, and indeed most complaints at the federal level, relate to the refusal to grant access to personal information. The Federal Commissioner therefore has to rely on conciliation and mediation with the ultimate hope that the willingness to avoid bad publicity will encourage a satisfactory settlement of the complaint. <P>
The emphasis on mediation to settle requests for access and correction of personal information is also apparent in the provincial legislation in BC, Ontario and Alberta. Mediation has become a standard operating procedure in the administration of these laws, before the Commissioner conducts an oral or written inquiry. Quebec's Bill 68 also places great emphasis on access to and rectification of personal information. Any person denied access, or who wishes to have personal information deleted from a file, may seek recourse through the <I>Commission d'acces a l'information</I>. A conciliation process may then follow (Sec. 48), after which the Commission renders a decision. <P>
Each of these processes for complaints resolution at federal and provincial levels is inherently reactive. It should be remembered, moreover, that these laws also enforce freedom of information obligations. The mediation and inquiry processes are written to deal principally with the refusal to grant access to information (personal or otherwise). These procedures may not translate neatly into a context of private sector compliance with the broader range of fair information practices represented within the CSA standard. <P>
Ultimate redress in Canada is normally vested in the courts. Each Canadian law outlines the circumstances under which disputes might be reviewed at the judicial level. Most circumstances for judicial review in the public sector relate to disputes over access requests. There may be an argument for a different review process within the context of private sector compliance.<P>
Some other countries have established small tribunals, <I>ad hoc </I>groups of experts that perform a quasi-judicial function. In Britain, for example, the <I>1984 Data Protection Act</I> establishes a <I>Data Protection Tribunal</I> to which individuals or data users may appeal a decision of the Registrar. This body is constituted from a panel of experts as is necessary. In New Zealand, an aggrieved individual may appeal a finding of the Privacy Commissioner to the Complaints Review Tribunal established under the <I>Human Rights Commission Act</I> of 1977. Thus Tribunals can serve as an avenue of appeal against enforcement decisions (as in the UK) and against the more advisory findings of an agency like the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner. In the Canadian federal context, appeal to a <I>Privacy Tribunal </I>may have a number of attractive advantages. First, the courts are not the ideal institutions to resolve comparatively specialised and technical issues. Moreover, a tribunal process could provide an important way to span the federal/provincial divide. <BR>
3) <U>Audit Powers<P>
</U>Privacy Commissioners may have suspicions about the personal-information practices of a particular organization that arise from a number of sources. The conduct of general audits of an organization or a technology can be a very effective way to implement fair information practices. Audits are more systemic. And they may be less confrontational than an investigation into the circumstances of a specific complaint. Only in the BC legislation, however, is the word "audit" mentioned, even though other offices have had audit programmes for some time. <P>
Audits may be internal or external to the organization. Under some circumstances, an external review of an internal audit might be an effective tool. Some Commissioners (such as the President of the Dutch <I>Registratiekamer) </I>have required audits to be performed by accredited auditors under certain circumstances. The existence of the standard can potentially provide an additional mechanism to extend the investigative process and relieve the offices of the privacy commissioners of some of this investigative responsibilities. If a credible registration process is established, by which businesses may be certified to Q830, the commissioners can simply require registration to the standard, and therein be assured that a verifiable and independent audit program is conducted (see below). <P>
<BR>
4) <U>Enforcement Powers</U><P>
At the end of the day, the central question arises as to what powers would be given to a Commissioner to order compliance with the privacy protection principles. This is the key distinction between the "medium" and "heavy" versions of standards-enforcement outlined by Lawson above. Here we see a sharp contrast between the federal and provincial approaches. As mentioned above, the federal Privacy Commissioner's powers are generally limited to those of investigation and recommendation. This approach is defended because it avoids the adversarial relationships that arise when enforcement powers are used or threatened. Besides, it is argued that bad publicity for privacy protection can be a more effective sanction against business than it is against government. <P>
In contrast, others contend that the ability to negotiate with data users is facilitated by the existence of an enforcement power at the end of the day, even if those powers are rarely used. Moreover, government and business organizations need certainty and consistency in the application of data protection rules. The provision of a formal order-making process assures a greater level of consistency, transparency and accountability over time in the implementation of the law.<P>
Most order-making power is related to the release of information in response to access requests. The debate over the appropriate range of powers is invariably conducted with the access and correction rights in mind. However, some provincial commissioners currently enjoy other power that might be more applicable to private sector oversight. The BC Commissioner, for instance, can (independently of the review process): "require a public body to stop collecting, using or disclosing personal information in contravention of this Act; and require the head of a public body to destroy personal information collected in contravention of this Act." The Ontario Commissioner can also "order an institution to, (i) cease a collection practice, and (ii) destroy personal information that contravene this Act." More generally, the Quebec <I>Commission d'Acces </I>"has all the powers necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction; it may make any order it considers appropriate to protect the rights of the parties on any issue of fact or law."<P>
Any federal legislation to the CSA standard would need to be drafted with careful consideration of such powers. "Cease and desist" powers found in many data protection laws that cover the private sector. But they are only used as a last resort and with regard to the most blatant contraventions of law. These powers are likely to be less enforceable in the private sector, although there may be an argument for their inclusion as a means to encourage mediated settlements under less adversarial conditions.<P>
<BR>
5) <U>Advice on the Privacy Implications of New Technologies</U> <P>
The foregoing functions are largely reactive. They are performed only after problems arise, complaints are lodged and investigations conducted. The implementation of data protection law is, however, as much an educational effort as a regulatory one. Much can be achieved in anticipation of policy and system development if privacy protection is built in at the outset, rather than "added on" afterwards. All Canadian legislation recognizes this fact, and grants responsibilities to the Commissioners to comment on the privacy implications of proposed legislation or on new automated personal record systems. <P>
The Federal Privacy Commissioner is currently empowered to "make a special report to Parliament referring to and commenting on any matter within the scope of the powers, duties and functions of the Commissioner." This function is performed in addition to the regular submission of the annual report. He, and to a lesser extent his provincial counterparts in Ontario and BC, have occasionally commented on privacy issues that fall outside their formal jurisdiction of the public sector. Privacy issues raised by the contracting-out of government services, for example, demonstrate the vague and shifting boundaries between public and private sectors. <P>
Moreover, the federal Privacy Commissioner already consults with private sector trade associations on their efforts at self-regulation. It would make sense to formalise this responsibility, granting the privacy commissioners the power to advise on the privacy implications of new information systems in both public and private sectors. The requirement of a <I>privacy impact statement </I>whenever a new technology (such as the Call Display) is introduced can go a long way to anticipate future problems and encourage a consideration of privacy and security issues at the outset. Linked with this, is the advice that may be given about the use of privacy-enhancing technologies. <P>
6) <U>Public Education and Research</U><P>
There is, of course, a fine line between the advisory responsibilities, that are generally conducted in confidence, and the performance of wider educational and research roles. The analysis of wider privacy and surveillance questions and the ongoing education of the general public can do much to anticipate problems and encourage citizens to protect their own privacy. <P>
The provincial Commissioners in B.C., Alberta and Ontario are given an explicit statutory obligation to information the public about their legislation. The federal Commissioner, however, has no mandate for public education and therefore no budget for such activities. Successive Commissioners have consistently pointed this out to successive governments without success. <P>
He can, however, carry out "special studies" "relating to the privacy of individuals" and has used this power to commission substantial research reports on issues such as drug testing, genetic testing and AIDS. Provincial commissioners may also "engage in or commission research." The Ontario office tends to produce shorter and more frequent research publications on new technologies such as smart cards, electronic mail systems and intelligent transport systems. In conjunction with the <I>Registratiekamer </I>in the Netherlands, the Ontario office has also published a study on privacy-enhancing technologies. Research reports are extremely useful techniques alerting public, government and business opinion to the privacy risks inherent in new technologies.<P>
This activity should continue with regard to private sector issues. To a certain extent, this is already occurring. It is important, however, for the education and research function to be explicitly mandated in legislation. These programs can be expensive and require appropriate funding.<P>
7) <U>Sanctions and Remedies</U><P>
Legal sanctions do not play a significant role in the implementation of public sector privacy law in Canada. Each statute does contain a list of various offences. In Ontario, this list includes the willful disclosure of personal information in contravention of the Act, the willful maintenance of a personal information bank that contravenes the Act, making an access request under false pretences, the willful obstruction of an order of the Commissioner, and willfully misleading the Commissioner. In BC and at the federal level, the list of offences is confined to the willful obstruction of the work or orders of the Commissioner. Under Quebec's Bill 68, penal provisions apply more broadly to the illegal collection, processing and communication of personal information. Those in contravention may be liable for a fine of between $1000 and $10,000 (and up to $20,000 for subsequent offences). <P>
Civil remedies are also little used. One perennial problem in this area of the law is that of proving that damages have occurred through the wrongful collection and processing of personal information. The fact that the provincial privacy torts have been rarely used is a testament to this. One of the advantages of a statutory framework may be to relieve business of its liability under the common law. It has been suggested that this trade-off may be used to convince industry to accept a more consistent, coherent and predictable policy environment. <P>
Nevertheless, there will always be the need for the inclusion of sanctions as a last resort. The CSA standard may indeed have an important role to play in this regard. If the legislation were to give the Commissioners (or indeed the courts) the power to order a registration to the standard, a potentially more effective means of enforcement can be constructed. The costs of registration are passed on to the data user. Moreover, the sanction becomes, not only a fine, but an obligation to change practices, be audited and meet the registration. This technique has been used to enforce environmental regulation, by obliging registration to ISO-14000. There is no reason why it cannot also profitably be used to enforce privacy standards. <P>
A process of registration to the standard adds a compliance instrument that is not present within any other data protection regime. The potential to require (by law or regulation) a registration to the standard can relieve privacy commissioners (and other regulators) of expensive and time-consuming compliance monitoring functions. Registration to the standard is also potentially a more effective sanction than a fine. The loss of the CSA "mark" can have real consequences for business. I quote Jason Meyers, chief economist at the Canadian Manufacturers Association: "The prospect of a $50,000 government fine for breaching the law pales in comparison to losing your entire customer base because the firm fails to meet its ISO-9000 requirements." <P>
<BR>
<B>VI. <U>Summary: The Elements of an Oversight System in Canada</B></U><P>
It is now necessary to summarise the analysis to reach some tentative conclusions about the possible elements of an oversight system for the protection of personal information within Canada's private sector: <P>
&#133; Provincial and federal governments need to apply the full range of available policy instruments to the privacy problem: Self-regulatory codes, legislation, privacy-protecting technologies, and better programs for consumer education. These are the policy instruments. They are not mutually exclusive. They all need to be utilized. <P>
&#133; The three years of bargaining over the CSA standard represents a crucial stage in the policy-making process. The brokering of a consensus has been completed. Any legislated scheme needs to be based on this established accommodation. <P>
&#133; A private sector privacy protection law does not need to be burdensome or overly complicated. Canada should avoid the costly and bureaucratic licensing and registration systems that have been established in some European societies. <P>
&#133; On the other hand, law without an effective mechanism for compliance monitoring can be worse than no law at all, and would not be considered "adequate" to meet European standards. <BR>
<B><BR>
&#133; </B>The central oversight agencies should be federal and provincial information and privacy commissioners (where they exist). These offices have established an independence, credibility and expertise. They are uniquely located within the regulatory landscape to oversee private sector legislation, and resolve issues that span the public/private divide. <B><P>
&#133; </B>Any legislated scheme needs to establish a balance of responsibilities for the following functions: complaints resolution and mediation; complaints investigation; audits; advice on the privacy implications of new technologies; the promotion of codes of practice; public education; and research. The most effective remedies may be those that are general in nature and pro-active rather than reactive. <B><P>
&#133; </B>Dispute resolution should be as non-litigious as possible, and should only be provided after all other avenues have been exhausted. Business will want quick and predictable resolution of privacy problems . There may be a persuasive case for a specialized federal/provincial Privacy Tribunal to resolve disputes<B> </B>over private sector issues.<B><P>
</B>&#133; Registration to the <I>CSA Model Code </I>contributes a crucial mechanism for enforcement within any potential regulatory system . Registration to the privacy standard can complement almost any current or future, contractual or regulatory, provincial or federal, sectoral or comprehensive, provisions for personal data protection. It can be used to reward good practice, and to bring the recalcitrants into line. <P>
&#133; Privacy codes will obviously continue to play an important role within any legislated regime. The standards-registration process can relieve regulatory bodies of checking and verifying privacy code content. A system that mandates all organizations to develop privacy codes would be unnecessarily burdensome and expensive. Consequently, codes should continue to be developed as a result of market demand and consumer pressure but, only in special circumstances, in response to regulatory fiat. <P>
&#133; Overseas experience suggests that codes of practice that enjoy any form of legal status (beyond the evidentiary value) are difficult and time-consuming to negotiate. Privacy codes should be encouraged and they should use the CSA standard as a template. But under a legislated regime, they should not be given an official "seal of approval", nor the power to qualify the provisions of the law. However, compliance with a code approved by CSA may be taken into account by Commissioners and courts in determining whether there has been a breach of the privacy principles. <P>
&#133; Experience suggests that sanctions in the form of fines are not a significant inducement toward compliance. Civil remedies are also ineffective because of the difficulty of proving actual damages from the willful mistreatment of personal data. <P>
&#133; In the context of private sector oversight, the threat of bad publicity can go a long way to securing compliance with the data protection principles. This incentive is probably a lot higher in the private, than in the public, sectors. The public reporting process is, therefore, crucial within any oversight model. <P>
&#133; It may be that the most effective sanction is a regulatory power to order registration to the standard. Thus if a pattern of complaints arose about a particular business, privacy commissioners or the courts could require registration to the standard, triggering the code development and audit process and passing the costs to the data user. <BR>
<B><U>Conclusion: Questions for Further Analysis</B></U> <P>
These conclusions are not inconsistent with other recent policy analysis about data protection. They are, however, tentative and incomplete. I conclude with an inventory of some of the complex regulatory questions that still require careful analysis and debate. <P>
<U>The consistency of the CSA <I>Model Code </I>with existing Canadian and international privacy provisions</U>?<P>
If the principles within the <I>CSA Model Code </I>are to be given the force of law, there clearly needs to be careful analysis of the relationship between the wording of these principles and that within existing privacy legislation, including: the federal <I>Privacy Act,</I> the provincial Information and Privacy Acts, Quebec's Bill 68. In addition, we need analysis of its consistency with other private sector privacy provisions including those within the 1993 <I>Telecommunications Act, </I>the 1991 <I>Bank Act, </I>and the provincial consumer credit legislation. We also require careful comparison of the <I>CSA Model Code </I>with the EU Data Protection Directive. <P>
<U>What is the future relationship between the Privacy Commissioners and other federal and provincial regulators?</U><P>
What should be the continuing role of federal regulators such as the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC ) and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI)? The former in particular has been active in regulating uses of new technologies within the telecommunications sector. There is an argument that this regulatory power should not be diluted. At the provincial level, what would be the future role of regulators for insurance and consumer credit? <P>
<U>Should the privacy commissioners be empowered to restrict flows of personal data to societies that do not have adequate data protection?</U> <P>
One concern of the European data protection authorities is that personal data can flow through societies with "adequate" protection, to those without. Ideally each national data protection law would contain a transborder data flow restriction similar to that within Articles 25 and 26 of the EU Directive. If so, how should this power be exercised in Canada, and by whom? At what point do the fleeting and rapid electronic impulses that characterize international data flows become a matter for Canadian regulation?<P>
<U>Will compliance monitoring under the CSA standard be consistent with existing auditing schemes under the public sector legislation?<P>
</U>The Quality Management Institute of CSA is currently deciding on the most appropriate registration scheme to Q830. If registration to the standard is to be employed as a compliance monitoring process, we need a consistent audit guide, an accreditation scheme for privacy auditors, an appropriate publicity mechanism, a method to monitor claims made about business policies and practices, and possibly an appropriate symbol or cachet for the "privacy-friendly" business. Privacy commissioners need to have confidence in the registration process if the <I>Model Code</I> is to be employed in the same way as other quality management standards.<P>
<U>Can regulatory power be given in statute to require a registration to a standard?<P>
</U>This is an interesting innovation and a potentially very effective means of compliance monitoring. But what are the precedents for this power in other fields, such as government procurement, equity policy, environmental policy and so on? If subsequent violations occur within a business that is registered to the standard, who shares the liability for any damages to the data subject? <P>
<U>What are the costs of an oversight regime, and by whom should they be borne? Are there opportunities for cost-recovery?</U><P>
Oversight that is coordinated among the existing commissioners, systemic rather than specific, anticipatory rather than reactive, and educational rather than regulatory, is also likely to be more cost-effective. The use of the standards-registration process can also relieve Commissioners and other regulators of much compliance work, and pass the costs onto the data user.<P>
<U>What process should be used for federal/provincial coordination?<P>
</U>The federal/provincial constitutional question underpins this entire analysis. Little is possible without a cooperative arrangement between the federal and provincial governments on the appropriate legislative process. Lawson outlined six models, in addition to the "paramount national standards model": mirror legislation; jurisdictional abstention; contract; conditional legislation; concurrent legislation; collaborative/complementary model. To the extent that that process can be agreed, the resolution of these oversight and enforcement issues will be facilitated.<BR>
<CENTER>____________________<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
In conclusion, it can be noted that not everything needs to be firmly concluded and nailed down. Legislation is a framework; it needs to be adaptable to changing circumstances. It also needs to be accessible and user-friendly. The more complicated the legislative provisions, the less likely will the law be used as an instrument by ordinary citizens. From this discussion, however, may be emerging a distinctively Canadian approach to personal data protection. This approach emphasizes the use of all instruments within the "toolkit" of privacy protection. It recognizes that voluntary action from the "bottom-up", is just as necessary as regulatory action from the "top-down." And it comprises an innovative combination of the traditional ombudsman approach with the use of the relatively new instruments from the world of standards-setting and certification. <P>

<H1>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H1>
<HR>
<H3><A HREF="report.html#A1">INTRODUCTION</A></H3>

       The seventy-six responses received cover a wide spectrum of interests and expertise. 
       In order to simplify comparisons between them, the responses have been broken
       down into eight categories.  These categories and the relevant number of responses
       in each are as follows: Medical and Social Research (21); Telecommunications and
       Technology (12); Individuals (11); Consumer and Privacy Advocates (11); Financial
       Services, Credit and Marketing Groups (5); Privacy Commissioners (4); Government
       (4); Miscellaneous (8).<P>

       Each of the submissions is summarized in regard to general comments on privacy,
       privacy concerns and various methods of ensuring privacy.  Specific proposals and
       recommendations, stemming from the four main potential approaches set out in the
       Discussion Paper, are included in each summary, where applicable.  These various
       elements are brought together and summarized in the review itself, which includes
       conclusions resulting therefrom.

<H3><A HREF="report.html#A5">WHAT IS PRIVACY?</A></H3>

       The definition of privacy set out in the Discussion Paper is generally accepted by the
       great majority of respondents.<P>

       One of the questions that frequently comes up is "Who owns personal information?". 
       The majority of consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners believe
       that personal information is owned by the individual.  However, most private sector
       organizations tend to see it as a commodity over which the consumer has varying
       degrees of control.<P>

       A number of respondents contend that the right to privacy should be incorporated in
       the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  However, recognizing the difficulty of amending
       the Charter, they are of the opinion that any amendment to the Privacy Act or any new
       federal privacy legislation should include a preamble that recognizes the principle of
       privacy.

<H3><A HREF="report.html#A9">WHAT ARE THE PRIVACY CONCERNS?</A></H3>

       The great majority of respondents, including those from the private sector,
       acknowledge that there is strong and growing public concern about privacy protection
       on the information highway.  This view is corroborated by a number of privacy surveys
       that have been conducted over the past few years.  The most quoted of these
       surveys are the Ekos survey of 1992, the Equifax survey of 1992 and the poll done by
       Gallup Canada in 1994.<P>

       There is considerable concern about freedom from intrusion.  Monitoring and
       surveillance are seen to be the most potentially damaging forms of intrusion.  Typical
       examples include, tracking the whereabouts of an individual by wireless or satellite-based
       personal communications systems, tracing the market profile of an individual
       from the "data shadow" cast by a series of transactions, and employee surveillance. 
       Surveillance of E-mail, including the related question of who owns the E-mail
       message, also is seen as a problem.  Monitoring of cellular phone messages by the
       use of scanners, as well as electronic surveillance in the home, also rate highly. 
       Nevertheless surveillance and monitoring are seen to have some benefits, particularly
       in the fields of search and rescue, home security and fleet management. It all
       depends on the uses to which they are put.  Lesser forms of intrusion are seen as
       being more of an annoyance, such as telemarketing which the individual can
       terminate at will. <P>

       The protection of personal information is the major concern of the public  This is
       expressed by the lack of control that an individual has over his/her personal
       information.  The use of personal information to create personal profiles of individuals,
       as well as a perceived lack of security and protection for personal information
       holdings, also are significant issues.  The unauthorized use of the Social Insurance
       Number (SIN), protection of medical and health information, and cross-border
       transfers of information are also of great concern to some respondents.  Equally,
       business is concerned that the social and economic benefits of the collection and use
       of personal information must be recognized.  Some journalists and writers fear that
       the freedom of expression provisions of the Charter could be subverted by
       unwarranted privacy rules.  Mention is also made of the strange ambivalence that
       occurs within the general public.  Very often members of the public believe that it is
       their right to know all the sordid details of the personal lives of celebrities but would
       be horrified if the same information was divulged about themselves.<P>

       The continuing and rapid evolution of technology raises a concern that privacy could
       become the victim of creeping erosion.  Security of stored data is also a significant
       concern.  Nonetheless, there is a growing acceptance of the use of technology,
       coupled with the benefits it can bring.  On the other hand, business is concerned that
       privacy requirements not be allowed to inhibit the introduction of new technologies.  A
       fair balance is required between the demands of technology development and privacy
       protection.<P>

       Some of the foregoing concerns can be attributed to a feeling of lack of knowledge
       and power on the part of individuals.  In particular, they often do not know just who
       holds information about themselves and they feel vulnerable in the light of well-publicized 
       privacy infractions.<P>

       Medical and social research, as it relates to the protection of personal information, is
       a significant issue.  By far the greatest number of responses come from medical and
       social researchers.  They are concerned that strict privacy rules could prohibit the
       long term storage of personal medical and health data and could mandate prior
       consent for the use of such data, in spite of the very high levels of security provided. 
       If this occurs, much valuable medical and social research, which is directed toward
       the public good, could be stifled.  Examples include, tracking the incidence of fatal
       diseases such as cancer and heart disease and undertaking studies as the basis for
       important government decisions in the social policy field.<P>

       In overall terms, there is a strong belief, expressed by many respondents from all
       sectors, that if the various concerns of the general public are not alleviated, the
       information highway will not be used to its full potential.

<H3><A HREF="report.html#A16">HOW TO ENSURE PRIVACY</A></H3>

       As a background to potential changes in privacy protection, some respondents
       provided details of the historical evolution of the development of privacy practices and
       legislation both in Canada and abroad.  It is noted that in Canada, only the federal
       government and five provinces have legislation to protect personal information held
       by governments.  Only Quebec has legislation governing the protection of personal
       information in the private sector.  At the federal level, some sector specific legislation,
       governing such areas as telecommunications and financial institutions, makes
       provisions for the implementation of regulations in regard to the management of
       personal information.  To date, however, regulations have only been implemented in
       the telecommunications sector.  The development of voluntary privacy codes in the
       private sector also is traced.  In the overall scheme of things, these scattered
       developments are seen as an unsatisfactory patchwork approach.  They are
       confusing and difficult to understand by the average individual and will not address
       emerging international standards, the dangers of rapidly evolving technologies, or the
       expectations of the public.<P>

       International developments are also reviewed.  Europe is seen to lead the world,
       particularly over the last 10 to 15 years.  Commencing in 1982, the Organization for
       Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published a set of privacy
       guidelines.  The guidelines contained comprehensive personal data protection
       principles, coupled with provisions for the restriction of transborder flows of personal
       data to countries which did not have equivalent protection standards.  Relatively all
       privacy legislation in Canada is based on the principles found in the OECD guidelines. 
       At the present time, the guidelines are being updated into  directives by the European
       Communities (EC) and compliance will be mandatory for all members, once they have
       been passed by the European Parliament.  The most important factor about the
       proposed directives, from Canada's viewpoint, is that they have the potential to inhibit
       trade by preventing the flow of personal information, whether in automated or manual
       form, to countries that do not have adequate data standards.  At the present time, it is
       doubtful that Canada would qualify because it does not have national standards
       governing the private sector.  Privacy developments in the USA also are summarized. 
       The USA does not have national standards applicable to the whole of the private
       sector, nor does it have legislation covering the public sector which meets all of the
       provisions of the federal Privacy Act.<P>

       The Discussion Paper's call for input on principles that should form the basis of
       effective privacy protection met with a wide range of responses.  Most of this input
       was based on the OECD guidelines.  Basic to the arguments of some consumer and
       privacy advocates and privacy commissioners is the premise that the right to privacy
       is a basic human right.  Stemming from this, is the view that the right to control one's
       personal information is the most important factor, coupled with the principle of
       consent.  However, some variations of viewpoint exist in regard to the question of
       consent.  Many consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners see
       consent as meaning "informed consent".  However, in the private sector consent
       tends to be seen as "consent", no matter how obtained.  Moreover, consumer and
       privacy advocates and privacy commissioners tended to see consent as "opting-in",
       whereas the private sector sees it as "opting-out". One of the additional principles
       raised, beyond those contained in the OECD guidelines, is the principle that
       individuals should not have to pay to maintain basic and existing levels of privacy. 
       Again, there are differences of viewpoint on this issue.  Some respondents believe
       that levels of privacy above the basic level should be paid for, while others maintain
       that privacy should not be prejudiced by inability to pay. Another principle entails
       freedom of individuals to choose whether or not to connect to the information
       infrastructure, to accept or reject services that may affect their level of privacy, and to
       be free to sub scribe to, and be charged for, only those services they wish to receive. 
       However, they should not suffer reduced levels of service because of their choice.
       Nevertheless, in overall terms, there is little difference in views.  Most respondents
       support the principles contained in the Canadian Standards Association's (CSA) draft
       "Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information".  Other submissions propose
       principles that should govern the information highway itself.<P>

       An emerging problem is seen in the blurring of distinction between information which
       is resident in the public sector and that which is resident in the private sector.  In
       Europe, this distinction between the public and private sectors, in terms of privacy
       protection, has been rendered irrelevant by the proposed EC directives.  Within the
       private sector, a further blurring is evident.  With the increasing integration of various
       media on the information highway, the original distinction between the various
       players, e.g., telephone and cable companies, the press, broadcasters, and
       marketers, it is becoming increasingly difficult to establish clear boundaries between
       sectors.  Accordingly, the effective establishment of sectoral voluntary codes could
       become more problematic.<P>

       The patchwork system of federal/provincial legislation and private sector voluntary
       codes across Canada is stimulating the call for a "level playing field".  Different
       legislation in different jurisdictions results in "rich and poor" in terms of privacy
       protection.  Some provinces have no legislation at all, while Quebec has legislation
       covering both the public and private sectors.  This could lead to the establishment of
       "data havens" where companies can locate to avoid privacy protection requirements,
       thus leading to unfair competition.  Therefore, all players are interested in the
       establishment of a national privacy standard.  However, how this is to be done results
       in different opinions.<P>

       The main focus of the Discussion Paper centered around approaches to be used in
       promoting privacy protection in the private sector.  Four potential approaches were
       identified, legislation and regulation, voluntary codes and standards, technological
       solutions, and education.  While there is very little difference in views on the roles to
       played by the two latter approaches, there is considerable debate on the relative
       merits of legislation and voluntary codes.<P>

       The majority of respondents believe that the government needs to take stronger
       action and establish new legislation.  With only two private sector respondents being
       in favour of legislation, the majority of support for this approach comes from
       consumer and privacy advocates, privacy commissioners and individuals.  The
       benefits of legislation and regulation are seen as guaranteeing to all Canadians an
       equal level of privacy protection and providing a legal means of redress, sanctions,
       complaint and appeal.  In addition, such a regime would meet the standards of the
       EC, thus avoiding potential trade problems.  Many suggestions are made as to how
       this may be accomplished.  The preferred method is for legislation to establish a
       framework for a set of national privacy standards under which private sector codes
       would operate and be bound.  This could be complemented by an independent and
       impartial administrative body which would enforce compliance, hear complaints,
       provide redress and deliver sanctions.  Suggestions are made that such a system
       could be based on the Quebec Act.  Moreover, lack of bureaucracy, low costs and
       cost effectiveness are seen as prerequisites.   A phase-in period is recommended,
       together with early consultations with the provinces to harmonize both public and
       private sector legislation across the country.  Other suggestions include amending
       and updating the federal Privacy Act to bring it into line with the proposed legislation
       and for the public sector to "clean up its own shop".  In effect, it is contended that the
       federal government must assume a strong leadership role.  Meanwhile, opponents of
       the legislative route point its problems.  It is seen as inflexible, incapable of rapid
       change to accommodate the rapidly evolving technology and marketplace, and
       possibly inhibiting new initiatives and investment.  The time taken to reach a
       federal/provincial consensus is seen as a problem, as is the fact that it would go
       against the current trend of deregulation in the global marketplace.  Moreover, it
       would cost more in a period of fiscal restraint.  The private sector is generally against
       legislation.  The telecommunications industry, in particular, is against additional
       legislation for the protection of personal information because it believes that privacy
       directives issued by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications
       Commission (CRTC) are sufficient to meet privacy concerns.  On the other hand, it is
       strongly in favour of technology-specific legislation that would make it an offence to
       intercept radio-based telecommunications and which would generally prohibit the
       manufacture, importation, sale and distribution of scanners capable of monitoring
       radio-based telephones, including cellular phones.  Nevertheless, the private sector is
       not universally against general privacy legislation, provided that it is implemented only
       after voluntary codes have been given a chance to prove themselves and have been
       shown not to work.  Additional provincial legislation, in the absence of federal
       legislation, is not seen as viable because it would not lead to uniform standards
       across Canada.<P>

       Voluntary codes and standards are mostly favoured by the private sector because of
       their flexibility and adaptability in meeting the particular needs of different
       technologies and segments of the marketplace.  They are also seen as less costly to
       operate, can raise the profile of privacy within an organization, and can help to
       educate consumers.  Moreover, they can be national in scope and provide a level
       playing field within each sector.  In addition, they are capable of being made
       mandatory across all members of a sectoral organization or can be strengthened by
       peer pressure, compelling competitive interests and consumer demand.  The main
       objection to voluntary codes and standards is that they are just that, "voluntary". 
       Many are not seen as fully responsive to consumer concerns, in that they do not meet
       the full range of fair information practices and do not have adequate mechanisms for
       complaint and redress.  Also, they are sometimes tailored more to business interests
       than to consumers' privacy rights. Moreover, they may not meet the "adequate"
       standards of privacy protection required by the proposed EC directives.  This being
       said, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners are not completely
       against voluntary codes.  They are considered to have an important role to play,
       because of their flexibility and adaptability,  provided they are governed by
       overarching legislation.  In this regard, both the private sector and the consumer and
       privacy advocacy and privacy commissioner groups strongly support the recent
       initiatives of the CSA to develop a voluntary privacy code as a national standard.  The
       CSA  draft code is being developed by a working committee comprised of
       representatives of governments, privacy commissioners, consumer and privacy
       advocates and the private sector.  The code, when implemented, could provide a
       standard against which private sector voluntary codes could be measured and may
       meet the adequacy provisions of the EC privacy directives.<P>

       Technological solutions are also seen as having a part to play.  Technology can
       threaten privacy but new developments can now allow privacy protection features to
       be built in at the outset.  In this regard, a number of respondents see the need for
       privacy impact assessments to be made an essential part of the systems
       development process.  Whether the information highway should be designed to
       provide high levels of privacy protection and whether it will slow the pace and raise
       the cost of innovation is also addressed by many respondents.  Built in security
       measures are seen as a key in this regard.  New innovations in this area include
       advanced encryption, the use of smart cards and the implementation of digital
       technology.  Basic protective measures are seen as essential, coupled with additional
       measures which could be provided at extra cost.  Furthermore, it is suggested that
       the government encourage the development of new protective technologies and
       provide support for research and development in order to provide new opportunities
       for Canadian industry.  In general, privacy protection measures are not seen as
       increasing the cost of innovation,  provided they are not too excessive.  There is a
       wide variety views on how Canadians can become better involved in the design of
       potentially privacy-threatening technologies.  Avenues already exist, such as
       involvement in CRTC hearings and participation in the development of new CSA
       technical standards.  However, many in all sectors see the need for more direct
       involvement at the design stage, provided that it is limited to informal consultations
       and the provision of advice by such groups as consumer advocates and privacy
       commissioners.<P>

       Lack of awareness and confusion on the part of the public are seen as significant
       problems.  Therefore, there is wide agreement that consumer education is essential. 
       Education of employees and businesses on their privacy responsibilities also is seen
       as necessary.  There is a general consensus that both governments and business
       have a major responsibility in this area.  Most businesses indicate commitment and
       many are already engaged in education programs.  As well, consumer and privacy
       advocates and privacy commissioners indicate willingness to become involved,
       provided that funding and resources are made available.  However, it is also
       recognized that consumers themselves have responsibilities and must also take
       initiatives in this area.  The educational  tools available are seen to be many and
       varied.  These range across the publicizing of private sector privacy codes and the
       CSA code, periodic public awareness campaigns, production of material and
       brochures aimed at different elements of the public for distribution in information
       centres and libraries, etc.

<H3><A HREF="report.html#A26">CONCLUSIONS</A></H3>

       There is a wide range of real public concerns on privacy matters which, if not
       addressed quickly, could escalate to the point that the effective functioning of the
       information highway could be jeopardized.<P>

       There is a significant divergence of views between the majority of members of the
       private sector and consumer and privacy advocacy and privacy commissioner groups
       on the relative merits of legislation and voluntary codes.  However, there also is a
       pragmatic and conciliatory approach to these differences which makes a compromise
       achievable.<P>

       No single approach to the resolution of the problems is viable.  Therefore, a
       combination of the approaches outlined in the Discussion Paper is most likely to
       succeed because they are inter-related and mutually supportive.<P>

       In order to achieve comprehensive solutions to the various problems identified by
       respondents, within the minimum possible time frame, a well-coordinated plan should
       be developed.<P>

       The following are potential elements of a plan which the Advisory Council may wish to
       consider.<P>

<UL>
<LI>The establishment by legislation of a national framework of privacy standards,
          probably based on the CSA model privacy code, under which private sector codes
          would operate and be bound.<P>
<LI>Revisions to the federal Privacy Act to overcome its current shortcomings,
          including a revised preamble, provision for the protection and security of personal
          information, and provision for the establishment of privacy impact assessments
          within the public sector.<P>
<LI>Development of a program to reinforce, strengthen and update the application of
          privacy protection practices within the public sector.<P>
<LI> Early discussion with the provinces to implement national standards on a country-wide basis.<P>
<LI>Development of legislation to make it an offence to intercept private radio-based
          telecommunications, and to generally prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale
          and distribution of scanners capable of monitoring radio-based telephones,
          including cellular phones.<P>
<LI> Development of a program to systematically promote the development of private
          sector codes based on the CSA model privacy code.<P>
<LI> Creation of a joint government/industry program to promote and support the
          development of privacy protection technologies.<P>
<LI> Promotion of consultations between industry/government, consumer groups and
          privacy commissioners on the development of significant and new potentially
          privacy-threatening technologies and systems.<P>
<LI>Development of a joint industry/government privacy education program in
          consultation with consumer groups and privacy commissioners.<P>
<LI>Establishment of consultations between government and the medical and social
          research groups to resolve the apparent dichotomy between the protection of
          personal information and the need to carry out medical and social research
          necessary to promote the public good.<P>
<LI>Development by the government of a standard privacy protection clause for all
          contracts or agreements involving the transfer or exchange of personal
          information with all institutions outside of government.<P>
<LI> Issuance of a public announcement after adoption of the plan and ministerial approval.<P>
</UL>

       Failure to address the major problems identified by respondents could be followed by
       increasing public privacy concerns, coupled with avoidance of use of the information
       highway.  Also, it might lead to Canada's privacy protection standards being
       considered inadequate under the EC privacy directives.

<H3><A NAME="A2">Origin of the Discussion Paper</A></H3>

       In October 1994, Industry Canada, in cooperation with the Information Highway
       Advisory Council, issued the discussion paper "Privacy and the Canadian Information
       Highway".  The paper was the first of several discussion documents to be released by
       Industry Canada on social, economic and technology policy issues.  Its purpose was
       to seek the public's views and to raise the level of debate on privacy issues related to
       the development and operation of the information highway. Written submissions
       and/or comments were invited on its contents, including the various options and
       approaches set out in the paper.  Submissions were to be received by December 23,
       1993.  Copies of the individual submissions are available for viewing, for a period of
       one year, at the Industry Canada Library, 2nd Floor, Journal Tower South, 365 Laurier
       Avenue West, Ottawa, Ontario, and at the regional offices of Industry Canada in
       Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver.

<H3><A NAME="A3">Responses Received</A></H3>

       The seventy-six responses received cover a wide spectrum of interests and expertise,
       and range in size from one page to sixty pages.  In order to simplify comparisons
       between them, the responses have been broken down into eight categories to reflect
       the main affiliation of the respondents.  These categories and the relevant number of
       responses in each are as follows: Medical and Social Research (21);
       Telecommunications and Technology(12); Individuals (11); Privacy and Consumer
       Advocates (11); Financial Services, Credit and Marketing Groups (5); Privacy
       Commissioners (4); Government (4); Miscellaneous (8).  The Miscellaneous category
       is comprised of a  labour organization, a standards organization, a
       telecommunications security company, a journalist, a writer/TV producer, an expert on
       learning and training, and two international respondents.  Summaries of the actual
       submissions, by category, are contained in Appendix A.

<H3><A NAME="A4">Basis of Review</A></H3>

       Each of the submissions is summarized in regard to general comments on privacy,
       privacy concerns and various methods of ensuring privacy.  Specific proposals and
       recommendations, stemming from the four main potential approaches set out in the
       Discussion Paper, are included in each summary, where applicable.  These various
       elements are brought together and summarized in the review itself, which includes
       conclusions resulting therefrom.

<H3><A NAME="A5">WHAT IS PRIVACY?</A></H3><HR>

<H3><A NAME="A6">Definition</A></H3>

<DL>
<DT>The right to privacy is defined in the Discussion Paper as comprising two elements:<P>
<DD>   the right to be left alone, free from intrusion and interruption; and,<P>
<DD>   the right to exercise control over one's personal information.
</DL><P>

       Both explicitly and by reference to examples, this definition is accepted by most
       respondents.  However in two cases, amendments to the definition are proposed.<P>

       In the first case, use of the word "interruption" is questioned by one of the technology
       associations as adding nothing to the concept of privacy because its use suggests
       that all interruptions - whether welcomed or not - are invasions of one's privacy. 
       Therefore, it submits that the concept of "uninvited" is the key to any notion of privacy
       intrusion in today's society.<P>

       The second comment comes from one of the consumer and privacy advocates.  In its
       view, the concept of privacy should be expanded to include the concept of
       "reputation" (as recognized by the Quebec Charter), in as much as personal
       information can shape what one thinks of someone.  Furthermore, it should also be
       expanded to include the concept of "dignity" (also recognized by the Quebec Charter),
       as it relates to one's "informational identity".

<H3><A NAME="A7">Who owns personal information?</A></H3>

       The question of who owns personal information is seen as elemental to privacy rights
       by some privacy and consumer advocates as well as by the Privacy Commissioner. 
       Their belief that personal information is owned by the individual is perceived as a
       fundamental premise underlying control over its collection, use, disclosure, retention
       and disposal.<P>

       Contrary to this view, most of the private sector organizations seem to be more of the
       view that personal information is a commodity over which the consumer should be
       able to effect varying degrees of control.  However, one technology association likens
       discussion about the ownership of transactional information as being similar to
       discussion about intellectual property.

<H3><A NAME="A8">Privacy - A Charter Right?</A></H3>

       A number of respondents, particularly privacy and consumer advocates, believe that
       the right to privacy should be incorporated in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
       The basis for this view is that privacy is a fundamental human right that must be
       recognized.<P>

       However, recognizing the difficulty of amending the Charter, an alternative proposal is
       that any amendment to the Privacy Act or any new federal privacy legislation should
       include a preamble that recognizes the principle of privacy.  This would be
       commensurate with a similar provision in the proposed privacy legislation of the European
       Communities.

<H3><A NAME="A9">WHAT ARE THE PRIVACY CONCERNS?</A></H3>

<H3><A NAME="A10">Are there real privacy concerns?</A></H3>

       Confirming the generally accepted view, the vast majority of responses specifically
       point to a large and growing consumer concern over privacy matters, particularly in
       regard to the information highway.  There is little difference in views in this regard,
       whether they come from the private business sector, consumer and privacy
       advocates, privacy commissioners or individuals at large.  These concerns are shown
       to be evidenced by privacy surveys over the last few years and a number of these
       surveys are specifically quoted.<P>

       The Ekos survey "Privacy Revealed - the Canadian Privacy Survey" was conducted
       on behalf of a number of private and public sector organizations in 1992 and is the
       most oft quoted in the responses.  It showed that while 52 percent of Canadians are
       extremely concerned about privacy, 92 percent expressed at least moderate concern. 
       Moreover, 83 percent strongly believe that they should be asked for their permission
       before an organization can pass on information about them to another organization,
       and 71 percent totally agree that privacy rules should apply to both government and
       business.  Also, "there is a pervasive sense that  personal privacy is under siege from
       a range of technological, commercial and social threats".  Furthermore, greater
       concern was expressed about business sector organizations than about public sector
       organizations.  However, as pointed out by some business sector members, the
       survey also revealed that privacy is of more concern in the abstract.  Thus, while
       Canadians are concerned about controlling their personal information, they are more
       accepting of its use in specific situations where the purposes and benefits are clearly
       identified.<P>

       The 1992 "Equifax Canada Report on Consumers and Privacy in the Information Age" 
       also found that a strong majority of consumers are worried about threats to their
       privacy.  However, an equally strong majority agree that computers give people more
       convenient access to useful information and services and have improved the quality
       of life.  Moreover, the same majorities responded positively to the use of personal
       information in setting automobile rates, in approving loans, and in issuing a credit
       card or establishing credit limits.  The report concluded that 62 percent of "Canadians
       take a pragmatic approach to balancing privacy interests and access to valued
       consumer benefits, deciding area by area what kind of fair information practices, rules
       and protection are called for, and who should apply them".<P>

       In 1994, a poll done by Gallup Canada for Andersen Consulting on "What Canadians
       Think About the Information Highway" indicated that, while 67 percent of Canadians
       thought that the information highway was a good idea, 83 percent were very or
       somewhat concerned about how the highway might affect their privacy.  However,
       contrary to the views expressed in this survey, a 1993 Decima Research survey found
       that 70 percent of respondents thought that society is relying too much on technology
       and 61 percent thought that technology makes things more complicated instead of
       simpler.  In the 1994 TELUS Longwoods survey 39 percent of respondents felt that
       they would be so concerned about privacy invasions that they probably would not use
       the information highway.<P>

       These findings are reinforced and renewed by the fact that almost all of the
       comments received from individuals related to concerns about the protection of
       personal information and freedom from intrusion.<P>

       The extent of concerns is very broad, ranging across freedom from intrusion,
       protection of personal information, lack of knowledge and power, and technology.

<H3><A NAME="A11">Concerns re Freedom from Intrusion</A></H3>

       These concerns are related to the right to be left alone.  Although the Discussion
       Paper lays great emphasis on a discussion of the four approaches which might
       alleviate privacy concerns related to the protection of personal information,
       considerable concern is also expressed by respondents on the issue of uninvited
       intrusion.  These concerns are equally expressed by both the business sector and the
       consumer sector, and may be divided into two broad areas.  The first area involves
       monitoring and surveillance and the second involves unwanted or annoying intrusions
       into a person's time.<P>

       Monitoring and surveillance is seen to be by far the most annoying and potentially
       damaging intrusion and many examples are given.  A typical example is the
       "electronic leash" created by the enhanced tracking capabilities inherent in wireless or
       satellite-based personal communications systems whereby, in the absence of
       effective controls, the actual location and movements of an individual can be tracked
       in an unauthorized manner.  Also, the "data shadow" cast by an individual in a series
       of transactions on the information highway, can be assembled into a pattern which
       will allow a profile to be developed of an individual's lifestyle, personal habits, and
       buying power and preferences.  Employee monitoring, whether by video surveillance
       or electronic productivity monitoring, is also seen as a significant issue. Surveillance
       of E-mail, whether by employers or outside sources, is both a concern and, in regard
       to employer monitoring, has caused an active debate as to whether the employer has
       the right to monitor personal messages sent by E-mail.  A most vociferous concern re
       surveillance and monitoring relates to the use of scanners to intercept cellular or other
       radio-based private communications.  This concern is expressed both by the
       consumer sector and the telecommunications sector, as is the recent issue over call
       blocking of name display telephone services.  Finally, surveillance at home is also
       seen as a potential problem in the light of proposed systems which will allow the
       provision of security services by electronic means, electronic monitoring of
       consumption and service by utility companies, and interactive multimedia services on
       TV and home computer systems.  Nevertheless, surveillance and monitoring are not
       seen as totally negative.  Their significant benefits are recognized in the fields of
       home security, search and rescue, commercial fleet management, etc.  It is all a
       question of the uses to which monitoring and surveillance are put.<P>

       Unwanted or uninvited intrusions into a person's time are also seen as a concern but,
       as evidenced by responses to polls and from respondents, not to the same degree as
       monitoring and surveillance.  While the former is seen as an annoyance, the latter is
       seen as potentiality threatening. However, telemarketing is deemed to be more of an
       intrusion than ad-mail, although the recent CRTC decision banning the use of
       automatic dialing-announcing devices (ADADs) for commercial solicitation and
       restricting the hours during which "live" telemarketing can occur should do much to
       alleviate the problem.  In any event, the consumer usually has the ability to terminate
       the intrusion at will.

<A NAME="A12">Concerns re Protection of Personal Information</A>

       A perceived inability to control access to and the use by others of an individual's
       personal information is seen as the major privacy concern.  Allied to this is the
       unauthorized marketing of personal information.  These concerns are equally
       recognized by business organizations, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy
       commissioners.  It is also the concern most frequently expressed  by individuals.<P>

       The unauthorized use of transactional data and the compilation of personal profiles by
       the matching and linking of personal information are significant issues.  Whether they
       take place as a result of involvement in credit card, direct marketing or banking
       transactions, etc., or as a result of obtaining medical services, all are seen as being
       major areas of concern.<P>

       Lack of adequate security and protective measures is also worrisome.  This can be
       due to lack of knowledge or laxity on the part of employees of the organization holding
       the personal information or to lack of built-in or established security/protective
       measures.<P>

       A number of specific issues related to particular types of personal information are also
       evident.  Of these, use of the Social Insurance Number (SIN) and the protection of
       medical and health information are the most important.  Lack of control on the use of
       the SIN by both the private sector and by those elements of the public sector which
       do not have specific authorization for its use are seen as a concern in a number of
       responses from individuals.  Also, the protection of medical and health information
       related to individuals is seen as particularly sensitive.  Concerns in this latter regard
       come not only from individuals, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy
       commissioners but also from the private sector and the medical research community. <P>

       Another area of general concern is the issue of cross-border transfers of personal
       information.  Here, the worry is that personal information will no longer be subject to
       national or provincial jurisdiction and therefore may not be capable of being protected.<P>

       Seemingly contrary to these concerns, is the concern that the business, economic
       and social benefits of the collection and use of personal information must be
       recognized.  Business benefits are expressed in terms of the extension of markets
       and the ability to provide new and better services.  Economic benefits are seen as the
       ability to provide additional employment in such areas as the direct marketing
       industry, while social benefits are seen to include law enforcement, medical and
       social research as well as the ability to implement consumers transactions in a more
       effective, efficient and less costly manner.  Not only is this concern expressed by the
       business community and medical and social researchers, but the benefits also are
       recognized by consumer and privacy advocates as well as privacy commissioners. <P>

       Two journalist/writers express fears that privacy initiatives could restrict access to
       large numbers of records, even though anonymized.  This could prejudice the
       freedom of expression provisions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Some
       private sector organizations are concerned that network providers may be seen as the
       information highway's privacy police.  In this regard, a number of respondents agree
       that this would be an impossible task and that privacy measures should focus on the
       information providers who interact on the highway.  Also, there is concern that it
       should be recognized that consumers also have a responsibility in the protection of
       their own privacy.<P>

       On the matter of privacy in general, a few respondents have noted the strange
       ambivalence that occurs within the general public.  While supporting the need for the
       adoption of strong privacy principles, particularly when they themselves are directly
       affected, many are not so concerned when their fellow citizens are affected. This is
       expressed in the call for information about the whereabouts of convicted criminals
       who have served their sentences, e.g. rapists and child molesters, the hunger for
       details of the personal lives of public figures as published in the tabloids, and the
       support for using new technologies to root out fraud and abuse, eliminate waste and
       duplication, and streamline inefficient bureaucratic procedures.

<H3><A NAME="A13">Concerns re Technology</A></H3>

       The continuing and rapid evolution of technology, coupled with the benefits it can
       bring, raise a concern that privacy could become the victim of creeping erosion.  It is
       not so much the actual applications of technology that cause the greatest concern but
       the fact that privacy may be left behind or overlooked in the "onslaught of technology". 
       Coupled with this, is the equal concern that privacy safeguards are too often not
       "built-in" to the development of technology but are "bolted-on" as a  later and perhaps
       ineffective appendage.<P>

       In spite of these concerns, it is acknowledged that there is a growing public
       acceptance of the use of technology.  This is illustrated by the use of automated
       banking machines (ABMs), the Interac direct payment service, personal computers,
       modems, the Internet, electronic tax filing, etc.<P>

       However, a contrary concern, particularly on the side of the business sector, is that
       privacy concerns or requirements may inhibit the development of new and innovative
       technologies.  Therefore, they see a fair balance as being required between the
       demands of technology development and privacy protection requirements.

<H3><A NAME="A14">Concerns Based on Lack of Knowledge and Power</A></H3>

       Some of the foregoing concerns can be partially attributed to a perceived lack of
       knowledge and power on the part of consumers.  Individuals become frustrated
       because they are not aware of exactly what technology can do and therefore may
       have little understanding of the privacy implications that may be involved.  Equally,
       they feel powerless in many circumstances, particularly because they do not see any
       effective means of redress for privacy related complaints against the private sector.<P>

       Specific concerns in this area relate to the fact that very often individuals have
       absolutely no knowledge of just who might hold information about them.  Moreover,
       they feel vulnerable because of the well publicized cases where privacy infractions or
       problems have not come to light until well after the fact.

<H3><A NAME="A15">Medical and Social Research</A></H3>

       By far the greatest volume of responses to the Discussion Paper came from the
       medical and social research community.  While fully endorsing the need for protection
       of personal information, almost unanimous concern is expressed about the potentially
       negative effect of proposed protection measures on medical and social research.<P>

       The types of research involved include studies on the continuity and effectiveness of
       health services, the use of multiple prescription drugs by the elderly, the incidence of
       serious and fatal diseases such as cancer and heart disease, the outcomes of
       therapeutic procedures and drugs, environmental effects on health, how families and
       individuals respond to the changing social and economic environment, etc.  This
       research has important public benefits related to the improvement of health in the
       community and the ability to make effective decisions in the health and social policy
       fields.<P>

       The actual concern revolves around the fact that if Canada adopts identical principles
       to those included in the draft EC privacy directives it is believed that the ability to carry
       out essential research in the public interest could be stifled. The reason is that no
       exemptions are provided in the EC directives regarding prior consent to the collection
       and use of personal information, and for the retention of personal information only for
       as long as it is required for its initial purpose.  Therefore, the prohibition of long term
       storage would make it impossible to track case histories over a lifetime, and the need
       to obtain consent would present prohibitive logistical and cost barriers.<P>

       The submissions from the medical research community provide great detail on the
       security measures taken to protect personal information.  These include:
       anonymization of personal data by the use of scrambling techniques; locked research
       areas; computer security systems; oaths of secrecy; approval and enforcement of
       project protocols by university and provincial bodies; structural separation of research
       from administrative functions; etc.  Also, none of the respondents is aware of
       confidentiality ever having been breached.  Moreover, the focus is not on individual
       patients but on groups or populations of patients.  Therefore, they consider that there
       is no justification for applying the same restrictions concerning consent, use and
       retention of data held for research purposes as is proposed for data held for other
       purposes in the public and private sectors.  As one researcher put it " Are we
       inventing a cure for which there is no disease?".<P>

       In overall terms, there is a strong belief, expressed by many respondents from all
       sectors, that if the various concerns of the general public are not alleviated, the 
       information highway will not be used to its full potential.

<H3><A NAME="A16">HOW TO ENSURE PRIVACY?</A></H3>

<H3><A NAME="A17">The Canadian Experience</A></H3>

       Some of the submissions touch on the Canadian experience with privacy legislation,
       regulations and voluntary codes, by way of background to the current situation.<P>

       Only six jurisdictions are shown to have effective privacy legislation covering the
       public sector, i.e. the Federal Government, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan
       and British Columbia.  Whereas, only Quebec has legislation governing the private
       sector.  Other federal legislation also has provisions related to privacy.  The
       Telecommunications Act has provisions to protect the privacy of individuals, including
       the regulation of unsolicited communications.  Also, amendments to the Criminal
       Code and the Radiocommunication Act now forbid the divulgence of intercepted
       radio-based telephone communications.  Furthermore, the new Bank Act, Insurance
       Companies Act and Trust and Loan Companies Act permit regulations to be made
       governing the use of information provided by customers.  In addition, all English
       speaking provinces, with the exception of New Brunswick and Alberta, have some
       form of legislation protecting consumer credit information.<P>

       At the federal level, there is very little protection of privacy by formal regulations. 
       Recent decisions of the CRTC have restricted the use of ADADs and limited the use
       of junk facsimiles and live voice calls for solicitation purposes.  In addition, it has
       prohibited the use of pre-recorded or computerized calls for solicitation purposes and
       has made clear that telephone companies can, on two days notice, cancel the service
       of ADAD users who violate this provision.  In approving "name display service", it has
       also directed telephone companies to provide free per-call blocking of the display on a
       universal basis.  Finally, it has indicated that it will not grant speedy approval to
       competitive filings of telephone companies if those filings raise privacy concerns. 
       Under the Bank Act, Insurance Companies Act and Trust and Loan Companies no
       regulations have as yet been established in regard to the use of customer information.<P>

       In the private sector, a number of industry associations and businesses have
       instituted voluntary privacy codes.  In the telecommunications industry, the then
       Minister of Communications issued a set of six "Telecommunications Privacy
       Principles" in 1992.  They were to be implemented by a Telecommunications Privacy
       Protection Agency made up of  representatives of industry and consumer groups.
       However the Agency never got of the ground for a number of political, economic and
       practical reasons.  The Canadian Direct Marketing Association (CDMA), the Canadian
       Bankers Association, and Stentor have all issued privacy codes for their members. 
       The cable industry also has embedded privacy principles within a general set of
       industry standards that is administered by the independent Canadian Cable Television
       Standards Council.  In addition, a number of individual companies have developed
       there own voluntary privacy codes.<P>

       In summary, however, in spite of the considerable effort put in to these initiatives,
       many respondents see this as a patchwork approach which is confusing and difficult
       to understand by the average individual.  Nor will this approach address emerging
       international standards, the dangers of rapidly evolving technologies, or the
       expectations of the public.

<H3><A NAME="A18">International Experiences</A></H3>

       Many respondents see international experiences as being the root from which
       Canadian privacy endeavours have grown and as a model upon which future
       endeavours can be based.<P>

       In the 1970s many European countries had adopted privacy legislation which often
       was incompatible among the various countries.  Accordingly, the OECD issued a set
       of guidelines in 1982 on the "Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal
       Information" for adoption by its members.  These guidelines which established basic
       privacy principles, also provided for restriction on the transborder flow of personal
       information to countries which did not comply with equivalent privacy protection
       principles.  Much of the public sector privacy legislation in Canada is based on the
       principles in the OECD guidelines.  However, although Canada acceded to the
       guidelines in 1984, the effect of the restriction of transborder data flow provisions has
       been negligible because of their voluntary nature.  Subsequently, in 1990, the EC
       drafted privacy directives on the "Protection of Individuals in Relation to the
       Processing of Personal Data", which are aimed at harmonizing all European data
       protection legislation to offer common and high levels of protection in order to
       facilitate trade.  The directives will have the force of law if passed by the European
       Parliament.  The latest draft of the directives, which build on the OECD guidelines
       and principles, take into account practical difficulties experienced with the OECD
       guidelines and somewhat reduce the rigidity of the earlier provisions.  Thus, 
       transborder data flows are allowed to countries which have adequate, rather than
       equivalent, data protection measures.  More importantly, they provide for the
       protection of personal privacy as a basic human right, cover both the public and
       private sectors and apply to both automated and manual records.<P>

       Since the 1970s the United States has, at the federal level, passed various pieces of
       privacy related legislation ranging from a general Privacy Act to sectoral specific
       legislation covering such areas as credit reporting, computer fraud and privacy in
       electronic communications.  However, none of this legislation covers the protection of
       personal information across the whole of the private sector.  Indeed, in 1977 the
       Privacy Protection Study Commission explicitly rejected an omnibus private sector
       data protection law on the European model.  It favoured  a combination of legislation
       and non-statutory codes that would be sector specific and thereby more sensitive to
       the different information-handling practices and the needs of different industries. 
       Moreover, the US legislation has neither oversight provisions nor data protection
       boards or privacy protection commissions.  More recently, however, new studies have
       commenced in the USA in regard to privacy on the information highway.  Similar to
       this current study by the Advisory Council, they are being undertaken by the National
       Information Infrastructure (NII) Privacy Working Group, and the National
       Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).  New draft general
       privacy principles have been developed by the NII and a discussion paper has been
       issued by the NTIA for comment.  In addition, new Telecommunications Bills before
       Congress also deal with telecommunications-related privacy concerns.<P>

       A number of respondents also favourably review privacy experiences in other
       countries such as Holland, Great Britain, New Zealand, Hong Kong, etc.

<H3><A NAME="A19">Privacy Principles</A></H3>

       The response to the Discussions Paper's request for comments on the principles that
       should form the basis of effective privacy protection has been met by a wide range of
       responses.  Therefore, the specific responses are included, where applicable, in each
       of the summaries of submissions received, as set out in Appendix A.   However,
       some common threads are discernible.<P>

       Basic to the arguments of some privacy and consumer advocates and privacy
       commissioners is the premise that the right to privacy is a fundamental human right.
       Stemming from this, is the view that privacy is too important to be left to the whims of
       the marketplace and therefore privacy protection should be seen as an integral  and
       necessary part of doing business.<P>

       The ability of individuals to control their personal information is perhaps seen as the
       major privacy issue.  Such control extends to collection, subject to statutory
       requirements, as well as to use and disclosure in accordance with fair information
       practices.<P>

       An essential element of control is the question of consent.  However, this has
       different interpretations in different sectors.  Generally, the consumer and privacy
       advocates and privacy commissioners see this as "informed consent".  This is
       interpreted to mean a clear understanding of the reasons for the collection of
       information and the uses to which it will be put, and being free from any form of
       "coercion".  Many in the business sector also appear to subscribe to the concept of
       "informed consent" while not defining it in that manner.  Whereas others tend to see
       consent as being deemed to have been given by the entry into a transaction.  Also,
       whereas privacy and consumer advocates and privacy commissioners see consent as
       being given by "opting-in", the business sector prefers the concept of "opting-out".<P>

       Other principles, based in large measure on the OECD guidelines and the provisions
       of the federal Privacy Act, include: identification of the purposes of collection; limiting
       collection to information which is necessary for those purposes; ensuring that
       personal information is as accurate and up to date as is necessary for those
       purposes; allowing access by individuals to their personal information, including
       correction where necessary; and, providing mechanisms for complaints and redress.<P>

       Some additional principles have arisen in recent years due to advances in technology
       and the changing marketplace.  These include the requirement for the protection of
       personal information by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the
       information, and the principle that individuals should not have to pay to maintain basic
       and existing levels of privacy.  Related to this latter aspect, there are some
       differences of viewpoint.  Some maintain that consumers should pay for enhanced
       privacy above the basic level, whereas others maintain that privacy should not be
       prejudiced by inability to pay.  Another principle entails freedom of individuals to
       choose whether or not to connect to the information infrastructure, to accept or reject
       services that may affect their level of privacy, and to be free to subscribe to, and be
       charged for, only those services they wish to receive.  However, they should not
       suffer reduced levels of service because of their choice.<P>

       In overall terms, there are not significant differences in views relating to privacy
       principles between, on the one hand consumer and privacy advocates and privacy
       commissioners, and on the other hand the business sector.  Both groups show strong
       support for the privacy principles included in the CSA draft model code which are, in
       the main, equivalent to those set out above.<P>

       Some of the submissions also advance principles that should govern the
       development of the information highway, particularly as it relates to privacy issues. 
       These include the principle that privacy measures must be compatible with the
       dynamic and often unpredictable evolution of the highway, and that the protection of
       privacy on the highway must be balanced with the rights of creators to know who is
       using their intellectual property.

<H3><A NAME="A20">The Public and Private Sectors</A></H3>

       Some of the consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners see a
       relatively new and emerging problem in relation to privacy on the information highway. 
       This is seen as a blurring of the distinction between information which is resident in
       the public sector and that which is resident in the private sector.  Therefore,
       contracting-out of more and more public functions to the private sector is expected to
       have an increasing effect on the privacy practices of the private sector.  As personal
       information in the public sector is passed to the private sector for the fulfillment of
       these contracts, the public sector will no doubt ensure that its privacy protection
       obligations are made part of those contracts.  In addition, the increasing matching of
       public sector information with private sector information, such as the matching of data
       on welfare recipients with bank or financial information to ascertain eligibility, also are
       seen to narrow the gap.  Likewise, in an evolutionary sense, the continued efforts of
       privacy commissioners and the press in bringing privacy issues to the fore will also
       have a spillover effect.  In fact, one international respondent believes that the
       abandonment of the distinction between the public and private sector in the latest
       draft of the proposed EC privacy directives reflects the fact that the increasing flows
       of personal information between those sectors renders the distinction irrelevant.<P>

       Within the private sector alone, further blurring is seen between the individual
       industries using the information highway.  Because of integration of the various media
       and technologies in a "seamless web", the former clear distinction between telephone
       companies, cable companies, broadcasters, the press, marketers, etc., is increasingly
       ceasing to exist.  This leads to difficulty in determining where one sector ceases and
       another commences.  Therefore, a potential problem is seen in establishing privacy
       protection on a purely sectoral basis.

<H3><A NAME="A21">A Level Playing Field</A></H3>

       Reference has been made earlier to the patchwork of federal /provincial legislation
       and regulations, as well as the multitude of different private sector codes across both
       Canada and all sectors of the marketplace.  This results in concerns arising in both
       private sector groups and the consumer and privacy advocacy and privacy
       commissioner groups.  The problem seen by some members of all of these groups is
       that if a national privacy standard is not established across Canada, privacy inequities
       will continue to occur between different individuals, based on both their respective
       geographical location and the respective business organizations with which they do
       business.  Moreover, some business organizations may be able to achieve
       discriminatory and unfair marketing advantages.  Failure to create a level playing field
       could possibly lead to the creation of "data havens," whereby the most lenient
       jurisdictions may attract businesses that seek to evade privacy protection measures 
       Also, artificial legal distinctions would have to be made about where data is "located"
       when it travels the highway.

<H3><A NAME="A22">Legislation and Regulation</A></H3>

       By far the greatest debate and difference in views occurs in regard to whether the
       preferred approach to privacy protection rests with legislation and regulation or with
       voluntary codes and standards.  Each of these views has its supporters and
       detractors for a wide variety of quite valid reasons.<P>

       The majority of respondents who addressed this issue believe that the government
       needs to take stronger action to protect the privacy and security of information. While
       acknowledging the differences in federal/provincial jurisdictions and the difficulty of
       harmonizing approaches between them, most of the respondents who seek stronger
       measures believe that additional legislation and regulation, covering both the public
       and private sectors, is essential.  In addition, the 1992 Ekos privacy survey revealed
       that "compared to a model of pure voluntary self-regulation by business, Canadians
       strongly prefer a governmental legislative response".<P>

       The reasons why legislation and regulation are seen to be required cover a wide
       range.  It is perceived to be the only way to establish a level playing field across
       Canada and to guarantee an adequate level of privacy protection for the public, free
       of confusion and regional and sectoral inequities.  Moreover, there is a risk that
       transborder flows of data could be prejudiced if privacy protection measures are not
       deemed to be adequate under the proposed EC privacy directives.  National
       legislation and standards would meet this requirement.  Furthermore, equal legislated
       national privacy standards for both the public and private sectors would do much to
       negate the concern related to the blurring of the distinction between information which
       is resident in the public sector and that which is resident in the private sector.  As one
       consumer advocate indicated, there has been enough discussion and evidence of the
       inadequacy of voluntary codes over the last ten years that the government must act
       now and be seen to take a leadership role.  Reinforcing this view, is the observation
       that Canada is one of the few western type democracies that does not have
       legislation covering both the public and private sectors.<P>

       The manner in which legislation and regulation can be implemented also covers a
       wide spectrum.  Starting with the public sector, there are suggestions that the
       government should "clean up its own shop".  As a start, there should be amendments
       to the Privacy Act.  A preamble to the Act would clearly establish the principle that
       privacy is a fundamental right (this is also seen as a requirement in any additional
       legislation governing the private sector).  There should be a  provision for the
       protection and security of personal information.  The undertaking of privacy impact
       assessments as part of the design process of all new or major revisions to
       government systems and programs would become mandatory.  Finally, a process
       would be established whereby a standing parliamentary committee would hold
       hearings on the Privacy Commissioner's Annual Report and the annual reports of
       government departments, similar to the manner in which the Public Accounts
       Committee reviews the Auditor General's Report and the public accounts of individual
       departments.  In addition, a number of respondents call for the government, in
       assuming a leadership role, to legislate privacy requirements on organizations that fall
       within the federally regulated private sector and to take all other means within its
       control that would promote the adoption of privacy measures by the private sector.
       In regard to legislating privacy in the private sector, supporters of the proposal tend to
       favour the establishment, by legislation, of a national framework of privacy standards
       under which private sector codes would operate and be bound.  This would be
       complemented by an independent and impartial administrative mechanism which
       would enforce compliance, hear complaints, provide redress and deliver sanctions.  A
       number suggest that such a system could be based on the Quebec Act Respecting
       the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector which is the only privacy
       legislation governing the private sector in Canada.  However, such a view is not
       unanimous.  One private sector institution believes that the Quebec Act does not
       achieve a balance between the protection of privacy and the free circulation of
       information which is so necessary in a market economy.  However, another indicated
       that the Act had had little impact on its policies and procedures although it was
       viewed as "overkill" in some respects.   It is also recognized that such legislation
       would have to be both framed and implemented in the most non-bureaucratic and
       cost-effective manner possible.  This view is reinforced by one British respondent who
       states that the data registration provisions of the UK Data Protection Act are largely
       ignored because they are too bureaucratic and fairly meaningless.  Also, it is
       suggested that any legislation should have a phase-in period in order to avoid
       economic upheaval in areas such as the direct marketing industry which employs
       thousands of Canadians.  Other suggestions for such legislation include provision for
       "whistle blowing" against organizations engaged in illegal activities, and the
       recognition of joint culpability on the part of both senders and receivers.  Furthermore,
       the government is urged to quickly enter into discussions with the provinces with a
       view to harmonizing both public and private sector legislation across Canada.<P>

       Opponents of legislation and regulation see a number of problems in taking the
       legislative route.  Legislation is seen as too blunt an instrument which would be
       inflexible and be incapable of reacting to the accelerating changes and needs of both
       technology and the marketplace.  Moreover, it is also seen as being capable of
       inhibiting new initiatives and prejudicing investment in these areas.  In this regard, the
       fact that business requirements and technologies differ from one sector to another
       would only compound the problem.  The time it would take to secure agreement
       between the federal and provincial jurisdictions also is considered to be a major factor
       against legislation.  Furthermore, some believe that voluntary codes and standards
       are only in their infancy and have not yet been given a chance to prove themselves,
       therefore legislation should only be used as a last resort.  Legislation and regulation
       also are seen as going against the current trend to deregulation in the global
       marketplace, as requiring additional public funding in a time of fiscal restraint, and as
       possibly leading to "micro-management" of the marketplace.<P>

       In general terms, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners favour
       legislation, whereas the private sector is against it.  However the picture is not
       completely black and white. One technology association supports legislation in order
       to guarantee consistent and appropriate levels of privacy protection.  Whereas, a
       telecommunications company believes that the regulated telecommunications industry
       should be exempted from any future legislation because it is already governed by the
       privacy provisions of the Telecommunications Act.  Other private sector organizations
       would not be against legislation if it was shown, after a reasonable period of time, that
       voluntary codes and standards were not working, provided that it recognized
       marketplace realities.<P>

       However, the radio-telecommunications industry is strongly in favour of technology-
       specific legislation.  It believes that the government should move quickly to pass
       legislation to make it an offence to intercept radio-based telecommunications and to
       generally prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale and distribution of scanners
       capable of monitoring radio-based telephones, including cellular phones.<P>

       In regard to the question as to whether adequate privacy protection can be provided
       through provincial or sectoral legislation, there are somewhat conflicting views. 
       However, there seems to be general acceptance that such a course would not be
       sufficient by itself.  Strong opponents of legislation are opposed to it whether it be
       federal, provincial or sectoral, while others agree that, if legislation is to be enacted, it
       must be based on national standards in order to ensure a "level playing field. There is
       equal concern about "balkanization" occurring coupled with the establishment of "data
       havens".  In summary, in any move towards legislation, discussions and coordination
       with the provinces are considered to be essential.

<H3><A NAME="A23">Voluntary Codes and Standards</A></H3>

       The main benefits of voluntary codes and standards are seen to be their flexibility and
       adaptability.  It is pointed out that different sectors are engaged in different business
       practices and utilize different technologies.  Therefore, flexibility allows them to
       customize their privacy practices to the specific nature of the business and to the
       needs of their customers.  Also, they can more quickly adapt and be more sensitive to
       changes in business practices, as well as to evolving technology and consumer
       privacy concerns.  Moreover, regular reviews can be undertaken to assess the effects
       of changing circumstances.  Voluntary codes also can be national in scope, providing
       a level playing field across individual sectors, thus avoiding the problems of different
       federal/provincial jurisdictions.  Additional advantages are also linked to the fact that
       they can be less costly to operate and responsibility and costs can be focused within
       the organization.  Furthermore, they can raise the profile of privacy within an
       organization and help to educate the public, thereby building the confidence of
       consumers while allowing them to fully participate in the benefits of the information
       highway.<P>

       Voluntary codes and standards can be implemented in many ways, each tailored to
       the particular needs of a sector.  They can be made mandatory on the members of a
       given sectoral association, as with the Canadian Direct Marketing Association code,
       or they can be incorporated in the confidentiality Terms of Service approved by the
       CRTC, as with the regulated carriers governed by the Telecommunications Act.  In
       addition, the adoption and implementation of voluntary codes can be made necessary
       by peer pressure, compelling competitive interests and consumer demand, whereby
       consumers will "vote with their feet" if they are not satisfied that their privacy concerns
       are being met.<P>

       One of the most significant developments in voluntary codes at the present time is
       seen as the CSA draft model privacy code which is strongly supported not only by the
       private sector but also by consumer and advocacy groups and privacy
       commissioners.  It contains ten principles for the protection of personal information
       (see Appendix B) which are based on the OECD guidelines.  Its main advantage is
       that it is being developed by a consensus of views emerging from the CSA Technical
       Committee on Privacy, which is made up of representatives from governments,
       privacy commissioners, privacy and consumer advocates, labour, and the private
       sector.  Also, it could be the basis for a national standard against which other
       voluntary codes could be measured.  Equally, it could provide a standard against
       which the international community could judge the adequacy of Canada's personal
       information protection practices.  However, the manner in which it can be
       implemented is still under study.<P>

       The main objection to the use of voluntary codes is that they are voluntary and, like
       chains, they are only as strong as their weakest links.  Moreover, they are sometimes
       only half measures which are not fully responsive to consumers privacy concerns, in
       that they do not always include the full range of fair information practices.  Often they
       do not include provisions for independent arbitration, provisions for monitoring and
       measuring performance, provisions for sanctions and penalties, or adequate
       provisions for complaint and redress.  Furthermore, they sometimes lack effective
       administration at the corporate and sector levels, and may be tailored more to
       business practices than to the protection of privacy.  Also, their coverage within a
       sector may often be inadequate and inconsistent.  Consumers may lack awareness of
       the existence of voluntary codes and often have little input into their development. 
       Finally, they may not meet the "adequate" standards of privacy protection required
       under the EC draft directives.<P>

       Although most of the support for voluntary codes and standards comes from the
       business sector, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners see
       voluntary codes and standards as having an important role to play, provided they are
       governed by overarching legislation.   In reaching this view, they are cognizant of the
       shortfalls of legislation, e.g., rigidity, the time taken to implement, etc., as well as the
       benefits of voluntary codes, e.g. flexibility, responsiveness to particular needs, etc. In
       this sense, voluntary codes are seen as being a first step towards data protection, as
       being deserving of legislative back-up if they are to be really effective, and as being
       an acceptable part of the solution if they can be demonstrated to work.  The fact that
       they can help to raise employee awareness, is also acknowledged.  Furthermore,
       some members of the consumer and privacy advocacy and privacy commissioner
       groups suggest that they can help industry to "get up speed" before legislation is
       introduced and, in doing so, can guide legislative drafters on sector specific issues
       and means of implementation.

<H3><A NAME="A24">Technological Solutions</A></H3>

       There is general agreement that technological solutions have a part to play.  While
       many maintain that the accelerating pace of technology is a threat to privacy, it is also
       acknowledged that new developments in technology can now allow better privacy
       protection features to be built in from the outset.  This latter factor is seen as being
       very important; supporting the view that before new technology and systems are
       developed, privacy impact assessments should be built in as an essential part of the
       development process.  In fact, one respondent has developed a step by step process
       as to how this can be accomplished and another provides suggested rules for
       evaluating the privacy impacts of emerging technologies.  While many see such
       impact assessments as adding to the cost of new systems and possibly delaying their
       development, others see them as possibly avoiding future costs by eliminating
       expensive retrofits to incorporate privacy protection functions at a later date.   Here,
       the need to add free call-blocking as a requirement for the introduction of name-display
       by the telephone companies is given as an example, as is the abandonment
       of the Lotus Marketplace: Households product.<P>

       The question of whether the information highway should be designed to provide high
       levels of privacy protection and whether it will slow the pace and raise the cost of
       innovation is also addressed by many respondents.  Built in security measures are
       seen as a key in this regard.  Generally speaking, it is acknowledged that there is a
       clear responsibility for basic protective measures.  However, these measures should
       be proportionate to the privacy issues associated with each particular application.  For
       instance , the Internet requires little built-in protective measures, whereas banking
       transactions and access to medical records require a high degree of protection. 
       Between these two extremes, various levels of protective measures could be
       instituted, with the consumer having freedom to choose, sometimes at added cost. 
       Beyond the normal protective measures, such as the use of access codes, new
       developments in encryption, such as "public-key" encryption, and the use of smart
       cards are seen as additional measures.  Also, the implementation of digital
       technology is seen as a significant contribution.  Furthermore, it is suggested that the
       government encourage new technology in this area and support research and
       development in order to provide new opportunities for Canadian industry. On the
       question of whether such measures will be more costly or will inhibit innovation, the
       prevailing view is that this will not occur provided that such measures are not too
       excessive.  However, as one privacy commissioner suggests, the costs, in terms of
       loss of human dignity and autonomy, are too great not to require high levels of privacy
       to be built in.  In the final analysis, the private sector recognizes that if consumers do
       not have confidence that the highway will protect their privacy interests, it will not be
       used to its fullest extent.<P>

       On the question of how Canadians can become better involved in the design of
       potentially privacy-threatening technologies and services, there is a wide variety of
       views.  It is pointed that, at the present time, consumers already have the opportunity
       to become involved.  CRTC hearings on the introduction of new regulated
       telecommunications services is given as one instance.  Participation and advice on
       the development of new CSA technical standards is given as another.  Nonetheless,
       there is strong support from consumer and privacy advocates and privacy
       commissioners for public participation in the development of all significant new and
       potentially privacy threatening systems.  Two private sector organizations also
       support public participation on the basis that consultation can forestall delays and
       possible litigation.  An example is given in relation to the current debate on whether
       fibre optic services should go right into the home or whether they should terminate
       100 metres away and then be transmitted by wireless communication.  The latter
       option is less costly but is fraught with privacy protection implications.  In any event,
       advance consultations with consumers and/or privacy commissioners are seen as
       potentially beneficial to private business, as long they are relatively informal and not
       the subject of long drawn out public hearings.

<H3><A NAME="A25">Consumer Education</A></H3>

       There is wide recognition of a lack of awareness and confusion among the public in
       regard to the benefits and services that are and will be available on the information
       highway.  This is coupled with an equal lack of awareness concerning their privacy
       rights, how to obtain those rights, the consequences of providing personal
       information, and the protective measures which are available.  This leads to vague
       but real concerns which could prejudice the success of the information highway. 
       Therefore, there is widespread agreement that education of the public on these
       matters is both essential and urgent in order to reduce concerns and because of the
       rapid growth of the highway.  In addition, it is recognized that both employees and
       businesses need to be educated on their responsibilities in regard to privacy
       protection.<P>

       A general consensus is evident that both governments and business have major
       responsibilities in this area.  Most private sector organizations indicate their
       commitment.  Many are already engaged in education programs, not only for their
       customers but also for their employees.  Moreover, consumer and privacy advocates
       and privacy commissioners indicate their willingness to become more involved,
       provided funding and resources are made available.  In addition, the media is also
       seen as having a significant role to play.  However, it is also recognized that
       consumers themselves must take the initiative to absorb educational materials
       provided to them, to shop around for the best balance of services and privacy
       protection, and to understand their own responsibilities in regard to privacy matters. 
       Equally, businesses must also take the initiative to inform customers of potential
       privacy problems related to their products and services and not hold back until a crisis
       occurs.<P>

       The tools available are seen to be many and varied.  Everyday business practices,
       coupled with the publicizing of industry codes, will be powerful mechanisms, as will
       the publicizing of the CSA model privacy code.  Massive advertising campaigns are
       not recommended, although periodic public awareness campaigns, which could take
       many forms, are recommended.  The use of information centres, including public and
       academic libraries, for the distribution of materials and brochures also is considered
       to be another avenue.  Brochures and publications can be directed at different
       audiences, including the public at large, schools and universities, and customers of
       businesses.  Other suggestions include a privately funded national toll-free privacy
       "hotline" for consumers and the inclusion of a confidentiality clause in all contracts.

<H3><A NAME="A26">CONCLUSIONS</A></H3>

<H3><A NAME="A27">Concerns</A></H3>

       It is quite that evident that there is a wide range of real public concerns on privacy
       matters which, if not addressed quickly, could escalate to the point that the effective
       functioning of the information highway could be jeopardized.

<H3><A NAME="A28">How to Ensure Privacy?</A></H3>

       There is a significant divergence of views between the majority of members of the
       private sector and consumer and privacy advocacy and privacy commissioner groups
       in regard to the relative merits of legislation and voluntary codes.  However, there also
       is a pragmatic and conciliatory approach to these differences which makes a
       compromise achievable.<P>

       No single approach to the resolution of the problems is viable.  Therefore, a
       combination of the approaches outlined in the Discussion Paper is most likely to
       succeed because they are inter-related and mutually supportive.<P>

       In order to achieve comprehensive solutions to the various problems identified by
       respondents, within the minimum possible time frame, a well-coordinated plan should
       be developed.<P>

       The following are potential elements of a plan which the Advisory Council may wish to
       consider.<P>

<UL>
<LI>The establishment by legislation of a national framework of privacy standards,
       probably based on the CSA model privacy code, under which private sector codes
       would operate and be bound.<P>
<LI>Revisions to the federal Privacy Act to overcome its current shortcomings,
       including a revised preamble, provision for the protection and security of personal
       information, and provision for the establishment of privacy impact assessments
       within the public sector.<P>
<LI>Development of a program to reinforce, strengthen and update the application of
       privacy requirements within the public sector.<P>
<LI>Early discussion with the provinces to implement national standards on a country-wide basis.<P>
<LI>Development of legislation to make it an offence to intercept private radio-based
       telecommunications, and to generally prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale
       and distribution of scanners capable of monitoring radio-based telephones,
       including cellular phones.<P>
<LI>Development of a program to systematically promote the development of private
       sector codes based on the CSA model privacy code.<P>
<LI>Creation of a joint government/industry program to promote and support the
       development of privacy protection technologies.<P>
<LI>Promotion of consultations between industry/government, consumer groups and
       privacy commissioners on the development of significant and new potentially
       privacy-threatening technologies and systems.<P>
<LI>Development of a joint industry/government privacy education program in
       consultation with consumer groups and privacy commissioners.<P>
<LI>Establishment of consultations between government and the medical and social
       research groups to resolve the apparent dichotomy between the protection of
       personal information and the need to carry out medical and social research
       necessary to promote the public good.<P>
<LI>Development by the government of a standard privacy protection clause for all
       contracts or agreements involving the transfer or exchange of personal
       information with all institutions outside of government.<P>
<LI>Issuance of a public announcement after adoption of the plan and ministerial
       approval.<P>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="A29">Failure to Address the Problem</A></H3>

       Failure to address the major problems identified by respondents could be followed by
       increasing public privacy concerns, coupled with avoidance of the use of the
       information highway.  Also, it might lead to Canada's privacy protection standards
       being considered inadequate under the European Communities' privacy directives.</BODY></HTML>

<H3>Advanced Surveillance Technologies Conference II,  Ottawa, Canada, 1996</H3>
<ul>

The surveillance of people and their activities has become an exact science using an extraordinary range of powerful new technologies.  On the horizon are technologies and techniques far in advance of anything covered by current law.  These technologies, many of which involve an intimate intrusion into the lives of individuals will be the subject of a one day conference to be held on September 16, 1996 in Ottawa, Canada. <A HREF = "http://www.privacy.org/pi/">Privacy International</A> and the <A HREF = "http://www.epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC)</A> are organising the event.<P>

<H1>National ID Cards</H1>
</center>

<!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4>Many countries are actively considering adopting national id cards for a variety of functions.  These include the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Over the past seven years, Privacy International has been at the forefront of opposing these proposals in a number of countries including  Australia, New Zealand, the Phillippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States.<p>

These pages are an attempt to bring together materials based on PI members' experiences on opposing the proposals. While each jurisdictions may have local variations, the themes remain remarkably similar no matter where the proposals are heard.  Our intention here is to discuss the evidence at an international level and to promote debate about the claims made about such card systems. </FONT>

<H2>CAMPAIGNS OF OPPOSITION TO ID CARD SCHEMES</H2>
</center><P>
<BR>
Proposals for identity (ID) cards have provoked public outrage and political division in several countries.  In this paper Simon Davies analyses the key elements of public opposition to ID Card schemes, and profiles the massive 1987 Australian campaign against a national ID card.<P>
<HR ALIGN=center  WIDTH=100% SIZE=2>
<P>
Following the announcement of an official identity card scheme, there is inevitably a public debate  Such debate often occurs as a three stage process:<P>
During the first stage of the debate, a popular view is usually expressed that identification, per se, is not an issue related to individual rights. When an identity card is proposed, the public discussion is initially focused on the possession and use of the card itself. At this level of debate, the perceived benefits of ID dominate discussion. People often cannot see past the idea of a card being used strictly for purposes of verification of identity (banks, public transport, travel etc). Invariably, at this early stage of awareness, support for ID cards is high. The device is perceived as an instrument to streamline dealings with authority.<P>
The second stage of public debate is marked by a growing awareness of the hidden threats of an identity card: function creep, the potential for abuse by authorities, the problems arising from losing your card. Technical and organizational questions often arise at this level of discussion. As for the question of abuse by authorities (i.e. routine ID checks by police) a common response is still  "I have nothing to hide, so I have nothing to fear".<P>
The final level of discussion involves more complex questions about rights and responsibilities. At this stage, the significance of the computer back-up and the numbering system come into the picture. <P>
Most public opposition to administration strategies such as numbering systems, Identity cards or the census are structured around an organized campaign of negative imagery (Big Brother) and  a more systematic process of public education.  In the Netherlands and German anti-census movements, and in the campaign against the Australia Card, hostile imagery sat comfortably alongside a strong intellectual foundation of opposition.<P>
To the organizers of a campaign, the imagery is important. No government assurances can counteract hysteria. The intangible arguments against national ID cards often include:<P>
<UL><LI>A fear that the card will be used against the individual<P>
<LI>A fear that the card will increase the power of authorities<P>
<LI>A feeling  that the card is in some way a hostile symbol<P>
<LI>A concern that a national ID card is the mechanism foretold in Revelations (the Mark of the Beast).<P>
<LI>A fear that people will be reduced to numbers - a dehumanising effect.<P>
<LI>A rejection of the card on the principle of individual rights<P>
<LI>A sense that the government is passing the buck for bad management to the citizen</UL><BR>
The tangible concerns that tend to create a more powerful long term campaign focus are:<P>
<UL><LI>Any card system needs rules. How many laws must be passed to force the citizenry to use and respect the card?<P>
<LI>A card or numbering system may lead to a situation where government policy becomes  "technology driven" and will occur increasingly through the will of bureaucrats,  rather than through law or public process<P>
<LI>Practical and administrative problems that will arise from lost, stolen or damaged cards (estimated at up to several hundred thousand per year) <P>
<LI>Will the system create enough savings to justify its construction?  If the system fails, can it be disassembled?<P>
<LI>To what extent will the system entrench fraud and criminality? What new opportunities for criminality will the system create?<P>
<LI>What are the broader questions of social change that relate to this proposal ? How will it affect my children?</UL><BR>
Concerns over the potential abuse of ID cards by authorities are supported by the experience of countries which have such cards. Complaints of harassment, discrimination and denial of service are, in some countries, quite common. <P>
The issue of privacy, which is central to concern about ID cards, tends to embrace all political philosophies. Concern over identity cards is as strong on the right as it is on the left.  Libertarians and Conservatives believing that a card will increase the power of government, tend to dislike the notion. The left is often split on the issue, but contains a significant number who fear card systems on the basis of human rights.<P>
It is, of course, true that a large number of people will support an ID card in the belief that it will solve many problems of fraud and criminality. Whether a Parliament accepts the notion is another matter. In Australia and New Zealand, MPs have crossed the floor and resigned from their party over this issue. And even when only a minority of the public opposes the card, they do so with vehemence. <P>
It cannot be taken for granted that the public will automatically support the ID card concept.  The Australian public took almost two years to protest against the card proposal. Within two months of the New Zealand announcement, hundreds of people were protesting in public. The reaction cannot be predicted. <P>
The United States has always viewed the introduction of ID cards as a fundamental attack on the relationship between authorities and the citizen, and therefore, a proposal that is politically unsustainable.<P>
The government of Ireland recently abandoned plans to establish a national numbering system and ID card.1  The Data Protection Commissioner for Ireland, Donal Linehan, objected vehemently to the proposal. While acknowledging the importance of controlling fraud, the Commissioner observed that the proposal posed "very serious privacy implications for everybody".2<P>
<BR>
<B>ANATOMY OF AN ANTI-ID CARD CAMPAIGN - THE AUSTRALIAN EXPERIENCE</B><P>
ID card systems are often made appealing to the public by being marketed as "service cards", offering access to a range of facilities and benefits.  The cards are also often marketed as voluntary instruments, thus neutralizing perhaps the key plank of any potential campaign of opposition.<P>
These factors have contributed to the dearth of opposition in recent years to card systems. The specter of an Orwellian Big Brother society has also diminished since the fateful year 1984, and apocalyptic scenarios of information brutality by an information-bloated State have also been treated with more skepticism than in the past. Information Technology has been absorbed by the public.<P>
Over the past ten years, opposition of ID cards has been confined to a handful of countries. French authorities have encountered opposition to their efforts to make cards machine readable.  German authorities have run up against public and constitutional barriers in establishing a national numbering system for the German ID card. The Philippine ID card ran aground in 1991 because of cost factors which were made public through a campaign of opposition by human rights groups. The New Zealand public also opposed the Kiwi Card. <P>
The campaign which stands out, however, is the one which stopped the proposed Australia Card.  This movement, the largest in recent Australian history, forced a dissolution of the parliament, a general election, and unprecedented divisions within the Labour government. The issues which were raised in this campaign provide important insights into the range of concerns related to ID cards in every country.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Australia Card</B><P>
To the older generation of Australians,  the idea of a national identity card was not novel. Australians were given an identity card during the Second World War. This scheme, similar to the British identity card, relied on the imposition of rations as an incentive for registration and production of the card, and it was dropped soon after the hostilities had ended.3<P>
Thirty years passed before the idea of a national identity card was again raised. Three government reports 4  suggested that the efficiency of the Commonwealth Government could be increased, and fraud better detected,  through the use of an ID card system. Two  Cabinet Ministers of the Fraser Government were reported as viewing such a proposal as politically unworkable, and the idea went no further.5<P>
The Australia Card's genesis can be traced to the early 1980s, with widespread concern about tax evasion and tax avoidance. Coupled with concerns over the extent of welfare fraud, there was a belief expressed in some quarters that an identity card or national registration procedure might assist the government's administration processes. Fears over the extent of illegal immigration added fuel to these suggestions. <P>
The identity card idea was then raised at the national Tax Summit in 1985 (initially by Labor MP David Simmons and later by the chief executive of the Australian Taxpayers Association6) and found its way into legislation the following year. Playing on patriotism, the government called it the "Australia Card" (it later became widely known as the "UnAustralia Card and the Aush-tralia Card).<P>
The Australia Card was to be carried by all Australian citizens and permanent residents (separately marked cards would be issued to temporary residents and visitors). The would contain a photograph name, unique number, signature and period of validity, and would have been used to establish the right to employment. It would be necessary for the operation of a bank account, provision of government benefits, provision of health benefits, and for immigration and passport control purposes. <P>
The plan consisted of six components :<P>
*     REGISTER     A central register containing information about every member of the population, to be maintained by the Health Insurance Commission (HIC).<P>
*     CODE     A unique numerical identifier to be given to every member of the population, and assigned by the HIC.<P>
*     CARD     An obligatory, multi-purpose identification card to be issued by the HIC to every member of the population.<P>
*     OBLIGATIONS.     The law would require all individuals to produce the card for a variety of reasons, and would require organizations to demand the card,  apply sanctions to people who refused to do so, and to report the data to the government. <P>
*     USE     The number and the Australia Card register wee to be used by a variety of agencies and organizations as their administrative basis.<P>
*     CROSS NOTIFICATION     Agencies using the system would be required to notify each other of changes to a person's details.7<P>
Despite the extraordinary change that the plan was likely to prompt in the relationships within the Australian Community, the proposal caused hardly a ripple of concern. Early opinion polls showed a seventy per cent public support for the scheme.<P>
Not everyone was enthusiastic about the plan. A handful of journalists ran occasional stories raising questions about the proposal. The parliamentary opposition opposed the plan. Most significantly, a small number of committed academics and advocates worked to provide a critical analysis of the scheme and its implications.<P>
 As early as July 1985, the Privacy Committee of NSW, a government agency,  devoted a special issue of its "Privacy Bulletin"  to the ID card, warning that the proposal encompassed grave dangers for liberty in Australia. The Committee's view was that this proposal was more than a mere identification procedure. It was, said the Committee, a tool for the centralization of power and authority within the government.<P>
Legal centers, civil liberties councils, academics and advocates joined the opposition to the ID card plan. Over the next two years, a strong intellectual foundation was developed.  <P>
In one of the earliest critiques of the ID card proposal (January 1986) Professor Geoffrey de Q Walker, now dean of law at Queensland University, observed :<P>
One of the fundamental contrasts between free democratic societies and totalitarian systems is that the totalitarian government relies on secrecy for the regime but high surveillance and disclosure for all other groups, whereas in the civic culture of liberal democracy, the position is approximately the reverse. 8<P>
Australian data protection expert Graham Greenleaf, one of the pioneers of the anti ID card push,  warned : <P>
Is it realistic to believe that the production of identity cards by children to adults in authority to prove their age will be "purely voluntary"?  The next generation of children may be accustomed to always carrying their Cards, to get a bus or movie concession, or to prove they are old enough to drink, so that in adult life they will regard production of an ID card as a routine aspect of most transactions. 9<P>
As the Australia Card Bill was subjected to increasing scrutiny, the surveillance nature of the scheme received more attention. Greenleaf described the components of the Australia Card as "the building blocks of surveillance". The most obvious of those building blocks were the card, the unique number, the Australia Card Register (containing all the information and acting as an information exchange) and the telecommunications links between different agencies and arms of the Card scheme. <P>
Not so obvious, however, were the extensive reporting obligations throughout the government and the community, the automatic exchange of information throughout the government, weak data protection, the ease of legislative expansion of the system, and the effective encouragement of the private sector and state governments to make use of the card's number. <P>
Advocates pointed out that whilst it is true that some civil law countries (Spain, France etc) have an ID card, none would have been as intrusive or dangerous as the one proposed by the Australian Government.  The Australia Card would have gone much further than the mere identification purpose of ID cards in other countries. It would have created a central information register that would touch many aspects of a person's life. <P>
At the end of 1985, the Opposition controlled Senate forced the appointment of a Joint Select Committee to investigate the proposal. The Committee raised a wide spectrum of concerns that eventually came to haunt the government. The majority of the Committee, including one government member, came down against the proposal, warning that the scheme would change the nature of the relationship between citizen and state and create major privacy and civil liberties problems. The committee pointed out that the cost benefit basis for such a scheme was speculative and rubbery, and that all common law countries had rejected such proposals. 10 The fact that no common law country has accepted an ID card was crucial to the whole debate over the Australia Card.<P>
Rather than supporting the Australia card option, the Committee's report recommended a number of reforms to Departmental practices and information management.  The government ignored the findings of the Select Committee, and proceeded with its proposal.<P>
A self proclaimed "unholy alliance"  was formed in Victoria between such figures as the Builders Labourers Federation';s Norm Gallagher, Western Mining Corporation chief Hugh Morgan, Civil liberties leader Ron Castan and popular singer Peter Garrett, and had placed advertisements in National publications.  Several organizations also publicly opposed the Card, including the libertarian Adam Smith Club and  Centre 2000,   the NSW and Victorian Councils for Civil Liberties, the NSW branch of the Australian Computer Society, and a number of left wing trade unions. Three  academics, Roger Clarke, Professor Geoffery de Q Walker and Graham Greenleaf, provided powerful and persuasive analysis of the government's proposals. The arguments against the card were seldom reported by media, who appear to have generally been persuaded by the government's revenue arguments. <P>
The committee's report formed the basis of the Parliamentary Opposition's rejection of the scheme. On two occasions the Government presented the legislation to the Senate, where it does not have a majority, only to see the bill rejected. After the second rejection by the Senate, the Government used the issue as the trigger to employ its constitutional right to call an election on the ID card legislation, and to call a joint sitting of Parliament, where it would have had a majority.<P>
As things turned out, the election campaign of July 1987 contained almost no reference to the ID card issue. In the opinion of the media, the ID card was simply not on the agenda.11 The government was re-elected and promptly re-submitted the ID card legislation.<P>
Until then, few Australians had taken any notice of the proposal. A rally in Sydney's Martin Place convened by Democrat Senator Paul McLean, succeeded in attracting less than a hundred people. 12 People held concerns privately, but were reluctant to express these fears lest they be branded "friends of tax cheats" (as the government had already labelled the parliamentary opposition). <P>
Three weeks after the election, the fortunes of the Australia Card were reversed.  On 28th July 1987, seventeen people from wildly different edges of the political spectrum met to plot the card's demise.The meeting involved well known libertarians, communists, mainstream political party leaders, media figures, and business, farming and community leaders. 13<P>
The meeting established a trust (later to be called the Australian Privacy Foundation) and resolved to form a campaign as a last ditch effort to fight the card. The almost complete absence of media interest demanded a publicity stunt, and the group decided to launch its campaign in the Ballroom of Sydney's plush Sebel Town House. 14<P>
The key element in the campaign launch was the diversity of speakers. Right wing broadcaster Alan Jones, Democrat leader Janine Haines, America's Cup hero Ben Lexcen and rock singer Peter Garrett provided an unprecedented mix of famous talent, and the launch enjoyed saturation coverage. Ben Lexcen threatened to leave Australia forever if the scheme proceeded. Peter Garrett called it "the greatest threat Australia has ever faced".15<P>
Once these well known figures had stated their opinion, other highly respected Australians rapidly joined the condemnation of the scheme. Former Westpac Bank chairman Sir Noel Foley stunned his colleagues with the blunt assessment that the card would pose "a serious threat to the privacy, liberty and safety of every citizen". Australian Medical Association  president  Dr Bruce Shepherd went as far as to predict "It's going to turn Australian against Australian. But given the horrific impact the card will have on Australia, its defeat would almost be worth fighting a civil war for." Fuelled by the unique alliance, newspapers and talk-back shows recorded a logarithmic increase in public concern.<P>
More Australians joined the Privacy Foundation to voice protest at the scheme. Right wing academic Professor Lauchlan Chipman, communist author Frank Hardy, former Whitlam Government minister  Jim McClelland, and left wing economist Professor Ted Wheelwright all linked arms with their ideological foe to fight the scheme. <P>
Within weeks, a huge and well organized movement was underway,  Rallies were organized on almost a daily basis.  Although these were described as "education nights" the reality was that most were hotbeds of hostility rather than well ordered  information giving sessions. <P>
The strength of public feeling was never more clear than on the night of September 14th, when 4,000 angry people crammed the AMOCO hall in the central New South Wales town of Orange. One in eight of the cities population attended the meeting.  Other towns responded in a similar way.<P>
The massive wave of public outrage was generated by scores of ad-hoc local and regional committees from coast to coast. Rallies formed on a daily basis, culminating in a gathering of 30,000 outside Western Australia's Parliament House. The Australian Privacy Foundation, which had organized the campaign, had planned  rallies in Sydney and Melbourne that were tipped to have sealed off the Central Business District. <P>
The passion of those weeks reached the point of open civil disobedience. The Labor caucus came close to violence on one occasion,16 while public demonstrations against the ID card began to turn nasty.17<P>
The letters pages of most newspapers reflected the strong feelings of Australians. "We won't be numbers!" was a typical letters page headline, with others such as "I have no intention of applying", "An alternative is the ball and chain", Biggest con job in our history", "Overtones of nazi Germany", "I will leave the country" and "Passive resistance gets my vote".18 The cartoonists contributed to the strong feelings, with some constantly portraying then Prime Minister Robert Hawke in Nazi uniform.<P>
Historian Geoffrey Blainey compared the extraordinary protest to the Eureka Stockade. "The destruction of the licences at Ballarat, and the stand at Eureka Stockade was a rebellion against the erosion of personal liberty associated with the Australia Card of that era".19 The card had touched a nerve in the national psyche by cutting across what many saw as the national character.<P>
A major national opinion poll conducted in the closing days of the campaign by the Channel Nine television network resulted in a ninety per cent opposition to the card. The normally staid Australian Financial Review produced a scathing editorial which concluded "It is simply obscene to use revenue arguments ("We can make more money out of the Australia Card") as support for authoritarian impositions rather than take the road of broadening national freedoms".20<P>
Within weeks of its commencement, the campaign had galvanized Australia against the Card. Despite elements of hysteria, the average Australian came to understand that the introduction of such a scheme would reduce freedoms and increase the power of authorities. Indeed, "freedom" would come to mean the freedoms granted by the card. As the Financial Review had so eloquently observed, Australia's rights and freedoms are far more fragile than those of older counterparts. A government should be committed to strengthening those freedoms. <P>
As news of the specifics of the ID card legislation spread, the campaign strengthened. If you were in employment without an ID card, it would be an offence for your employer to pay you (Penalty $20,000). If you were then forced to resign, you could not get a new job, as the law would make it a offence for an employer to hire a cardless person (penalty $20,000). Farmers without ID cards could not receive payments from marketing boards for their produce (penalty $20,000). A person without an ID card would be denied access to a pre-existing bank account, and could not cash in investments, cannot give money to or receive money from a solicitor, or could not receive money in unit, property or a cash management trust. <P>
Cardless people could not buy or rent their own home or land (penalty $5,000), nor would benefits be paid to the unemployed, widows, supporting parents, the aged, the invalid or the sick. <P>
If your card is destroyed for any reason than cannot be proven as accidental, the penalty would be $5,000 or two years imprisonment or both. A $500 penalty would be imposed if you lost your card and failed to report the loss within twenty one days. Failure to attend a compulsory conference if ordered to by the ID card agency would result in a penalty of $1,000 or six months' gaol. Failure to produce your ID card on demand to the Tax Office would invoke a penalty of $20,000. <P>
By this time, the Card's architect, the Health Insurance Commission was well and truly on the nose. Talk back radio hosts had become fond of quoting a paragraph of an HIC planning document on the Australia Card:<P>
'It will be important to minimize any adverse public reaction to implementation of the system. One possibility would be to use a staged approach for implementation, whereby only less sensitive data are held in the system initially with the facility to input additional data at a later stage when public acceptance may be forthcoming more readily.'21 <P>
The campaign organizers stressed the pseudo-voluntary nature of the card. Whilst it was not technically compulsory for a person to actually obtain a card, it would have been extremely difficult to live in society without it.  Indeed, the government actually coined the term "pseudo-voluntariness" to describe its aspirations.<P>
By mid September, the Government was facing an internal crisis. The left of the party had broken ranks to oppose the card 22 while right wing members (particularly those in marginal seats) were expressing concern within caucus. 23 Deputy Prime Minister Lionel Bowen urged the Party to tread with caution, and suggested that a re-think may be necessary.24<P>
Within weeks, in the face of mass public protests, a party revolt and civil disobedience, the government scrapped the ID card proposal. It was  provided with the convenient face-saver of a technical flaw in the legislation revealed by opposition senator John Stone. The government had the option of re-introducing the legislation, but did not do so. Journalists reported that the government was overwhelmed with joy  that the flaw had been discovered.<P>
The Hawke Government made several key mistakes in its preparations for the Australia Card scheme. First, it had made assumptions about the right of government that simply did not match community expectations. People felt that the government did not have a mandate to do as it pleased. Second, the resort to patriotism (calling this the Australia Card) was resented hotly. Finally, and perhaps most important, the Government was simply not able to establish that it and its law enforcement agencies could be trusted with the mechanism. <P>
The sophistication of public debate was highly developed. Letters to the newspapers and calls to radio stations put the argument that with the implementation of the card, the onus of proof in day to day transactions would be reversed. Trust within society would be replaced by the demand for formal identification. The government appeared unable to understand people's concern that there would emerge a shift in the balance of power in the relationships between citizen and the state. According to academic experts and privacy advocates leading the campaign, the card would suffer "function creep" and would find its way into many aspects of life.  These were fears that could never be countered by government assurances. <P>
There can be little doubt that, in addition to the problems listed above, several very substantial privacy and data protection fears were established. These included matters of data security, function creep, incursions related to data matching, improper use and disclosure of data, erroneous data, the establishment of central control and tracking, and the possible development of an "internal passport". Coupled with the government's inability to establish that the system would actually tackle major problems such as the underground economy, even the most conservative government supporters became skeptical.  <P>
There was a very real fear in the Australian community in 1987 that the fundamental balance of power was shifting. Justice Michael Kirby, President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal,  observed "If there is an identity card, then people in authority will want to put it to use....What is at stake is nothing less than the nature of our society and the power and authority of the state over the individual". 25<P>

<H2> ID CARDS: SOME PERSONAL VIEWS FROM AROUND THE WORLD</H2><p><br><br>
</center>
<P>


In 1994, in an attempt to discover the problems caused by ID cards, Privacy
 International compiled a survey containing reports from correspondents in forty
 countries.  Amongst the gravest of problems reported to Privacy International was
 the over zealous use or misuse of ID cards by police - even where the cards were
 supposed to be voluntary. One respondent wrote :<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
On one occasion I was stopped in Switzerland when walking at night near Lake Geneva.
  I was living in Switzerland at the time and had a Swiss foreigner's ID card.  The
 police were wondering why I should want to walk at night to look at the Chateau de
 Chillon.  Really suspicious I suppose, to walk at night on the banks of the lake to
 look at an illuminated chateau (I am white and dress conservatively).  I had to
 wait for 20 minutes whilst they radioed my ID number to their central computer to
 check on its validity.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>



Correspondents in most countries reported that police had powers to demand the ID
 card. A correspondent in Greece reported:<P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>In my country the Cards are compulsory.  If police for example stop you and ask  for
 identification you must present them the ID or you are taken to the police
 department for identification research.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Police were granted these powers in the late 1980s, despite some public misgivings.
 Non European countries reported more serious transgressions, In Brazil, for example:
<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>They are compulsory, you're in big trouble with the police if they request it and
 you don't have one or left home without it. The police can ask for my identity card
 with or without a valid motive, it's an intimidation act that happens in Brazil
 very, very often.  The problem is not confined to the police.  Everybody asks for
 your id when you are for example shopping, and this is after you have shown your
 cheque guarantee card. We also other similar cards. Nobody trusts anybody
 basically.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>

Predictably, political hot-spots have seen widescale abuse of the card system:<p>



<BLOCKQUOTE>One problem that Afghans encountered carrying these "tazkiras"  (ID cards) was
 during the rule of the communist regime in Afghanistan  where people were stopped
 in odd hours and in odd places by the government's Soviet advisors and their KHALQI
 and PARCHAMI agents and asked for their "tazkiras". Showing or not showing the
 "tazkira" to the enquiring person at that time was followed by grave consequences.
 By showing it, the bearer would have revealed his age upon which, if it fell
 between 16-45, he would have been immediately taken to the nearest army post and
 drafted into the communist army, and if he refused to show, he would have been
 taken to the nearest secret service (KHAD) station and interrogated as a member of
 the resistance (Mujahideen), imprisoned, drafted in the army or possibly killed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Many countries reported that their ID card had become an internal passport, being
 required for every dealing with people or institutions. In Argentina, according to
 this correspondent, the loss of the ID card would result in grave consequences:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I got my first personal ID when I turned seven. It was the Provincial Identity Card.
 It looked like the hardcover of a little book with just two pages in it. It had my
 name, my photograph, the fingerprint of my right thumb, and some other personal
 data. I never questioned what was the logic about fingerprinting a seven-year old
 boy. It was suggested that identification was one of the major purposes for the
 existence of the Police of the Province which issued the card. It was required for
 enroling in the Provincial School I attended. Attending the primary school is
 compulsory, hence everybody under twelve is indirectly forced to have the
 Card.Well, this Book was required for any sort of proceedings that the person
 wanted to initiate, e.g. enrol at school, buy a car, get his driving license, get
 married. Nobody could do anything without it. In addition, it became a  prerogative
 of the police to request it at any time and place. Whoever was caught without it
 was customarily taken to jail and kept there for several hours (or overnight if it
 happened in the evening) while they "checked his personal record".  In effect,
 Argentine citizens have never been much better off than South-African negroes
 during the Apartheid, the only difference is that we Argentinians did not have to
 suffer lashings if caught without the pass card.  As for daily life without the ID,
 it was impossible. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Of greater significance is the information that ID cards are commonly used as a
 means of tracking citizens to ensure compliance with such laws as military service.
 Again, in Argentina: <P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
The outrage of the military  service was something that many people was not ready to
 put up with. Nevertheless, something forced the people to present themselves to be
 drafted. It was nothing more or less than the ID.  In fact, if somebody did not
 show up, the army never bothered to look for them. They just waited for them to
 fall by themselves, because the ID card showed the boy to be on military age and
 not having the necessary discharge records by the army. Provided that in the
 country you could not even go for a walk without risking to be detained by the
 police, being a no-show for military duty amounted to a civil death.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Another respondent in Singapore noted that many people in his country were aware
 that the card was used for purposes of tracking their movements, but that most did
 not see any harm in this:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If that question is put to Singaporeans, they are unlikely to say that the cards
 have been abused. However, I find certain aspects of the NRIC (ID card) system
 disconcerting. When I finish military service (part of National service), I was
 placed in the army reserve. When I was recalled for reserve service, I found that
 the army actually knew about my occupation and salary! I interpreted this as an
 intrusion into my privacy. It might not be obvious but the NRIC system has made it
 possible to link fragmented information together.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>


The consequences of losing ones card were frequently mentioned:<P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>A holiday in Rio was ruined for me when I was robbed on the beach and had to spend
 the rest of the brief holiday going through the bureaucracy to get a duplicate
 issued. One way round this (of dubious legality) is to walk around with a notarized
 xerox copy instead of the original. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


The Brazillian experience shows that the card is often misused by police:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Of course violent police in metropolitan areas of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro love
 to beat and arrest people (especially black/poor) on the pretext that they don't
 have their ID card with them. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

In some countries, denial of a card means denial of virtually all services:<P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>ID cards are very important in Vietnam.  They differentiate between citizens and
 non-citizens.  People without an ID card are considered as being denied of
 citizenship and all the rights that come with it.  For example, they cannot get
 legal employment, they cannot get a business license, they cannot go to school,
 they cannot join official organizations, and of course they cannot join the
 communist party.   They cannot travel either. (Even though in practice, they bribe
 their way around within the country, they would face big trouble if got caught
 without ID card.)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>



The same problem occurs in China:<P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>I personally feel that the card has the following drawbacks:   It carries too much
 private info about a person.  We have to use it in almost every situation. such as
 renting a hotel room, getting legal service from lawyers, contacting government
 agencies, buying a plane ticket and train ticket, applying for a job, or getting
 permit to live with your parents,  otherwise your residence is illegal. In a  lot
 of cases, we are showing  too much irrelevant information to an agency or person
 who should not know that.  The card is subject to police cancellation, and thus 
 without it, one can hardly do anything, including traveling for personal or
 business purposes, or getting legal help or obtaining a job. The government has
 been using this scheme too often as a measure against persons who run into troubles
 with it socially or politically.  The identity card is showing your  daily or every
 short-term movement, and can be used to regularize and monitor a person's behavior
 and activity.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


One Korean professor reported that the national card was used primarily as a means
 of tracking peoples activities and movements:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

 If you lose this card, you have to report and make another one within a certain
 period.  Since it shows your current address, if you change your address then you
 must report that and make a correction of the new address.  If you go to a military
 service or to a prison, then the government takes away this identity card. You get
 the card back when you get out.  You are supposed to carry this card everywhere you
 go, since the purpose is to check out the activity of people. There are fines and
 some jail terms if you do not comply.  If you board a ship or an airplane, then you
 must show this card to make a record. You need to show this card when you vote.
 Former presidential candidate Kim, Dae Joong could not vote for his own
 presidential election because his secretary forgot to bring Kim's card. He had to
 wait for a while until somebody bring his card.  Many government employees make lot
 of money selling information on this card to politicians during election season. 
 Police can ask you to show this card and check whether your identity number is on
 the wanted list or not.  There is a widespread prejudice between the people of some
 local areas. This card shows the permanent address of you. And it allows other
 people to successfully guess the hometown of your parents. </BLOCKQUOTE><P>



One Portuguese man studying in the United States reported an obsession with identity  in his country:<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
I keep losing my ID. card, and people keep asking for it.  It seems like it's needed
 for just about everything I want to do, and I should really carry it around my neck
 or have it tattooed on my palm.  The information on it is needed for everything.  
 Many buildings, perhaps most, will have a clerk sitting at a "reception desk" who
 will ask you for your id.  They will keep it and give it back to you when you
 leave.  Few people seem bothered with this, but then they don't keep loosing
 they're cards like I do.  SO I usually threw a little tantrum "Are we under curfew?
  Why do I have to carry my id with me anyway?"  Our tolerant culture invariably
 leads the clerk to take whatever other document I happen to be carrying -- usually
 my bus pass, which I loose less often.  After a while I surrender and go get myself
 a new id. card. It takes 1/2 a day or more to do this and -- guess what -- you need
 your old id. card.  It's more complicated if you've lost it.  Then finally I am
 legal again for a while. It's partly due to the Portuguese obsession with identity.
  Everyone carries both they're mother's and father's last names.  
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Others confirmed the traditional problem of counterfeiting:<P>



<BLOCKQUOTE> It costs only 300 rupees ($10) to get a counterfeit ID card. The system hardly
 works. We all know how fake IDs (one guy's photo, another one's name) can be
 obtained so people can have their friends take GREs and TOEFLs (national tests) for
 them.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The rapid evolution of technology is leading to the creation of a
seamless web of surveillance across much of the world.  Powerful technologies
origionally developed for the military are being adopted by law enforcement and
civilian agencies and private companies to monitor entire populations. This has
been further fueled by the end of the Cold War and increasing demands for
greater bureaucratic efficiency. Existing laws and regulations have failed to
keep up with these developments.<p>
This one day conference will examine a range of advanced surveillance
technologies and their impact on privacy and other civil liberties. It will
explore the process of planning and implementation of the technologies, their
operating conditions, and the people and organizations respnsible for them. The
conference will also examine possible technical, regulatory and legal
responses. <p>
The conference will also address in detail the findings of Privacy
International's "Big Brother Incorporated" report which examined the
international trade in surveillance technology and the involvement of the arms
industry.<p>

<H1>Mondex and Anonymity</H1>
</center>

<!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4>

In September 1995, Privacy International Director General Simon Davies investigated Mondex's claims that their digital cash service was "anonymous". Davies determined that, contrary to Mondex's public statements, in fact that the system was not anonymous and that the bank and merchants counld find out the identity of the users. 
<P>
Davies filed a Fair Trading Act complaint against Mondex for falsely advertising the service as anonymous. In June 1996, the Fair Trading Office responded noting that: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>It appears the customer is identified to the trader, as in paragraph seven above and, ultimately, the bank, by the 300 previous transactions. Each of these will soon be superseded by further transactions and drop off the end of the
list. These can be monitored by the bank and could be used for marketing purposes. This is the audit trail and ultimately could be sold to business users for third party marketing. </BLOCKQUOTE>

The office also noted that Mondex changed its literature and no longer claims that it was anonymous. The Office declined to press the issue further stating the online press releases were not covered by the act..

<H2>PRIVACY INTERNATIONALS MONDEX COMPLAINT
IS UPHELD</H2>

<H2>ELECTRONIC CASH IS ANYTHING BUT
ANONYMOUS</H2>

<H3>June 21, 1996</H3>

</CENTER>


After a nine month investigation, government Trading
Standards authorities in Britain have confirmed that
Mondex electronic cash is not anonymous, as has
been consistently claimed by the company.
<P>


The investigation was sparked by a complaint last year
by Privacy International director Simon Davies, who
objected to the manner in which the cards had been
promoted.  Davies argued that the word anonymous,
used by Mondex to describe its product, was misleading
and incorrect.   He said Mondex transactions were
logged by the trader and were known to the bank.
<P>
In a letter of 21 June announcing the outcome of the
informal inquiry, Robert Gilham of the Environmental
Health and Trading Standards Department in Bromley,
South London,  confirmed the traders till chip retains
the last 300 transactions as card number, value and
date.
<P>
"It appears the customer is identified to the trader...and,
ultimately, the bank, by the 300 previous
transactions....These can be monitored by the bank and
could be used for marketing purposes.  This is the audit
trail and ultimately could be sold to business users for
third party marketing."
<P>
Gilham observed The potential exists for unauthorised
use of transaction information by banks, traders or third
parties but he conceded that no evidence was
available to confirm that this stage has been reached.
<P>
The Department has decided, in view of the embryonic
state of the Mondex trials, not to prosecute, but to
resolve the matter through negotiation and discussion.
<P>
Responding to the outcome, Simon Davies said, "I'm
disappointed that Mondex has escaped further action by
the Trading Standards authority, but I hope the outcome
of this inquiry motivates other projects in this field to be
more honest in the promotion of their product."
<P>
"During the course of this investigation it has become
clear that Mondex cards have more in common with
credit cards than cash.

<TITLE>Privacy International Mondex Complaint Letter</TITLE> 
<center><img align=bottom src="http://www.privacy.org/pi/PI.gif" hspace=4 vspace=4 height=85 width=85></center>


16 September 1995<p>

Customer Services, <br>
Bromley Council, Stockwell Close, <br>
Bromley  BR1 3UH<br>
<br>
Attention : Tom Dent<br><br>

Dear sir,<br><br>

I am writing to notify you of an apparent breach of the
Trade Descriptions Act, and to lodge a formal
complaint. Please forgive the length and detail of this
letter. The complaint involves a complex technical
project about which there is only limited public
information. For this reason I feel it is important that I
present a full background to the subject area.
<P>
I am making this complaint to Bromley Council
because I viewed the offending material in the
Bromley area.<P>

This complaint involves the activities of Mondex Ltd,
a partnership between the Midland and National
Westminster Banks.  Since June of this year, Mondex
has been engaged in a trial of smart cards which
are designed to replace cash.  The trial is being
conducted in Swindon.<P>

The Mondex cards (being given to Midland and
National Westminster bank customers)  can
electronically store the value of cash authorised from
a bank ATM machine or by way of specially adapted
payphones connected to the customers bank.<P>

Instead of handing over cash to a store, customers
hand over the card, which acts in place of cash. The
card is inserted into a machine which debits the
amount of the transaction.  Because it is a debit card
(that is, customers have already paid for the value of
cash contained in it)  no signature or authorisation is
needed. The relevant amount is electronically
deducted from the card.  Many big High Street
retailers, including Boots, Asda, Safeway, J
Sainsbury, WH Smith, BP and McDonald's are
participating in the scheme. Currently, six thousand
people are using the  cards in Swondon, and
Mondex hopes this will rise to as many as 40,000.<P>

<H3>Some background</H3>

I should explain at this point that a smart card is a
credit-card size device containing a microchip, which
can store and process considerable amounts of data.
Most smart cards can hold several A4 pages of data.
The smart card can independently process this data,
and present it in different forms according to
requirements. Information on the chip can be
locked with a PIN number, and protected through a
range of encryption methods. These cards have
been developed in various countries for health,
social welfare benefits, transport, and financial
transactions.<P>

The Mondex trial is being eagerly watched by banks
and governments around the world.  The common
view of these bodies is that cash is a costly,
cumbersome and messy commodity. It is insecure
and untraceable. UK banks estimate that they spend
2 billion a year on cash distribution, and the cost to
retailers has been put at 800 million. Banks want to
save money not only by taking cash out of the
system, but also by charging customers and retailers
for an alternative system that avoids the traditional
drawbacks. A cash smart card is one way of
achieving this.<P>

The Mondex experiment is widely seen as crucial to
the future of electronic cash worldwide. Mondex has
signed up Midland's sister company,
HongkongBank, as the first overseas partner.
HongkongBank has acquired the rights to franchise
Mondex in Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia,
Macau, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka,
Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia. Trevor Blackler,
NatWest's chief executive of group services, has
been reported as saying discussions are being
conducted with 30 banks in 15 countries around the
world.<P>

While the Mondex experiment is at the cutting edge,
other banks are not far behind. Barclays and Lloyds
are in partnership with Visa International to pioneer
an international system that may, in effect, create a
single international cash unit of currency.  The Visa
International project is co-operating with bank-led
groups in Belgium, France, Portugal, Spain, Taiwan
and the US. Like Mondex, it plans to create an
extensive network of shop-based card readers.<P>

The importance of this project, nationally and
internationally, cannot be easily overstated. The
concept of electronic cash is almost certain to take
hold throughout Europe, particularly in the lead-up to
a single unit of currency. In 1995, European
Commission premises across Europe are to act as
host to a trial of an electronic multi -currency
payment system similar to the one being pioneered
by Mondex.  The technology is known more
popularly in Europe as an electronic purse. Under
the EU's own research programme in Information
Technology, a seven-country consortium of partners
in industry and academia has developed the purse,
which can be loaded with money from the owner's
bank account, then used to meet expenses in ECU
and national currencies by down -loading payments
into compatible terminals in shops, pay-phones, toll
roads, public transport and so on.<P>

At the same time, a specialized working group
attached to the European Committee for
Standardization (CEN) is on the point of developing
a European standard that could open the door to
cross-border use of electronic cash. An international
standard has already been finalised for point-of-sale
machinery for the cards. Thirteen European
countries have been  involved since 1991 in the
effort.<P>

The mechanism of the Mondex system is complex.
Each card is linked to an existing bank account.  The
card can be topped up, or the security instructions
changed, by using any ATM or modified pay phone.
Although the card is a direct substitute for cash, it can
be made more secure than cash. The owner can
encode it with a PIN number which locks the cash
value, and thus makes the card useless for anyone
else.<P>

<H3>The complaint</H3>

Mondex has consistently promoted its product as
privacy friendly, anonymous, and cash-like. These
are important selling points of the Mondex product,
because many people value their financial privacy,
and would support a technology that offers secure
and anonymous transactions.   However, I dispute
the claims made by Mondex, and will set out below
evidence that I believe will show that Mondex has set
out intentionally to deceive the public. Transactions
using the cards are neither anonymous nor are they
privacy friendly.<P>

In the Mondex Home Page - an electronic
promotional advertisement located on the internet,
Mondex makes the following statement:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>     What about privacy?<p>

     In everyday use Mondex transactions are
     anonymous, just like cash.<p>

      However, if the card is lost, a unique 16-digit identity
     number stored on the chip, which will have been
     registered by a card-providing bank against the
     personal details of the customer, may be used in
     order to return the card to its rightful owner.
     Cards also contain a "purse narrative". The
     customer's narrative would contain the names of the
     retailers - letting them know where they have used
     their card.<p>

     Only a cardholder will have access to the statement
     entries on their card which detail transactions. A
     cardholder will be able to lock their card and prevent
     unauthorised access.<p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Here, Mondex has made the case for privacy, setting
out in very specific terms the way the data will be
restricted.  The statement Only a cardholder will
have access to the statement entries on their card
which detail transactions  sets out to reassure the
public that Big Brother will not be a party to the
system.<p>

The claim is an outright lie.  In late September I
interviewed the project manager of the Swindon
experiment (Rob Jameson) and was told without
equivocation that Mondex uses a full audit trail of all
transactions. Jameson told me all retailers have a
card linked record of all transactions which are
available to the bank.  This directly contradicts the
publicity.  Mondex, in fact, uses the same audit trail
systems as any other card system. This is, to my
knowledge, the first time Mondex has revealed this
dimension of its system.<p>

Mondex consistently makes its claim of being privacy
friendly.  Page 15 of the Mondex Media Pack (August
1994) states the cards are as anonymous as cash.
In defence of its tactics, Mondex might well argue
that the cards are transferable, and thus the audit
trail cannot technically link a transaction to an
identified individual in, say, the way a credit card
could (the credit card requires a signature). This
justification is largely irrelevant. I believe Mondex
has conducted research which shows that almost
one hundred per cent of transactions are conducted
by the owner of the card.<p>

I believe Mondex is in clear breach of the Trade
Descriptions Act.  It has willfully and intentionally set
out to mislead the public. I believe the case warrants
prosecution. Mondex must either cease describing
their product as anonymous and cash like, or it
must remove all transaction recording machinery at
point of sale.<p>

Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further
information.<p>

Yours sincerely<p>

Dear Mr Davies,
<p>


MONDEX ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER CARD<br>
TRADE DESCRIPTIONS ACT 1968
<p>
After some considerable time examining what may have
appeared a straightforward matter, I am now in a
position to let you know how the matter has been
resolved.
<p>
Having finally gained access to the internet and read the
information available relating to Mondex I believe that
the relative part of that information could be treated as
an advertisement.  I also noted that words had been
changed from the original entry which you sent to me. I
will return to both these matters later in this letter.
<p>
I took the opportunity to meet Mr Capelthorne of Mondex
International on 12 June to seek explanation of the
system, having had the chance to see the internet
statements. I understand the following to be the system
operation.
<p>
Loading a card shows on customers bank statements.
That is to say, there is no other paper record of the
transaction as would be the case in credit card
transactions having monthly statements.
<p>
The retailers transaction to pay in Mondex cash shows
on his bank statement but nothing ties the customer to
the electronic money used.
<p>
The transaction log on the card can be read by the
cardholders electronic wallet.  The previous ten
transactions are identified as amount, trader and date;
this includes personal transfers and load-up, which are
not identified.
<p>
The traders till chip retains the last 300 transactions as
card number, value and date.  The trader cannot trace
the customer as  the Personal Identification (PID)
Number is only traceable through the card issuing bank
and is not disclosed under the banks duty of privacy to
its customer.  The PID is required in order for the till to
read the card and conduct the transaction.
<p>
In addition, the customer uses a 4 digit Personal
Identification Number (PIN) to free the card for loading
from ATMs and to lock/unlock the card for access
authorisation. Lost cards can be read if not locked by the
card owner.  The card is not defaulted to lock when sent,
as it is of no use to anyone until given a PIN by the user.
The user must choose to lock the card, and must unlock
it for transactions to take place.  An unauthorisd user
can only use or read the card if the PIN is known or
discovered, otherwise, after a set number of attempts to
discover the PIN, the card locks up and is no use to
anyone.
<p>
It appears the customer is identified to the trader, as in
paragraph seven above and, ultimately, the bank, by the
300 previous transactions.  Each of these will soon be
superseded by further transactions and drop off the
end of the list.  These can be monitored by the bank and
could be used for marketing purposes.  This is the audit
trail and ultimately could be sold to business users for
third party marketing. I am assured this does not occur at
present.  I am assured that descriptions will be
appropriate and data protection issues addressed if this
avenue is pursued.
<p>
Mondex International has changed the word
anonymous to private as a description within the
internet promotion.  This word seems to have more
appropriate meanings than anonymous, reflecting the
limited access to information, equating with the privacy
of a (pocket) wallet where the information is not for third
party consumption, but is available to unauthorised
people.
<p>
The card system has checks and balances, which
means that the amount of information available to third
parties is protected or currently not available at all.
<p>
The potential exists for unauthorised use of transaction
information by banks, traders or third parties, but no
evidence is available that this stage has been reached.
Currently, no false trade description has been
demonstrated.  The POS (Point of Sale) material makes
no claim for privacy.  The only claim was made in a
press release and as explained previously, is not within
the scope of a trade description.
<p>
A privacy claim is made, via promotional material
(advertisements) on the Internet.  I do not believe this is
the issue which should be used to test whether the
material on the Internet is an advertisement.  More
correctly, the issue relates to a trial of the card, and the
pitfalls discovered should be corrected by negotiation
and discussion.
<p>
To this end I am making my colleagues in the City of
London Trading Standards aware of the complaint,
since the card company is based in their area.  I have
invited Mondex to discuss with them and concerns or
proposed descriptions.
<p>
Thank you for bringing this complex matter to my
attention and for your patience over an enquiry which
may at times have seemed to have become bogged
down in bureaucracy.
<p>
Yours sincerely
<p>
Robert Gilham <br>
Area Trading Standards Officer<P>

Burns Press Release
For immediate release:
Thursday, March 28, 1996

                      Burns Has "CODE" for E-Commerce

 Legislation Opens Internet for Commerce, Protects Intellectual Property


     WASHINGTON, D.C.   Montana Senator Conrad
Burns today announced the introduction of legislation designed
to promote electronic commerce on the Internet, protect
intellectual property rights and put American software
companies on a level playing field with their foreign
competitors.

     Dubbed the Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the
Digital Era, or "PRO-CODE," Act, the bill would end the
imposition of government-designed encryption (mathematical
codes used for computer security) standards and would promote
the use of commercial encryption. Current government
standards allow American software companies to export
products only with a level of encryption regarded as easily
defeated by "hackers." The effect has been to dampen the
growth of on-line commerce and to place American companies
at a competitive disadvantage with foreign firms not bound by
lower standards on the export of encrypted security.

     "Everything I do here in Washington, D.C., I do with the
interests of Montanans in mind," Burns said. "We live in a state
that, from northwest to southeast, spans the same distance as
from Washington, D.C., to Chicago. I can think of no better way
to make our wide-open spaces feel a lot smaller than by making
it easier to communicate and transact business over long
distances."

     The PRO-CODE Act restricts the U.S. Department of
Commerce from imposing government encryption standards that
were not: developed by the private sector, do not provide robust
security, require people to relinquish control of a decryption
key, do not have widespread commercial support and
acceptance, do not provide for the ability to securely interact
worldwide, and do not protect the privacy of users consistent
with constitutional protections. It also prohibits the department
from setting de facto encryption standards through the use of
export controls.

     In addition, the bill prohibits restrictions on the sale of
commercial encryption programs and products in interstate
commerce, prohibits mandatory key escrow (requiring that a
decryption key be placed in the hands of a third party), and
permitting the export of software and hardware if products with
comparable security is commercially available from a foreign
supplier.

     The Burns bill has strong bipartisan support and has
been referred to the Senate Commerce Committee, where Burns
chairs the Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space. He
announced his legislation via a phone call to the Computers,
Freedom, and Privacy conference at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in Cambridge, Mass.

     Burns earlier this month was the chief Senate co-sponsor of a bill
 sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont),
a member of the Judiciary Committee, that also addresses
encryption.

<b><H2>A Primer for Human Rights Groups on Wiretapping</H2></b><p>
<b></b><p>
October 1995<p>
<p>
David Banisar<p>
<A HREF="http://www.privacy.org/pi/">Washington Office, Privacy International</A> <p></CENTER>
<p>
<b>Introduction</b><p>
<p>

The explosion of telecommunications services has improved the ability for human
rights groups to disseminate information worldwide. New telephone, facsimile
and computer communications have created opportunities for human rights groups
to improve organizing and to promote human rights faster and at a lower cost
than ever before.  However, these new technologies can be monitored by
governments and other groups seeking to monitor the activities of human rights
advocates. For this reason, human rights advocates should be aware of  the
dangers and measures that can be taken to limit surveillance.<p>
	The scope of this paper is limited to the interception of oral and electronic
communications commonly referred to as wiretapping and other issues related to
telephone communications. It will also discuss methods to avoid surveillance.<a
href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a><p>
 <p>
<b>Why Should Groups be Concerned?</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	Wiretapping is conducted in nearly every country in the world and is
frequently abused. The US Department of State, in its annual <i>Country Reports
on Human Rights Practices for 1994</i>, reports widespread, illegal or
uncontrolled use of wiretaps by both government and private groups in over 70
countries.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[2]</a>  Human rights groups, reporters
and political opponents are the most common targets of surveillance by
government intelligence and law enforcement agencies and other non-governmental
groups. In some countries, such as Honduras and Paraguay, the state owned
telecommunications companies were active participants in helping the security
services monitor human rights advocates.  In other countries, multiple forms of
surveillance are used. For example, in 1991, wiretaps and hidden microphones
were found in the offices of the Mexican Human Rights Commission.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[3]</a> More recent press reports estimated that there are
200,000 illegal wiretaps in Mexico currently in place.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[4]</a> <p>
	 	These problems are not limited to developing countries.  In the US,
litigation conducted by the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that the FBI monitored computer
networks used by political and advocacy groups.  French counter-intelligence
agents wiretapped the telephones of prominent journalists and opposition party
leaders during the mid-1980s. There have been numerous cases in the United
Kingdom which revealed that the British intelligence services monitor social
activists, labor unions, and civil liberties groups.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[5]</a> <p>
	Thus, there is an obvious need for human rights groups to be concerned with
wiretapping: Governments often monitor human rights groups to discover what
they know, who their sources are, and what their future activities will be.
The lack of secure communications creates the threat of physical harm to many
people in the human rights field.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Who Can Do it and What are the Limitations?</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Most types of electronic communication can be intercepted without a high level
of expertise or  expensive equipment.  Surveillance equipment is not difficult
to construct and is available in many electronics stores. Many manufacturers
sell surveillance devices to any buyer, without restrictions.  Thus, groups
should be aware that both governments and private organizations may have the
capability to eavesdrop.<p>
	This does not mean that everyone should believe that they are always under
surveillance.   It is not practical for any government or group to wiretap all
telephones in a country and listen to every conversation simultaneously.
Wiretapping is a labor intensive operation and requires considerable resources
to conduct the taps, listen to, and transcribe the conversations. Because it is
necessary to have a human listen to the conversation, labor and equipment costs
create practical limits to surveillance. The East German secret police employed
10,000 people to conduct wiretaps and listen to conversations before the Berlin
Wall fell.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[6]</a> <p>
	New technologies, such as computerized voice recognition, that can automate
surveillance are being actively developed by Western (and presumably also by
other) governments. The <i>Ottawa Citizen </i>reported that the Canadian
Communications Security Establishment has spent over $1.1 million to "isolate
key words and phrases from the millions of signals the CSE monitors every day"
and  awarded contacts to develop systems to create a "speaker identification
system."<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[7]</a> There were also reports that the
US Government assisted the Columbian government in tracking down drug cartel
leaders by using voice recognition technologies on cellular phone calls. These
new technologies are not yet generally available to less wealthy countries or
local police forces.  	There may also be technical limitations on conducting a
large number of simultaneous taps.  Recently, former members of the Soviet KGB
disclosed that they only had the capability of wiretapping 1,000 phone lines in
Moscow and another 1,500 for the rest of Russia.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[8]</a> <p>
	Given this, it is not likely that every telephone can be monitored in a
particular city. However, it is possible that the public and private phones
nearest to the offices of human rights organizations or their staffs may be
also monitored.  In France, counter-intelligence officers illegally wiretapped
not only the telephones of several journalists but also the phones in bars and
restaurants that they frequented.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[9]</a><p>
   Thus, surveillance is generally limited to those wiretaps installed manually
and listened to by human agents. This is not an inconsequential threat. <p>
<p>
<b>Standard Telephones</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Standard telephone systems are very vulnerable to wiretaps. It does not
require a high level of skill or technology to intercept a voice communication.
There are many locations where a wiretap can be placed. For example,
microphones in many older telephones' handsets can be replaced with one that
can also transmit to a remote receiver.  Taps can also be placed at the
telephone boxes in the basements of buildings, on the lines outside the house,
or on the telephone pole junction boxes near the target of the surveillance. A
common technique used by police forces is to remotely monitor calls by having
lines run from a telephone company central office where the local switching
equipment is located to a monitoring station in a government office. <p>
	Many of these techniques are undetectable to the target, especially in newer
systems, where the system is run by computers.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[10]</a> In the US, legislation requiring that all
communications systems be designed with the ability to more easily intercept
communications was recently enacted at the behest of the law enforcement and
intelligence community. <a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[11]</a>This will have a
profound effect worldwide since the US is one of the largest manufacturers and
purchasers of telephone switching equipment worldwide.<p>
<p>
<b>Scrambling Voice Communications</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Technology is available to ensure that telephone conversations are not easily
monitored.  Secure phones, which use cryptography, a mathematical technique for
scrambling conversations, are commercially available from many different
companies including Motorola, TRW and AT&amp;T, but these devices may not
provide adequate protection. AT&amp;T recently introduced an telephone
attachment that connects to the handset cord and when used with a duplicate
device on the receiving device, scrambles conversations.  However, it uses a
specialized computer chip, known as the Clipper Chip,  for which the keys to
unscramble communications are also held the US Government in a system called
"key escrow."<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[12]</a> The U.S. Government has
been strongly pushing other governments to adopt the system for their
countries. If other countries also begin using similar systems, it is likely
that keys for users in that country will also reside with their governments.<p>
	Other devices use the US Data Encryption Standard (DES) or secret company
standards.  DES is considered by most security experts to be secure against
eavesdropping except against the most well financed opposition such as large
intelligence organizations.  Secret  standards may not be as secure because
they may have weaknesses that have not been publicly disclosed since there is
no open review of the algorithms. These devices are also very expensive,
costing around $US 2,000 each.<p>
	There is also the possibility that the devices are deliberately not secure.
The United State and some other countries have laws that require government
permission to use or export any device or software that contains encryption.
In the US, manufacturers are required to design their products that will be
exported so that the NSA may still monitor the conversations. Therefore, any
device that is sold by a US company overseas should not be considered safe for
protecting sensitive information.<p>
	These controls may be circumvented by purchasing devices designed in countries
such as Sweden or Switzerland, which do not have export control laws on
encryption.  However, these devices may have also been compromised by their
domestic intelligence agencies. Recently, there were numerous news reports
across Europe that Crypto AG, a company which sells secure phone and fax
devices, is in reality controlled by German intelligence and has deliberately
sold weakened encryption devices. There are also international information
sharing agreements -- such as the Quadripartite Agreement -- between
intelligence agencies that could result in the weakening of encryption.<a
href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[13]</a><p>
	A recent advance is the development of computer based scrambling that will
allow two PC (or clone) owners to talk to each other through their computers
over modems or the Internet to scramble their conversations. Several freely
available programs are currently under development.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[14]</a> These programs are generally available for free and
may be ideal for human rights groups to use. However, they may also require
more powerful computers to use (at least a 386 or faster machine for the PC,
68030 or greater for the Mac) and high speed modems (14.4K or faster) to have
understandable speech.<p>
<p>
<b>Wireless Communications</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Wireless telephones are becoming more and more popular in western countries.
In the US alone, over 40 million cordless phones are in use. There are also
millions of cellular telephones in use. In developing countries, wireless
communications such as cellular and satellite-based telephones are also popular
as a means to avoid laying new telephone lines in areas that were previously
undeveloped. All of these devices are easily interceptable and should not be
used by anyone who is discussing sensitive information.	<p>
	Cordless telephone communications are especially easy to intercept.  Many of
the older models broadcast just above the top range of the AM radio band and
conversations can be easily overheard with any AM radio. Newer models operate
in the 49 MHz range and can be intercepted with an inexpensive radio scanner
purchased at most electronics stores for under $US 100.00. The range of
interception can extend to nearly one mile.<p>
	 Several phone manufacturers now offer "privacy secure" cordless phones that
they claim ensure the privacy of phone calls. However, most of these phone use
a simple fifty year old technique known as  "frequency inversion"  that inverts
the sound waves to limit eavesdropping.  This system provides minimal security
at best.<p>
	New digital-based cordless phones may provide a slightly greater level of
protection from the common listener, but most of these phones lack any form of
sophisticated scrambling that would protect eavesdropping by government
agencies or wealthy opponents. In addition, it is likely that new scanners will
soon be available commercially that will be able to listen in on these
conversations.<p>
	Cellular phones have the same problems as cordless. They also broadcast over
airwaves like a radio.  Inexpensive scanners are also available to intercept
conversations. A US law requires that newer scanners limit eavesdropping on
certain frequencies but kits are readily available from electronic stores and
mail order companies to remove those protections.  In addition, some cellular
phones can be programmed to act as scanners to intercept other calls. There is
also equipment available to law enforcement, which can track and monitor
cellular conversations as they move around a city.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[15]</a><p>
	New cellular phones use a digital system which will be more difficult to
intercept and also provide for clearer conversations.  It is also easier to
secure these telephones from eavesdropping.  However, intelligence agencies in
the United States and other countries have attempted to restrict the use of
improved scrambling technology. In Pakistan, the government shut down the
cellular phone company until it provided equipment to allow easy over-the
air-interception.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn0">[16]</a> In the US, the cellular
telephone industry association agreed to adopt a weakened scrambling standard
after pressure from the National Security Agency. Experts who have seen the
standard state that the standard provides little or no protection against
eavesdropping. Intelligence agencies in other countries have also lobbied to
limit the security features in GSM - the international standard for digital
cellular phones. In Australia, the federal government rejected the request of
the law enforcement agencies and ordered the operator of a new digital cellular
system to commence operation without the capability to intercept the over the
air portion of the conversation.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn1">[17]</a><p>
	Cellular phones can also provide information on the location of an individual
to within a few blocks, depending on the system. When a cellular telephone is
turned on, it regularly broadcasts its location to the local transmitters so
that they can direct calls to the correct location. This information can be
used to locate the position of a cellular phone and may also be used to track
its location its owner moves around.<p>
	A related technology, the wireless pager, can also be easily intercepted.
Pagers receive signals over the airways with no scrambling. Numerous programs
are available for computers that can monitor the entire frequency spectrum that
pagers operate on and automatically retain every message that is sent.<p>
<p>
<b>Facsimile (fax) Machines</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	It is also possible to intercept facsimile transmissions.  A fax machine is
essentially an inexpensive computer system that uses a well known standard for
sending and receiving files.  Most experts describe intercepting faxes as "very
easy."<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn2">[18]</a> Commercial devices are widely
available that automatically intercept faxes. In New York City, fax intercept
machines were used as far back as 1990 by local police. <a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn2">[19]</a> <i>Defense News </i>reports that numerous countries
sell these devices including the United States, the UK, the Czech Republic, and
Israel and that the "many countries are eyeing low-cost systems...also to
intercept political and economic-related information...." It is also possible
to intercept faxes using a computer with specialized software and a fax modem.
With the widespread use of Digital Audio Tape (DAT), it may also become easier
to record a fax transmission and replay it back into a machine with minimum
effort.  Thus, fax machines should be considered as insecure as telephones.<p>
	There are also fax machines available that provide scrambling to prevent
interception.  These machines usually cost around $US 3,000 and are available
worldwide.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn2">[20]</a>  Like secure telephones, fax
machines from the United States must have a weakened encryption scheme to allow
for their export.  Companies in Sweden, Switzerland, and other European
countries claim their machines are not limited because they have no export
laws.  An expert on encryption should be consulted before purchasing these
devices to ensure their security.<p>
	It may also be illegal to use such devices.  It has been reported that some
countries, such as Singapore and China limit the use of encryption without
providing the keys to the government.  In China, the use of fax machines
without a license is prohibited.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Telephone Transaction Information</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	Another area of concern is the transactional information created when a
telephone call is placed. <p>
In most countries, when a call is placed, the number of the called party is
recorded in the telephone company's computers. This can provide critical
information on confidential sources and others. In the US, these records are
widely used by law enforcement against reporters to locate leaks of
information, and monitor environmentalists and others.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn2">[21]</a><b> </b>In the former USSR, human rights activist
Anatole Sharansky reported that the authorities regularly obtained his overseas
billing records to keep track of  who he had spoken to.<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn2">[22]</a><b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Computer Communications</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Computer based communications is the newest and most useful tool for human
rights advocates.  It provides fast and inexpensive communications to nearly
every country in the world. Electronic mail can be used quite effectively to
communicate and distribute information worldwide at low cost. It  is also
possible to create private mailing lists or post information on public
electronic conferences such as Peacenet or the USENET newsgroups. <p>
	Eavesdropping of computer communications is not difficult unless measures are
taken to increase security. High speed modem communications (14.4K, 28.8k) are
more technically difficult but can still be intercepted by law enforcement in
the US. Low speed modem communications (1200,2400) are fairly easy to
intercept.<p>
	Once connected to an international network like Internet, new problems arise.
Messages pass through numerous machines on the way to their destination.
Currently, sending electronic mail is the equivalent of sending a typewritten
postcard in the mail. It theoretically can be read by anyone in the computer
link between the author and the recipient and there is also no method to
conclusively verify the identity of the message originator.<p>
	Encryption can also be used to protect these communications. Many human rights
groups are already encrypting their messages. Groups in Central America,
Ethiopia and Burma use encryption to protect their communications and files.<a
href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn2">[23]</a> It was also reported that the African
National Congress developed and used an encrypted e-mail network for years
without it being compromised by the security services of South Africa.<a
href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn2">[24]</a><p>
	Encryption can be used to protect the messages and to verify the identity of
the sending party. Unlike other communications technologies, encryption for
computers is widely available for free or at minimal cost.  It is also easy to
use.  Many commercial software packages such as Lotus Notes and the planned
future versions of the Microsoft and Apple Computer operating systems will have
built-in encryption, although the encryption in these products have been
weakened to allow for export.  <p>
	Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)<a href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn3">[25]</a> by Phil
Zimmermann, an American software engineer and human rights activist is commonly
used by human rights groups worldwide. It is available for most  computers<a
href="Bug_Off_fn.html#fn3">[26]</a> and can be easily configured to work in
several different languages, including Spanish, French and German.  The program
is small and can work on nearly all laptop and personal computers, along with
larger systems.<p>
	PGP uses "public key" encryption.  Each user of PGP creates two keys, a public
key and a secret key.  The user then gives the public key to whomever they wish
to correspond with and can even publish it publicly like a phone number. The
secret key is kept in a safe place -usually with the PGP program -  and
protected by a password.  The public key is used by other people to encrypt
messages that they send to the secret key holder and only that person can
unscramble the messages. Thus, public key cryptography avoids the need to meet
in person or to carry codebooks to safely exchange keys and messages.<p>
	To use PGP, a person writes out a message using a word processor, runs PGP to
scramble the message with the recipient's key, then sends the scrambled file as
a mail message instead of the original message.  The receiver runs PGP to
covert it back to a readable form.  The process only takes an additional minute
or two, depending on the length of the message and the processor speed of the
computer.  For some computer systems, programs have been written to make it an
automatic function of electronic mail.<p>
	Another feature that PGP and other public key systems can provide is "Digital
Signatures," which ensure the identity of the sender of the message in the same
way that a normal signature at the bottom of a letter usually verifies that a
letter is from a known corespondent.  Signatures are useful when an electronic
message is sent to ensure that it was not modified or falsely created by
someone else.  Thus, readers of notices from groups which send  out electronic
alerts, such as Amnesty International, Americas Watch, Helsinki Watch and the
Tibetan Government-in Exile, can ensure that the alerts have not been altered
by people wishing to disrupt the group's activities. <p>
	PGP can also be used to protect files on a computer. It can prevent the
accessing of  electronically stored papers or correspondence in case there is a
physical break-in and the computer is taken. Many groups in Central America use
it to protect their databases of rights abuses. <p>
 	Another useful program to ensure that IBM PC computers are not accessible
without a password is Secure File System (SFS) by Peter Gutman. SFS is a
program which sits between the disk drive and the operating system,
transparently encrypting all data as it is written to disk and decrypting it
again as it is read from disk.  To the user, it appears - apart from a slight
slowdown due to the encryption - as a normal disk drive. In order to access an
encrypted drive, it must be first mounted by entering the decryption password.
The drive can later be unmounted with a user-defined key combination, after a
period of inactivity, or when the machine is reset or turned off.<p>
	Encrypted disks can be converted back to normal disks, or have their contents
quickly and efficiently destroyed.  The software includes various stealth
features to minimize the possibility of other programs monitoring or altering
its operation. <p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	New technologies offer new opportunities for human rights advocates.
These same technologies also present opportunities for enhanced eavesdropping
by those opposed to the groups' activities.  <p>
	Wiretapping of human rights groups is not uncommon. However,  there are
limits, both technical and labor related, to the number of taps that are in
effect at one time. It is impracticable for every phone in a city to be
monitored simultaneously. Nonetheless, human rights organizations may want to
take precautions. There are methods available to prevent eavesdropping and care
must be taken to ensure that the devices purchased actually provide an adequate
level of protection.<p>

Encryption Items Transferred From the U.S. Munitions List to the
Commerce Control List
AGENCY: Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce.
ACTION: Interim rule.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This interim rule amends the Export Administration Regulations
(EAR) by exercising jurisdiction over, and imposing new combined
national security and foreign policy controls on, certain encryption
items that were on the United States Munitions List,

[[Page 68573]]

consistent with Executive Order 13026 and pursuant to the Presidential
Memorandum of that date, both issued by President Clinton on November
15, 1996.

    On October 1, 1996, the Administration announced a plan to make it
easier for Americans to use stronger encryption products to protect
their privacy, intellectual property and other valuable information.
The plan envisions a worldwide key management infrastructure with the
use of key escrow and key recovery encryption items to promote
electronic commerce and secure communications while protecting national
security and public safety. To provide for a transition period for the
development of this key management infrastructure, this rule permits
the export and reexport of 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength
encryption items under the authority of a License Exception, if an
exporter makes satisfactory commitments to build and/or market
recoverable encryption items and to help build the supporting
international infrastructure. This policy will apply to hardware and
software.

DATES: Effective Date: This rule is effective December 30, 1996.
    Comment Date: February 13, 1997.

ADDRESSES: Written comments (six copies) should be sent to: Nancy
Crowe, Regulatory Policy Division, Bureau of Export Administration,
Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Room
2705, Washington, D.C. 20230.

Trade and Foreign Policy Controls, Telephone: (202) 482-0092.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    Following upon the Administration's October 1 announcement, on
November 15, 1996, the President issued the Memorandum directing that
all encryption items controlled on the U.S. Munitions List, except
those specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted, or
modified for military applications, be transferred to the Commerce
Control List. The Memorandum and Executive Order 13026 (November 15,
1996, 61 FR 58767) also set forth certain additional provisions with
respect to controls on such encryption items to be imposed by the
Department of Commerce. The Executive Order also provides for
appropriate controls on the export and foreign dissemination of
encryption items controlled on the U.S. Munitions List that are placed
on the Commerce Control List. In issuing the Memorandum the President
stated:


    Encryption products, when used outside the United States, can
jeopardize our foreign policy and national security interests.
Moreover, such products, when used by international criminal
organizations, can threaten the safety of U.S. citizens here and
abroad, as well as the safety of the citizens of other countries.
The exportation of encryption products must be controlled to further
U.S. foreign policy objectives, and promote our national security,
including the protection of the safety of U.S. citizens abroad.


    This initiative will support the growth of electronic commerce;
increase the security of the global information infrastructure; protect
privacy, intellectual property and other valuable information; and
sustain the economic competitiveness of U.S. encryption product
manufacturers during the transition to a key management infrastructure.
Under this initiative, non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit
key length DES or equivalent strength will be permitted for export and
reexport after a one-time review of the strength of the item and if the
exporter makes satisfactory commitments to build and/or market
recoverable encryption items, to support an international key
management infrastructure. This policy will apply to hardware and
software and will last through December 31, 1998.

    The initiative addresses important foreign policy and national
security concerns identified by the President. Export controls on
cryptographic items are essential to controlling the spread abroad of
powerful encryption products which could be harmful to critical U.S.
national security, foreign policy and law enforcement interests. This
initiative will preserve such controls and foster the development of a
key management infrastructure necessary to protect important national
security, foreign policy and law enforcement concerns.

    Encryption software can be used to maintain the secrecy of
information, and thereby may be used by persons abroad to harm national
security, foreign policy and law enforcement interests. As the
President indicated in E.O. 13026 and in his Memorandum of November 15,
1996, export of encryption software, like export of encryption
hardware, is controlled because of this functional capacity to encrypt
information on a computer system, and not because of any informational
or theoretical value that such software may reflect, contain, or
represent, or that its export may convey to others abroad. For this
reason, export controls on encryption software are distinguished from
other software regulated under the EAR.

    The government recognizes that several factors, including the
development of common international encryption policies, the need for
an international key recovery infrastructure, and technological change,
will influence market development in key recovery products. At the same
time, the government is committed to a two-year transition period. The
government will continually evaluate progress towards key recovery
throughout and beyond the two-year period and will tailor the
implementation of its policies in consultation with the public.

    This interim rule implements the Administration's policy on
encryption exports and reexports. This rule amends the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR) by imposing national security and
foreign policy controls (``EI'' for Encryption Items) on certain
information security systems and equipment, cryptographic devices,
software and components specifically designed or modified therefor, and
related technology (``encryption items'). ``Encryption items'' subject
to the EAR do not include encryption items specifically designed,
developed, configured, adapted or modified for military applications
(including command, control and intelligence applications). Such items
remain on the U.S. Munitions List, and continue to be controlled by the
Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls. EI controls
apply to encryption software transferred from the U.S. Munitions List
to the Commerce Control List consistent with E.O. 13026 of November 15,
1996 (61 FR 58767) and pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of the
same date.

    This interim rule also amends the Export Administration Regulations
by requiring a license for exports and reexports to all destinations,
except Canada, of certain encryption items controlled for EI reasons.
Except as otherwise noted, applications will be reviewed on a case-by-
case basis by BXA in conjunction with other agencies to determine
whether the export or reexport is consistent with U.S. national
security and foreign policy interests. Exporters should allow 40 days
for the processing of licenses, consistent with E.O. 12981. The
licensing policy is as follows:

    (1) Certain mass-market encryption software. Certain encryption
software that was transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the
Commerce Control List consistent with E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996
(61 FR 58767) and

[[Page 68574]]

pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of that date may be released
from ``EI'' controls and thereby made eligible for mass market
treatment after a one-time BXA review. To determine eligibility for
mass market treatment, exporters must submit a classification request
to BXA. 40-bit mass market encryption software may be eligible for a 7-
day review process, and company proprietary software may be eligible
for 15-day processing. See new Supplement No. 6 to part 742 and
Sec. 748.3(b)(3) for additional information. Note that the one-time
review is for a determination to release encryption software in object
code only. Exporters requesting release of the source code should refer
to paragraph (b)(3)(v)(E) of Supplement No. 6 to part 742. If, after a
one-time review, BXA determines that the software is released from EI
controls, such software is eligible for all provisions of the EAR
applicable to other software, such as License Exception TSU for mass-
market software. If BXA determines that the software is not released
from EI controls, a license is required for export and reexport to all
destinations, except Canada, and license applications will be
considered on a case-by-case basis.

    (2) Key Escrow, Key Recovery and Recoverable encryption software
and commodities. Recovery encryption software and equipment controlled
for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 or under ECCN 5A002, including
encryption equipment designed or modified to use recovery encryption
software, may be made eligible for License Exception KMI after a one-
time BXA review. License Exception KMI is available for all
destinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria and
Sudan. To determine eligibility, exporters must submit a classification
request to BXA. Requests for one-time review of key escrow and key
recovery encryption products will receive favorable consideration
provided that, prior to the export or reexport, a key recovery agent
satisfactory to BXA has been identified (refer to new Supplement No. 5
to part 742) and security policies for safeguarding the key(s) or other
material/information required to decrypt ciphertext as described in
Supplement No. 5 to part 742 are established to the satisfaction of BXA
and are maintained after export or reexport as required by the EAR. If
the exporter or reexporter intends to be the key recovery agent, then
the exporter or reexporter must meet all of the requirements of a key
recovery agent identified in Supplement No. 5 to part 742. In addition,
the key escrow or key recovery system must meet the criteria identified
in Supplement No. 4 to part 742. Note that eligibility is dependent on
continued fulfilment of the requirements of a key recovery agent
identified in Supplement No. 5 to part 742. Since the establishment of
a key management infrastructure and key recovery agents may take some
time, BXA will, while the infrastructure is being built, consider
exports of key recovery encryption products which facilitate
establishment of the key management infrastructure before a key
recovery agent is named, consistent with national security and foreign
policy. When BXA approves such cases, exporters of products described
in Supplement No. 4 to part 742 are required to furnish the name of an
agent by December 31, 1998. Requests for one-time review of recoverable
products which allow government officials to obtain, under proper legal
authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the user, the
plaintext of the encrypted data and communications will also receive
favorable consideration.

    (3) Non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or
equivalent strength supported by a satisfactory business and marketing
plan for exporting recoverable items and services. Manufacturers of
non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent
strength will be permitted to export and reexport under the authority
of License Exception KMI, provided that the requirements and conditions
of the License Exception are met. Exporters must submit a
classification request for an initial BXA review of the item and a
satisfactory business and marketing plan that explains in detail the
steps the applicant will take during the two-year transition period
beginning January 1, 1997 to develop, produce, and/or market encryption
items and services with recoverable features. Producers would commit to
produce key recovery products. Others would commit to incorporate such
products into their own products or services. Plans will be evaluated
in consideration of good faith efforts by the exporter to promote key
recovery products and infrastructure. Such efforts can include: the
scale of key recovery research and development, product development,
and marketing plans; significant steps to reflect potential customer
demand for key recovery products in the firm's encryption-related
business; and how soon a key recovery agent will be identified. Note
that BXA will accept requests for classification of non-recoverable
encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength
under this paragraph from distributors, re-sellers, integrators, and
other entities that are not manufacturers of the encryption items. The
use of License Exception KMI is not automatic; eligibility must be
renewed every six months. Renewal after each six-month period will
depend on the applicant's adherence to explicit benchmarks and
milestones as set forth in the plan approved with the initial
classification request and amendments as approved by BXA. This
relaxation of controls and use of License Exception KMI will last
through December 31, 1998. The plan submitted with classification
requests for the export of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-
bit key length DES or equivalent strength must include the elements in
new Supplement No. 7 to part 742. Note that distributors, re-sellers,
integrators, and other entities that are not manufacturers of the
encryption items are permitted to use License Exception KMI for exports
and reexports of such items only in instances where a classification
has been granted to the manufacturer of the encryption items. The
authority to so export or reexport will be for a time period ending on
the same day the producer's authority to export or reexport ends.

    Exporters authorized to export 56-bit DES or equivalent strength
non-key recovery products in exchange for commitments to key recovery
will be allowed to service and support the customers of those products
during and after the two-year period. Support and service includes
maintenance or replacement of products to correct defects or maintain
existing functionality. It also includes upgrades that do not increase
the strength of the encryption in the product.

    Exporters authorized to export 56-bit DES or equivalent strength
non-key recovery products during the interim period may also export
under a license additional quantities of those 56-bit DES or equivalent
strength non-key recovery products after the two-year period to
existing customers. Such sales may be made to the customers of any
exporter that was authorized to export such products in exchange for
key recovery commitments during the two-year period. The additional
quantities sold may not be disproportionate to the customer's embedded
base.

    (4) All other encryption items--(i) Encryption licensing
arrangement. This is intended to continue without change the regulatory
treatment of the distribution and warehouse arrangements currently
permitted under

[[Page 68575]]

the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Applicants may submit
license applications for exports and reexports of certain encryption
commodities and software in unlimited quantities for all destinations
except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan.
Applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Encryption
licensing arrangements may be approved with extended validity periods
specified by the applicant in block #24 on Form BXA-748P. In addition,
the applicant must specify the sales territory and classes of end-
users. Such licenses may require the license holder to report to BXA
certain information such as item description, quantity, value, and end-
user name and address.

    (ii) Applications for encryption items not authorized under an
encryption licensing arrangement. Applications for the export and
reexport of all other encryption items will be considered on a case-by-
case basis.

    (5) Applications for encryption technology. Applications for the
export and reexport of encryption technology will be considered on a
case-by-case basis.

    Note that all ``EI'' encryption items are not subject to any
mandatory foreign availability procedures of the EAA or the EAR. In
section 1(a) of Executive Order 13026, the President states:


    I have determined that the export of encryption products
described in this section may harm national security and foreign
policy interests even where comparable products are or appear to be
available from sources outside the United States, and that facts and
questions concerning the foreign availability of such encryption
products cannot be subject to public disclosure or judicial review
without revealing or implicating classified information that could
harm United States national security and foreign policy interests.
Accordingly, section 4(c) and 6(h)(2)-(4) of the Export
Administration Act of 1979 (``the EAA'') * * *, all other analogous
provisions of the EAA relating to foreign availability, and the
regulations in the EAR relating to such EAA provisions, shall not be
applicable with respect to export controls on such encryption
products.


    This interim rule amends part 768, Foreign Availability, to make
clear that the provisions of that part do not apply to encryption items
transferred to the Commerce Control List.

    This interim rule also amends part 734 to exclude encryption items
transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List
consistent with E.O. 13026 (61 FR 58767, November 15, 1996) and
pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of that date from the de
minimis provisions for items exported from abroad. This rule also
amends part 734 of the EAR to reflect that encryption software
controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 that has been transferred to
the Department of Commerce from the Department of State by Presidential
Memorandum will be subject to the EAR even when publicly available. A
printed book or other printed material setting forth encryption source
code is not itself subject to the EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(2)). However,
notwithstanding Sec. 734.3(b)(2), encryption source code in electronic
form or media (e.g., computer diskette or CD ROM) remains subject to
the EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(3)). The administration continues to review
whether and to what extent scannable encryption source or object code
in printed form should be subject to the EAR and reserves the option to
impose export controls on such software for national security and
foreign policy reasons. Note that there is a new definition of ``export
of encryption source code and object code software'' (see
Sec. 734.2(b)(9)).

    This rule creates a new License Exception KMI for exports of
certain encryption software and equipment. This rule also amends part
740 and Supplement No. 2 to part 774 to reflect that encryption
software will not be eligible for ``mass market'' treatment under the
General Software Note or for export as beta-test software under License
Exception BETA unless released from EI controls through a one-time BXA
review (refer to new Supplement No. 6 to part 742). Encryption items
transferred from the USML to the CCL prior to November 15, 1996 are not
controlled for EI reasons. Note that License Exception TMP is available
for temporary exports and reexports of encryption items except under
the provisions for beta-test software. License Exceptions TMP and BAG
effectively replace the Department of State's personal use exemption.
Software and technology that was controlled by the Department of
Commerce prior to December 30, 1996 are not affected by this rule and
will continue to be eligible for the publicly available treatment.
Software controlled by the Department of Commerce prior to December 30,
1996 will continue to be eligible for mass market treatment under the
General Software Note, and License Exception TSU for mass-market
software.

    For purposes of this rule, ``recovery encryption products'' refers
to encryption products (including software) that allow government
officials to obtain under proper legal authority and without the
cooperation or knowledge of the user, the plaintext of encrypted data
and communications. Such products fulfill the objectives of the
Administration's encryption policy. Other approaches to access and
recovery may be defined in the future.

    This interim rule also amends part 742 to reflect the new combined
national security and foreign policy controls imposed by this rule, and
adds a new Supplement No. 4 titled ``Key Escrow or Key Recovery
Products Criteria'' that includes product criteria, a new Supplement
No. 5 titled ``Key Escrow or Key Recovery Agent Criteria, Security
Policies, and Key Escrow or Key Recovery Procedures'' that includes
interim requirements for key recovery agents, a new Supplement No. 6
titled ``Guidelines for Submitting a Classification Request for a Mass
Market Software Product that contains Encryption'' that includes the
criteria for the one-time review of classification requests for release
of certain encryption software from EI controls, and a new Supplement
No. 7 titled ``Review Criteria for Exporter Key Escrow or Key Recovery
Development Plans.''

    This interim rule also amends part 744 to add a general prohibition
in Sec. 744.9 with respect to technical assistance in the development
or manufacture abroad of encryption commodities and software controlled
for EI reasons and makes conforming changes throughout the EAR.

    This interim rule makes conforming changes in part 748 for
classification requests, amends part 750 of the EAR to reflect the
Department of Justice role in the review of encryption license
applications, adds new definitions to part 772, and amends the Commerce
Control List (Supplement No. 1 to part 774) by adding new EI controls
under ECCNs 5A002, 5D002, and 5E002 for commodities, software and
technology that are placed under Commerce Department jurisdiction,
consistent with E.O. 13026, by Presidential Memorandum.

    In certain cases, semiannual reporting requirements on quantities
shipped and country of destination will be imposed on exporters, in
order to allow the United States to fulfill the reporting requirements
of its international obligations, such as the Wassenaar Arrangement.

    The scope of controls on the release to foreign nationals of
technology and software subject to the EAR may be amended in a separate
Federal Register Notice.

    This rule involves no new curtailment of exports, because the
transfer or removal of items from the United States Munitions List to
the CCL maintains a continuity of controls. Therefore, the

[[Page 68576]]

provisions regarding the impact of new controls do not apply, and
contract sanctity also does not apply to this imposition of controls.

    U.S. persons holding valid USML licenses and other approvals issued
by the Department of State prior to December 30, 1996 may ship
remaining balances authorized by such licenses or approvals under the
authority of the EAR by filing Shippers Export Declarations (SEDs) with
District Directors of Customs, citing this Federal Register Notice and
the State Department license number. Such shipments shall be in
accordance with the terms and conditions, including the expiration
date, existing at the time of issuance of the State license. Any
reports required for distribution and other types of agreements
previously authorized by the Department of State, valid at the time of
this publication, should be henceforth submitted to the Department of
Commerce. Actions pending at the Department of State on December 30,
1996, including pending license applications, must be refiled with the
Department of Commerce. Export violations, including the terms and
conditions of export, shall hereafter constitute a violation of the
EAR.

    Consistent with the provisions of section 6 of the Export
Administration Act, a foreign policy report was submitted to Congress
on December 24, 1996, notifying the Congress of the Department's
intention to impose controls on certain information security systems
and equipment, cryptographic devices, software and components
specifically designed or modified therefor, and related technology that
will be controlled on the CCL and that will be subject to new control
procedures.

    Although the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired on August 20,
1994, the President invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers
Act and continued in effect, to the extent permitted by law, the
provisions of the EAA and the EAR in Executive Order 12924 of August
19, 1994, notice of August 15, 1995 (60 FR 42767), and notice of August
14, 1996 (60 FR 42527).

Rulemaking Requirements


    1. This interim rule has been determined to be significant for
purposes of E.O. 12866. A cost benefit analysis has been prepared and
is available upon request by contacting James A. Lewis at (202) 482-
0092.

    2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person is
required to respond to, nor shall any person be subject to a penalty
for failure to comply with a collection of information, subject to the
requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), unless that
collection of information displays a currently valid OMB Control
Number. This rule involves collections of information subject to the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). These
collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget
under control numbers 0694-0048 and 0694-0088. This rule also contains
a new collection-of-information requirement subject to the PRA that has
received emergency approval under OMB control number 0694-0104. The new
information requirement and estimated public burden hours include:
marketing plans (40 hours each); semiannual progress reports (8 hours
each); safeguard procedures (4 hours); recordkeeping (2 hours); and
annual reports (4 hours). These estimates include the time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and
maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the
collections of information. Send comments regarding these burden
estimates or any other aspect of these collections of information,
including suggestions for reducing the burden, to OMB Desk Officer, New
Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503.

    3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications
sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under
Executive Order 12612.

    4. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.
553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for
public participation, and a delay in effective date, are inapplicable
because this regulation involves a military and foreign affairs
function of the United States (Sec. 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)). Further, no
other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an
opportunity for public comment be given for this interim rule. Because
a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment
are not required to be given for this rule under 5 U.S.C. or by any
other law, the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.
601 et seq.) are not applicable.

    However, because of the importance of the issues raised by these
regulations, this rule is issued in interim form and comments will be
considered in the development of final regulations. Accordingly, the
Department encourages interested persons who wish to comment to do so
at the earliest possible time to permit the fullest consideration of
their views.

    The period for submission of comments will close February 13, 1997.
The Department will consider all comments received before the close of
the comment period in developing final regulations. Comments received
after the end of the comment period will be considered if possible, but
their consideration cannot be assured. The Department will not accept
public comments accompanied by a request that a part or all of the
material be treated confidentially because of its business proprietary
nature or for any other reason. The Department will return such
comments and materials to the person submitting the comments and will
not consider them in the development of final regulations. All public
comments on these regulations will be a matter of public record and
will be available for public inspection and copying. In the interest of
accuracy and completeness, the Department requires comments in written
form.

    Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which will
also be a matter of public record and will be available for public
review and copying. Communications from agencies of the United States
Government or foreign governments will not be made available for public
inspection.

    The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained
in the Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Records
Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and
Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230. Records in this
facility, including written public comments and memoranda summarizing
the substance of oral communications, may be inspected and copied in
accordance with regulations published in Part 4 of Title 15 of the Code
of Federal Regulations. Information about the inspection and copying of
records at the facility may be obtained from Margaret Cornejo, Bureau
of Export Administration Freedom of Information Officer, at the above
address or by calling (202) 482-5653.

    This rule has been determined to be a major rule as defined in 5
U.S.C. Sec. 804(2) for purposes of Congressional review under 5 U.S.C.
ch. 8. Notwithstanding 5 U.S.C. Sec. 801(a)(3), this rule is effective
December 30, 1996 pursuant to authority at 5 U.S.C. Sec. 808(2) as
there is good cause to waive the requirement to provide notice and
public procedure thereon. This action implements an Administration
initiative that is intended to protect the national security and
foreign policy interests of the United States and streamlines export
controls for encryption items. Therefore,

[[Page 68577]]

notice and public procedure that would delay implementation of this
rule is contrary to the public interest.

software.) ``Export'' of technology or software, excluding encryption
software subject to ``EI'' controls, includes:
* * * * *

    (9) Export of encryption source code and object code software. (i)
For purposes of the EAR, the export of encryption source code and
object code software means:

    (A) An actual shipment, transfer, or transmission out of the United
States (see also paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section); or

    (B) A transfer of such software in the United States to an embassy
or affiliate of a foreign country.

    (ii) The export of encryption source code and object code software
controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control List
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) includes downloading, or
causing the downloading of, such software to locations (including
electronic bulletin boards, Internet file transfer protocol, and World
Wide Web sites) outside the U.S., or making such software available for
transfer outside the United States, over wire, cable, radio,
electromagnetic, photooptical, photoelectric or other comparable
communications facilities accessible to persons outside the United
States, including transfers from electronic bulletin boards, Internet
file transfer protocol and World Wide Web sites, unless the person
making the software available takes precautions adequate to prevent
unauthorized transfer of such code outside the United States. Such
precautions shall include:

    (A) Ensuring that the facility from which the software is available
controls the access to and transfers of such software through such
measures as:

    (1) The access control system, either through automated means or
human intervention, checks the address of every system requesting or
receiving a transfer and verifies that such systems are located within
the United States;

    (2) The access control system, provides every requesting or
receiving party with notice that the transfer includes or would include
cryptographic software subject to export controls under the Export
Administration Act, and that anyone receiving such a transfer cannot
export the software without a license; and

    (3) Every party requesting or receiving a transfer of such software
must acknowledge affirmatively that he or she understands that the
cryptographic software is subject to export controls under the Export
Administration Act and that anyone receiving the transfer cannot export
the software without a license; or

    (B) Taking other precautions, approved in writing by the Bureau of
Export Administration, to prevent transfer of such software outside the
U.S. without a license.

    12. Section 734.3 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(3) and by

PART 742--[AMENDED]


    25. Part 742 is amended by revising Sec. 742.15 to read as follows:

Sec. 742.15  Encryption items.


    Encryption items can be used to maintain the secrecy of
information, and thereby may be used by persons abroad to harm national
security, foreign policy and law enforcement interests. As the
President indicated in E.O. 13026 and in his Memorandum of November 15,
1996, export of encryption software, like export of encryption
hardware, is controlled because of this functional capacity to encrypt
information on a computer system, and not because of any informational
or theoretical value that such software may reflect, contain, or
represent, or that its export may convey to others abroad. For this
reason, export controls on encryption software are distinguished from
controls on other software regulated under the EAR.

    (a) License requirements. Licenses are required for all
destinations, except Canada, for ECCNs having an ``EI'' (for
``encryption items'') under the ``Control(s)'' paragraph. Such items
include: encryption commodities controlled under ECCN 5A002; encryption
software controlled under ECCN 5D002; and encryption technology
controlled under ECCN 5E002. (Refer to part 772 of the EAR for the
definition of ``encryption items'). For encryption items previously on
the U.S. Munitions List and currently authorized for export or reexport
under a State Department license, distribution arrangement or any other
authority of the State Department, U.S. persons holding valid USML
licenses and other approvals issued by the Department of State prior to
December 30, 1996 may ship remaining balances authorized by such
licenses or approvals under the authority of the EAR by filing Shippers
Export Declarations (SEDs) with District Directors of Customs, citing
the provisions of this section effective on December 30, 1996 and the
State Department license number. Such shipments shall be in accordance
with the terms and conditions, including the expiration date, existing
at the time of issuance of the State license. Violations of such
authorizations, terms and conditions constitute violations of the EAR.
Any reports required for distribution and other types of agreements
previously authorized by the Department of State, valid prior to
December 30, 1996, should be henceforth submitted to BXA at the
following address: Office of Strategic Trade and Foreign Policy
Controls, Bureau of Export Administration,

[[Page 68581]]

Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Room
2705, Washington, D.C. 20230.

    (b) Licensing policy. The following licensing policies apply to
items identified in paragraph (a) of this section. This section refers
you to Supplements No. 4, No. 5, and No. 7 to this part 742. For
purposes of these supplements, ``products'' refers to commodities and
software. Except as otherwise noted, applications will be reviewed on a
case-by-case basis by BXA, in conjunction with other agencies, to
determine whether the export or reexport is consistent with U.S.
national security and foreign policy interests.

    (1) Certain mass-market encryption software. Consistent with E.O.
13026 of November 15, 1996 (61 FR 58767), certain encryption software
that was transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce
Control List pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of November 15,
1996 may be released from ``EI'' controls and thereby made eligible for
mass market treatment after a one-time review. To determine eligibility
for mass market treatment, exporters must submit a classification
request to BXA. 40-bit mass market encryption software may be eligible
for a 7-day review process, and company proprietary software may be
eligible for 15-day processing. Refer to Supplement No. 6 to part 742
and Sec. 748.3(b)(3) of the EAR for additional information. Note that
the one-time review is for a determination to release encryption
software in object code only unless otherwise specifically requested.
Exporters requesting release of the source code should refer to
paragraph (b)(3)(v)(E) of Supplement No. 6 to part 742. If, after a
one-time review, BXA determines that the software is released from EI
controls, such software is eligible for all provisions of the EAR
applicable to other software, such as License Exception TSU for mass-
market software. If BXA determines that the software is not released
from EI controls, a license is required for export and reexport to all
destinations, except Canada, and license applications will be
considered on a case-by-case basis.

    (2) Key Escrow, Key Recovery and Recoverable encryption software
and commodities. Recovery encryption software and equipment controlled
for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 or under ECCN 5A002, including
encryption equipment designed or modified to use recovery encryption
software, may be made eligible for license exception KMI after a one-
time BXA review. License Exception KMI is available for all
destinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria and
Sudan. To determine eligibility, exporters must submit a classification
request to BXA. Requests for one-time review of key escrow and key
recovery encryption items will receive favorable consideration provided
that, prior to the export or reexport, a key recovery agent
satisfactory to BXA has been identified (refer to Supplement No. 5 to
part 742) and security policies for safeguarding the key(s) or other
material/information required to decrypt ciphertext as described in
Supplement No. 5 to part 742 are established to the satisfaction of BXA
and are maintained after export or reexport as required by the EAR. If
the exporter or reexporter intends to be the key recovery agent, then
the exporter or reexporter must meet all of the requirements of a key
recovery agent identified in Supplement No. 5 to part 742. In addition,
the key escrow or key recovery system must meet the criteria identified
in Supplement No. 4 to part 742. Note that eligibility is dependent on
continued fulfilment of the requirements of a key recovery agent
identified in Supplement No. 5 to part 742. Since the establishment of
a key management infrastructure and key recovery agents may take some
time, BXA will, while the infrastructure is being built, consider
requests for eligibility to export key recovery encryption products
which facilitate establishment of the key management infrastructure
before a key recovery agent is named, consistent with national security
and foreign policy. When BXA approves such cases, exporters of products
described in Supplement No. 4 to part 742 are required to furnish the
name of an agent by December 31, 1998. Requests for one-time review of
recoverable products which allow government officials to obtain, under
proper legal authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the
user, the plaintext of the encrypted data and communications will
receive favorable consideration.

    (3) Non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or
equivalent strength supported by a satisfactory business and marketing
plan for exporting recoverable items and services. (i) Manufacturers of
non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent
strength will be permitted to export and reexport under the authority
of License Exception KMI provided that the requirements and conditions
of the License Exception are met. Exporters must submit a
classification request for an initial BXA review of the item and a
satisfactory business and marketing plan that explains in detail the
steps the applicant will take during the two-year transition period
beginning January 1, 1997 to develop, produce, and/or market encryption
items and services with recoverable features. Manufacturers would
commit to produce key recovery products. Others would commit to
incorporate such products into their own products or services. Such
efforts can include: the scale of key recovery research and
development, product development, and marketing plans; significant
steps to reflect potential customer demand for key recovery products in
the firm's encryption-related business; and how soon a key recovery
agent will be identified. Note that BXA will accept requests for
classification of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key
length DES or equivalent strength under this paragraph from
distributors, re-sellers, integrators, and other entities that are not
manufacturers of the encryption items. The use of License Exception KMI
is not automatic; eligibility must be renewed every six months. Renewal
after each six-month period will depend on the applicant's adherence to
explicit benchmarks and milestones as set forth in the plan approved
with the initial license classification and amendments as approved by
BXA. This relaxation of controls and use of License Exception KMI will
last through December 31, 1998. The plan submitted with classifications
for the export of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key
length DES or equivalent strength must include the elements in
Supplement No. 7 to part 742.

    (ii) BXA will make a determination on such classification requests
within 15 days of receipt. Exports and reexports of non-recoverable
encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength
will be authorized under the provisions of License Exception KMI,
contingent upon BXA's review and approval of a satisfactory progress
report related to the ongoing plan submitted by the applicant. The
applicant must submit a letter to BXA every six months requesting
approval of the progress report. Note that distributors, re-sellers,
integrators, or other entities that are not manufacturers of the
encryption items are permitted to use License Exception KMI for exports
and reexports of such items only in instances where a classification
has been granted to the manufacturer of the encryption items or a
classification has been granted to the distributors, re-sellers,
integrators, or other entities. The authority to so export or reexport
will be for a time period

[[Page 68582]]

ending on the same day the producer's authority to export or reexport
ends.

    (4) All other encryption items--(i) Encryption licensing
arrangement. Applicants may submit license applications for exports and
reexports of certain encryption commodities and software in unlimited
quantities for all destinations except, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North
Korea, Syria, and Sudan. Applications will be reviewed on a case-by-
case basis. Encryption licensing arrangements may be approved with
extended validity periods specified by the applicant in block #24 on
Form BXA-748P. In addition, the applicant must specify the sales
territory and classes of end-users. Such licenses may require the
license holder to report to BXA certain information such as item
description, quantity, value, and end-user name and address.

    (ii) Applications for encryption items not authorized under an
encryption licensing arrangement. Applications for the export and
reexport of all other encryption items will be considered on a case-by-
case basis.

    (5) Applications for encryption technology. Applications for the
export and reexport of encryption technology will be considered on a
case-by-case basis.

    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not
available for license applications reviewed under this section.

    (d) [Reserved]

    26. Part 742 is amended by revising Supplement No. 4 and Supplement
No. 5, and by adding a new Supplement No. 6 and a new Supplement No. 7
to read as follows:

Supplement No. 4 to Part 742--Key Escrow or Key Recovery Products
Criteria

Key Recovery Feature


    (1) The key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt
ciphertext shall be accessible through a key recovery feature.

    (2) The product's cryptographic functions shall be inoperable
until the key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt
ciphertext is recoverable by government officials under proper legal
authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the user.

    (3) The output of the product shall automatically include, in an
accessible format and with a reasonable frequency, the identity of
the key recovery agent(s) and information sufficient for the key
recovery agent(s) to identify the key(s) or other material/
information required to decrypt the ciphertext.

    (4) The product's key recovery functions shall allow access to
the key(s) or other material/information needed to decrypt the
ciphertext regardless of whether the product generated or received
the ciphertext.

    (5) The product's key recovery functions shall allow for the

agent(s) internal to the user's organization) acceptable to BXA,
pursuant to the criteria in Supplement No. 5 to Part 742. Since the
establishment of a key management infrastructure and key recovery
agents may take some time, BXA will, while the infrastructure is
being built, consider exports of key recovery encryption products
which facilitate establishment of the key management infrastructure
before a key recovery agent is named.

    Exporters of products described in this Supplement No. 4 to part
742 are required to furnish the name of an agent by December 31,
1998.

Supplement No. 5 to Part 742--Key Escrow or Key Recovery Agent
Criteria, Security Policies, and Key Escrow or Key Recovery Procedures

Key Escrow or Key Recovery Agent Requirements; Security Policies; Key
Escrow or Key Recovery Procedures


    This Supplement sets forth criteria that the Department of
Commerce will use to approve key recovery agents to support approval
of the export or reexport of key recovery encryption items
controlled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002 and 5D002. Any
arrangements between the exporter or reexporter and the key recovery
agent must reflect the provisions contained in this Supplement in a
manner satisfactory to BXA, in conjunction with other agencies. This
Supplement outlines the criteria for employing key recovery agent
personnel for key recovery procedures. An applicant for eligibility
to export or reexport key recovery items shall provide, or cause the
proposed key recovery agent to provide, to BXA sufficient
information concerning any proposed key recovery agent arrangements
to permit BXA's evaluation of the key recovery agent's security
policies, key recovery procedures, and suitability and
trustworthiness to maintain the confidentiality of the key(s) or
other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext. The key
recovery agent, who must be approved by BXA, may be the applicant
for the classification request. When there is no key recovery agent
involved, or the customer will self-escrow abroad, with or without a
legal obligation to the exporter, the customer must be approved by
BXA. BXA retains the right, in addition to any other remedies, to
revoke eligibility for License Exception KMI if BXA determines that
a key recovery agent no longer meets these criteria. The
requirements related to the suitability and trustworthiness,
security policies, and key recovery procedures of the key recovery
agent shall be made terms and conditions of the License Exception
for key recovery items. BXA shall require the key recovery agent to
provide a representation that it will comply with such terms and
conditions.


    Note: Use of key recovery agents located outside the U.S. is
permitted if acceptable to BXA in consultation with the host
government, as appropriate.

I. Key Recovery Agent Requirements


    (1)(a) A key recovery agent must identify by name, date and
place of birth, and social security number, individual(s) who:

    (i) Is/are directly involved in the escrowing of key(s) or other
material/information required to decrypt ciphertext; or

    (ii) Have access to key(s) or other material/information
required to decrypt ciphertext, or

    (iii) Have access to information concerning requests for key(s)
or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext; or

    (iv) Respond to requests for key(s) or other material/
information required to decrypt ciphertext; or

    (v) Is/are in control of the key recovery agent and have access
or authority to obtain key(s) or other material/information required
to decrypt ciphertext, and

    (b) Must certify that such individual(s) meet the requirements
of the following paragraphs (b)(i) or (b)(ii). BXA reserves the
right to determine at any time the suitability and trustworthiness
of such individual(s). Evidence of an individual's suitability and
trustworthiness shall include:

    (i) Information indicating that the individual(s):

    (A) Has no criminal convictions of any kind or pending criminal
charges of any kind;

    (B) Has not breached fiduciary responsibilities (e.g., has not
violated any surety or performance bonds); and

    (C) Has favorable results of a credit check; or,

    (ii) Information that the individual(s) has an active U.S.
government security clearance of Secret or higher issued or updated
within the last five years.

    (2) The key recovery agent shall timely disclose to BXA when an
individual no longer meets the requirements of paragraphs
I.(1)(b)(i) or (ii).

    (3) A key recovery agent must, to remain eligible for License
Exception KMI, identify to BXA by name, date and place of birth, and
social security number any new individual(s)

[[Page 68583]]

who will assume the responsibilities set forth in paragraph I.(1)(a)
of this Supplement. Before that individual(s) assumes such
responsibilities, the key recovery agent must certify to BXA that
the individual(s) meets the criteria set forth in subparagraphs
I.(1)(b)(i) or (b)(ii) of this Supplement. BXA reserves the right to
determine at any time the suitability and trustworthiness of such
personnel.

    (4) If ownership or control of a key recovery agent is
transferred, no export may take place under previously issued
approvals until the successor key recovery agent complies with the
criteria of this Supplement.

    (5) Key recovery agents shall submit suitable evidence of the
key recovery agent's corporate viability and financial
responsibility (e.g., a certificate of good standing from the state
of incorporation, credit reports, and errors/omissions insurance).

    (6) Key recovery agents shall disclose to BXA any of the
following which have occurred within the ten years prior to the
application:

    (a) Federal or state felony convictions of the business;

    (b) Material adverse civil fraud judgments or settlements; and

    (c) Debarments from federal, state, or local government
contracting.

    The applicant shall also timely disclose to BXA the occurrence
of any of the foregoing during the use of License Exception KMI.

    (7) Key recovery agent(s) shall designate an individual(s) to be
the security and operations officer(s).

    (8) A key recovery agent may be internal to a user's
organization and may consist of one or more individuals. BXA may
approve such key recovery agents if sufficient information is
provided to demonstrate that appropriate safeguards will be employed
in handling key recovery requests from government entities. These
safeguards should ensure: the key recovery agent's structural
independence from the rest of the organization; security; and
confidentiality.

II. Security Policies


    (1) Key recovery agents must implement security policies that
assure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the
key(s) or other material/information required for decryption of the
ciphertext.

    (a) Procedures to assure confidentiality shall include:

    (i) Encrypting all key(s) or other material/information required
to decrypt ciphertext while in storage, transmission, or transfer;
or

    (ii) Applying reasonable measures to limit access to the
database (e.g. using keyed or combination locks on the entrances to
escrow facilities and limiting the personnel with knowledge of or
access to the keys/combinations).

    (b) Procedures to assure the integrity of the database (i.e.
assuring the key(s) and other material/information required to
decrypt ciphertext are protected against unauthorized changes) shall
include the use of access controls such as database password
controls, digital signatures, system auditing, and physical access
restrictions.

    (c) Procedures to assure the availability of the database (i.e.
assuring that key(s) and other material/information required to
decrypt ciphertext are retrievable at any time) shall include system
redundance, physical security, and the use of cryptography to
control access.

    (2) Policies and procedures shall be designed and operated so
that a failure by a single person, procedure, or mechanism does not
compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
key(s)or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext.
Security policies and procedures may include, but are not limited
to, multi-person control of access to recoverable keys, split keys,
and back-up capabilities.

    (3) Key recovery agents shall implement policies that protect
against unauthorized disclosure of information regarding whose
encryption material is stored, the fact that key(s) or other
material/information required to decrypt ciphertext was requested or
provided, and the identity of a requester. Procedures to assure the
confidentiality of this information shall include those described in
paragraph II.(1)(a) of this supplement.

    (4) Key recovery agents shall provide to BXA prompt notice of a
compromise of a security policy or of the confidentiality of key(s)
or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext.

III. Key Recovery Procedures


    (1) Key recovery agents shall maintain the ability to make the
key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext
available until notified otherwise by BXA. Key recovery agents shall
make requested key(s) or other material/information required to
decrypt ciphertext available, to the extent required by the request,
within two hours from the time they receive a request from a
government agency acting under appropriate legal authority.

    (2) Key recovery agents shall maintain data regarding key
recovery requests received, release of key(s) or other material/
information required to decrypt ciphertext, database changes, system
administration access, and dates of such events for purposes of
audits by BXA.

    (3) The key recovery agent must transfer all key recovery
equipment, key(s) and/or other material/information required to
decrypt ciphertext, key recovery database, and all administrative
information necessary to its key recovery operations to another key
recovery agent approved by BXA in the event that:

    (a) The key recovery agent dissolves or otherwise terminates
escrowing operations, or

    (b) BXA determines that there is a risk of such dissolution or
termination, or

    (c) BXA determines that the key recovery agent is no longer
suitable or trustworthy.

Exporter Key Recovery Plan


    (1) Export of 56-bit digital encryption standard (DES) or
equivalent strength encryption products, without key recovery, will
be permitted, in exchange for specific commitments to key recovery
products and services and a key management infrastructure. After a
one-time review of the strength of the product, the 56-bit DES or
equivalent strength products will be eligible for export License
Exception KMI, provided that the exporter submits an acceptable
plan.

    (2) Acceptable plans include: export licenses issued for, and
demonstrations of, key recovery products to appropriate U.S.
agencies; plans describing products under development with key
recovery features (see paragraph (3) of this Supplement), and for
distributors, a plan describing intentions to offer for distribution
key recovery products.

    (3) Following are topical areas to include in the plan, which
should be submitted to the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export
Administration, in the form of a letter from senior corporate
management:

    (i) Steps the applicant has taken or will take (depending on its
line of business) to develop, produce, distribute, market, and/or
transition to encryption products with key recovery features. The
plan should include benchmarks and milestones for incorporating key
recovery features into products and services, and for the supporting
key management infrastructure, including key recovery agent(s); and

    (ii) Provision, at the applicant's discretion, of other
information to indicate commitment to the development of a key
management infrastructure, such as participation in U.S. Government
pilot programs, current key recovery products or services provided,
role in NIST's Technical Advisory Committee on a Key Management
Infrastructure, participation in other encryption policy committees
or groups, or other support for the key management infrastructure.

    (4) Renewal of License Exception KMI must be sought by sending a
letter to BXA every six months reporting progress in meeting

<b>Abstract </b><br>
<b></b><br>
<br>
The evolution of information technology is likely to result in intimate
interdependence between humans and technology.  This fusion has been
characterized in popular science fiction as chip implantation.  It is, however,
more likely to take the form of biometric identification using such
technologies as fingerprints, hand geometry and retina scanning.<br>
<br>
Some applications of biometric identification technology are now
cost-effective, reliable, and highly accurate.  As a result, biometric systems
are being developed in many countries for such purposes as social security
entitlement, payments, immigration control and election management.  Whether or
not biometry delivers on its promise of high-quality identification, it will
imperil individual autonomy.  Widespread application of the technologies would
conflict with contemporary values, and result in a class of outcasts.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
<b></b><br>
The accurate identification of individuals is a key concern for many government
agencies and corporations.  It is important to them because it contributes
significantly to administrative efficiency and the control of fraud, and can
offer benefits to clients as well.  A key focus of information systems security
in recent years has been the intensification of efforts to establish accurate
identity.<br>
<br>
The application of identification systems involves conflict between two
conditions.  On the one hand, flawed identity checking results in unnecessary
duplication, fraud, and client disruption, with resultant costs and risks;  and
on the other, a rigorous identification procedure is invasive, and its
effectiveness may be undermined by unpopularity and resultant falsification and
evasion.<br>
<br>
Three conventional forms of identification are in use today.  The first is
something you have, such as a card.  The second form is something you know,
such as a password or PIN.  The third is something you are, such as a pattern
of ridges on a fingertip;  or something you do, such as writing or speaking.
This third form of identification is known as 'biometrics'.<br>
<br>
Schemes based on the items and knowledge which people possess have many
weaknesses.  For example, fake 'blanks' of even the highest integrity cards are
generally available in East Asian countries within weeks of the first cards
being issued (Davies 1992a, p.42).  The general availability of sophisticated
manufacturing equipment has placed the ability to forge such documents into the
hands of a much wider group of criminals than was previously the case (Carroll
1991, pp. 10-13).<br>
<br>
A high-integrity biometric system appears, from the perspective of information
users, to be an ideal solution to such problems.  The development and
application of technical standards has meant that communications among the
information systems of different organisations is increasingly simple.  The
application of a biometrically-based identifier for each individual would be a
natural further step.<br>
<br>
Yet, from the perspective of individuals, any move towards a biometric
identifier carries enormous risk. Many systems do not live up to expectations
because they prove unable to cope with the enormous variations among large
populations, or fail to take into account the practicalities of human
behaviour, and the needs of people.  Individual autonomy and freedoms may be
compromised by the need for a high level of compliance with the scheme.  In
many western nations, the stigma of criminality is associated with
fingerprinting, and, by association, with other biometric techniques.  If a
scheme is applied across multiple organisations, behaviour in relation to one
organisation might lead to a domino effect of 'cross-enforcement' activities,
involving suspension of entitlements or benefits by other organisations.
Individuals who cannot, or will not, use the prescribed system may become
outcasts on the edge of society.<br>
<br>
The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of biometric systems, and
discuss the justifications for its implementation and the dangers inherent in
them.  Because biometric technologies, their application, and their working
environment are all in their infancy, the research on which this paper is based
has relied heavily on case studies, literature search, primarily in the popular
and trade press, and interviews with leading figures in the field.  Where
applicable, studies and working documents have been incorporated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGIES</b><br>
<b></b><br>
Biometrics has been applied in a variety of ways since at least the time of the
Pharaohs, who used height measurement.  Automated biometric technology was
first applied in controlling access to premises and to computer networks.
Modern biometric schemes generally rely on sophisticated computer scanning
technology, of such aspects of the body and its behaviour as the micro-visual
pattern on the retina, the geometry of the hand or a finger, the patterns on
the surface of the skin of the thumb or fingers, the aural pattern of the
voice, the pattern of handwriting or signatures, and facial appearance.  In
each case, an artifact analyses a sample presented to it, and compares the
measurement with a verified sample digitally stored in the system.<br>
<br>
In recent years, biometric technology has attained a very high degree of
sophistication, and accuracy has been achieved at a level which far surpasses
all other forms of identification.  The Iriscan system, for example, conducts a
scan of the eye, and, according to claims made by the manufacturer, is
generally accurate to 10<sup>15</sup> on the first scan, and 10<sup>22</sup> on
the second (BTT 1993a).  Iris recognition does, however, suffer from the
shortcoming that many people feel very sensitive and protective of their eyes,
and find such technology disquieting.  To address at least some of this
concern, research is currently underway to scan the eye at a range of up to
three meters.<br>
<br>
Currently the most popular form of biometry is fingerprinting.  National
computerised fingerprint systems exist in several countries, the first national
system having been established in Australia in 1987.  The Japanese
telecommunications giant NTT recently announced the development of a
fingerprint recognition method that it claims provides further improvements in
speed and accuracy.  Recognition of a fingerprint takes place in an average of
2 seconds on a personal computer or 1 second on a workstation, with accuracy
claimed to be above 99.9%.  Among its diverse potential applications, it could
be used to confirm that the bearer of an identification card is the person to
whom it was issued (TA 1993).  Meanwhile, the Biometric Technologies Company of
the U.S.A. is developing a fingerprinting system using neural networks.
Laboratory tests commissioned by the manufacturer are reported to show an
accuracy of 0.0001% and a probability of wrongly rejecting a genuine client of
0.1%.  Known as Printscan 3, the device is intended for release in the early
part of 1995 at a cost of $US600 per unit (BTT 1993b).<br>
<br>
Hand geometry, involving a scan of the shape and characteristics of the entire
hand, has been applied in a variety of situations in over 4,000 locations
including the Colombian legislature, the San Francisco International Airport, a
day care centre at Lotus Corporation in the U.S.A. and a Los Angeles sperm bank
(Miller 1994, p.25).<br>
<br>
Evaluation of biometric technologies will be essential to their acceptance, but
to date only limited independent testing has been undertaken.  In 1991, the
U.S. Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories released the results
of its second round of tests.  The significance of these results remains open
to question, however, since they assessed equipment from only six U.S. vendors:
Indentix's Touchlock fingerprint system, Recognition Systems' ID-3D-U hand
geometry system, Eyedentify's Model 8.5 retinal scan system, Autosig's Sign/On
signature dynamics system, and Alpha Micro's Ver-a-tel and International
Electronics' VoiceKey voice verification systems (Sherman R.L. 1993).<br>
<br>
The tests showed that dynamic signature verification was by far the cheapest of
the evaluated products, although it rejected a high proportion of properly
enrolled individuals.  Hand geometry had a very low rate of false rejections,
especially if more than one attempt was made, and was very much better than
signature dynamics in this respect;  however it cost more than twice as much.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>CASE STUDIES</b><br>
<b></b><br>
In order to provide some depth of understanding of the nature of
biometrics-based identification, this paper documents several schemes.  The
first is a single-purpose scheme in pilot operation, and the second a
multi-purpose system currently under development.  Several other applications
are identified.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>National Border Crossings</b><br>
<b></b><br>
In 1993, the U.S. immigration authorities opened a new lane at New York's John
F. Kennedy airport.  It differs from traditional immigration procedures in that
it uses biometric technology called FAST (Future Automated Screening for
Travellers) to automatically identify and process passengers in as little as
twenty seconds.<br>
<br>
The project is called INSPASS (Immigration and Naturalisation Service Passenger
Accelerated Service System).  Applicants for registration are interviewed, and
their identity confirmed.  They place the palm of a hand onto the surface of a
scanner, which records measurements of the hand's contours.  These are
converted into a 'template' and stored on a card.  This is currently a paper
card, but is soon to be a 'smart card'.  In case the hand geometry system
proves to be inadequate, fingerprints are also taken and recorded.<br>
<br>
When INSPASS members arrive at the two test airports (John F. Kennedy and
Newark), they bypass the main immigration queues, and enter a kiosk.  The card
is presented to the terminal.  The hand is placed onto a scanner, which matches
the biometry of the hand with the template encoded into the card.  Immigration
databases are consulted.  Once the last of five green lights appear at the tips
of the fingers, the glass exit door opens, and the passenger continues to the
baggage claim and customs zone.<br>
<br>
INSPASS is currently operating as a voluntary system for frequent travellers to
and from the U.S.A., who are U.S. or Canadian nationals, or nationals of
countries involved in the U.S. visa waiver scheme.  More than thirty thousand
people have so far enrolled, and by mid-1994 this was increasing by one
thousand per week.  Governments in 26 countries are monitoring and cooperating
with the project (BTT 1993b, Davies 1994b). <br>
<br>
If the INSPASS trial is successful, the technology may render conventional
identification card and passport systems redundant.  As a trade-off for faster
immigration processing, passengers are accepting a system which has the
potential to generate an increased amount of international traffic in their
personal data.  INS officials appear confident that a multi-purpose scheme can
be established, using common international standards and a smart-card system
that can cope with either a hand geometry or a fingerprint scan.  Immigration
control could be linked to a wide spectrum of information, such as police and
taxation systems.<br>
<br>
The system has been approved by a preliminary feasibility audit, and looks
increasingly like being implemented in several countries.  The trial may be the
forerunner of a linked biometric system that involves many nations.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Social Welfare</b><br>
<b></b><br>
In the Canadian province of Ontario, there is considerable public concern about
the existence of nearly twelve million identities in the health system of a
province with a population of ten million.  It is perceived that many U.S.
citizens are using Canadian health care facilities without entitlement.  To
address the problem, the provincial government is developing a proposal for a
government-wide biometric scheme variously called the Ontario Client Positive
Identifier Proposal or Service Card Ontario.  It is being championed by the
Community Services Department of Metro Toronto, an agency which disseminates
around $Can2 billion ($US1.4 billion) per annum in welfare services.<br>
<br>
A committee representing the majority of Ontario Departments is currently
discussing mutual identification and administration problems, and the potential
for creating a universal strategy for dealing with these issues (Davies 1994a).
Officials are hopeful that a register of thumb scans can be established by 1996
as the basis for a 'once-and-for-all' identity.  Scanners would be located at
many locations in all Ontario Government agencies, and connected to a
thumb-scan registry and to the computers of relevant agencies.  Discussions are
underway with Federal agencies with regard to integration with immigration
systems.  <br>
<br>
The Request For Information (TMS 1993) envisaged that the system would
involve:<br><ul>
-	digitised photographs and hand geometry stored in a central database;<br>
-	a plastic identity card, possibly with a magnetic strip, containing facial
image, client signature, client date of birth, a variety of security features,
and possibly a fingerprint;<br>
-	authorised users at multiple sites using data scanned from a person's hand to
search the databank for matches;  and<br>
-	interfaces with existing information systems.<br>
<br></ul>
Five of thirteen companies providing submissions were shortlisted.  The
principal difficulty for suppliers appeared to be the capability to interface
with existing technologies.  A Request For Proposal was subsequently issued
(TMS 1994).  The total cost for hardware, software, maintenance, training and
peripherals was indicated to be in the range of $Can3-4 million.  According to
project staff, this expenditure would be recovered from administrative and
payments savings.  The project team recognises that there are significant
administrative barriers, but hopes to overcome them.<br>
<br>
The Department has announced that it intends pursuing a policy of 'openness and
honesty' in the development of the system, and will appoint an external adviser
to monitor its performance and impact.  The Privacy Commissioner for Ontario,
however, has had minimal involvement to date, and has expressed grave
reservations about it.  Issues of identification are still divisive in Canada
(Phillips 1994), and the pursuit of the project may require considerable
political will.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Emergent Applications</b><br>
<b></b><br>
Reports in the trade press suggest that biometric systems are being developed
for a wide spectrum of purposes.  Major retail and banking organisations in
Australia, Europe and North America are adopting biometric systems for internal
security.  Blue Cross and Blue Shield in the U.S.A. have plans to introduce
nationwide fingerprinting for hospital patients.  This may be extended into
other medical applications.  The Jamaican Government is planning to introduce
electronic thumb scanning to control elections.  Social Security verification
using biometrics is being planned in several countries including Spain and
South Africa (BTT 1994a, 1994b).<br>
<br>
In 1994, the U.K. Department of Social Security (DSS) developed a proposal to
introduce a national identification card, which it is hoped will assist in
reducing the estimated [[sterling]]1 billion of welfare fraud annually.  The
DSS recommended a computerised database of hand-prints of all of the 30 million
people receiving a government benefit.  Applicants for a benefit or subsidy
would have their hand-prints tested against existing entries (Sherman J. 1993)
.  The proposal is expected to be one of the options contained in a Green Paper
on an identification card, to be released in the Spring of 1995.<br>
<br>
In Europe, tests are being undertaken of the feasibility of storing
card-holders' fingerprints on their credit cards, so that a device at the point
of purchase can compare the card-borne data with the bearer's fingerprint.  In
Australia, the technology is being applied to staff who access automated teller
machines.  Government officials in The Netherlands say that biometrics has a
"real chance" of being accepted as a form of identification.  According to the
Chip Card Platform, which is coordinating the project, there has been a
political 'change of wind' in recent years, and an understanding amongst the
public of the role of information technology.  Officials acknowledge that this
change of attitude has taken them by surprise (Davies 1994a).<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>THE ACHIEVABILITY OF BIOMETRICS' POTENTIAL BENEFITS</b><br>
<b></b><br>
The potential benefits of an integrated biometrics-based identification system
include improvements in: <br><ul>
-	the cost of administration;<br>
-	the integrity of identification;<br>
-	the integrity of information;<br>
-	access to information held by organisations;<br>
-	the speed of delivery of services and benefits;<br>
-	the accuracy and quality of research and statistics;  and<br>
-	the level of technical security of communications.<br>
<br></ul>
In many countries, information technology is being successfully applied to
particular business and administrative functions within particular
organisations.  The majority of these success stories have in common a
manageable size, a limited geographic spread, a single purpose, and modest and
easily defined goals.  Where biometric technologies are applied to specific
purposes, some confidence may be felt in the system's ability to deliver the
intended benefits.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, many failures and disappointments continue to occur, even
among seemingly straightforward projects.  A report commissioned by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services noted that a vast gulf exists between
the promise and the reality of savings from computer systems (HHS 1993).  A
study by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment found that
computer-based information systems, once implemented, often result in
"unforeseen costs, unfulfilled promises, and disillusionment" (OTA 1993).<br>
<br>
Large-scale government schemes have been shown in several countries to be much
less cost-effective than was originally estimated.  Years after the governments
of the United States and Australia developed schemes to match public sector
data, there is still no clear evidence that the strategy has succeeded in
achieving its goals.  The audit agencies of both federal governments have cast
doubt that computer matching schemes deliver savings.  Achieving the potential
benefits of large-scale applications of information technology is difficult,
and the outcomes are erratic, unpredictable, and commonly considerably less
than expected.<br>
<br>
Complex systems embody greater levels of risk of failure, and resultant
vulnerability of organisations and individuals dependent on them.  An example
of this was the shutdown of more than half of AT&amp;T's network due to a
computer virus in the network switching system (Davies 1990).  The greater the
complexity of a system, the more permutations of failure appear to be created.
The case for multi-faceted integration of complex personal information systems,
whether or not based on biometrics, must be viewed with some skepticism.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>THE DANGERS OF BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION</b><br>
<b></b><br>
The pursuit of high-quality identification involves significant technical,
organisational, social, legal and political issues.  Many of the these are
concerns about computerisation in general, and the sharing of data among
organisations in particular.  For a review of the dangers of data surveillance
to individuals and society, see Clarke (1988).<br>
<br>
Biometric identification relies on technology that is far from proven, and
major organisational adjustments are needed to cope with it.  There are many
practical problems involved in complex and largely automated schemes, and in
coping with exceptions, system outages and claims of database error.  The
imposition of intrusive identification procedures changes the nature of
relationships and transactions between clients and organisations.  There is at
least a perceived, and probably a real, increase in the power of organisations
over individuals.  Biometrics, much more so than other identification schemes,
may imperil the sense of individuality.<br>
<br>
Systems that entail a central registry of personal identities raise much more
substantial issues.  The adequacy of data protection laws in dealing with these
issues to the satisfaction of the public is in doubt.  A biometric print may,
for example, be considered to be in the public domain.  Alternatively, people
may find that they are required to provide a biometric print in many unforeseen
or unintended future circumstances.<br>
<br>
The history of identification systems throughout the world provides evidence of
'function creep' - application to additional purposes not announced, or perhaps
even intended, at the commencement of the scheme.  Uses of the Social Security
Number in the U.S.A, the Social Insurance Number in Canada, the Tax File Number
in Australia, the SOFI number in The Netherlands, and the Austrian Social
Security Number have been extended progressively to include taxation,
unemployment support, pensioner benefits, and in some cases health and higher
education.  The existence of a relatively high-integrity scheme would create
irresistible temptations to apply it widely, and inter-relate many hitherto
separate collections of personal information (Holvast 1991, Clarke 1992, Davies
1992a).<br>
<br>
Privacy protection involves resistance to the establishment or consolidation of
monolithic information systems.  Informational chaos and functional separation
amongst agencies have ensured that the individual has not become a servant to
the state.  Variety, choice, and chaos have also had the effect of insuring the
free movement, rights, and free choice of individuals against errors in the
system.<br>
<br>
Several countries, including Australia, Canada, the United States and New
Zealand, have witnessed public disquiet over identification schemes.  Abstract
fears that have been cited include :<br><br><ul>
-	that people will be de-humanised by being reduced to codes;<br>
-	that the system will enhance the power over individuals of particular
organisations and the State;<br>
-	that high-integrity identification embodies an inversion of the appropriate
relationship between the citizen and the State;<br>
-	that the system is a hostile symbol of authority;<br>
-	that society is becoming driven by technology-assisted bureaucracy, rather
than by elected government;<br>
-	that exemptions and exceptions will exist for powerful individuals and
organisations, and that the system will entrench fraud and criminality;  and<br>
-	that such identification schemes are the mechanism foretold in religious
prophecy (e.g. 'the Mark of the Beast').<br></ul>
<br>
There is some evidence that the public may be moving away from traditional
notions of privacy, and cautiously accepting fraud control and administrative
mechanisms that would have been politically untenable in the 1970s and 1980s.
For example, both the Dutch and Australian public rejected national information
and identification schemes <i>en masse</i>  several years ago, but have reacted
more passively to equally intrusive (though less blatant) schemes in the 1990s.
In Germany, where the introduction of an identity card caused major controversy
fifteen years ago, the public now appears to be more willing to accept a
national 'smart card' scheme for the health sector.<br>
<br>
There may be many factors at work in the apparently greater public acceptance
of privacy-invasive schemes.  Proposals are being brought forward in a more
careful and piecemeal fashion, which may be lulling the public into a false
sense of security.  There is increasing popularity of computers and networks
for personal use.  The use of personal information systems by Nazi Germany to
enable the identification and location of a target race are becoming a vague
memory.<br>
<br>
It is an open question, however, as to whether public acceptance is real, or
only apparent.  A change of attitude may merely await a catalyst.
Alternatively, an increasing proportion of people may ignore official processes
and organisations and opt instead for 'black markets' and 'black society'.
Many countries have substantial sub-cultures of outcasts, usually resulting
from poverty, racial differences or illegal immigration.  To these may be added
a significant number of people who choose not to participate in a general
identification scheme.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b><br>
<b></b><br>
Biometry is, in many senses, a natural extension of technological evolution.
Like the modern automobile, it signals an intimacy with the client.  Whether
the public senses a danger in the establishment of such a fusion will depend on
its sensitivity to privacy and autonomy.<br>
<br>
High-quality identification offers the promise of the avoidance of error and
fraud, and privacy advocates often have difficulty expressing their opposition
to it.  Nevertheless, the use of biometrics needs to conform to the standards
and expectations of a privacy-minded society.  Specific-purpose biometric
schemes raise serious issues which need to be addressed.  General-purpose
schemes represent real threats to the fabric of contemporary society.<br>

<b>SUMMARY</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<p>
This report presents a detailed analysis of the international trade in
surveillance technology.  Its' primary concern is the flow of sophisticated
computer-based technology from developed countries to developing countries  -
and particularly to non-democratic regimes. It is in this environment where
surveillance technologies become technologies of political control. <p>
<p>
Surveillance technologies can be defined as technologies which can monitor,
track and assess the movements, activities and communications of individuals.
These include an array of visual recording devices, bugging equipment, computer
information systems and identification systems. These innovations are used by
military, police and intelligence authorities as technologies of repression.<p>
<p>
The surveillance trade is almost indistinguishable from the arms trade. More
than seventy per cent of companies manufacturing and exporting surveillance
technology also export arms, chemical weapons, or military hardware.
Surveillance is a crucial element for the maintenance of any  non-democratic
infrastructure, and is an important activity in the pursuit of intelligence and
political control. Many countries in transition to democracy also rely heavily
on surveillance to satisfy the demands of police and military. The technology
described in this report makes possible mass surveillance of populations.  In
the past, regimes relied on targeted surveillance.<p>
<p>
<p>
<u>Big Brother Incorporated</u> is the first investigation ever conducted into
this trade.  Privacy International intends to update the report from time to
time as more information becomes available. <p>
<p>
The report identifies the trade with such countries as Nigeria, China, Angola,
Rwanda Zambia and Indonesia. More than 80 British companies are involved,
making the UK the world leader in this field. Other countries, in order of
significance, are the United States, France, Israel, the Netherlands and
Germany.<p>
<p>
It is derived from company information, trade fair data, annual reports and
media reports.  It lists the companies, their directors, products and exports.
In each case, source material is meticulously cited. Addresses and contact
numbers are as current as possible but in some cases these will be out of
date.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>OVERVIEW OF THE REPORT</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<p>
Numerous investigations and reports in the past decade have highlighted the
extent to which the global arms trade nurtures and supports brutal and
repressive regimes across the world. The industry and its participants have
been put under the microscope by a number of parliamentary inquiries in Europe
and North America. Without exception, these have uncovered a complex and
profitable trade with few controls and with no ethical compass.<p>
<p>
<u>Big Brother Incorporated</u> is concerned with a parallel activity involving
many companies involved in the arms trade. The international trade in
surveillance technology (sometimes known as the Repression Trade) involves the
manufacture and export of technologies of political control. These technologies
involve sophisticated computer-based technology which vastly increases the
power of authorities.<p>
<p>
Amongst the products involved are : <p>
<p>
*   telephone interception equipment <p>
*   bugging devices <p>
*   police and military information systems <p>
*   ID cards <p>
*   "System X" telephone systems<p>
*   communications logging systems <p>
*   micro-cameras <p>
*   parabolic microphones <p>
*   automatic transcription systems <p>
*   infra red scopes <p>
*   night vision equipment <p>
*   advanced CCTV equipment <p>
*   geographic information systems <p>
*   vehicle tracking technology  <p>
*   automated fingerprint systems <p>
*   biometric technology  <p>
*   cellular intercept systems <p>
*   computer intercept systems <p>
*   crowd analysis and monitoring technology <p>
*   data matching programs<p>
<p>
<p>
Much of this technology is used to track the activities of dissidents, human
rights activists, journalists, student leaders, minorities, trade union
leaders, and political opponents. It is also useful for monitoring larger
sectors of the population. With this technology, the financial transactions,
communications activity and geographic movements of millions of people can be
captured, analyzed and transmitted cheaply and efficiently. The emerging
information and communications infrastructures of countries can be hijacked for
limitless surveillance purposes.<p>
<p>
In the absence of meaningful legal or constitutional protections, such
technology is inimical to democratic reform.  It can certainly prove fatal to
anyone "of interest" to a regime.<p>
<p>
Western surveillance technology is providing invaluable support to military and
totalitarian authorities throughout the world.  British computer firm ICL
(International Computers Limited) provided the technological infrastructure to
establish the South African automated Passbook system, upon which much of the
functioning of the Apartheid regime depended.  In the late 1970s Security
Systems International supplied security technology to Idi Amin's brutal regime
in Uganda.<p>
<p>
In the 1980s, Israeli company Tadiram developed and exported the technology for
the computerized death list used by the Guatemalan police. Meanwhile, companies
such as PK Electronics routinely provide the Chinese authorities with bugging
equipment and telephone tapping devices.<p>
<p>
The extent of Western support for inhumane regimes is widespread. The notorious
human rights abuses in Indonesia - particularly those affecting East Timor -
would not be possible without the strategic and technological support of
Western companies.  Amongst those companies supplying the Indonesian police and
military with surveillance and targeting technology are Morpho Systems
(France), De la Rue Printak (UK), EEV Night Vision (UK), ICL (UK), Marconi
Radar and Control Systems (UK), Pyser (UK), Siemens Plessey Defense Systems
(UK) Rockwell International Corporation (USA) and SWS Security (USA). These and
other corporations supply the intelligence gathering and identification systems
necessary to pursue a program of ethnic cleansing.<p>
<p>
This technology is exported to virtually all countries with appalling human
rights records. Nigeria is supplied by such companies as Codalex (Canada) and
Continental Microwave (UK).  Companies supplying to Chinese authorities are
numerous, but include Phillips (Netherlands) EEV Night Vision (UK), GEC Marconi
(UK), GPT-Plessey Telecom (UK), Pilkington PE Ltd (UK) and Siemens Plessey
(UK).<p>
<p>
The Thailand Central Population Database and ID card system, developed by the
US based Control Data Systems, involves sophisticated intelligence that has
been used for political purposes by the Thai military. This integrated system
creates an ID card, electronic fingerprint and facial image, and electronic
data link involving the entire population. It spans most government agencies
and is controlled by the powerful military/police dominated Interior Ministry.
<p>
<p>
Databases in the Thai system include : Central Population Database, National
Election System, Political Party Database, Political Member Database, Voter
listing, Electronic Minority Group Registration System, Electronic Fingerprint
Identification System, Electronic Face Identification System, Population and
House Report System, National Tax Collection System, Village Information
System, Secret Information System, Public Opinion System, Criminal
Investigation System, National Security System, Social Security System,
Passport Control System, Driver Control System, Gun Registration, Family
Registration, Alien Control System and Immigration Control System. <p>
<p>
Similar ID card and "smart" card systems have been marketed to more than two
dozen developing countries.  Without exception, they result in wholesale
discrimination and hardship for vulnerable people. Such systems can adversely
affect the delicate balance pursued by an emerging democracy. The adoption of
Information Technology (IT) involves a change to the relationship between
citizen and the State. The use of surveillance technologies vastly increases
this change.<p>
<p>
The justification advanced by the companies involved in this trade is identical
to the justification advanced in the arms trade -   i.e. that the technology is
neutral. Privacy International's view is that in the absence of legal
protections, the technology can never be neutral.  Even those technologies
intended for "benign" uses rapidly develop more sinister purposes.  The UK
manufactured "Scoot"  traffic control cameras in Beijing's Tianamen Square were
automatically employed as surveillance cameras during the student
demonstrations. Images captured from the cameras was broadcast over Chinese
television to ensure that the offending students were captured.  <p>
<p>
The emerging Information Superhighway also poses fundamental threats to
developing countries (the Superhighway is a metaphor for the convergence of
information and communications systems to form a national and international
information web. The 1995 summit of the G7 (the seven richest industrial
powers) linked arms with some of the most dominant corporations in the
technology industry to form a consensus about how the Superhighway should be
built.  They agreed to a set of principles that would maximize growth,
development  and profit.  Relatively little attention was paid to the negative
impact of the Superhighway on developing countries and on the rights and
privacy of citizens of all countries. <p>
<p>
Martin Bangermann,  Europe's Commissioner in charge of information technology,
has remarked "We will not achieve the Information Society unless we give the
free market a free rein". In the context of the trade in surveillance
technologies to third world countries, this signals a "hands off" policy. An
unregulated Superhighway is likely to maximize surveillance and increase the
power of institutions in control of the technology.<p>
<p>
It should be a source of grave concern that the world's telecommunications and
computer companies have been moving to force government to back away from
regulating information technology. In 1994, under the leadership of US Center
for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a consortium of the world's
leading companies have formed the Global Information Infrastructure Commission
(GIIC). Headed by the president of Mitsubishi, the chairman of EDS, and the
vice chairman of Siemens Corporation, the GIIC intends to create a conglomerate
of interests powerful enough to subsume government interest in regulation. <p>
 <p>
The effort is being funded to a large extent by the World Bank, which in early
1994 appears to have been persuaded by CSIS that unregulated economic
investment was more important to developing economies than social and political
reform. The corporate sector, argued CSIS, can deliver this economic reform
along the Superhighway. And they can do it best if they, not the governments,
take the lead. <p>
<p>
The unregulated development and export of these technologies creates grave and
unnecessary threats to developing countries. The trade requires scrutiny and
regulation to help minimize the fatal impact that it can cause. Whether this
impact is intended or unforseen, the surveillance industry has a responsibility
to ensure that the export and development of its products conform to scrupulous
ethical standards. Developed countries should ensure that the export industry
is regulated. Technological assessment must be a pre-requisite.<p>
<p>
This report is by no means comprehensive. It omits numerous government-led
systems. For example, the notorious PROMIS surveillance software marketed
throughout the world by the US Justice Department has led to widespread fears
about the creation of an international tracking system for individuals "of
interest". The US, French and British governments' moves to limit effective
encryption systems is also of profound importance to developing countries, but
is not dealt with in any detail here.  These and many other issues will be
explored in updates of<u> Big Brother Incorporated</u>  We are hoping that
interested people will contact us to provide further information on this trade.
We also welcome "clarification" of the facts by the companies named in this
report.<p>
<p>
Privacy International wishes to acknowledge the invaluable advice and
assistance of a number of people and organizations in the preparation of <u>Big
Brother Incorporated</u>. Because of the sensitive nature of the report's
contents, we have agreed that they should remain anonymous. However, the
invaluable support of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) in
Washington DC is gratefully acknowledged.<p>

<H1><CENTER>U.S. State Department Reports Wordwide Privacy Abuses</H1>
<BR>
<H2>David Banisar</H2>
</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER><A HREF="http://www.privacy.org/pi/reports/hr95_privacy_report.html">Excerpts from State Department Report</A><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
In its' annual review on human rights around the globe, lthe US State Department reports that while most countries have either Constitutional or legal protections of privacy, there are widespread abuses of privacy rights.  The abuses reported included illegal wiretapping, widespread informer networks, interception of mail, and warrantless searches of homes.  <P>
The report, entitled "U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1995," is based on reports from US embassies, human rights groups, and other information.  It is produced by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the State Department, headed by Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck. <P>
The country reports cover a wide range of civil and political rights ranging from disappearances to labor rights. The scope of privacy issues covered is limited to traditional American Fourth Amendment concerns relating to search and seizure of private property, and the interception of mail and communications. Information privacy issues are only mentioned in a few countries. No mention is made of any privacy or data protection commissions.  Important issues such as the collection of personal information by governments and private companies, and id cards are also mostly ignored.<P>
<H3><B>Constitutional and Legal Protections</H3>
</B>According to the report, almost all of the countries in the world have either a constitutional or legal right to privacy.  110 countries are reported to have a specific provision in their constitutions guaranteeing the right of privacy. These vary from the protection from unlawful searches and wiretaps to countries such  as Spain and Slovenia, which have data protection specifically enumerated in their Constitutions. Another 55 countries are reported as having laws which protect privacy in the absence of a Constitutional right.<BR>
<BR>
 Frequently, these protections are unenforced. In addition, a number of countries have enacted laws authorizing privacy violations in the name of national security or emergency legislation which override constitutional and legal protections.<P>
<H3><B>Wiretapping and Mail Interception</H3>
</B>Illegal wiretapping was prevalent throughout the world in 1995. The State Department cites reports of taps in over 90 countries. The abuses varied from systematic monitoring by military and government officials to occasional abuses by private entities.  Most of the countries where these abuses occurred have laws prohibiting warrantless taps. Additionally, in many countries, prosecutors and police officers can issue warrants, rather than independent judges.<BR>
<BR>
 The most frequently mentioned targets of  illegal wiretapping are foreign residents, political opposition, dissidents, human rights workers, and journalists.   In most countries where illegal wiretapping is conducted, the unauthorized interception of mail is also reported.<BR>
<H3></H3>
<H3><B>Regional Breakdowns</H3>
<H3></B><B>Africa</H3>
</B> <BR>
A majority of the countries of Africa have poor  records on privacy.  While 31 countries have constitutional, and another 12 have legal protections of privacy, illegal wiretapping was reported in thirty out of the 49 countries in that region.  Widespread illegal searches were reported in at least 23 of the countries.  Incidents of unlawful interception of the mail were reported in 13 countries. <BR>
<BR>
 Many countries engage in systematic surveillance against their citizens. For example, in Angola, the report states that, "the Government maintains a sophisticated security apparatus dedicated to surveillance, monitoring and wiretapping of certain groups, including journalists, opposition party leaders, members, and suspected sympathizers of UNITA, National Assembly deputies, and foreign diplomats." Kenya maintains "a network of informants to monitor the activities of opposition politicians and human rights advocates."  In Sudan,  a  "wide network of government informants  conducts pervasive surveillance in schools, universities, markets, workplaces, and neighborhoods" and is used to "keep key opposition figures under frequent surveillance."<BR>
<BR>
In some countries, the laws authorize and encourage surveillance. In Gambia, the report notes, "existing constitutional safeguards against arbitrary search and seizure were abrogated as part of Decree 45. AFPRC priorities in security matters and corruption investigations override all constitutional safeguards." In Kenya, the Constitution permits searches without warrants in cases "to promote the public benefit."  A 1995 money laundering decree allows the Nigerian National Drug Law Enforcement Agency to, "monitor telephone conversations, access computer systems, and obtain bank and financial records." Decrees in Sierra Leone allow the government to, "monitor actions or conversations within homes, to prevent a person from acting in a manner deemed prejudicial to public safety."<P>
<B>Latin America and the Caribbean<P>
</B>Nearly all of the countries in the region - 28 of 34 - have Constitutional rights of privacy. Most of the remainder have legal protections. In nine of the countries, the State Department reports that there are "effective legal sanctions" to illegal searches.<BR>
<BR>
Illegal wiretaps were reported or suspected in ten countries. In Brazil, they were commonly used until a scandal involving the wiretapping of a presidential aide led to a temporary ban on their use. In Chile, a new law was enacted on November 20, 1995 prohibiting unauthorized taps. Even as democratic reforms progressed, illegal taps continued to occur in Honduras,  El Salvador, and Guatemala.   In Honduras, "the armed forces reportedly continued to use its operation of the national telephone company to monitor telephone lines of influential people in government, the military, and the private sector without authorization from the appropriate civilian judicial authority."  Once again, Cuba was listed as a major human rights violator with a pervasive system of surveillance designed to limit any dissent.<BR>
<BR>
The war on drugs also continued to have an  impact on privacy rights. In Venezuela, suspensions of the constitutional guarantees were lifted in June 1995 after 13 months but still remain in border areas. In Jamaica, Barbados, Bolivia, and Columbia, warrantless searches were reported.<BR>
Some countries are reported as improving their records. In Chile, a law was enacted on November 20 that "bars obtaining and dissemination of information by undisclosed taping, telephone intercepts and other surreptitious means."  In Suriname, "the military command curbed invasions of privacy by the military such as the illegal monitoring of telephone calls, monitoring of the movements of human rights advocates, and threatening government officials, policemen, politicians, human rights workers, and journalists. Although some persons continued these activities on occasion, the military authorities reportedly did not authorize them to do so." Authorities in Guatemala continue to investigate the presidential security mail interception unit scandal that broke in 1993. <BR>
     <BR>
<H4><B>East Asia and the Pacific</H4>
</B>In this region, of the 32 countries, 9 countries had constitutional provisions and 13 had legal protections for privacy. <BR>
<BR>
Illegal wiretapping was reported in 10 nations.  Many of the countries including Singapore, Fiji, China, Cambodia, Burma, Malaysia, North Korea reportedly  tapped the phones of social and political critics. In South Korea, a new law limits wiretapping but many groups believe that illegal wiretapping still continues.  In addition, Internet surveillance also was an issue in China, where the government limited new access until it could determine how to prevent access to antigovernment materials on the Net. <BR>
<BR>
The report contains an extensive country report critical of China's record. Ironically, China responded to the report with a number of articles criticizing the U.S. on its lack of workplace privacy laws. Other countries in the region also harbored repressive regimes. In Burma, "the military ruled unchecked by any outside authority, and the State continued to interfere extensively and arbitrarily in the lives of private citizens. Through its extensive intelligence network, the Government closely monitored the travel, whereabouts, and activities of many citizens, particularly those known to be politically active. Security personnel selectively screened private correspondence and telephone calls, and conducted warrantless searches of private premises." In Indonesia, the government continues to exert "strong pressure against antigovernment critics, independent journalists, and labor activists."  One improvement was "a phasing-out of a discriminatory symbol on the identification cards of ex-political prisoners and their families."<P>
<H3><B>Europe</H3>
</B>The European region had a mixed record on privacy.  While the western countries generally had good records (though several had wiretap scandals), many of the former states of the Soviet Union are still reportedly being run by the vestiges of the KGB. Many Central European countries continued to struggle as they moved towards market economies. Thirty countries in the region have constitutional provisions guaranteeing the right to privacy. Another 18 have laws protecting privacy. In addition, other agreements, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, also apply. Nonetheless, illegal wiretapping was reported in 22 countries.<BR>
<BR>
Many of the nations that made up the former Soviet Union had poor records.  The State Department reported that in many of the countries, the security apparatus set up by the KGB remained intact and maintained control over the country.  In Russia, a law enacted in August 1995 allows the security apparatus to,   "open mail, tap telephones, monitor other forms of communication, and enter a private residence without a court order in cases of emergency that may lead to the commission of a serious crime or if Russia's political, military, economic, or environmental security is threatened."   In Kazakstan, "the KNB and Ministry of Internal Affairs, with the concurrence of the procuracy, can and do arbitrarily interfere with privacy, family, home, and correspondence." In Turkmenistan, even with a Constitutional guarantee, "Security officials use physical surveillance, telephone tapping, electronic eavesdropping, and the recruitment of informers. Critics of the Government, and many other people as well, report credibly that their mail is intercepted before delivery." In Estonia, "a political scandal erupted when then Minister of Internal Affairs Savisaar was implicated in the illicit recording of his conversations with other politicians. Parliament appointed a special committee to investigate the matter, including the contacts of police with private security firms. Savisaar was dismissed, the cabinet resigned, and a new governing coalition was formed. Security police and parliamentary investigations were continuing at year's end." At the same time, U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation director Louis Freeh toured the region and encouraged countries to conduct more wiretapping to fight organized crime.<BR>
<BR>
Western European countries were also not exempt from abuses. In Greece, a new data protection law was enacted in September. However, "the security services continued to target human rights activists, non-Orthodox religious groups, and minority group representatives and to monitor foreign diplomats who met with such individuals. On several occasions, information about such private meetings was given to the press, apparently by government representatives. Human rights activists also reported the continuation of suspicious openings and diversions of mail, some of which was never delivered but was subsequently published in newspapers with apparent links to Greek security services."  In France, "a wiretap of an official who was believed to be involved in a political corruption case was found to be illegal in February by a Paris appeals court." In Spain,  "the press published allegedly leaked official documents suggesting that the National Intelligence Agency (CESID) intercepted and recorded telephone conversations between 1984 and 1991. Private calls made by the King, various ministers, and other prominent figures were apparently taped and stored at CESID. The scandal resulted in the resignation of CESID's director, the Minister of Defense, and the Vice President."<BR>
<BR>
In Turkey, a partial state of "emergency rule" has abrogated constitutional rights, "in the 10 provinces under emergency rule, the regional governor can and does empower security authorities to search without a warrant residences or the premises of political parties, businesses, associations, or other organizations."<P>
<H3><B>Near East and North Africa</H3>
</B><BR>
Only nine of the eighteen countries in the region have constitutionally protected privacy rights. Another three countries are reported to have legal protections.  Illegal wiretapping is prevalent in the region, with fifteen countries having reports of violations.<BR>
<BR>
In many of the countries with constitutional and legal protections, massive abuses occur anyway. In Egypt, "the Emergency Law has abridged the constitutional provisions regarding the right to privacy...The Emergency Law empowers the Government to place wiretaps, intercept mail and search persons or places without warrants. Security agencies frequently place political activists, suspected subversives, journalists, foreigners, and writers under surveillance, screen their correspondence (especially international mail), search them and their homes, and confiscate personal property."  In Syria, "the Emergency Law authorizes the security services to enter homes and conduct searches with warrants if security matters&#139;very broadly defined&#139;are involved. The security services selectively monitor telephone conversations and facsimile transmissions, and interfere with the mail. The Government opens mail destined for both citizens and foreign residents. It also prevents the delivery of human rights materials." In Yemen, "despite constitutional provisions against government interference with privacy, security forces routinely search homes and private offices, monitor telephones, read personal mail, and otherwise intrude into personal matters for alleged security reasons. Such activities are conducted without legally issued warrants or judicial supervision. Security forces regularly monitor telephone conversations and have interfered with the telephone service of government critics and opponents."<BR>
<BR>
Some countries have began steps to improve their situation.  In Lebanon,  "the Prime Minister announced that he would refer cases to the Prosecutor-General to prevent the intelligence services from tapping telephone conversations. Additionally, in a note to the Post and Telecommunications Ministry, the Prime Minister said that he would hold private cellular phone companies responsible should they allow government agencies to tap cellular phones without warrants."<P>
<H3><B>South Asia</H3>
</B>In this region, three out of eight countries have constitutionally protected privacy rights. Another three countries have legal protections. In half of the countries, there are reports of illegal wiretaps.<BR>
<BR>
In India, "The Indian Telegraph Act authorizes the surveillance of communications, including monitoring telephone conversation and intercepting personal mail&#139;in case of public emergency or "in the interest of the public safety or tranquillity." These powers have been used by every state government." In Pakistan, "the Government maintains several domestic intelligence services which monitor politicians, political activists, suspected terrorists, and suspected foreign intelligence agents. Credible reports indicate that the authorities commonly resort to wiretapping and occasionally intercept and open mail. On July 1, the Government suspended cellular phone, card pay phone, and pager services in Karachi and Hyderabad. The Government accused the MQM/A and criminals of using these services to commit crimes in Sindh." <P>
<H3><B>Conclusion</H3>
</B>Overall, the report paints a grim picture of a worldwide lack of government respect for privacy rights.  Flouting internationally recognized rights and ignoring their own laws and constitutions, governments in developing and developed  countries continue to abuse rights in the name of national security or other reasons. <BR>

<p>
<b>Additional Information :</b><p>
<p>
Age 14/9/95 : A new command and control system being supplied to Victoria
Police, Australia. By 2001, each police car is expected to have a portable
personal computer. The PC will link up with the $160 million computer generated
call-taking and dispatch system being tested by Intergraph. Using satellite
technology every police car in Melbourne will be tracked along screens staffed
by civilians.  The computers will help operators decide which patrol cars to
send to incidents. Thanks to a giant computer driven map of the city being
compiled by Intergraph, the operators will be able to tell police all the
relevant details about the address they visit. Officers will know immediately
whether, for example, the owner is known to the police or if weapons are
inside. Eventually it may provide plans of the house in case of sieges.<p>
<p>
 Times 20/9/91 : Command and Control systems developed by Intergraph (US). The
most sophisticated police computer installed in Britain, that should play an
important role in tackling inner-city riots was unveiled by the Cleveland
police force. The heart of the computer is a geographic information system
which, when an incident is restored, can instantly display a map showing
streets, buildings and incident's location. The map also shows the locations of
police vehicles and officers. Plans to link police vehicles to the system,
providing more secure communications than radio and also plans to introduce a
facility for tracing telephone calls. The system, developed by Intergraph and
supplied to US Forces, is able to turn two dimensional plans of buildings into
three dimensional drawings.<p>
<p>
 IPEC 91 : Dispatch management system (DMS) "the most advanced command &amp;
control system of its kind in the world" - chosen by Cleveland Constabulary.
DMS integrates dynamic mapping into the dispatching process + relational
database, also video frame grabber &amp; geographic information system (GIS).<p>

CCTV Vol 1.3 : Contract to supply Spain's Basque Police with system for the
transmission of data between mobile policing situations.<p>
<p>
<b>Additional Information :</b><p>
<p>
CCTV Vol 1.3 : TV2 Ltd supplies a range of broadcast facilities and equipment.
Announced a contract to supply Basque Police. Aerlyper SA (Madrid, Spain) leads
the contract. The system is to provide transmission of data between mobile
police situation, in particular sending live video and thermal pictures
integrated with GPS data between the ground, aircraft and control centres.  TV2
is supplying a range of wireless camera systems, microwave and communications
equipment as well as a Global Autotracker intelligent antenna system. The
Global Autotracker sends pictures from a police helicopter approx three times
further than conventional microwave antenna systems, so extending the practical
range of operation. It also offers police the capacity to send on the same
signal a range of data such as time, date and grid reference, thus reducing the
need for radio talk. Because it is highly directional, it has a high degree of
built-in security from unauthorised interception.<p>
<p>
 Copex 94 : Live microwave transmission for security and surveillance. In
addition to consultancy and systems interrogation, TV2 offers a range of
intelligent, steerable antenna systems, called Global Autotracker, for live
transmission over distances up to 140Km. Already in use with UK and European
police forces, the Global Autotracker has also been commissioned by Defence
Ministries.<p>
