<p> Ethnographic techniques allow researchers to study how
environmental and cultural factors affect values, attitudes, and
behaviors of individuals and groups. Historically, ethnography
has roots in both anthropology and sociology (see box 7-1). </p>

<p> ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDIES OF ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG USE </p>

<p> Since the 1960s the number of drug ethnographies has grown
steadily. Many of the nation's social issues were in one way or
another associated with drug use: poverty, urban unrest among
minorities, counter culture, failure of social programs, AIDS
transmission, and urban violence. Research conducted by
anthropologists and qualitative sociologists was an important
part of understanding new drug-related social problems and
trends. By the mid-1970s, &quot;street ethnography&quot; or
simply &quot;ethnography&quot; were the terms commonly used to
describe the drug research they were conducting in the United
States (60). </p>

<p> Alcohol </p>

<p> Nineteenth century and early twentieth century
anthropologists conducted comprehensive community studies in
nonindustrial societies in which they recorded ritual and social
uses of alcohol. This extensive but generally unfocused
documentation provided data for later cross- cultural analyses
relating alcohol use patterns to other cultural variables. </p>

<p> The contribution of ethnographic studies conducted outside
the United States was to provide data on the social conditioning
of alcohol's effects. The findings from one such study conducted
in </p>

<p> Bolivia during 1958, alerted the alcohol research community
to the existence of culturally accepted alcohol use patterns
quite different from those customarily encountered in the United
States. For example, &quot;virtually all of the Camba (of eastern
Bolivia) drink to the point of passing out, at least twice a
month.&quot; Although the beverage they drink is stronger in
alcoholic concentration than that customarily drunk by other
populations, there appeared to be no major health or social
problems associated with their drinking (35). </p>

<p> These data along with findings from research on four other
societies (the Aritama of Colombia, the Ifaluk of Micronesia, the
Takashima of Japan, and the town of Juxtlahuaca in Oaxaca,
Mexico), support the view that the experiential effect of alcohol
is socially conditioned (37). Each of these societies possessed
distinct messages regarding the use of alcohol, which were clear
and consistent. In contrast, individuals in modern societies are
influenced by overlapping, and sometimes contradictory, social
messages based on religious, ethnic, occupational, generational,
regional, and class differences. Drinking habits and behaviors
within the United States vary enormously. </p>

<p> Since the 1970s, ethnographic research on alcohol use in the
United States has concentrated on specifying and explaining the
variations in American drinking patterns. Some ethnographers have
focused on specific subcultures defined by their problematic
alcohol use (53). Other ethnographers have focused on alcohol
beliefs and behaviors in ethnically, religiously, and
professionally constituted subcultures-- usually exploring the
adaptation of culturally sanctioned drinking patterns, passed on
through family and community modeling, to changing social
contexts (5). </p>

<p> Heroin </p>

<p> The majority of ethnography studies conducted in the 1960s
focused on heroin use. Several of these studies challenged the
accepted perception &quot;that heroin provides an escape for the
user from his psychological problems and from the
responsibilities of social and personal relationships--in short,
an escape from life&quot; (47). Researchers documented drug use
as a way of life, rather than just as an escape from life. Two
such articles, based on three years of field work in Oakland,
California, detailed several distinct patterns or styles among
heroin users. Varying levels of prestige were associated with
these different styles, and heroin users at the top of the
hierarchy were observed to work hard to maintain their lifestyles
(54,55). </p>

<p> Another study in New York City, New York, in the late 1960s,
asked why heroin use periodically mushroomed, in epidemic
proportions, in lower class communities. The data revealed that,
regardless of ethnic background, in poor neighborhoods
&quot;there are pressures on adolescent boys to live up to the
ideals of toughness, strength, daring, and the willingness to
challenge the bleak fate of being poor.&quot; Simply put,
&quot;movement into heroin use was one route to becoming a
`somebody' in the eyes of the important people who comprised the
slum social network&quot; (20). Later articles elaborated on the
idea of so-called street status. Based on 4 years of research, a
hierarchy of illicit drugs was defined by perceived risk
components, such as physical harm, addiction potential, parental
discovery, police, and intragroup dangers. The use of drugs
perceived by the group to be risky, increased a user's personal
status within that group. The researcher concluded that reliance
on legal sanctions and scare tactics to reduce the use of certain
drugs will only make the use of these drugs appear more daring
and hence to some, more attractive (21,23). </p>

<p> Cocaine and Crack </p>

<p> Although ethnographers noted that cocaine use was on the rise
among some middle-class professionals and drug experimenters by
the mid 1970s, it was not until the 1980s that extensive studies
on cocaine users were begun. </p>

<p> While some of these early users, many of whom were white,
progressed from experimental use of cocaine to heavy use with
subsequent biological and behavioral problems, many others did
not (57,58). Several years later, though, middle- class users
with cocaine-related problems were becoming more common,
prompting many would-be experimenters to steer clear of the drug.
During this same time period, cocaine smuggling escalated,
resulting in increased availability, lower prices, and higher
quality. Within low-income, minority communities, cocaine
smoking, first as free-base and then as crack, grew so
precipitously that it was commonly called an epidemic. In New
York City, ethnographers provided complementary perspectives on
the rapidly changing crack culture. </p>

<p> In a series of ethno-historical articles, Ansley Hamid
documented the history of cocaine smoking as it evolved in lower
income minority neighborhoods in New York City. Among the
elements identified as central to the widespread diffusion of
crack smoking was the interest shown by heroin injectors with
collapsed veins in the concentrated high of smoked cocaine; the
entry of Rastafarian marijuana distributors into the cocaine
trade; the emergence of young, nonusing street distributors able
to sell unit doses in vials at relatively low prices; and the
rise in crack prices due to increased demand combined with
suppliers who had greater control over the market. Hamid believes
the rise and fall of cocaine smoking to have followed a
developmental cycle similar to that of heroin use between 1964
and 1972 and marijuana use in the 1960s and 1970s (31,32,33,34). </p>

<p> A 1992 study of crack use focused on the children of crack
users. It found that the extended family networks in the African
American community, a major source of stability and support, were
being overwhelmed by the drug crisis as the number of children
whose mothers were no longer able to care for them because of
increased drug use. Further, children exposed to drug-taking
behavior by adults may be more likely to display similar
behavior. In one family headed by a 60- year-old woman, an adult
son was a crack dealer and a daughter was a crack-abusing
prostitute (18). </p>

<p> Hallucinogens </p>

<p> Most ethnographic studies of hallucinogens and mind-altering
drugs (e.g., peyote, mescaline, mushrooms) have focused on tribal
societies. Anthropologists have uniformly found that the use of
hallucinogens was socially approved and integrated into the
religious and social life of the community. If one defines abuse
as use of a drug in such a way that it interferes with physical,
economic, or social functions, then little if any evidence points
to drug abuse among tribally organized peoples (1,27,15,42). </p>

<p> Other than scattered studies of hallucinogenic drug use among
hippies (12,14,45,46), few ethnographic studies have been
completed on use of hallucinogenic substances in American
society. However, the persistent use of lysergic acid
diethylamide (LSD) by some young people, and concerns that its
use may be increasing, have sparked new interest among
ethnographers (30,38). </p>

<p> Marijuana </p>

<p> As with hallucinogens, most of the ethnographic research on
marijuana use has been conducted outside the United States. Much
of it was initiated in the 1960s and 1970s, when increasing use
of marijuana among American youth led researchers to question the
social and medical consequences of marijuana use, especially
long-term use. Research was conducted in countries in which
marijuana use was long standing and widespread, such as Brazil,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, Jamaica, Mexico, Rwanda, and South
Africa (11,16,17, 51). </p>

<p> In Jamaica, for example, anthropologists Vera Rubin and
Lambros Comitas directed a research team of 45 social scientists
and medical professionals to conduct original ethnographic
research at several field sites, in addition to medical,
psychological, and psychiatric testing in hospitals and clinics.
Their controversial findings were that none of the deleterious
social or medical consequences believed by many to be associated
with the drug in the United States could be found among Jamaican
users: </p>

<p> .?.?. There is no evidence of any causal relationship between
cannabis use and mental deterioration, insanity, violence or
poverty; or that widespread cannabis use in Jamaica produces an
apathetic, indolent class of people. In fact, the ganja complex
provides an adaptive mechanism by which many Jamaicans cope with
limited life chances in a harsh environment (52). </p>

<p> Other than a few studies of middle-class users (10,39) and
young African American dealers (24,25), substantial U.S.
ethnographic research on marijuana use in the United States has
been generally lacking, despite the fact that marijuana has been
the most commonly used illicit substance for decades. </p>

<p> Phencyclidine (PCP) </p>

<p> An ethnographic study in 1979 of PCP users is frequently
cited for its substantive findings and methodological
contribution as the first multisite ethnographic drug study.
Initiating the study when PCP use was believed to be spreading
among white working-class and middle-class young people, the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) contracted for a
four-city ethnographic study of PCP users not in treatment. After
3 months of working in Miami, Florida, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, Chicago, Illinois, and Seattle, Washington,
ethnographers documented groups of users and the underlying
social processes. They found that it was relatively rare for a
young person to use PCP exclusively. Use occurred mainly within
socially distinctive groups of young people who displayed &quot;a
kind of restlessness, an orientation for action, and a sense that
life generally was boring, uninteresting, and lacked recreational
activities&quot; (22). </p>

<p> The young people studied were very knowledgeable about drug
effects and understood that the PCP drug experience varied
dramatically with dosage. Low doses of the drug were reported by
different user groups to be mildly euphoric and hallucinogenic
like LSD, or sedating like barbiturates. What concerned regular
PCP users was not the acute adverse effects reported in the media
(e.g., psychotic episodes, assaultive outburst, irreparable
harm), but rather &quot;burning out&quot;--a &quot;spacey&quot;
state accompanied by incoherent thoughts, forgetfulness, and
memory loss. As burnout became apparent, individual users and
groups of users consciously cut back their PCP use. Within this
group, violent episodes were found to be rare, mainly involving
efforts by law enforcement or hospital treatment staff to
restrain users, thereby seeming to set off panic reactions and
struggle. </p>

<p> The study suggested that a significant gap existed between
official agencies responsible for drug education and prevention
and street drug users. When PCP use increased dramatically in the
mid 1970s, there were no official responses because quantitative
national data sources, such as surveys of high school students
and hospital emergency reports, failed to include PCP as a
separate drug. When the official agencies recognized the
widespread use of PCP, their prevention efforts were viewed by
users as distorted and were discounted. Ethnographers attribute
the eventual decline in PCP use to &quot;the general consensus
among users themselves on the negative features of its long-term
effects rather than the kind of expert opinion that accompanies
legitimate efforts at prevention&quot; (22). </p>

<p> SOCIAL CONTEXT OF DRUG USE </p>

<p> Specificity in Drug Abuse Research </p>

<p> As more questions are asked about alcohol and other drug use,
it becomes clear that drug use is not one phenomenon, but many.
There is no generic pattern of drug use; rather, there is use of
specific drugs in specific situations. </p>

<p> Quantitative researchers frequently use ethnic categories to
increase study specificity. While studies on different ethnic
groups are useful, often the definitions of ethnicity vary and
the concept is employed uncritically. Moreover, most of the
quantitative researchers using the concept of ethnicity
implicitly assume what anthropologists call a &quot;static&quot;
concept of culture, viewing ethnicity as a trait one is born
with, an unchanging characteristic, like hair color or body type.
In contrast, most ethnographers view culture as &quot;a dynamic
process through which individuals and societies learn the sum
total of their society's behaviors and associated belief systems,
including those encompassing drug use practices and beliefs&quot;
(4). </p>

<p> Many recent ethnographic studies focus on socially meaningful
units in which members share social statuses, behaviors, and
attitudes. For example, a recent book on drug use among Hispanics
included ethnographic accounts of Cuban so-called streetside drug
use in Miami, Florida, drug use among male and female gang
members from the East Los Angeles, California, barrios, and drug
use and dealing among low-income Puerto Ricans in New York City,
New York, and Chicago, Illinois. (28). </p>

<p> Inclusiveness in Drug Abuse Research </p>

<p> One drawback of studying increasingly specific drug-using
communities is losing sight of the larger whole. Ethnographic
drug studies at times fail to link the customs of the specific
study communities to customs in other communities or to place the
customs in a larger framework. A way that both highlights and
critiques the contribution of ethnography in the field of drug
research is to focus on the social relationships around drug use,
specifically, on the pattern of use in relation to
self-identification with a social group. In the ethnographic
literature, four basic patterns appear: </p>

<p> o Individuals who use drugs with others who share an
identification with a lifestyle or subculture in which drug use
is the central component. </p>

<p> o Individuals who use drugs with others who share an
identification with a lifestyle or subculture in which drug use
is customary and openly accepted, but not the central component. </p>

<p> o Individuals who use drugs with friends and acquaintances,
but there is no self-identification with a drug-using lifestyle
or subculture. </p>

<p> o Individuals who use drugs by themselves while maintaining
self-identification with a group that stigmatizes drug use (see
table 7-1). </p>

<p> Drug Use Within a Drug Subculture </p>

<p> Numerous studies have documented that, for pragmatic and
social reasons, individuals whose lives have become oriented to a
drug often associate with others who use the drug in a similar
fashion. Over time a subculture develops with specialized
knowledge, norms, and expectations. Individuals think of
themselves as belonging to the subculture, and others define them
as such. &quot;Where subcultures exist, social-psychological
barriers separate participants from onlookers&quot; (13). It has
often been noted, for example, that for many heroin users, use of
the drug overrode background characteristics, such as race,
class, and national origin, to become the defining
characteristic. As one heroin user related: </p>

<p> I always refer to myself as a junkie, even when I'm not
hooked on anything. And when you're introduced to somebody for
the first time the first thing you find out is whether he's a
junkie or not. It's like belonging to some fantastic lodge, you
know, but the initiation ceremony is a lot rougher (57). </p>

<p> However, even within a drug-using subculture variations
exist, especially with regard to frequency and amount of use.
This difference was emphasized by a 38-year-old regular heroin
user from New York City: </p>

<p> .?.?. all heroin addicts are not heroin abusers, okay? And
you get the abuser, he's a dog, right? He's the one who sits in
the drug house and shoots all day long. That's an abuser. I'm a
visitor, you never catch me in the drug house. Not me, no (41). </p>

<p> A similar distinction was made by a female crack user, who,
although her life revolved around crack, was still attractive,
healthy, in a relationship, and the social center of a network of
users. In contrast, for her: </p>

<p> The crack addict is the person who's lost all sense of what's
going on. They are like zombies. They are out there standing in
the pouring rain. If it's cold and snowing, they'll be walking up
and down out there .?.?.?. They are .?.?. to the point of
desperation where they will take off [rob] people they know. They
will set you up. It comes to the point where they will set up
family, friends, anybody--the point where they don't care anymore
(61). </p>

<p> One ethnographer noted that these types of individuals were
attempting &quot;to become `visitors' in social networks of other
users, to establish a degree of contact and membership while
remaining somewhat detached from the network. Their attempts to
remain partially marginal to both street and straight society are
a central part of their strategies for controlling their use and
their own lives&quot; (41). </p>

<p> Drug Use as Part of a Lifestyle or Identity </p>

<p> Drug use often occurs within a lifestyle or subculture
inwhich drug use is common and accepted, but is not the defining
characteristic. The subculture may be professionally oriented.
For example, some of the earliest drug research was done among
jazz musicians (2,62). Anabolic steroid use was common among
professional and amateur athletes in certain sports (29). During
its peak, cocaine use was rampant among entertainers. </p>

<p> In one study, a waitress at a rock-and-roll bar called
cocaine use an &quot;occupational hazard.&quot; She and other
restaurant workers in the study described how groups of workers
would pool funds to purchase small amounts of cocaine for use
while working: &quot;For them. ?.?. hard work, constant activity,
and long, late hours seemed instrumental to their cocaine
use&quot; (59). </p>

<p> Recent research has documented that at times the nuclear or
extended family may act as the subcultural unit in which illicit
drug use is common and accepted. </p>

<p> We was with my mother over her girlfriend's house when Aunt
Jeannie came by and she had some coke. She cooked it up and told
Ma and Ruth to try it. After that things started goin' crazier. I
had to take care of my oldest sister's two sons, my son, and my
younger brother. I had to do everything. Most of the time we
didn't have nothin' to eat. We stayed hungry all the time. When I
washed clothes I'd find vials in her [mother's] pockets.. ?.?. I
`member comin' home one day and she'd been smokin' for awhile
then, but the house was full of people smokin' all over the
place. I went to go to my bedroom and close the door and it was
full too. I said to her, `what's happenin'? I just turned round
and left. I was tired, the house was dirty with vials on the
floor and the tables and I'd just had my son.. ?.?. I just wanted
to get away.. ?.?. At first I had smoked some crack to kill my
appetite, to keep me from bein' hungry. ?.?. I just felt like I
couldn't take it no more so I took my son to my sister and left </p>

<p> .?.?. I went on a binge and smoked for three months. Nobody
knew where I was, but I was out smoking crack and gettin' money
anyway I could get it (18). </p>

<p> Drug Use With Partners and Peers </p>

<p> Drug use can also occur when there is no subcultural support
or membership in a group that approves of drug use. In some
cases, an orientation toward, or acceptance of, drug use may have
been acquired earlier in life when the individual was part of a
drug-accepting subculture: former hippies, student drug users, or
participants in street life. Such individuals may continue their
drug use long after ending their other associations with the
subcultures. </p>

<p> Recently reported by ethnographers is the recreational use of
MDMA (Ecstasy) by some middle-class individuals. </p>

<p> Some professionals, particularly those whose ideas about
drugs were formulated during the 1960s, quietly view psychoactive
substances as one of many ways to relax, to relate, to &quot;kick
back.&quot; It is within this context, coupled with the need to
relax fast and relate quickly, that Ecstasy is used (50). </p>

<p> Drug Use in Social Isolation </p>

<p> Last, some individuals use illicit drugs primarily by
themselves. Often they identify themselves with a professional
subculture or social group that is opposed to drug use. One
well-documented pattern is that of physicians, nurses, and other
health workers who illicitly use psychoactive pharmaceutical
drugs, especially narcotics (63,64). </p>

<p> Other patterns of use in social isolation are known but
poorly documented in the ethnographic literature. Unsupervised
use of pharmaceutical drugs is fairly common and often the line
between licitly obtained and illicitly obtained drugs can be
blurred. Emergency room and family physicians, for example,
encounter suspected middle-class prescription drug abusers. One
middle-class housewife interviewed as part of a study of
emergency room drug episodes began her use of prescription pain
killers because of a back problem, and then continued chronic
(and essentially unsupervised) use of the drug for years by
obtaining prescriptions from multiple physicians (49). </p>

<p> Typology as a Whole </p>

<p> The ethnographic method of describing how and, to some
extent, why people use drugs differs from the purely quantitative
method that analyzes the association of drug use with the social
and demographic characteristics of the users. </p>

<p> To date, most of the ethnographic research has concentrated
on drug-focused subcultures or on crime-related subcultures.
There are few studies on other populations, and many of these are
now dated. For example, there have been no significant
ethnographic studies of student drug use in almost two decades.
The drug problem has been defined in the public mind and among
some funding sources as a problem of poor minority communities.
Some ethnographers acknowledge that, to some extent, their own
attitudes have contributed to the skewing of the drug research as
well. Ethnographic field work with drug-focused and criminal
subcultures is considered by some to be more adventurous and
professionally rewarding. Also, in its own way, it may be easier
than field work in the general population, since study
participants can be readily delineated from onlookers and
subjects can be relatively easily located on the street or
through their relationship with treatment and law enforcement
agencies. </p>

<p> One consequence of the absence of information concerning drug
use within the general population is that, like a self-
fulfilling prophecy, attention continues to be paid almost
exclusively to minority drug use. Drug use and drug users are
defined as the &quot;other,&quot; different from the rest of
society. Ethnographers have paid relatively little attention to
the relationship between culturally approved drug use (e.g.,
caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, psychoactive prescription drugs) and
illicit drug use. </p>

<p> Another consequence is that there are few data available on
which to base prevention programs for individuals who are
unlikely to become members of a drug or criminal subculture.
Virtually nothing is known about experimenters, casual users,
controlled users, or chronic users not associated with a drug
subculture. </p>

<p> POVERTY, RACISM, AND CYCLE OF ABUSE </p>

<p> The preceding section outlined a variety of drug using
contexts in the United States and documented the presence of drug
use and abuse among different social, racial, and ethnic classes.
Equally important, however, is the realization that the
consequences of drug abuse are especially devastating in
chronically poor, often minority, communities. While poverty as
an individual risk factor for substance abuse is described in
chapter 6, this section considers ethnographic observations on
the links between the poverty of the inner-city communities and
substance abuse. </p>

<p> The Social Context of Poverty </p>

<p> Drug ethnographers have noted that urban poverty means more
than lacking money. Often it means living in substandard housing
in communities that lack basic municipal services, and for young
people it usually means attending overcrowded, underfunded,
demoralized schools. Researchers regard illicit drug use,
especially the use of heroin, cocaine, and crack, as both a
result of oppressive social conditions and a cause of the
worsening of these conditions. </p>

<p> To cope with difficult social circumstances, ethnographers
have documented the effective utilization of extended family
networks and kin relationships. However, even with these
safeguards, it is not uncommon for children to encounter
alcoholism, other drug use, depression, physical abuse and
neglect, sexual abuse, and other traumatic experiences. </p>

<p> Lack of Opportunity </p>

<p> In ethnographic life histories of men and women who become
deeply involved with illicit drugs, the characteristic of
inner-city life most often mentioned is the lack of opportunity
for meaningful work. For example, an ethnographer studying heroin
addicts in the early 1970s noted: </p>

<p> Often in interviews with addicts I have thought that this
antiwork attitude was a sour-grapes defense because so few have
had meaningful work experiences and many do not consider
good-paying or creative jobs work, but I think that these
attitudes are more than psychological mechanisms. They are, I
believe, deeper in the fabric of our society and arise out of
poverty and the reality of poor, uneducated persons who can only
expect the most dull, stultifying, and meaningless work. Most, I
would expect, held these attitudes before their addiction and
when they became addicted simply added another good reason not to
pursue something that offered so little (56). </p>

<p> More recently, ethnographers studying the crack subculture,
have related changes in drug use patterns to structural changes
in the world economy. For many inner-city residents the difficult
economic situation of the 1950s and 1960s became impossible in
the 1970s and 1980s, as many of the secure semiskilled and
unskilled jobs shifted overseas. New York City, for example, lost
a half million manufacturing jobs and 100,000 jobs in wholesale
and retail trade between 1967 and 1987 (36). For individuals
without post secondary degrees, jobs that could support a family
became scarce. </p>

<p> Because of the structural shifts, basic expectations around
work have changed dramatically: </p>

<p> The option of a steady, legal job appears so distant for
inner-city high-school dropouts (and even graduates), that they
cease job searches after a few attempts or experiences in
low-wage jobs. Adult household members can rarely provide
concrete assistance in finding jobs or help in accessing networks
of employers (19). </p>

<p> Racism </p>

<p> Clearly a person need not be a member of a racial or ethnic
minority group to use drugs. Much of the early ethnographic
research was done on white heroin-using individuals (20,21,48) or
with mixed ethnic and racial backgrounds samples (47, 20,56).
Nonetheless, many ethnographers introduce race as an explanatory
element. It is not used in the genetic or biological sense but
rather that racial discrimination has shaped the social context
and opportunity structure for many people of color. Ethnographers
cite the indirect racism of some politicians who have been
unresponsive to the worsening social conditions of schools,
housing, and municipal services in many minority communities.
Also reported is the active racism encountered by many minority
people in daily life (9,8). </p>

<p> Ethnographers describe inner-city minority residents as
having a pervasive sense of not fitting into white mainstream
society. Within most poor inner-city communities, whites are
rarely encountered except as representatives of conventional
institutions such as police, teachers, and social workers. </p>

<p> Development of an Oppositional Culture </p>

<p> While oppressive social conditions, limited economic
opportunities, and racism are identified by ethnographers as
contributing to the high prevalence of drug abuse in the inner
city, in and of themselves they offer little insight into the
specific attitudes and behaviors of those involved in illicit
drug use. For this, ethnographers have often relied on the notion
of an oppositional culture, one of resistance or refusal. </p>

<p> Some ethnographers argue that amidst oppression and
exclusion, minorities, such as blacks, Hispanics, and American
Indians, develop &quot;a collective identity or sense of
peoplehood in opposition to the social identity of white
Americans.&quot; Developed in tandem with this oppositional
social identity is a cultural frame of reference that defines
&quot;certain forms of behavior and certain activities or events,
symbols, and meanings&quot; as not appropriate because they are
characteristic of white Americans while &quot;other forms of
behaviors and other events, symbols, and meanings [are defined]
as more appropriate because they are not a part of white
Americans way of life. To behave in the manner defined as falling
within a white cultural frame of reference is to `act white' and
is negatively sanctioned&quot; (26). </p>

<p> Many ethnographers studying inner-city communities argue that
illicit drug use is embedded in an oppositional culture, formed
in response to oppressive social conditions and lack of
opportunity. Ethnographer Terry Williams explains: </p>

<p> .?.?.?to some extent, it is possible to see the violence,
crime, and substance abuse that plague the inner city as
manifestations of resistance to a society perceived as white,
racist, and economically exclusive. This could be called a
culture of refusal. The young people in the crackhouses refuse to
be part of the system, refuse to obey their parents, reject
school or any adult-controlled education or training, spurn
prevailing social values and most authority. In the crackhouses,
teenagers and adults refuse to obey the law, refuse to stay
sober, refuse to engage in safe sexual practices--even though
this refusal leads them to behaviors that are manifestly harmful
both physiologically and psychologically (61). </p>

<p> Cycle of Abuse </p>

<p> Attraction of the Drug </p>

<p> Ethnographers have emphasized three factors to help explain
the use of illicit drugs, especially heroin and crack by poor,
inner-city, and minority populations. </p>

<p> First, ethnographers report that as the use of a drug begins
to spread through a community, its use is seen as a status symbol
within the street hierarchy. Many ethnographers attributed the
quick expansion of cocaine smoking that occurred in the middle
1980s to cocaine's reputation as a high-status drug, especially
when smoked or free based (23). </p>

<p> Second, initiation into drug use almost always occurred
through an established friendship or kin relationship. Virtually
every ethnographic study of drug use quotes users as saying: I
was at a party (or with a friend) and someone offered me some
heroin (cocaine, crack), so I tried it. </p>

<p> The third theme is simply that many people, when they try
heroin or crack cocaine, like it. For some individuals, at least
in the beginning, their drug experiences are more highly valued
than anything else in their lives (6,61). </p>

<p> Several ethnographers have suggested that once crack became
available at relatively low cost in the late 1980s, the sharp
rise in its use was due primarily to the intensity of the drug
experience, comparable in somatic effect to arterial injection.
The drug's effects attracted intravenous drug users with
collapsed veins or with concerns about HIV transmission, as well
as many nonintravenous drug users (23,40,43). </p>

<p> Slide Into Abuse </p>

<p> In explaining the slide of inner-city residents into drug
abuse, addiction, and dependency, ethnographers have highlighted
two complementary themes. One theme explains the function drug
dependency serves in simplifying and giving meaning to a drug
user's life. Stated succinctly: &quot;The euphoria of heroin and
the excitement of hustling serve many addicts in the same way
that jobs, sex, and consumption serve nonaddicts&quot; (56). </p>

<p> A similar conclusion was drawn by another ethnographer
studying crack use patterns: </p>

<p> Substance abuse in general, and crack in particular, offer
the equivalent of a millenarian metamorphosis. Instantaneously
users are transformed from being unemployed, depressed high
school drop-outs, despised by the world--and secretly convinced
that their failure is due to their own inherent stupidity,
&quot;racial laziness&quot; and disorganization-- into being a
mass of heart palpitating pleasure, followed only minutes later
by a jaw-gnashing crash and wide awake alertness that provides
their life with concrete purpose: get more crack--fast! (8). </p>

<p> The complementary perspective emphasizes the lack of a viable
lifestyle alternative to drug use. One researcher contends that
due to the unequal distribution of viable nonaddict social roles
in society, some groups will have more difficulty in recovery
than others: </p>

<p> For example, a white, middle-class, high-school-educated,
male addict will have more personal and social resources to draw
from when he decides to give up drugs than will a Chicano addict
living in a barrio. In fact, a relatively uneducated Chicano
addict may opt to retain the junkie- dealer role and identity
because it provides him with greater status and financial rewards
than any other social role available to him (7). </p>

<p> End of the Cycle </p>

<p> Despite little improvement in the social conditions of many
inner cities, recent journalistic accounts, ethnographic studies,
and reports from surveillance systems indicate that the
prevalence of crack use may be decreasing. Ethnographers report
that for many individuals, the initial appeal of crack use has
faded. &quot;Youths under 16 have made a new pastime of
ridiculing or beating up crackheads who they say disgrace
neighborhoods or are nuisances or thieves. Five years ago,
youngsters their age had initiated crack use after first becoming
distributors, as youngsters had previously been drawn into heroin
use&quot; (34). </p>

<p> Ethnographers present several possible explanations for this
downturn. Epidemiologically, a parallel could be drawn to the
decrease seen in bacteria-based epidemics, where all individuals
most likely to be infected have been. Economically, it could be
argued that all possible wealth to be extracted from the inner
city has been. There are simply fewer resources for drug
traffickers, smugglers, and importers. </p>

<p> A complementary explanation is based on concepts put forward
25 years ago (3). It was argued that the social consequences
resulting from a drug's use could be related to the historical
stage of the drug's introduction in society. Most importantly,
over time, a subculture of drug users develops &quot;.?.?.
material on how to obtain and ingest the drug, definitions of the
typical effects, the typical course of the experience, and the
permanence of the effects.. ?.?.&quot; In the case of marijuana
and LSD, this type of shared information may have accounted for
the sharp decrease in reported psychotic reactions even though
the actual number of users was increasing. </p>

<p> This subculture can also define certain drugs or styles of
use as dangerous. For example, ethnographers argue that the
downturn in cocaine use in the late 1980s among middle- and
working-class individuals was due to the belief that
&quot;cocaine can mess you up,&quot; and that this subculture of
users understood this warning as more than just propaganda of
prevention proponents (59). </p>

<p> This same process may be occurring in inner-city communities
among the subculture of crack users. Researchers note that the
crack epidemic has followed a predictable developmental cycle,
previously seen with heroin use, &quot;characterized by periods
of onset, incubation, widespread diffusion, peak, and decline.
The final stage is stabilization at reduced levels of use&quot;
(34). </p>

<p> In exploring the devastation caused by crack epidemics on
inner-city communities, ethnographers have called attentionto the
process through which harm-reducing information develops within a
subculture of users. For example, among middle-class,
cocaine-using individuals, many users gained information from
conventional sources (such as books, magazines, and even
scholarly journals) on the progression of cocaine dependence,
long-term negative consequences, danger signals, and methods to
control or end use. This information then spread through the
wider user community. In contrast, researchers note that the
inner-city subculture of crack users paid little attention to
conventional information sources and were ideologically
predisposed to discount what information did reach them. While
there was no deficit of warnings about the dangers of crack use
in the popular media, ethnographers observed that little effort
was made to translate prevention information into more
appropriate media messages for inner-city communities. </p>

<p> FUTURE RESEARCH </p>

<p> Over the past 30 years, ethnographers have contributed to the
understanding of substance abuse research through their work
among different countries and among different subpopulations in
the United States. However, some additional contributions could
be made in the following areas. </p>

<p> Filling in the Gaps </p>

<p> The earlier sections on the social contexts of drug use
emphasized that drug use in the United States is much more than
heroin and cocaine in the inner cities and LSD in the suburbs.
Research is needed, for example, on middle-class prescription
abusers, substance abusers in rural areas, and hidden populations
(e.g., homeless, runaways, dropouts); since many of these
individuals are either excluded from, or under sampled in, the
national drug abuse surveys. To further complete the matrix of
substance use and abuse in the United States, future research
could address not only those individuals whose use is
unmanageable, but individuals and communities who do not use, or
whose use is moderate and controlled. </p>

<p> Expanding Research Hypotheses </p>

<p> The documentation that cultural and societal norms, to a
large degree, shape individuals' and groups' behaviors toward
drugs use, could be used to formulate new substance abuse
research hypotheses, or expand on existing hypotheses. For
example, understanding the etiology of drug use through studies
of children will help explain initiation of drug use and provide
guidance for prevention efforts. Basic studies that document how
children come to perceive drugs are lacking. &quot;...when it
happens, how it happens. How they conceptualize, for example,
what is a drug and what is a poison, and how that changes when
they begin experimenting with drugs&quot; (44). </p>

<p> Planning Prevention Programs </p>

<p> The insight gained by ethnographic research on a community's
or subculture's view on substance use could be incorporated to a
greater degree in the needs assessment, planning, implementation,
monitoring, and evaluation components of substance abuse
prevention research. The information gained from ethnographic
research could help assure that the prevention information is
culturally appropriate not just in a generic ethnic sense, but in
terms of the specific cognitive framework and concerns of the
target audience. Additionally, the qualitative tools used in
ethnography can assist quantitative researchers in the
interpretation of substance abuse data in varying contexts. </p>

<p> Identifying Emergent Trends </p>

<p> Ethnographic research is also useful in its ability to
relatively quickly document changes in existing drug use patterns
or identify the use of new drugs by a particular subculture. This
timely information could assist in the planning of appropriate
prevention strategies. </p>

<p> SUMMARY </p>

<p> Studies on drug-using subcultures have provided a wealth of
knowledge on why, how, and who uses and abuses drugs.
Experience-based methods of data collection, such as ethnography,
provide the field of substance abuse research with unique
information on drug abuse among individuals, groups, and
communities. Some of the contributions discussed in this chapter
have been theoretical, substantive, and programmatic. </p>

<p> Ethnographic studies have documented drug use patterns
worldwide and in so doing have assisted the understanding of
societal influences on drug use. These insights have, for
example, been utilized in the planning, implementation, and to
some extent, evaluation of drug prevention programs in a variety
of different social contexts. </p>

<p> Researchers have also utilized ethnographies to follow
constantly changing drug use patterns. Moreover, ethnographers
provide valuable data on new drug use such as who is using it,
how the drug is being used, and where the probable epicenters of
the drug use are. </p>

<p> While not without methodological limitations, ethnography and
other experience-based research provide new insights into
substance abuse, as well as complimenting more quantitative
methods of data collection. </p>

<p> BOX 7-1: What is Ethnography? Ethnographic research is
descriptive, subjective, analytical, and comparative. The focus
on context is central to the ethnographic approach, explaining
how a particular behavior, institution, or process is acted on by
larger forces outside of the control of the participants. It
describes how events happen and the social life of the study
individuals. While qualitative interviewing and other more formal
methodologies are usually part of an ethnographic study,
participant observation (i.e., informally interacting with
participants and observing events as they naturally occur) is a
hallmark of ethnographic research. Studies are subjective in that
they focus on the understandings, interpretations, and world
views of the participants. Ethnographic accounts describe not
only what occurs, but also the multiple levels of distinctions by
which individuals and groups make sense of and purposively act in
the world. Ethnographic studies are also analytical. The
observations, interviews, and documents are raw data, as forms
and responses are raw data for survey statisticians. The
ethnographer's analytic responsibility is to condense and order
these data. The analytic work can include the identification of
nonobvious patterns, associations, and themes, as well as the
construction of typologies, process models, or explanatory
frameworks. Finally, ethnographic research is comparative in two
senses of the term. First, it often explores how attitudes and
behaviors are shaped by social forces in two or more contexts.
The contexts are at times spatial (two different cultures or
subcultures), at other times temporal (the same culture or
subculture at different times). Ethnographic studies are also
conducted within a research tradition, so that each new project
draws on the methods and findings of previous research. Over
time, a corpus of work develops regarding a particular cultural
community (e.g., Samoans, inner-city drug users) or a particular
topic (e.g.,witchcraft, ethnic boundaries). As new work appears
it is scrutinized for fit with the existing corpus. Lack of fit
may be attributed to differing circumstances, methodologies,
theoretical concerns, or possibly to inferior research or
analysis._ <br>

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b><font size="5">CHAPTER 8 </font></b> </p>

<p> <b><font size="5">COMMUNITY ACTIVITY SETTINGS <br>
</font></b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"> </p>

<p> This chapter reviews substance use and abuse-related research
on factors and interventions in homes, schools, workplaces,
recreational and other developmental settings, and community-wide
settings. These community activity settings are the major
physical and social arenas in communities where individuals
interact and learn their values, attitudes, and behaviors, some
of which can increase or reduce the likelihood that individuals
will use and abuse substances. The addition of treatment settings
of all types and correctional settings would provide a fairly
comprehensive and systematic overview of all the major settings
in communities. Those settings are not discussed at length in
this report, however, because of its focus primarily on
prevention, even though comprehensive prevention strategies will
almost always want to include treatment and correctional
components as well. </p>

<p> By focusing on any one of these settings, researchers
interested in substance use and abuse can study the interplay of
multiple factors in a context, and practitioners can implement
programs designed for specific settings. By examining all of
these settings together, policymakers and practitioners
interested in substance abuse and the healthy development of
individuals and communities can identify and, within available
resources, implement concrete, systematic, and comprehensive
preventive interventions for communities as a whole. The
development and strengthening of community-wide norms against the
use of substances may well be one of the more important ways to
protect individuals against the use of substances. The section on
communities discusses some of the issues and tools for
community-wide prevention planning and coordination. </p>

<p> HOMES AND FAMILIES </p>

<p> Although American society expects families in their homes to
take the lead in dealing with substance abuse and other problem
behaviors (69), families in this country generally receive only
limited outside support in protecting themselves against
substance abuse. This situation may result in part from the
belief that most nuclear families can raise their children
largely independently and therefore do not need outside support,
and in part from the belief that teens and young adults are more
influenced by their peers. The first belief, however, is not
supported by long- standing practices in most societies, where
extended families and life-long neighbors have traditionally
helped raise children (although in the United States many parents
do not have access to these additional child-rearing resources
because of urbanization, high technology, and family mobility).
And the second belief is being questioned by growing evidence
that certain parenting practices and family intervention programs
can significantly reduce the risk of substance abuse among
adolescents and young adults. </p>

<p> An extensive and growing body of research strongly suggests
that many families do need, and can benefit from, support from
outside the family, and can often protect their children from
substance abuse, even into adolescence and adulthood. While some
of the findings reported here may appear to be commonsensical,
they are presented because they have been addressed by
researchers as part of a growing body of increasingly rigorous
research. Some of the studies focus on risk and protective
factors that are known or thought to be associated with substance
use and abuse, while others focus directly on substance use and
abuse. To reduce redundancy, factors and programs discussed
elsewhere in this report are for the most part not considered
here. </p>

<p> Protective Factors </p>

<p> Families can protect against substance use and abuse by
providing close family relationships, sufficient monitoring,
clear messages about substance use and abuse, and attractive
alternatives to substance use and abuse. </p>

<p> Close Family Relationships </p>

<p> Family relationships can help protect against substance use
and abuse when they are characterized by closeness and warmth,
effective and positive discipline, and successful problem solving
and communications. For example, young people who report feeling
close to their families are less likely to abuse substances than
those who report not feeling close to their families. Parents in
such families are more likely to comfort their children when they
are afraid, have two-way communications, and give children some
say in what happens to them (83,86,152). Because such parents
spend more time with their children, there can be more conflict,
but the time spent together can also lead to greater mutual
understanding and acceptance (23,59). </p>

<p> Parents can better channel their children away from substance
use and abuse if they have routinely used effective,
age-appropriate discipline methods, including clear expectations
and rules about homework, television, curfews, and drugs and
alcohol. Such methods are particularly effective when they are
enforced by praise and encouragement, instead of by threatening,
nagging, and blaming (42,47). In contrast, ineffective or
provocative family management practices, including overly harsh
or reluctant discipline practices and inconsistent followthrough,
are associated with early sampling of substances and later abuse
(8,115). Unruly behaviors in childhood can lead children to poor
achievement in school, social rejection by more conventional
peers, and greater association with other children with behavior
problems (46). </p>

<p> Skillful handling of problems by families helps children
learn how to distance themselves from problems and address them
with specific problem-solving strategies (77). Such skills can
help children later avoid the use and abuse of substances. By
contrast, families where children eventually abuse substances do
not make decisions and solve problems as well as other families
(97). Positive caregiving and discipline can prevent negative
outcomes even for highly stressed, minority, low socioeconomic
status (SES), urban families (177). When the birth parents are
not available, effective parenting by a surrogate, relative, or
neighbor can also be protective (173). </p>

<p> Sufficient Monitoring </p>

<p> When parents or parent surrogates know how their children are
spending their time, the risk of substance abuse is low (47).
Such monitoring may prevent abuse by reducing access to
substances, preventing use of substances, or allowing parents to
identify substance use earlier and to apply sanctions. Monitoring
may also entail greater involvement by parents in their
children's lives, which may help render substance use and abuse
less appealing by enhancing feelings of trust, warmth, and
closeness in the family. Such monitoring prevents substance
sampling across ages, ethnicities, and settings. </p>

<p> Single parents and working parents are often less able to
monitor their children thoroughly, because they can be in only
one place at a time. However, grandmothers, aunts, after-school
personnel, and other caring and supportive adults can also
monitor children and help reduce deviant behaviors (59,88). Early
autonomy and unsupervised leisure time apparently increase the
risk of substance use and abuse by children. </p>

<p> Clear Messages About Effects of Substances, Including
Sanctions </p>

<p> Children are more likely to avoid the use of substances if
they know that use will bring negative outcomes, such as adverse
physical and psychological effects, disapproval, and penalties
imposed by parents. Many children develop expectations about the
effects of substances as early as the preschool years (100),
influenced primarily by their parents. Frequent parental use even
of aspirin, cold pills, prescribed psychotropic medications (85),
and cough medicine can give children positive expectations about
the effects of substances (61). </p>

<p> When parents apply reliable penalties, such as revoking
privileges, and coach their children about the adverse effects of
substances, use is likely to discontinue (6). By contrast, if the
possible adverse effects (e.g., illness and depression) are not
emphasized and few negative sanctions are applied when
adolescents first use marijuana, while the immediate experiences
are to feel pleasantly stoned and potent (87), then continued use
and adult drug problems are more likely (37). Parental
disapproval of children's alcohol use has been found to be
protective across ethnic groups (33). Increased appreciation of
risks and social disapproval of substance use is credited with
the recent downturn in cocaine and marijuana use nationally (5). </p>

<p> Attractive Alternatives to Substance Use and Abuse </p>

<p> Participation in religious and other conventional and
challenging activities can protect against substance use and
abuse (26,81,111,173). Especially important are activities about
which youth are passionate. </p>

<p> Parents are more likely to guide their children away from
substance use and abuse if parents have instilled hope in their
children to succeed as adults (172). By contrast, some children
do not look forward to and plan for adulthood, but learn only
short-term thinking (see box 8-1) and have been encouraged by
their parents to believe they cannot succeed. </p>

<p> Parents of inner-city African American children face special
difficulties in holding out hope for their children's success
through traditional opportunities. Unemployment among African
American men is almost 50 percent (24) and the marriage rate
among African American women is low and still declining (10),
with substance use and abuse among African Americans increasing
as they reach 26 to 34 years of age, instead of decreasing as
with other racial and ethnic groups (164). </p>

<p> Risk Factors </p>

<p> Families also face risk factors, such as parental neglect and
rejection, behavioral problems and crime, physical and sexual
abuse, substance abuse in the family, failure in school,
emotional problems, negative life events, early use of
substances, substance abuse in the neighborhood, and poverty,
unemployment, and homelessness. Because some of these factors are
discussed elsewhere in this report, this section will focus only
on parental neglect and rejection, physical and sexual abuse,
substance abuse in the family, negative life events, and drug
trafficking in the neighborhood. </p>

<p> Parental Neglect and Rejection </p>

<p> Children who are neglected anytime, but especially from
earliest childhood, are at greater risk of substance abuse
(17,142). When children have been continually rejected, they
become immune to parental guidance. Such children fail to form
close relationships, get along with others, solve problems, and
regulate impulses. </p>

<p> Physical and Sexual Abuse </p>

<p> Physical or sexual abuse in childhood leads to greater
vulnerability to substance abuse in adolescence and adulthood
(38). Rape victims, particularly those with Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, are 20 times more likely to have
subsequent substance abuse problems (165). Substance abuse
rehabilitation programs report that as many as 60 to 70 percent
of the female patients and 25 percent of the male patients have
been sexually victimized, while 43 percent have been beaten
(45,99,92). Victims of sexual or physical abuse often report
wishing to avoid unpleasant memories, including flashbacks to the
abuse (126). The use of substances may help some victims forget
for awhile (see box 8-2). </p>

<p> Substance Abuse in the Family </p>

<p> The biological children of alcoholics have a higher than
average chance of abusing alcohol, even if they are reared away
from their alcoholic parents (40,63). Thus, a part of the
vulnerability to alcohol abuse, at least for some, may be
inherited. Children of alcoholics, for example, may experience
more positive effects or fewer negative effects from the use of
alcohol. Either of these responses could result from individual
differences in experienced pharmacological effects of drugs (135)
or differences in temperament that can be modified by the use of
alcohol and other drugs (154). </p>

<p> In addition to friends and acquaintances, relatives are a
common source of alcohol and other drugs for teens. Family
members and other relatives can be very persuasive when they
offer such substances to teens. One study, that included both
abstainers and heavy users, found that young people refused
available substances, mainly alcohol, 46 percent of the time when
friends offered them, but only 18 percent of the time when
relatives outside the family offered them. When their own parents
offered such substances, the young people never refused (9).
Family members who use substances can also inadvertently make
them available to teens by leaving family cabinets containing
alcohol or pills unlocked (35). </p>

<p> Family members can learn how to use alcohol and other drugs
by watching and listening to abusing family members; they can
also adopt the abusing members' expectations about the effects of
these substances. For example, children of alcoholics are more
likely to think that the purpose of drinking is to get drunk
(107). They also have greater expectations for the use of alcohol
(143), and sometimes believe they can do things better after a
few drinks. </p>

<p> Families with a substance abusing parent experience
significant disruptions in many aspects of their lives, including
child rearing (160). Substance abusing parents and spouses often
have difficulties guiding their children, especially away from
substances, because of inconsistent nurturing, monitoring, and
disciplinary practices (36,47). Their abuse of substances can
also rob children of stability in life and of competent adult
role models. Even a nondrinking spouse can become so involved
with the drinking spouse and so depressed and isolated from
social support that children feel neglected (13). Marital quality
can be affected (160), and the level of conflict and verbal and
physical aggression can be high (151). In addition, adolescent
and adult children of substance abusers are less influenced by
their parents and have lower parental attachment, less
involvement with other people, more difficulty getting along with
other people (84), lower self- esteem, lower academic
achievement, higher depression (128), and a greater number of
other psychiatric symptoms (143). </p>

<p> Major Negative Life Events </p>

<p> Substance use and abuse often increase as children experience
more negative events (106,174) (see table 8-1). Adult alcoholics
report a significantly higher number of severe life events just
before their alcohol dependency begins (65), with seven out of
eight of them reporting disruptions in important personal
relationships, such as with friends, lovers, or spouses. Among
the elderly, late- onset alcoholism is reportedly preceded by new
feelings of loneliness and depression, perhaps also due to recent
losses of important relationships (120,134). </p>

<p> Such negative life events may heighten vulnerability to
substance abuse by increasing depression (174). For instance, one
study found that children who had lost a parent to death had a
7.5 times greater risk of developing a depression than other
children (60). Negative life events may also occasion perceptions
of helplessness and decreased personal control; these too can be
offset, at least for awhile, by some drugs (91). </p>

<p> Families are likely to have the greatest difficulty
preventing substance abuse if friends abuse substances (86,109)
or if substance use is rampant in the neighborhood
(39,44,51,124). Such conditions encourage substance use and
reduce the barriers against use by making drugs continuously
available and socially acceptable (even appealing) and by
providing temporary escape from the frequent hassles and
tragedies of life among highly transient and troubled (rather
than stable and helpful) neighbors (146). </p>

<p> Programs To Enhance Protective Factors </p>

<p> This section discusses some of the numerous programs that
have been developed for families with infants, school-aged
children, and young adults. Few of these programs specifically
target substance abuse and addiction, but many have been found to
enhance family-based protective factors and/or reduce risk
factors that can be associated with drug abuse. Unlike some
school-based programs, methodologically rigorous studies
correlating the efficacy of these programs to the level of
substance abuse and addiction have yet to be done. </p>

<p> Families With Infants </p>

<p> Parent education, prenatal and infant care, and social
support programs help strengthen involved and responsive
parenting (4), which in turn can significantly reduce substance
abuse risk factors such as child abuse and neglect and childhood
accidents. </p>

<p> Parents who had participated in such programs attained more
education, had fewer other children, and were less likely to be
on welfare by the time their children were 10 years old, than
parents who had not participated in such programs. Participating
parents reported less stress and more confidence in their
parenting (175). Most importantly, children were dramatically
less likely to experience attendance, behavior, or academic
problems in school (112,138,139). </p>

<p> These programs can take many forms: </p>

<p> o a neighborhood house where parents and their infants can
come during the day for companionship, child care advice, social
services, and health care from a stable professional staff (139);
</p>

<p> o twice-a-week home visits by the same nurse, from pregnancy
until the child is 2 years old (112); </p>

<p> o home visits, with child development advice, help in
acquiring other services, and time-limited family counseling to
lower conflict and increase support from the extended family; </p>

<p> o a public school dedicated to pregnant teens and new mothers
and that provides health and child care education, social
services, and intensive high school education (138); and </p>

<p> o parent meetings in the hospital where the baby was born
(175). </p>

<p> Families With School-Age Children </p>

<p> Parent training and support programs can help parents of
school-aged children motivate their children to more willingly
pay attention to and accept parental guidance and to develop
skills for success outside the family. A parent training program
called WINNING, provided through a Texas school system, increased
positive and corrective feedback from parents to children,
increased parent-child interactions, and decreased the attention
parents gave to inappropriate child behavior. Concomitantly, the
portion of their children's behavior that was inappropriate
decreased (43). </p>

<p> Another parent training and support program, &quot;How to
Help Your Child Succeed in School,&quot; was offered through
Seattle, Washington schools to increase protective factors and
reduce risk factors for substance use and abuse. After the
program, parents spent more time reading with their children and
provided more consistent positive and negative consequences for
behavior (70,71, 72,73,74). </p>

<p> Involving parents more in schools can further
supportparenting and prevent it from being undermined by peers
and by school environments. In the School Development Program in
New Haven, Connecticut, for example, parents serve as members of
the School Advisory Council and as employees or volunteers in
classrooms. Significant improvements have been seen in student
attendance, language skills, math scores, and social competence,
and virtually all classroom behavior problems have been
eliminated (34,41). </p>

<p> A community grassroots effort to provide these and other
resources for parents began 17 years ago in the Ravendale section
of Detroit, Michigan. The &quot;Joy of Jesus&quot; programs now
support families living in more than 30 contiguous blocks. Every
day after school about 250 youth of all ages participate in
scheduled activities such as tutoring, music, dance, gym,
writing, teen sex education, cultural field trips, university
tours, and an entrepreneur's club (for 30 teens who are starting
their own businesses). This program provides several substance
abuse protective factors and prevents the risk factor of school
failure, by monitoring report cards and enrolling students in an
individualized after-school motivational learning program, if
necessary. </p>

<p> In Los Angeles, California, an after-school tutoring and
activities program has been developed in a for profit apartment
building. The program, called EEXCEL, provides a room in the
building and live-in counselors and tutors who offer children a
&quot;sanctuary for education [and]...incentives for
learning.&quot; When report cards come out, good grades are
recognized at parties. Only those families that want this
resource for their children are accepted as tenants in the
building (108). </p>

<p> Atlanta, Georgia-based Inner-City Families in Action has been
presenting comprehensive information in a series of 2- hour
sessions about how specific drugs, such as alcohol or crack,
affect every system in the body, to residents in two Atlanta
housing projects. The curriculum is called &quot;You Have the
Right to Know.&quot; After 2 years of using the curriculum in
many locations, the narcotics arrests in both housing projects
are down (52). </p>

<p> Through flyers, personal invitations from schools, and a 1-
hour television special, parents were recruited to 87 local sites
around Seattle, Washington, for workshops on &quot;Preparing for
the Drug (Free) Years,&quot; led by trained parents. Surveys
showed that parents' attitudes and behaviors were changed in the
direction of providing protective factors. Parents also rated
highly the workshops' content, process, and leaders (71). </p>

<p> The Midwestern Prevention Project (Project STAR) in Kansas
City, Missouri, used the local media to recruit parents to become
involved in a school and parent substance abuse education course
and to repeat the messages for more than one year. This intensive
effort reduced the rate of increase in initiation of alcohol,
tobacco, and marijuana use among seventh and eighth graders who
had participated in the program, as compared to those who had not
participated (116). </p>

<p> Families With Young Adults </p>

<p> Job Corps, Peace Corps/VISTA programs, American Conservation
and Youth Service Corps, National and Community Service Programs,
universities, and the military all provide young people sheltered
work experiences, educational training if necessary, and
opportunities to live away from home with other young people in
structured environments. Research shows that such experiences
enhance the confidence of participants in their ability to work
hard (48). </p>

<p> Programs To Reduce Risk Factors </p>

<p> Reducing Drug-Trafficking and Substance-Using Peers </p>

<p> Operation Clean Sweep, now being run by the Chicago,
Illinois, Housing Authority, is designed to reduce drug dealing
and other crimes in housing projects. Staff approach one
high-rise building at a time, spending at least a whole day at
the building. State and local law enforcement officers and
housing authority security officers search apartment units (if
there is reasonable cause) for illegal weapons and unauthorized
residents. Authorized residents are given photo I.D. cards, while
others are put on the lease, given a 2-week pass, or asked to
leave. The maintenance staff makes repairs, cleans graffiti,
encloses lobbies, and builds a security station for 24-hour-a-day
surveillance and review of photo I.D.'s and passes for
admittance. The program is being replicated in cities across the
nation, with funding and technical assistance from the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). </p>

<p> Reducing Physical and Sexual Abuse </p>

<p> Physical and psychological security is important for the
emotional well-being of children (30) and may well reduce their
risk of later substance abuse. Mandatory arrest and brief
incarceration for physical and sexual abuse of children or
mothers has been shown to deter more repeat offenses than do
warnings or counseling alone (144), and court-mandated treatment
for convicted offenders seems to reduce later abuse even further
(50). Since 40 to 87 percent of adult sexual or physical abusers
also report alcohol or drug abuse, individuals treated for family
violence should perhaps also be screened and, if appropriate,
treated for substance abuse (176). </p>

<p> Reducing Substance Abuse in the Family </p>

<p> Substance abuse treatment for the family can reduce substance
abuse in the short-term and maintain those reductions in the
long-term (27,75, 101,147,149,153,). Substance abuse treatment
for married adults is more effective when both spouses are
involved (96), and especially with a behavioral approach to
marital problems (110). Clearly, families can help rehabilitate
substance abusers, thereby reducing the risk of substance abuse
for other family members. </p>

<p> Reducing Impact of Negative Life Events </p>

<p> Linking people with modest community supports during crises
or adjustments can reduce risk factors and enhance protective
factors. For example, when widows were contacted individually by
trained, previously widowed persons to discuss grief and
decisions to be made, 61 percent accepted the widow-aide services
(145) and one month after bereavement were less depressed and
less preoccupied with the past than widows who had received no
intervention. One year later, the intervention group was
significantly more resocialized in their roles as singles; two
years later, the health of the intervention group members was
significantly better than that of control group members (168). </p>

<p> Also, a 6-month program for newly separated or divorced
people in Colorado (which included both one-to-one counseling by
trained volunteers and group meetings about practical problems,
such as career planning and child- rearing) significantly reduced
the participants' problems and their anxiety, nervousness, and
fatigue. It also improved their psychological adjustment (less
guilt and self-blame, more competence), as compared with a
randomly selected control group (18). More indirect approaches
have also been tried. For example, socially isolated and lonely
individuals, who were provided a free blood pressure station in
the lobby of their innercity single room occupancy hotel, were
introduced to each other by the nurse and later formed a
&quot;Senior Activities Club.&quot; In another example, a surplus
food distribution service, that required individuals to work
together to get their food, produced new friendships (117). </p>

<p> Reducing Parental Neglect </p>

<p> Parents whose children failed to maintain gains after parent
education or family therapy are often socially isolated and
subject to seemingly insurmountable daily problems (49). An
experimental program--with weekly follow-up sessions with
isolated parents, to discuss environmental problems that affected
how parents saw their children's behavior--reduced maternal
criticisms of children, negative responses by children to
mothers, and child problem behaviors (170). When the weekly
discussions stopped, however, the negative interactions resumed. </p>

<p> In a more comprehensive program for low SES parents believed
by Child Protective Services to be at high risk for child abuse
or neglect, Project 12-Ways held meetings with parents in their
homes (95). Treatment goals were developed and, as needed,
behavioral training was provided in stress reduction,
assertiveness, self-control, leisure time planning, marital
counseling, and job finding. Social support groups, alcohol
treatment referral, homemakers, physicians, and mental health
workers were also involved. Parent compliance and involvement in
this 5- to 6-month program were high. Twenty months after
treatment, only 2 percent of Project 12-Ways parents abused or
neglected their children, while 10 percent of a nonprogram
comparison group did. </p>

<p> Families on the verge of having children placed in foster-
care, group homes, or psychiatric hospitals can benefit from
family preservation programs. Children have fewer behavioral and
academic problems when they are raised by birth-parents in safe
homes (130). Thus, the goal of a family preservation counselor is
to help the family out of the crisis and learn how to retain the
child safely at home. The interventions are typically intensive
and brief--for example, a counselor is available for meetings in
the home 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for about 6 weeks. The
counselor deals with any relevant problems, helping the family
clarify values, set goals, and solve problems, and helps connect
family members with community resources (see box 8-3). </p>

<p> Many families, especially those with substance abuse
problems, need more prolonged help. A family support program that
provides such longer term support is Camden House, in the
Ravendale section of Detroit, Michigan. A rundown house was
purchased, renovated, and made the center of an outreach and
drop-in program for about 10 local families with multiple
problems that included substance abuse, lack of skills, chronic
unemployment, early pregnancy, and crime. After staff had worked
with the families for one to two years, taking one problem at a
time and actively mentoring the parents, six out of 10 of the
original parents were out of the Camden House program, drug-free,
trained and employed, and safely and responsibly raising their
children. </p>

<p> SCHOOLS AND PEERS </p>

<p> Millions of school-age youth in the United States experiment
with alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs annually, often
(especially with alcohol) in ways that can cause overdose deaths,
accidental injuries or deaths, and permanent impairments. Many
school-age youth continue to use substances and later develop
long-term addictions. To address these substance abuse problems,
schools provide the most important settings for reaching young
people with standardized, broadly applied educational and
preventive messages. </p>

<p> Because school-age youth are especially likely to initiate
the use of alcohol and other drugs, much of the research has
focused on use, rather than on abuse and dependency. Such
research is nevertheless relevant to an understanding of abuse
and dependency, since use is a precondition and contributor to
abuse and dependency and even experimental use can be harmful.
For example, nearly half of all youth who experiment with
cigarettes develop long-term smoking habits, and alcohol and
marijuana use by youth with no chronic problems still contributes
to highway deaths, crime, and violence. This section summarizes
results from an analysis of survey research on the causes of
school-age substance use and discusses school-based prevention
programming. </p>

<p> Analysis of Survey Research on Causes of School-Age Substance
Use </p>

<p> OTA commissioned a review of the survey research literature
on school-aged substance use that compiled, classified, and
examined 9,930 statistical analyses from 242 separate studies.
This is by far the most extensive systematic examination of this
body of research conducted so far. Most of the studies dealt with
school-based populations, but some focused on school-age army
recruits, dropouts, children of alcoholics, and individuals
involved in clinics. The studies reported statistical
relationships between substance use and its postulated causes.
Statistical findings from the study reports were sorted into 11
major categories and 50 subcategories (see table 8-2), and then
analyzed to identify strong, moderate, and weak statistical
relationships, as well as those that had been insufficiently
studied. </p>

<p> Characteristics of Database </p>

<p> The studies tended to focus on so-called gateway substances,
with tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana analyses accounting for 82
percent of the completed analyses (see figure 8-1). Cocaine,
inhalants, heroin, and prescription drugs, which have recently
received extensive social attention, have been relatively ignored
by quantitative researchers to date; none of these latter
categories of substance use accounted for more than 5 percent of
the analyses in the research reports examined. Gateway drugs are
indeed important, since they may lead some individuals to later
abuse. Nevertheless, the literature has gaps. Inhalants, for
instance, may well be one of the most commonly used and abused
substances among some youth, but they have received almost no
attention from survey researchers. </p>

<p> Although the primary measures were of use, not abuse, the
database included some measures of alcohol abuse (e.g., drunk
driving and impairment from alcohol use). Abuse of cocaine,
heroin, and analgesics was not measured. The percentages of
analyses in the database for each of the 11 major types of
independent variables is displayed (see figure 8-2). The types of
independent variables most studied were personality, use by
others, and cognitive factors (including attitudes, beliefs, and
values). </p>

<p> Results of Analysis </p>

<p> After being sorted into the 11 major categories and 50
subcategories, the average of all the correlations in each
subcategory was calculated. Then, each subcategory was ranked by
its average correlation and the rankings were divided into three
groups, defined by ranges of correlations: primary (with
correlations over .30), secondary (with correlations between
about .20 and .30), and tertiary (with correlations under about
.20) (see figure 8- 3). </p>

<p> Primary correlates </p>

<p> The four variables that dominate as correlates of and
possible contributors to substance use are: 1) prior and
concurrent use of substances, 2) substance use by peers and
friends, 3) perceived peer attitudes about substance use, and 4)
offers to use substances. The prominence of prior and concurrent
use is consistent with the reinforcing nature of substance use
itself. The prominence of the other three variables emphasizes
the importance of the social environment in contributing to and
reinforcing substance use among school-age youth. </p>

<p> Secondary correlates </p>

<p> Of the 15 variables judged to be of secondary importance,
seven are social variables: 1) susceptibility to peer pressure,
2) resistance skills, 3)??perception of social pressure to use
substances, 4)? beliefs that such pressure can be effectively
handled, 5) beliefs about social consequences of use, 6)
bondedness (especially to school), and 7) peer group
characteristics. With the exception of parent attitudes about
substance use, other parental variables--such as parental
supervision, monitoring, and relations--are notably missing as
primary or secondary correlates. </p>

<p> Tertiary correlates </p>

<p> Of the 38 variables found to have no more than a minor role
in substance use, 10 were included in at least 100 of the
correlational analyses in the database for this review. They are:
1) substance use by parents, 2) personality traits, 3)
intelligence, 4) social personality traits, 5) parental
relations, 6) affect, 7) participation in structured activities,
8) bonding with the peer group, 9) beliefs about health
consequences of using substances, and 10) self-esteem. </p>

<p> Variables requiring further study </p>

<p> Several of the secondary and tertiary variables in the
studies reviewed here were insufficiently examined to allow
general conclusions to be drawn. However, they may later prove to
be useful to the field. For example, religious affiliation and
the development of substance use-specific values, while not
extensively studied as separate variables, both address issues
related to social norms and influences that have often been found
to be associated with substance use; thus, an association between
these two variables and the onset of substance use might be
expected. Also, availability may prove to be important,
especially if it is defined in future studies more broadly (e.g.,
as physical and social availability, as discussed in ch. 5)
rather than as potential availability (that is, how easy it
appears to be to get a substance, if motivated), as many current
surveys define it. </p>

<p> Preventive Interventions </p>

<p> Schools can seek to prevent substance use and abuse through
curriculum-based drug prevention programs and through other, more
novel approaches, such as school-based clinics, student
assistance programs, and holistic environmental interventions.
School-based prevention efforts have been hampered, however, by a
lack of good evaluation data on the most widely marketed programs
and by insufficient information about and dissemination of the
more promising programs. </p>

<p> Numerous studies of the effectiveness of curriculum-based
drug prevention programs have been completed and reviewed (67).
Studies of prevention programs focusing on tobacco have been
extensively reviewed (16,20,54,58,94,132,155) and alcohol studies
have been reviewed several times (62,64,102). Reviews of
school-based prevention curricula that specifically target
marijuana or cocaine do not exist. However, several reviews have
examined studies of programs designed to prevent the use of
multiple substances (7,25,102,131,156). Even these reviews,
however, typically focus primarily on tobacco and alcohol. </p>

<p> Effectiveness of Drug Abuse Resistance Education Program </p>

<p> Three merchandised curriculum programs have captured a
sizable share of the prevention program market: DARE (Drug Abuse
Resistance Education); Quest: Skills for Living; and Here's
Looking at You 2000. Of these, evaluations only of DARE have been
reported in sufficient numbers to allow conclusions to be drawn. </p>

<p> The DARE program is delivered in schools by uniformed police
officers who have been trained in any of five regional training
centers. It was designed by the Los Angeles, California, Unified
School District, which borrowed from research-based programs
developed in the early 1980s. DARE is delivered annually to about
5 million students in all 50 States, at a total cost of about $50
million (an average annual cost of about $10 per student) (93).
DARE is thus one of the better funded drug prevention programs in
schools. </p>

<p> One research team examined 17 published and unpublished
evaluations of DARE (53). For the 11 studies that met minimal
standards of methodological rigor, the average reductions in
substance use were very small. Use among control schools and DARE
schools was roughly equal. The few studies that were longitudinal
found neither short-term nor long-term reductions. </p>

<p> DARE has important strengths, including favorable reactions
among students who have participated in DARE programs, widespread
political support, substantial funding, uniformly reported
improvements in school-police relations, highquality of program
implementation, and expert marketing. However, these strengths
have not guaranteed that DARE is always effective as a drug
prevention program. A scientific advisory group has been
established to review research and evaluation of the DARE program
and to consider changes in the curriculum. </p>

<p> The General Accounting Office (GAO) estimated that about
one-fourth of the funds given to the States and local schools
under the Drug-Free School and Communities Act went toward
purchasing and delivering school curricula (163). However, widely
adopted curriculum packages (such as Quest: Skills for Living;
Here's Looking at You 2000; Project Adventure; BABES; Project
CHARLIE; and Children Are People) have presented no adequate
evaluation results that allow program effectiveness to be judged.
Evaluations conducted to date have been primarily short-term
reviews for dissertations and theses, and they lack interpretable
behavioral end-points. Given the widespread dissemination of
these curricula, quality evaluation studies would be important. </p>

<p> Conclusions About Curriculum-Based Prevention in Schools </p>

<p> Curriculum-based drug prevention efforts to date can be
characterized as showing promise (67,156), but critics point out
that the effectiveness of these programs, especially those that
are being commercially marketed, has not yet been proven and that
significant difficulties remain (102). Some of these are
methodological difficulties intrinsic to all field trial
research, while others relate to the possibly intrinsic
limitations of curriculum approaches when used alone. Individual
studies suggest that curriculum-based prevention programs in the
schools may ultimately be proven to be effective for preventing
substance use among some youth, especially when used as
components in more comprehensive substance use prevention
efforts. However, school-based prevention technologies currently
in use have not been refined and tested enough to demonstrate
their effectiveness for reducing substance use for students in
general, and especially not for multiproblem youth, who are at
higher risk of substance abuse. Clearly, for DARE and for the
other major school-based curriculum prevention programs,
resources must be set aside to properly evaluate program results.
</p>

<p> Noncurricular Approaches to School-Based Prevention </p>

<p> Curriculum-based efforts have dominated the field, largely
because they are relatively simple to understand, implement, and
replicate, and because methods to evaluate them have become
standardized. However, curriculum-based prevention programs have
not been demonstrated to be effective, and several noncurricular
approaches have recently emerged, including student assistance
programs, school-based clinics, and more holistic
school-community collaborations and alterations of psychosocial
environments in schools. These approaches have been evaluated
only rarely, but interest in them has been growing. For example,
although student assistance programs remain largely unevaluated,
they accounted for about half of the spending, under the Drug-
Free Schools and Communities Act, in six recently evaluated urban
school districts (163). </p>

<p> Student assistance programs try to identify substance-using
students early on and then provide social support, build skills
for dealing with life problems, or refer to treatment, as
appropriate. Peers often help as crisis managers, small group
facilitators, and referral agents, while adults often act as
program facilitators and counselors. Programs typically counsel
students who are children of alcoholics, who use alcohol or drugs
abusively, and who are performing poorly at school. Programs can
also help parents address their children's needs. </p>

<p> Only three evaluations of student assistance programs were
found by OTA for this review. Two focused on process issues only
(89,118), while one addressed program outcomes (90). The outcome
study focused on interventions for students in six residential
facilities, including a locked correctional facility. Although
the sites are atypical for student assistance programs, the
program otherwise resembled student assistance programs in
schools. </p>

<p> The outcome study found that marijuana and tobacco use
declined among program participants in five of the six
facilities. Alcohol use declined in half of the sites, while
alcohol use in two sites remained unchanged and in one site rose
slightly. The declines in use were observed at about nine and 15
months after participation in the program. Although these results
are promising, one study (especially a study conducted in
nonschool settings) cannot support general conclusions about the
effectiveness of student assistance programs in schools. </p>

<p> Many schools, either directly or through community agencies,
are bringing services into schools to help deal with social and
health problems that are often interrelated, such as depression,
violence, substance use, and sexually transmitted diseases.
School-based clinics and youth service centers are being set up
to provide comprehensive and integrated health and social
services. This new wave of programming has been supported by
State governments, local school districts, and private
foundations. </p>

<p> School-based clinics have been developing in response to
growing poverty, widespread lack of insurance, and increases in
health and social problems among youth. One study indicates that
the percent of adolescents defined as living in poverty increased
from 15 percent in 1979 to 19 percent in 1986 (22). Not all youth
living in poverty are covered by Medicaid or other health
insurance, and millions of other youth (e.g., in near-poor or
recently unemployed families) also lack health insurance.
Violence, teen pregnancy, and substance use and abuse remain high
or are increasing in many communities, and these problems often
require direct one-on-one medical or social interventions, if
they are to have a chance of being resolved. </p>

<p> Self-referral and other data suggest that school-based
clinics are providing health care and social support. For
example, a survey of 306 such clinics in 33 States and Puerto
Rico (22) found that about half the visits were for medical
problems, such as injuries and illnesses, with 40 percent of the
visits for counseling and 10 percent for birth control supplies
or counseling about reproductive issues more generally. No
evaluations seem yet to have focused on the effectiveness of
school-based clinics for assisting with the treatment and
prevention of substance use and abuse. School-based clinics
perhaps should not focus primarily on these problems, but as
clinics expand in numbers questions will naturally and more
frequently arise about their role in addressing substance use and
related problems. </p>

<p> Several notable collaborations between schools and other
community agencies and resources have been supported and, at
least in part, studied. For example, the Community Partnership
Program, administered by the Center for Substance Abuse
Prevention, has supported more than 250 local partnerships for
the prevention of substance use and abuse, with over 60 percent
actively involving schools as coalition members. Each site must
have a local evaluator that will monitor primarily program
activities, and a national evaluation to monitor program
activities and outcomes has begun. The local evaluations are
expected to vary widely, in part because uniform, accepted
standards for community-wide program evaluation have yet to be
developed. Outcome findings are expected by 1997. </p>

<p> The Midwest Prevention Project (116) provides and studies
school-based interventions in the greater Kansas City, Missouri,
metropolitan area and in Marion County (Indianapolis), Indiana.
Due to constraints in the study design, the evaluation results to
date speak directly only to the impact of the school-based
curricular interventions; the impact of community organization,
parental, and media components cannot be evaluated. Nonetheless,
this approach suggests the potential for communities to support
school- based prevention efforts. </p>

<p> Cities-in-Schools is a national nonprofit organization
devoted to preventing students from dropping out, through
partnerships among schools, local governments, and businesses.
Cities-in-Schools operates in 122 communities in 21 states with
384 schools participating in the program. The national
organization strives to bring health, social, and employment
services into schools across the nation, to help youth find jobs,
tutors, and counseling and to motivate them to stay in school. A
national staff assists local boards. A prominent person in
business presides over each local program, directs fund-raising,
and organizes a team of professionals to help potential dropouts.
In most programs, a case manager is assigned to each high-risk
child. Beyond these basics, programs vary greatly, focusing on a
diversity of prevention and intervention strategies. Several
Cities- in-Schools sites have achieved national attention.
Although little concrete evaluation data are available about the
effects of these programs in general or on substance use, the
model appears promising and warrants further study. </p>

<p> Changing the social or physical climate in schools may also
help reduce substance use and abuse. Future research and
evaluation studies could focus on the impacts on substance use
and abuse of this and other holistic models, such as open versus
closed campuses, alternative schools, and after- school care
programs. These models may be especially promising for high risk
youth suffering from multiple risk factors and limited protective
factors, many of which are rooted in problematic (often substance
using and abusing) homes, neighborhoods, peer groups, and other
subcultures, which cannot easily be influenced by more limited
school- based prevention approaches alone. </p>

<p> WORKPLACES </p>

<p> Workplaces can also contribute to and protect against alcohol
and drug abuse. This section reviews literature on factors and
interventions associated with substance abuse in the workplace,
with a special focus on the role of workplace settings
themselves. Researchers have investigated the causes of substance
abuse among workers for nearly four decades, and U.S. management
and labor have been concerned about workplace substance abuse for
over a century (150,158,159). Alcohol has been the drug most
studied in workplaces and appears to be the drug most commonly
used. </p>

<p> Magnitude of Problem </p>

<p> The prevalence of substance abuse among the employed remains
inadequately documented, based on a small number of flawed
studies. For American workers more information exists on the
extent of alcohol use and dependence (although gaps remain) than
on the use and abuse of illegal substances (57, 68,114). </p>

<p> The 1988 National Health Interview Survey found that about 13
percent of employed men and 6 percent of employed women were
alcohol dependent (68). This nationwide household survey of
almost 27,000 individuals found that, for both men and women, the
percentage of white-collar workers who drank was greater than the
percentage of blue-collar workers who drank. However, among those
who drank, blue-collar workers drank more than white-collar
workers. Consistent with an earlier survey in Detroit, Michigan,
alcohol-related disorders were also found to be greater among
blue-collar workers, with the rates highest for men who were
craftsmen, laborers, and service workers, and for women who were
machine operators, laborers, and service workers (114). Another
investigator has reported that the rate of on-the- job substance
use among young men in the 6 months prior to the study was about
28 percent (105). </p>

<p> Substance abuse contributes to workplace problems, such as
accidents, injuries, absenteeism, turnover, lost productivity,
compensation claims, and insurance costs (11). The total cost to
the American economy related to substance abuse has been
estimated to be more than $144 billion a year, with about 60
percent due to alcohol abuse and 40 percent due to the abuse of
other drugs (121). Costs to the economy include costs due to
medical care, prevention, law enforcement, and lost productivity.
The 1985 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that
substance-using employees were 3.6 times more likely to have
accidents than nonusing employees. They had 2.5 times more
absences of 8 days or more. They were three times more likely to
be tardy than nonusing employees and were 2.2 times more likely
to ask for early dismissal. They requested sick leave three times
as much as nonusing employees. They were five times as likely to
file for worker compensation. The total cost of lost productivity
due to alcohol and other drug abuse has been estimated at more
than $33 billion in 1985 and a little more than $43 billion in
1988 (122). </p>

<p> Factors Affecting Individuals in Workplaces </p>

<p> Substance abuse in workplaces can be affected by nonworkplace
factors and workplace factors. </p>

<p> Nonworkplace Factors </p>

<p> Early research attributed drinking and other drug problems on
the job to factors outside the workplace. Substance abuse was
seen as a problem brought to the workplace but not caused by the
workplace, and some believed that substance abusers selected
workplaces where they could conceal their problems. This view
assumed that substance abusers had the knowledge and freedom to
choose jobs on this basis, an assumption unlikely to apply to
all, given the limits of education and work experience among many
substance abusers, especially blue-collar workers (113). In any
case, family and community experiences interact with workplace
experiences (2), and workers from families and other subgroups
that drink may find that drinking influences their work lives as
well. </p>

<p> As noted earlier, drinking problems are more common among
those with lower SES, although drinking occurs more frequently
among higher SES individuals (31). Workplaces that employ more
lower SES employees may therefore be expected to have more
alcohol abusers (157). </p>

<p> The acceptance of alcohol and other drugs in the larger
society outside the workplace can also influence substance use
and abuse in the workplace. This can be seen in the new attitudes
in American society toward smoking. Consumers used to be assailed
constantly by advertisements presenting smoking in a positive
light, but are now more informed about its negative effects on
health. As a result, smoking has been banned from many airplane
flights, restaurants, stores, and public and private workplaces. </p>

<p> The availability of alcohol in the local community from which
a work organization derives its employees can also influence
workplace drinking (157). Higher rates of drinking problems exist
in communities where alcohol is cheaply and widely available and
alcohol outlets remain open for long hours. </p>

<p> Workplace Environment Factors </p>

<p> Several decades ago, researchers distinguished four
categories of workplace factors that place employees at risk for
excessive drinking (127). They are: </p>

<p> o lack of work visibility, </p>

<p> o absence of job structure, </p>

<p> o lack of social controls that discourage alcohol use, and </p>

<p> o job stress. </p>

<p> A more recent review (157) of risk factors internal to
workplace environments identified the following elements: </p>

<p> o alienation and powerlessness, </p>

<p> o work stress, </p>

<p> o structural features of the workplace, </p>

<p> o influence of administrative subcultures, </p>

<p> o poorly implemented intervention programs, and </p>

<p> o union-management conflict. </p>

<p> It has also been suggested that individual factors and
perceived work situations may be more important for alcohol use
than objective work situations (136). Those with boring and
routine jobs, or jobs over which they have little control, may be
more likely to drink (3,76). For example, a study of auto factory
assembly line workers found that 40 percent drank alcohol at work
(129). Other research found a consistent relationship between
powerlessness and alcohol use, and no evidence that work
experience or social support moderated alcohol use (137). </p>

<p> Workplace subcultures, whether administrative or
occupational, may also encourage drinking or the use of other
drugs at work. Administrative support for heavy drinking can
exist throughout the work organization or can be limited to
specific sites or occasions. Subcultures that can support the
heavy use of alcohol, but strongly discourage the use of illicit
drugs, are found in the military (28,119). Anecdotal reports
suggest that other occupational settings have encouraged the use
of cocaine (e.g., entertainment industry). Although available
research does not support the conclusion that workplace
subcultures are the primary cause of substance abuse, there is
evidence that at least alcohol problems vary widely according to
occupation (148). </p>

<p> Workplaces can offer protective factors as well. For some,
the fact of being employed, with the income and stability and
status that employment can convey, may offer protection against
substance use and abuse. If unemployment and underemployment are
viewed as risk factors, then employment by itself, at a decent
wage in a decent job, may offer protection. In addition, the
specific characteristics of a workplace can be protective. For
example, the risk factors listed above could be viewed as the
extremes on a continuum, the other end of which could be expected
to offer protection. Thus, work visibility, job structure,
manageable stress, worker involvement and empowerment, supportive
administrators, well implemented treatment and prevention
programs, and union-management harmony could be expected to be
protective factors. </p>

<p> Interventions </p>

<p> Two primary ways of dealing with employee substance abuse and
health have emerged: traditional employee assistance programs
(EAPs), which seek to help employees with identified problems,
and health promotion programs, which seek to prevent illness and
promote health (56). </p>

<p> Employee Assistance Programs </p>

<p> EAPs help employees with personal problems at the employer's
expense, by providing services directly (through the work
organization) or indirectly (through a provider in the community)
(140). In some workplaces, for example, EAPs are located in
medical departments, which generally provide emergency medical
care and may also provide preventive or rehabilitative care.
Medical departments, however, appear to be declining as sites for
EAPs (141). </p>

<p> EAPs rely on a strategy of constructive confrontation, which
assumes that supervisors or coworkers of substance abusers will
help refer them to the EAPs. In addition, workers are encouraged
to refer themselves to EAPs for assistance. </p>

<p> A review of what works in fighting substance abuse in the
workplace stresses that an employee assistance program is a key
to a good workplace program (167). It also recommends a written
drug-free workplace policy, management and supervisory training,
drug testing in workplaces where appropriate (one example of
which is when substance abuse may be dangerous to self or
others), and employee education programs focused on substance
abuse. Testing may well prevent substance use and abuse in
workplaces. </p>

<p> Some studies suggest that EAPs can be cost-effective for
business. The Department of Labor has reported thatemployers
generally find that for every dollar invested in an EAP, savings
of from $5 to $16 are achieved (167). Other reviews of the
limited evaluations of the economic and other benefits of EAPs
have found that health care costs and absenteeism, for example,
decline after employees have been served by EAPs (178). </p>

<p> However, EAPs have also been criticized in some cases, for
their inability to reach those at greatest risk, their incomplete
coverage of lower status employees, their failures to identify
problem drinkers early enough, their inadequate handling of
situation-dependent drinking problems, and their uncertain
effectiveness in rehabilitating problem drinkers (140). The
relative lack of EAPs in medium and small workplaces is an
important constraint on the ability of EAPs to offer more
widespread protection to the employed. </p>

<p> Health Promotion Programs </p>

<p> Health promotion programs seek to prevent illness and promote
wellness through behavior change. For example, they provide
information and support activities to help individuals increase
exercise, quit smoking, change diets, and manage stress and
hypertension. There are several advantages to using such general
workplace health promotion programs to prevent substance abuse in
the context of promoting positive life-style changes for all
employees. These include: </p>

<p> o little or no stigma; </p>

<p> o the use of positive, optimistic approaches; </p>

<p> o ease in selling to employees and generating enthusiasm;
and, </p>

<p> o generous corporate financing of health promotion programs
(103). </p>

<p> The use of health promotion programs to prevent substance
abuse can also present problems, however. For example, prevention
historically has been one of the lowest priorities for Federal
funding (104). When implemented by businesses, health promotion
programs may inadequately deal with the needs of a particular
work organization's employees, since the programs often come from
outside and have not been tailored to fit the needs of a
particular group of employees. Decision makers within a workplace
may decide on the basis of intuition, whim, or trendiness to buy
a health promotion program from the increasing number of
purveyors of programs (140). Furthermore, many of the proponents
of marketed health promotion programs have failed to adequately
evaluate their programs. Unfortunately, this has been
particularly true of activities intended to prevent substance
abuse. </p>

<p> Environment-Oriented Approaches to Substance Abuse Prevention
</p>

<p> A third approach, often associated with Scandinavia, focuses
less on changing employee behaviors and more on altering
workplace factors that influence worker health. The Swedish Work
Environment Fund, established in 1972, supports research,
workplace innovations, information dissemination, and training to
achieve better working environments. Grants that support
occupational health centers and research programs in Sweden are
financed through a combination of employer fees, payroll taxes,
and government financial assistance. </p>

<p> By contrast, the goal of alcohol policy in the workplace in
the United States has for centuries been to change individual
drinking behavior (1). Researchers have recently begun to focus
on how the workplace environment influences problem drinking. The
Harvard School of Public Health, jointly funded by the National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation, is surveying thousands of managers and work
groups in up to 10 large multinational corporations (171). The
study will determine corporate and work site patterns of
drinking, levels of work site drinking problems as they relate to
attitudes and practices of management, how corporate culture
affects managerial behavior and drinking problems in the
workplace, and what role the work group plays in promoting or
preventing problem drinking. </p>

<p> RECREATIONAL SETTINGS </p>

<p> Recreational and other developmental activities and settings
may also contribute to the prevention of substance use and abuse,
or by their absence increase the risk. Examples of such
recreational and other developmental activities and settings
include Boys and Girls Clubs, Boy and Girl Scouts, organized
sports, cultural activities, and local park and recreation
department programs. </p>

<p> Organized Activities and Drug Abuse </p>

<p> Research on the impact of organized youth activities on
substance use and abuse is limited, and only a few studies have
addressed the issue directly, while others have addressed it more
indirectly. </p>

<p> One study (which relied extensively on reports from employees
of Boys and Girls Clubs) found that public housing developments
served by Clubs had 22 percent less drug activity than
developments not served by Clubs. The presence of crack in
particular was 25 percent lower, and even lower in developments
served by new Clubs with SMART Moves, a substance abuse
prevention program (133). </p>

<p> A more extensive investigation has been conducted by the
Search Institute, which has surveyed 180,000 6th through 12th
grade youth in 430 school districts since 1988. Analysis of the
data found that as developmental assets increased (including
involvement in music, school team sports, nonsport school-based
cocurricular activities, nonschool clubs or organizations, and
churches) at-risk behaviors decreased, including the use of
alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs (12). Specifically, the
correlations: </p>

<p> o tend to be small; </p>

<p> o are strongest for tobacco use and weakest for alcohol use;
and, </p>

<p> o are slightly higher for church involvement than for other
activities. </p>

<p> Involvement in youth programs and activities has been found
to be associated with fewer at-risk behaviors among youth. One
study found that higher levels of four youth assets (perceived
positive school climate, family support, involvement in
structured youth activities, and involvement in church or
synagogue) were associated with lower levels of 20 at-risk
indicators, contained mainly in eight at-risk domains (alcohol,
tobacco, illicit drugs, sexuality, depression/suicide, antisocial
behavior, school, and vehicle safety) (12). High school students
who listed no assets, for example, reported an average of 5.6
at-risk indicators, while students listing all 4 assets reported
only 1.7 at- risk indicators. </p>

<p> A study of different communities found that 55 percent of the
youth in the healthier communities (defined by fewer at- risk
behaviors among youth) were involved in structured activities,
whereas only 39 percent of the youth in the least healthy
communities were involved in such activities (19). </p>

<p> Qualitative assessments across prevention disciplines support
these findings. For example, although a review and analysis of
delinquency, adolescent pregnancy, substance abuse, and school
failure and dropout prevention programs did not directly
investigate connections between youth development programs and
substance abuse prevention, its authors concluded that the
elements in youth development organizations can play a critical
role in preventing each of these problem behaviors (48). </p>

<p> The Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development has identified
several successful prevention efforts launched by national
youth-serving organizations, including the adolescent pregnancy
efforts of the Association of Junior Leagues and of Girls, Inc.,
and found that participation in such programs was associated with
fewer at-risk behaviors (32). The Carnegie Council's Task Force
on Youth Development and Community Programs concluded that, taken
together, current social science theory and field evaluations
provide a solid rationale for strengthening and expanding the
role of community-based programs in promoting healthy adolescent
development, since unsupervised after-school hours represent a
period of significant risk, with young adolescents standing a
greater chance of engaging in substance abuse. </p>

<p> Another study tested whether inactivity or boredom was
associated with substance abuse. It compared adolescents who had
been clinically diagnosed as substance abusers with a comparison
group of nonsubstance abusers, and found that the substance
abusers experienced their leisure activities as more boring, even
though they had participated in more leisure activities
(including such activities as going to concerts and going for a
drive). Available leisure activities may, for some youth, fail to
satisfy &quot;their need for optimal arousal,&quot; leaving them
more vulnerable to the appeal of drugs (78). </p>

<p> Thus, being active does not by itself protect against
substance abuse. Some activities, such as those that are
unstructured and unsupervised, may even increase the risks of
substance use and abuse through association with a wider range of
peers, some of whom are using substances. In addition, activities
perceived as boring may not protect against substance use and
abuse. More research is needed, to clarify the aspects of
recreational and other leisure activities that may protect
against substance use and abuse. Research might profitably focus
on whether activities that are supervised, structured, drug-free,
empowering, skills- building, self-esteem-promoting, active,
shared, and nonboring (or some combination of those) are
associated with lower levels of substance use and abuse. </p>

<p> Elements of Notable Programs </p>

<p> Several of the most important elements of notable substance
abuse prevention programs are provided by youth development
programs as well. These include: </p>

<p> o Promoting social and life skills. Programs that rely
exclusively on transmitting information about the health, legal,
and social risks of substance use and abuse are generally
ineffective (79). If, as the author of a recent longitudinal
study contends, substance use is a symptom rather than a cause of
personal and social maladjustment, promoting social and
psychological well-being may help prevent substance abuse (66).
Many alcohol and other drug prevention programs focus on the
development of social and life skills, as a way to help youth
understand their emotions, control their anger, curb
aggressiveness, and presumably reduce their inclination to turn
to substances (66,166). </p>

<p> o Strengthening families. Increasingly, alcohol and other
drug prevention programs are recognizing and addressing family
factors. Youth development organizations afford opportunities for
involving parents in recreational and other nonschool, nonfamily
activities. </p>

<p> o Promoting healthy peer interactions. Several studies have
shown the value of using peers as role models in prevention
programs. One study conducted a meta-analysis of 143 adolescent
drug prevention programs and collapsed prevention programs into 5
strategies or types: knowledge only, affective (i.e., addressing
feelings) only, peer programs, knowledge plus affective, and
alternatives. Peer programs that highlight peer influences and
emphasize skill building were found to be the most successful
(156). Peers are often the best positioned to help others build
resistance skills and bring about significant results in reducing
substance use, as compared to teachers or other adults. Peer
counseling and student assistance programs, for example, offer
unique opportunities for youth to cope with difficult issues and
develop skills to resist peer pressure (33). </p>

<p> o Indirect and participatory approaches to substance use.
Substance prevention programs are more likely to be effective if
they develop creative ways to reach and connect with their
participants. Many programs incorporate lessons concerning
substance use into activities such as games, theatrical
performances, creative arts, and sports. Some programs avoid
stating in their names that they are focusing on substance use
prevention, and in this way often attract more youth and preclude
them from feeling stigmatized (161). Because youth spend so much
time in school, where didactic, lecturing approaches so often
predominate, these approaches may well be less effective in
nonschool activities. GAO has recommended that programs engage
youth in activities that are more motivational and participatory,
such as support groups, dramatic productions, leadership
training, and role- playing (161). </p>

<p> o Alternative activities. Communities are beginning to create
healthy, substance-free alternative activities, such as teen
centers or drug-free parties, for youth who may feel there is
nothing else to do. This alternatives approach grows from the
idea that youth who turn to substances to meet certain social and
psychological needs can meet those needs in more positive and
healthy ways without chemicals. In its guide book, Prevention
Plus III, CSAP stresses the importance of incentives for youth to
participate in such alternative activities. At a minimum,
activities should reflect the interests and preferences of the
youth involved. A 10-year study with over 500 subjects found that
the largest percentage (67 percent) of assuredly recovered
substance abusers, defined as those who have been clean for five
years, used alternative activities to cope with or improve their
moods (169). However, although it remains a promising strategy,
many agree that more substantial research is needed. </p>

<p> The elements of notable programs suggest that youth
development organizations may be able to play a greater role in
the prevention of substance abuse. First, they can provide
specific information about substances and training in refusal
skills. Second, they can address life skills development,
emotional issues, and academic remediation. Further, they can
involve both youth and their families, as well as peers, in
settings for collaborative, substance-free interactions. Research
has shown the importance of building supportive communities
through such networks of social support that can diminish
substance use and abuse and promote healthy youth development
(14,19,133). PLANNING, IMPLEMENTING, AND EVALUATING
COMMUNITY-WIDE PROGRAMS </p>

<p> If substance abuse and addiction problems in a particular
community affect individuals via multiple risk and protective
factors interacting in multiple settings, then efforts to prevent
these problems may require multipronged efforts involving
schools, parents, media messages, and other community resources
(116). While it is possible that an assessment of problems may be
carried out by relatively few individuals, it is extremely
unlikely that the planning, implementation, and evaluation of
community-wide efforts can be achieved without participation of
residents and leaders throughout the community. Widespread
coordination and cooperation are intrinsic to community-wide
efforts. To help achieve such community-wide coordination and
cooperation, several different types of community coalitions have
been created. The CSAP has studied the ability of 7 pilot test
communities, under Community Partnership grants, to gather
information on 15 community-wide indicators of alcohol and other
drug abuse (see table 8-3). Some of these indicators are directly
related to and measure the extent of substance abuse and
addiction among subpopulations in a community (e.g., number of
drug positive urine samples from pregnant women at time of
delivery). Some of the indicators measure the extent of behaviors
or outcomes that may be directly related to substance abuse
(e.g., number of single vehicle nighttime accidents and number of
deaths due to alcohol and other drugs). Some of the CSAP
indicators relate to community activity settings, such as
workplaces and schools. </p>

<p> CSAP has recently supported, through the Community
Partnership program and the High-Risk Youth program, the use of
nonquantitative techniques to gain insights into substance abuse
and addiction and related problems in communities. This
information can be garnered by ethnographers and citizen
informants, who can report on the values, attitudes, purposes,
behaviors, and experiences of individuals in the subcultures of
communities. </p>

<p> The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has funded 13 community
coalitions in its &quot;Fighting Back&quot; program to reduce
substance abuse and addiction. About 600 coalitions now belong to
a national organization, Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of
America (CADCA). Some coalitions have been formed to address
other health and social issues, including the ASSIST and COMMIT
community tobacco control programs, funded by the National
Institutes of Health, and the Planned Approach to Community
Health (PATCH) program, funded by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention to encourage local coalitions for community health
planning and implementation (29). HUD now has funds to support
Community Coalitions Against Crime, which also address substance
abuse and addiction. And CSAP has supported numerous activities
conducted by approximately 250 coalitions through its Community
Partnership program (see table 8-4). </p>

<p> A recent review of some of the Community Partnerships
revealed the wide range of activities they have so far
implemented, including general prevention programs, public
education, alternative activities, community organizing and
empowerment, advocacy for policy change, and other community
activities. </p>

<p> Although coalitions have not been extensively evaluated as
yet, and although the evaluations that are now in process will
not produce outcome results for several years, there is reason to
believe that community coalitions offer promise for
community-wide efforts to prevent substance abuse and addiction.
First, as documented by this report, the factors contributing to
substance abuse and addiction are multiple and interactive.
Second, these factors interact in subcultures and community
activity settings that can encourage or inhibit substance abuse
and addiction and are widely dispersed. Thus, especially in
communities severely impacted by these problems, multiple efforts
addressing multiple factors in multiple settings may be required.
A recent report from the General Accounting Office concluded that
&quot;preliminary research results indicated that a
community-based approach may hold promise in preventing drug
use,&quot; and went on to emphasize the need for comprehensive
evaluations of such efforts (162). </p>

<p> Community coalitions could make use of the framework in this
report to develop plans for preventive interventions addressing
targeted populations in selected community activity settings.
Building on a systematic quantitative and nonquantitative
assessment of needs, a coalition could identify optional
preventive interventions that address selected populations and
settings, and then phase them in as resources permit. However,
some community coalitions may need additional support and
technical assistance to help them resolve conflicts, form
consensus on goals and plans, and sustain cooperative,
coordinated efforts that are subject to more rigorous evaluations
and midcourse corrections. Each community coalition needs to take
a critical look at what works and what does not work, and needs
to be flexible enough to try promising and proven analytical and
programmatic technologies, even if they are somewhat new to the
coalition. </p>

<p> SUMMARY </p>

<p> This chapter has reviewed research on factors and
interventions relevant to the onset and prevention of substance
use, abuse, and addiction in the four principal community
activity settings--homes and families, schools and peers,
workplaces, and recreational and other community settings.
Research indicates that families may influence whether family
members, especially (but not limited to) the young, initiate
substance use and progress to abuse and dependency, and can be
the target of a wide range of increasingly tested preventive
interventions that can help family members resist the use of
substances. Similarly, schools, especially through peer group
norms and behaviors related to substance use, can also be
important locations for the onset of substance use (including
alcohol use) and for preventive interventions, especially those
that focus on social influences, including peers. Factors in
workplaces, although less studied, can also contribute to and
protect against substance use and abuse, and workplace
interventions that focus on individuals and environments provide
opportunities for prevention. Finally, an emerging literature on
the role of recreational settings and activities, especially for
youth, suggests that the availability of attractive and
compelling substance-free activities can play a role in
dissuading youth from becoming heavily involved in the use and
abuse of substances. </p>

<p> BOX 8-2: Janice Janice, a 28-year-old, white, married female,
was inoutpatient treatment for bulimia nervosa, a
binge-purgepattern of eating that began when she was 18 years
old. Shealso had an intermittent history of alcohol abuse
datingfrom midadolescence. Janice appeared to be well-motivated
intreatment. She used the psychoeducational approach taught byher
therapist to increase her knowledge of how her binge-eating and
moodiness were related to her restricted dailycaloric intake. She
made progress quickly, using cognitivebehavioral techniques to
challenge her distortions andunderstand her behavior; she began
to eat consistent mealsin adequate amounts. These changes led to
a decrease in herbinge-eating and self-induced vomiting. However,
along withthis progress she became increasingly anxious, fearful,
andagitated about weight gain (despite the fact that little
ornone had occurred). At the same time, she became overwhelmedby
the intensity of the feelings she experienced, was havingbad
dreams, and withdrew from her support system in waysthat angered
her friends. She once more resorted toinconsistent meal patterns,
dieting, poor nutrition, and--inevitably--binge-eating and
vomiting. Her alcohol useincreased.Janice's symptomatology
shifted once she significantlydecreased her bulimic behavior.
Instead of dealing witheveryday feelings, behavior, and thoughts,
she began torelive memories from her unresolved traumatic past.
Thesememories started with vague feelings of uneasiness,
whichgrew more intense as she binged less. She then began
toremember her dreams, which, as they came into clearer
focus,caused her to be suspicious of her friends, and
particularlyof the men around her. Janice reported feeling fine
oneminute and then very frightened the next. Whereas she usedto
be flattered by any male attention, she now felt fearfulwhen men
looked at her. She started to remember multiplesexual assaults in
her past, both by persons known to herand by strangers. She felt
increasing urges to suicide, andobserved the reality of her
internal suffering as being &quot;tooawful.&quot; As she said,
&quot;If this is what recovery is all about,I don't think it's
worth it; I'll take my chances andstruggle with addictions. If I
can't stand that, there'salways suicide.&quot;SOURCE: M.P. Root,

<p> BOX 8-3: Dara Dara (20) was the natural mother of Christina
(9 months).Christina was in danger of placement in foster care
due tothe cocaine addiction of her mother. Her father, Matt,
wasserving time in jail on a drug charge. Christina's
olderbrother, Jason, was placed in foster care prior
toHomebuilder involvement. Dara's addiction prevented her
fromproperly caring for herself and the children. Dara rentedthe
upstairs apartment in her parent's home. Her
19-year-oldboyfriend, Brian, spent a great deal of time with her
andChristina.I helped Dara find out about drug treatment centers
and aschedule for Narcotic Anonymous (N.A.). She missed her
firstdrug evaluation because of having an abortion. She and
Brianwent to one N.A. meeting and then missed many days. The
CPScaseworker met with me and Dara and stressed the importanceof
her drug recovery. Dara agreed to complete the evaluationas well
as attend N.A. meetings. Initially I accompanied herto the N.A.
meetings for moral support. Sometimes Brianwould go and the rest
of the time her mother would accompanyher. Dara successfully
completed her drug evaluation andattended regular counseling
sessions with a drug counselor.She volunteered for urinalysis,
&quot;just to keep her honest.&quot;Dara got involved with other
young adults in N.A. They wentto eat together and went out to
dances and movies. She beganassociating with a new peer group.
The CPS caseworkerauthorized maximum day-care to be paid for so
she couldattend her meetings and counseling. Dara's
mothervolunteered to baby-sit Christina if Dara was with
herfriends from N.A.Dara's husband got out of jail and wanted a
divorce. Hefiled for custody of both of their children. I helped
Daraarrange for legal aid. She said she was more determined
thanever to &quot;stay straight so she would look good in
court&quot; overthe custody of the children.Dara asked her
boyfriend to move out so she could live byherself. She and Brian
continue to stay in contact from timeto time. Dara retained
custody of Christina. She and Mattagreed on joint custody of
their son, Jason, and Dara sawhim every other weekend. She
continued drug counseling andattending N.A. Her urinalysis always
tested negative.SOURCE: J. Kinney, D. Haapala, and C. Booth,

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 9 POLICY OPTIONS </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> Issues related to substance abuse and addiction have long
occupied the attention of the American public. Congress has:
authorized a multitude of federal programs aimed at reducing or
preventing the supply and demand of illicit drugs and to regulate
the availability of illicit substances, appropriated billions of
dollars each year to federal agencies, provided oversight of
federal programs, and passed broad-based legislation to
coordinate programs as part of the war on drugs. </p>

<p> Congress faces several fundamental difficulties in addressing
the causes of substance abuse and addiction: </p>

<p> o No scientific consensus exists as to what is the driving
cause of substance abuse and addiction. A range of risk and
protective factors have been associated with drug use, abuse, and
addiction. </p>

<p> o Federal antidrug efforts, though coordinated by the White
House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), are spread
among many federal agencies, whose authorization and
appropriations are the subject of action by numerous
congressional committees and subcommittees. ONDCP efforts in drug
demand reduction efforts alone involved the efforts of federal
agencies across at least 11 Cabinet-level departments. This makes
coordinated legislative action difficult to achieve. </p>

<p> o The federal budget deficit is an obstacle to the creation
of new domestic programs that target known risk and protective
factors in individuals and communities. The framework and
literature reviews presented in this report make clear that
multiple factors in individuals, groups, and substance abuse and
addiction can arise and be influenced by communities. Thus,
effective intervention requires prevention practitioners to
select from a variety of options, so they can target the specific
factors that are especially important for the particular
populations and communities they are addressing. This does not
mean that everything must be done at once nor that everything be
known in advance of taking action. To the contrary, policymakers
and practitioners can take small steps at a time, and then, as
resources and new knowledge permit, take additional steps that
address a fuller range of factors and contexts in greater depth. </p>

<p> o Current drug prevention programs lack scientifically
accepted standards for determining their success or failure.
While federal supply-side efforts yield hard data (e.g., amount
of illicit drugs confiscated, number of persons incarcerated), it
is much more difficult to demonstrate and quantify the impact of
a domestic program designed, in part or in whole, to prevent drug
abuse. Whatever methods are developed, tested, and incorporated
into prevention programs, a critical component of success is
careful, rigorous evaluation. Answering &quot;what works?&quot;
is essential in making advances in preventing substance abuse. </p>

<p> This chapter addresses some of the policy issues brought to
the Office of Technology Assessment's (OTA's) attention during
the course of this assessment, and possible options for
congressional action. The issues and options are broken into four
broad categories: federal focus and prevention program structure,
research needs, community activity settings, and availability.
Given the broad nature of federal antidrug efforts, many
important issues relating to federal antidrug efforts remain
beyond the scope of this report. Such topics include drug
treatment, interdiction and enforcement, and drug legalization. </p>

<p> The order in which the issues and options are presented does
not imply priority. Moreover, the options presented under each
policy question are intended as a short menu from which Congress
can choose one or more options for consideration and
implementation, and they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. </p>

<p> FEDERAL FOCUS AND PREVENTION PROGRAM STRUCTURE </p>

<p> Supply vs. Demand Reduction </p>

<p> The federal substance abuse control policy has as its primary
focus the eradication of the supply of drugs. The federal
government currently spends over $12 billion annually on antidrug
efforts, with approximately two-thirds of this amount supporting
drug interdiction and law enforcement activities, and the
remainder supporting demand- side activities, such as drug
treatment, research, and prevention programs. While ONDCP's most
recent National Drug Control Strategy argued for a slightly
increased percentage of funds for demand-side reduction, the
larger percentage of funds remain devoted to supply-side efforts.
Congress could decide that existing levels of effort and program
approaches in interdiction may need to be continued for a longer
period of time before they can succeed in reducing the
production, distribution, and local availability of illicit
substances. Congress could direct that interdiction efforts, and
the balance between supply and demand efforts, continue on the
same track. </p>

<p> If Congress decided to increase federal efforts in demand
reduction efforts, it could adopt any of three methods: 1)
increase appropriations for treatment and prevention programs; 2)
redirect some of the interdiction funds to increase support for
treatment and prevention programs; or 3) require that assets
forfeited in drug seizures be increasingly used to support
treatment and prevention programs. If Congress chose to simply
increase appropriations for additional treatment and prevention
programs, this option would require raising the current level of
federal spending for drug control efforts at a time when the
federal deficit is a key concern. Since costly interdiction and
incarceration programs have not eliminated either the supply of
illicit substances or the demand for and use of such substances,
Congress could decide to increase appropriations for treatment
and prevention programs by reallocating funds currently spent in
drug interdiction and law enforcement activities; this would mean
a drop in supply-side efforts such as drug interdiction and law
enforcement activities. The reallocation of assets forfeited in
drug seizures to treatment and prevention programs, if done
together with closer coordination of local antidrug efforts among
law enforcement and treatment and prevention practitioners, may
be an attractive small step. Congress could direct that ONDCP
monitor the reallocation of such assets, to ensure the flow of
funds to programs that directly focus on substance abuse and
addiction and, programs that do not directly address substance
abuse and addiction but that target risk and protective factors
known to be associated with abuse and addiction. </p>

<p> Many stakeholders agree that the federal antidrug effort
should be more focused on treatment and prevention. Widespread
disagreement exists, however, as to whether such additional
treatment and prevention efforts should be created at the expense
of, or in addition to, current supply-side efforts. </p>

<p> Structure of ONDCP </p>

<p> Since its creation in 1988, ONDCP has served as the most
visible federal entity in the war on drugs. The Director, the
so-called drug czar, has the opportunity to galvanize public
attention on federal antidrug efforts, and to propose and
advocate policies within the White House. ONDCP's effectiveness
is limited, however, both in its statute and through its
operation as a White House office. Congress could choose to
reauthorize ONDCP, and in so doing maintain or alter its mission
and authority; or allow ONDCP to expire. </p>

<p> If Congress chooses to reauthorize ONDCP, a number of options
exist for altering its mission. Congress could: </p>

<p> o Direct ONDCP to address the full range of the most harmful
abusable substances, including alcohol, tobacco, and inhalants.
Although federally funded prevention programs address the range
of abusable substances, the statute creating ONDCP emphasized
illicit substances. As a result, ONDCP has historically provided
limited attention on abusable substances that have been
associated with higher levels of death and injury than illicit
drugs. More recently, ONDCP increased the focus in its National
Drug Control Strategy on the illicit use of alcohol and tobacco
by minors because of the extensive damage to the health and
safety of minors, resulting from the use and abuse of these
substances. This approach could be enhanced through congressional
authorization. </p>

<p> o Alter ONDCP's leadership structure. ONDCP by statute has a
Deputy Director of Supply Reduction and a Deputy Director for
Demand Reduction. This structure has, in part, resulted in an
ongoing public policy debate regarding the overall federal focus
on antidrug efforts, with supply-side and demand-side reduction
efforts seen by some as philosophically incompatible (see
discussion on supply versus demand reduction earlier in this
chapter). By creating an alternative structure, ONDCP may be
encouraged to adopt programs that more closely link various
elements of the antidrug strategy (e.g., a focus on drug
availability could link current supply-side elements that target
physical availability of a drug with current demand-side efforts
that focus on economic and social availability, as discussed in
chapter 4). Despite the advantages that may result from a new
organizational structure, the simplicity of the current structure
makes it easier to provide a sharper focus on supply and demand
elements of the National Drug Control Strategy. </p>

<p> o Give ONDCP increased authority over federal agency antidrug
programs. Although ONDCP is charged with leading a war on drugs,
its authority is limited to a coordinating function. Congress
could provide the Director of ONDCP with specific authority over
certain elements of various federal programs, or with additional
authority over federal agency budget proposals. Such actions
would give the drug czar more substantive authority to direct the
war on drugs, but would likely be viewed by some federal agencies
as an unwarranted intrusion in agency matters. </p>

<p> o Mandate the size of ONDCP. Because it is part of the
Executive Office of the President, ONDCP is subject to increased
political manipulation by each administration. Recently, for
example, ONDCP took the largest personnel cut of any White House
office to meet President Clinton's pledge of a 25 percent
reduction in overall size of White House staff. While mandating a
specific size for ONDCP might lead to increased effectiveness for
the office, it would hamper White House efforts to control staff
size. </p>

<p> Alternatively, Congress could allow the authorization for
ONDCP to expire. While ONDCP has produced National Drug Control
Strategies that summarize and set policy for federal efforts, the
office lacks the authority to shape the antidrug policies of the
federal agencies. Coordination of antidrug efforts is difficult
at best when the number of relevant agencies is so large; since
antidrug policy involves many federal agencies, it might make
sense to disband ONDCP and rely on efforts by diverse federal
agencies to continue to address the many aspects of the drug
problem. Recent reductions in the size of the ONDCP staff, as a
part of the down-sizing of the White House staff, could make this
an opportune time to eliminate the office altogether. Terminating
ONDCP would, however, be viewed by many as federal abdication of
the war on drugs. </p>

<p> Structure of Federal Substance Abuse Prevention Programs </p>

<p> Federal efforts supporting substance abuse prevention
programs are housed at a number of agencies. Congress recently
reorganized the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health
Administration (ADAMHA), splitting service-based components into
the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA) and research-based components--the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the National Institute on Mental Health
(NIMH)-- into the National Institutes of Health (NIH). More
recently, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has been renamed
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), which has
already expanded its title and mission to include prevention.
Congress could maintain the current structure if it determines
that substance abuse is a problem that has many aspects and
deserves to be addressed by many agencies and in many settings. </p>

<p> If Congress decided to create a more centralized structure,
it could enact legislation designating a single federal entity as
the chief agency for prevention efforts, or merge the components
of various agencies under one federal roof. Possibilities
include: </p>

<p> o Merging NIDA and NIAAA into a single National Institute on
Substance Abuse and Addiction. The use of multiple substances
(including alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin) is
increasingly reported by researchers and practitioners. Indeed,
the gateway theory or hypothesis focuses on the progression in
the use of substances, beginning with alcohol and tobacco (which
are illegal for youth, but legal for adults) and moving to
marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. Since clinicians and researchers
have increasingly commented on the progression in substance use
and on the co-occurrence of the use of multiple substances, the
separation of the major federal research agencies into an alcohol
agency (NIAAA) and a drug agency (NIDA) is more and more
inconsistent with the shape of the problem. The Center for
Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) is an integrated substance
abuse agency that explicitly focuses on alcohol, tobacco, and
other drugs, and all state alcohol and drug abuse agencies are
now integrated or located in the same place. To facilitate more
integrated and coherent research on the range of abusable
substances, NIDA and NIAAA could be combined into a national
institute on substance abuse and addiction. Such a merger would
further integrate the federal research efforts in substance
abuse, but might be seen by some as downplaying the emphasis
given to illicit substances. </p>

<p> o Place CSAP in CDCP or in the Health Resources and Services
Administration (HRSA). CDCP could give the substance abuse
prevention field a solid base in the health and medical sciences,
especially in the tracking and prevention of diseases. HRSA could
give CSAP a broader health care environment to work within, which
includes Community Health Centers and the National Health Service
Corps. One disadvantage to the merging of CSAP into either of
these other health agencies is that it would emphasize the
medical aspects and interventions of drug prevention and downplay
the many nonmedical factors and interventions that are important
in the onset of substance use and abuse. Merger would also
present problems of moving people--CSAP is headquartered in
Rockville, Maryland, while CDCP is headquartered in Atlanta,
Georgia--and threaten the loss of identity that some proponents
of CSAP say is found in an agency that solely addresses substance
abuse and prevention. However, the fragmentation of the federal
effort on substance abuse prevention has been viewed by some as
extreme and counterproductive, and the efforts of ONDCP have not
succeeded in achieving coordination across departments. </p>

<p> o Merge federal substance abuse prevention efforts into a
single agency, such as CSAP. CSAP has been working
collaboratively with the staff in many other federal agencies,
and would be seen as a natural leader for this effort. In
addition, its recent efforts to begin to develop standards of
practice for substance abuse and addiction prevention programs
could be continued and more effectively infused into the
components of programs currently in other agencies and
departments. </p>

<p> Evaluation of Prevention Programs </p>

<p> Current drug prevention programs lack scientifically accepted
standards for determining their success or failure. Most
evaluations focus on the processes used in formulating and
implementing a prevention program (e.g., who was involved, what
type of program was used) and outcome evaluation (e.g., how many
people were part of the program, how the program was replicated).
Congress could allow the current level of process and outcome
evaluation related to substance abuse prevention programs to
continue. </p>

<p> If it chose to improve the quality of program evaluation,
Congress could direct NIDA and NIAAA, or CSAP to design, lead,
and support a multiyear national process (involving
representatives of other federal agencies and of outside
organizations) to forge consensus on standardized definitions and
outcome measures, using technical reviews, consensus-forming
techniques, and technical assistance monographs. These
definitions and measures could include substance use, heavy
drinking, substance abuse, substance addiction or dependency, and
related behavioral problems such as school truancy, unemployment,
delinquent and criminal behaviors, and the like. CSAP, NIDA,
NIAAA, the Department of Education (DOE), and other federal
agencies could be required to increase funding and technical
assistance for process and outcome evaluations through grants and
contracts. CSAP could focus on process evaluations that may
assist program managers throughout the course of a program. NIDA
and NIAA could focus on outcome evaluations that are more
rigorously designed and conducted by individuals who are
independent of the programs being evaluated. DoE could require
both process and outcome evaluations by states and by schools,
using Drug-Free School monies. NIDA, NIAAA, or CSAP could be
directed to provide incentives for researchers and programs to
participate in a national program database, using consistent
definitions and including data from multiple evaluations. The
creation of such a database would allow researchers to extend
their own analyses by tapping into data from other program sites
and populations that have used consistent definitions and
measures. </p>

<p> States could be required by legislation to use a portion of
their 20 percent prevention set-asides under the Alcohol and Drug
Abuse Block Grant program and a portion of their Drug- Free
Schools funds for evaluation of substance abuse prevention
programs. Since evaluations of prevention programs can be
expensive, Congress could consider increasing block grant funding
levels to allow increases in evaluation studies without requiring
decreases in programs. If such an option were enacted, Congress
could mandate that evaluations be conducted by independent
bodies, such as university-based researchers, rather than by
state government agencies that have vested interests in
demonstrating program effectiveness. </p>

<p> RESEARCH NEEDS </p>

<p> Data Collection </p>

<p> The National Household Survey and the National Survey of High
School Seniors have developed credibility over the years for
their regular reporting of substance use in households and high
schools. These surveys could be allowed to continue, with no
substantial changes in the cost, frequency of data collection,
focus on target groups, analysis, and sharing of the database. </p>

<p> Because of the methodology employed, national surveys miss or
underreport various populations. Much of the data now collected
focuses on substance use (e.g., any use within the past 30 days
or anytime in a lifetime), rather than on more intense substance
abuse and addiction. In addition, questions are
substance-specific, and less oriented to the use and abuse of
multiple substances. Such polydrug users and abusers are
increasingly being identified by researchers and clinicians.
While substance use is a key precondition to later abuse and
addiction, most individuals who use illicit substances do not go
on to addiction. Thus, an important question for the development
of prevention policies and programs is: What are the
characteristics of individuals who abuse and become addicted to
substances, and how do they make the transition from use to abuse
and addiction? </p>

<p> If Congress felt that current data do not provide adequate
information, it could direct that the Household and High School
Surveys be conducted less intensely or less frequently. The
expense of these surveys, especially the National Household
Survey, is high. In 1992, the High School Survey cost about $3
million, and the Household Survey costover $12 million. Spending
could be reduced if the survey data were compiled less intensely
(e.g., with fewer questions or from a smaller sample) or less
frequently. Alternatively, Congress could direct NIDA to develop
and support survey methodology that reaches populations missed by
current surveys (notably the homeless, school dropouts, and
residents of some inner-city and rural areas), or through
legislation, create a mechanism, comparable to the release of
economic indicators, for the regular and nonpolitical release of
survey data. Data could then be released through a well-defined
process that includes careful and timely technical reviews for
compliance with high standards of data collection and analysis,
rather than being subjected to bureaucratic or political reviews
that may delay the release of or bias the data. </p>

<p> Individual Risk and Protective Factors </p>

<p> A substantial body of research has been developed regarding
potential risk and protective factors for children and
adolescents. A variety of theories has been developed concerning
how many and which risk factors increase the chances for a child
or adolescent to first use alcohol or other drugs. Historically,
one of the flaws with much of the risk and protective factor
research has been that studies analyzed one factor in isolation
from all others. Increasingly though, researchers are examining a
wider variety of factors among different populations, as well as
using more complex data analysis procedures. Even so,
sophisticated multifactor research studies are still in the
minority. </p>

<p> While a substantial amount of risk and protective factor
research has focused on children and adolescents, not as much is
known about factors among other populations. Recent research has
led to interest in the possibility of further analyses in
selected populations and/or selected risk or protective factors.
Some examples: </p>

<p> o Adults. Additional research in this area could result in
learning more about factors associated with long-term drug abuse
and addiction as well as the importance of factors more often
found in adult populations (e.g., effects of aging, death of a
spouse or child, divorce). Data from a recent National Household
Survey on Drug Abuse show that individuals aged 18 to 25, and 26
to 34, respectively, have the two highest reported rates for
heavy drinking and smoking, past month use of cocaine, crack,
marijuana and hashish, or psychotherapeutic drugs. Additionally,
gender, racial, and ethnic substance use differences appear
within the adult population. Some research has indicated that
women who drink heavily do so several years later than men,
although the reasons for this remain unclear. Researchers also
indicate that black men who drink heavily, do so in their late
twenties and early thirties, in contrast to white men whose
drinking peaks at age 15 to early twenties. Increased research on
the adult population could be useful in developing appropriate
substance abuse prevention and treatment programs for adults. </p>

<p> o Race and Ethnicity. The biological and genetic substance
abuse studies completed on different racial and ethnic groups
have been few in number, mostly limited to alcohol, and
inconclusive. While race and ethnicity have not been shown to be
biological or genetic predictors for substance use, abuse, or
addiction, certain risk factors appear to be unique for specific
cultures. To date, however, the racial and ethnic categories used
in many large-scale studies are so broad that many researchers
consider them useless. Increased federal funding for studies of
specific subpopulations living in geographically different areas
(e.g., urban versus rural, reservation versus nonreservation)
will provide much needed baseline data on which to plan,
implement, and evaluate appropriate substance abuse services. </p>

<p> o Poverty. Disagreement exists on the appropriate definition
of poverty and its exact relationship to substance abuse. While
few researchers deny that the daily stresses associated with
living in chronic poverty probably contribute to substance abuse,
poverty is certainly not the only factor, or perhaps even the
most important. There are after all, more individuals living in
poverty who do not abuse substances than who do. However, the
consequences of substance abuse appear to be worse in chronically
poor areas. Additional research to study the complex relationship
between poverty and substance abuse could provide substance abuse
practitioners with a framework from which to build programs most
suitable for the special needs of chronically poor areas. </p>

<p> Congress can, through its reauthorization and oversight
powers, monitor the amount and scope of risk and protective
factor research that is being conducted, and redirect federal
efforts toward more extensive multifactor research and analysis,
as appropriate. Such focus could include factors other than
substance use that may contribute to later abuse and addiction,
such as other problem behaviors, availability, marketing,
psychological factors, social norms in communities, and
subcultures. The increased use of ethnographers as part of a
multidisciplinary drug abuse prevention research teams could also
be encouraged. </p>

<p> Biomedical Research </p>

<p> Biomedical research on substance abuse helps explain the
acute and chronic biological effects of substances on the brain
and other organs, and also points to appropriate short- and
long-term medical treatments for substance abuse. This in turn
helps treatment providers understand treatment outcomes and
relapse rates for long-term abusers. Most federally supported
biomedical research is administered by the 17 institutes that
comprise the NIH. With the passage of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse,
and Mental Health Administration Reorganization Act of 1992
(Public Law 102-321), NIDA and the NIAAA were moved to NIH.
Research targeting substance use, abuse, and addiction is
supported primarily by these two institutes, whose combined
appropriation level ($580.7 million in fiscal year 1994) is
approximately 5 percent of the NIH total. </p>

<p> Congress has historically increased annual appropriations for
biomedical research at NIH; if Congress continues this trend,
both NIDA and NIAAA annual appropriations will rise, although not
at the dramatic levels many scientists would like. If Congress
were to decide that substance abuse and addiction should command
more of the nation's biomedical research budget, it could
substantially raise appropriation levels for NIDA and NIAAA. Such
an action would allow increased levels of research in a number of
areas including: genetics; drug development; identification of
biological factors related to transitions from casual drug use to
abuse, addiction, and dependence; the pharmacology of multiple
drug use; environmental factors and their effect on individual
biological susceptibility; and the biological effects of drug use
and abuse on the development of children and adolescents. Given
budget realities, however, an increase in the funding levels
available for basic biomedical research could mean a decrease
somewhere else. </p>

<p> A number of budgetary pressures have recently slowed robust
NIH budget growth, including the need to fund disease- specific
research (e.g., acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), indirect
costs of research, and the increasing pressure to limit
discretionary spending. Some scientists identify stable budget
growth--as opposed to sporadic increases targeted at particular
topics--as most important for continued progress in research. In
fiscal year 1994, both NIDA and NIAAA received a 5.2 percent
increase in appropriations, following an Administration request
that would have raised NIDA's appropriation by less than 1
percent, and decreased NIAAA's appropriation by 1.6 percent.
Fluctuations in appropriation levels could impede the development
of scientific advances that are necessary to the creation of new
medications and therapies. </p>

<p> The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in its March 1994
report to Congress, Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue
Options, identified a reduction in funding for NIH research as
one of nearly 200 policy options. As noted by CBO, a reduction in
NIH funding could have adverse effects on biomedical research and
might cause some researchers to leave the field. NIH cannot
currently fund the majority of grants it approves; in addition,
funding is insufficient to support some important areas of
research. According to a 1992 General Accounting Office report on
Drug Abuse Research: Federal Funding and Future Needs, antidrug
research appears now to have a very modest role, with only about
4 percent of total drug strategy spending devoted to research and
development. </p>

<p> COMMUNITY ACTIVITY SETTINGS </p>

<p> Substance abuse and addiction occur in communities around our
Nation. Those who believe that drug abuse and addiction are
closely related to social and economic problems argue that
antidrug programs should more directly address the risk and
protective factors that have been identified by researchers. Many
prevention program providers also argue that the most successful
programs are those that are more comprehensive in scope (i.e.,
tailored to address the many community settings in which drug
abuse can occur) rather than addressing one or two risk factors
in isolation. </p>

<p> In conducting this assessment, OTA surveyed literatures
addressing substance abuse and addiction in various community
settings--families and homes, schools and peers, workplaces, and
recreational settings (see ch. 8). The literature reviews
presented in this report make clear that substance abuse and
addiction can arise and be influenced by multiple factors in
individuals, groups, and communities. Thus, effective
intervention ideally should be comprehensive, employing multiple
services and addressing the many factors that cause drug abuse
and addiction; and community-based, sensitive to and directed at
the needs of the local population. </p>

<p> Still, three problems arise in assessing policy options
related to community settings: </p>

<p> 1. There is the inherent difficulty in drawing a link between
many social services and their effect on drug abuse and
addiction. </p>

<p> 2. Since broad-based social services are provided through the
work of many federal agencies, further analysis (e.g., by ONDCP
or a congressionally enacted national commission) could identify
which federal agencies are best suited to implement the variety
of options that Congress may wish to employ. </p>

<p> 3. The federal budget deficit is an obstacle to the creation
of new domestic programs that target known risk and protective
factors in individuals and communities. </p>

<p> Schools and Peers </p>

<p> The primary focus of federal efforts at community-based drug
prevention is programs aimed at our nation's schoolchildren. In
fiscal year 1993, Congress appropriated $598 million to DOE under
the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986. The federal
government could continue to fund school-based prevention
programs, with a continued emphasis on prevention curricula and
evaluations that are limited to substance use prevention. The
likely limited effects on preventing abuse among high-risk youth
would continue. Other school-based prevention programs would
continue to be implemented sporadically, without significant
evaluation and with few or unknown effects. </p>

<p> If Congress decided that more rigorous evaluation of school-
based programs was called for, it could mandate DOE to spend a
set percent of its Drug Free Schools monies on research and
evaluation of prevention curricula and the dissemination of
findings. A special initiative could be launched to test
prevention curricula for high-risk youth and for different racial
and ethnic groups, since most of the research and evaluation to
date has been based on samples of schools with middle income
white youth. Special expertise would need to be brought in, on
staff and as advisers, to assure the research and evaluation meet
high standards of methodological rigor. This could be achieved by
hiring staff with research and evaluation expertise, detailing
staff from the NIDA, setting up an interdepartmental advisory
group that guides and oversees a research and evaluation program,
or appropriating funds directly to NIDA (e.g., as a set- aside
from the Drug-Free Schools appropriation) to support such a
research and evaluation program. Also, easier access to
information about the many drug prevention curricula that exist
could help school personnel select curricula that fit their
needs. DOE could be directed to prepare and disseminate more
widely information about the purposes, design, methods, resources
required, and evaluations (if any) of drug prevention curricula
currently available, and to inform school personnel of the
limitations of school- based curriculum approaches and the
growing availability of supplementary and alternative approaches.
If Congress decided that Drug-Free Schools funds should be used
more widely to target risk and protective factors found in
school-aged populations, it could require DOE to set aside a
certain percentage of Drug-Free Schools funds for a variety of
activities that target high-risk youths and to work individually
with them and their families. Such targeting could enhance
activities already carried out under the Drug- Free Schools Act
(e.g., Drug Abuse Resistance Education, replication of successful
programs, local programs for high- risk youth, school personnel
training). However, congressional mandates could reduce state and
local flexibility in tailoring programs best suited to local
needs, and could increase administrative costs associated with
implementing the Drug-Free Schools Act. </p>

<p> In addition to Drug-Free Schools programs, comprehensive
primary health, mental health, and social services can be
provided in many school-based clinics. School-based clinics can
be supported by a variety of federal funding sources, including
Medicaid, the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, Drug-Free
Schools, and Special Education funds. DOE and the Department of
Health and Human Services could be encouraged or directed to
collaborate on the support of such services in schools. </p>

<p> Since researchers have found that peers and other social
influences strongly affect substance use, programs that
strengthen total school environments may be potent in preventing
substance use and abuse. Models that involve school
restructuring, parent involvement, mental health components, and
elevated expectations for achievement have been developed and are
being tested. The hypothesis is that engaging high-risk youth in
positive educational environments and experiences can profoundly
influence their behaviors for the better. Congress could expand
research on the effects of restructuring of school environments
on substance abuse by appropriating funds for extensive large-
scale longitudinal research that could be supported by DOE, NIDA,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), and other
federal agencies that conduct and support research on youth
outcomes. </p>

<p> Homes and Families </p>

<p> Congress appropriates funds for federal programs addressing
substance abuse and addiction in homes and families, which are
supported by the HUD and HHS' Administration on Children, Youth,
and Families (ACYF) and CSAP. Also relevant to the health and
welfare of families are health funding programs (e.g., Medicaid
and Medicare) and welfare programs (e.g., Aid to Families with
Dependent Children). Through its oversight, authorization, and
appropriations of these programs, and others that impact on the
quality of family life, Congress can support a number of
preventive interventions that are both comprehensive and
intensive. Programs can be initiated by almost any local service
or support setting, such as health care, school, family
preservation, juvenile justice, and housing authority, with
coordination with other services and settings. Such interventions
can include health care, counseling, intensive in-home services,
neighborhood patrols, clean sweeps of public housing, and family
and parent education for all family members. </p>

<p> Because substance abuse and other related problems can be
influenced by so many family factors and programs, a long- term
effort to identify family needs may be desired. Congress could
enact legislation to create a Presidential commission or task
force to formulate a national family policy and create a
blueprint for long-term national efforts to shore up the many
families, rich and poor, that would benefit from more guidance,
skills, and support. Such a national policy could be framed in
the near-term, based on the many studies and program
interventions that have been documented so far. Alternatively, it
could be formulated later, after additional research and program
interventions have been supported and major gaps in knowledge
have been filled. </p>

<p> Workplaces </p>

<p> Congress could allow current activities that focus on
providing workplace employees with information, development of
drug-free workplace policies, drug testing, and employee
assistance programs to continue. These programs are scattered
among many federal agencies, with some leadership by the
Department of Labor (DOL), CSAP, and the Office of Management and
Budget. </p>

<p> If Congress chose to increase efforts in workplace antidrug
prevention, it could mandate that federal agencies increase the
information that is made available to workplaces about drug-free
workplace programs and policies. For example, DOL is implementing
an electronic database, with information about workplace
substance abuse treatment, prevention, and other control programs
and research. Such a database, if properly supported, publicized,
and accessed by businesses and unions, could help workplaces
identify and implement approaches that can meet their needs in
affordable ways. </p>

<p> Recreational and Community Settings </p>

<p> Congress currently funds community partnership demonstration
programs administered by CSAP. These partnerships foster
public/private sector partnerships that create and preserve
comprehensive strategies for addressing substance abuse
prevention within communities. A major advantage of these
partnerships is the ability to create programs that address
substance abuse prevention within individual communities. As with
other drug prevention programs, however, evaluation has generally
been limited. Congress could, through appropriations and
authorization, direct CSAP to expand the provision of technical
assistance and expand the national process and outcome evaluation
of partnerships. More site visits would be possible, with
additional resources for national and regional workshops,
conferences, and training. </p>

<p> Other federal activities in this area remain limited and
largely uncoordinated. Major current programs are administered by
the Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service
(with its 4-H program, which is refocusing its efforts on
high-risk youth) and CSAP (through some of its High Risk Youth
Demonstration Grants). The President's Council on Physical
Fitness addresses one aspect of recreational and leisure
activities--that is, physical fitness. If Congress decided to
provide more information and support more research on
recreational, leisure, and other youth development programs, an
information clearinghouse could be established to share
information about federal and non-federal recreational, leisure,
and youth development activities. The purpose would be to help
communities and program developers identify and develop such
programs especially for youth at risk of drug use and abuse. The
clearinghouse could be managed in-house or under contract, and
could be located in the Cooperative Extension Service (which is
now attempting to redirect 4-H programs to address high-risk
youth); ACYF; or CSAP (perhaps in the existing National Center
for Alcohol and Drug Information, a federally sponsored
clearinghouse). </p>

<p> The dearth of recreational places, especially in highly
developed urban areas, can be remedied by an enhanced national
effort to acquire land and facilities for park and recreation
purposes. Such an effort could focus especially, but not
exclusively, on rural and inner city areas where low property
values make the acquisition of such properties financially
attractive as long-term investments in the future development and
enrichment of communities. Such a national effort could be
comparable in scope and long-termcommitment to the development of
the national park system, but could contribute to a broader
national system of parks owned and managed by the federal, state,
and local governments specifically for more intense human uses.
Such a system could focus on the developmental needs of youth,
especially in urban areas, where usable open spaces are often in
short supply. Congress could designate a lead federal agency for
such an effort (e.g., Department of Interior or HUD), and could
acquire properties outright or by encouraging and subsidizing the
acquisition of properties by nonprofit groups and by state and
local governments. The latter approach would require less federal
funding and administration. Possible sources of land and
facilities include: closed military bases, holdings of the
Resolution Trust Corporation, assets forfeited through drug
seizures, individual gifts and bequests, and corporate and
philanthropic gifts. </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY </p>

<p> The primary current focus of federal antidrug efforts is
stemming the physical supply of illicit drugs. A multitude of
policy issues arise in addressing drug availability, most of
which are beyond the scope of this report. The discussion in
chapter 4, however, touches on two availability issues currently
on the congressional agenda. </p>

<p> Taxes </p>

<p> The federal government currently levies excise taxes on
alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Excise taxes on all
types of alcoholic beverages were raised in 1990 to their current
levels. Currently, for example, beer (six pack, 12-ounce cans)
carries a 33 cent federal excise tax, a 750 ml bottle of wine
carries a 21 cent federal excise tax. A pack of cigarettes
carries a federal excise tax of 24 cents. If Congress takes no
action, current federal levies will remain in effect. </p>

<p> Congress could enact legislation raising the federal excise
tax on a variety of tobacco and alcohol products if it sought to
decrease consumption of such products, to recover estimated
societal costs (i.e., health costs, injury, </p>

<p> death) resulting from consumption of such products, or to
raise revenue for federal spending programs. Such tax hikes could
be targeted at all tobacco and alcohol products, or at selected
products in these industries. Advocates of increased excise taxes
have argued that abuse of and addiction to tobacco and alcohol
products cost the United States more than any illicit substance;
that increased taxes would make such products less economically
affordable and hence less used and abused; that increased taxes
could be used to pay for financial damages arising from the use
of such products; and that such excise taxes, which have
increased less rapidly than the general rate of inflation, should
be adjusted upward to reflect inflation. Opponents of taxation
have argued that excise taxes are regressive in that they target
primarily low- and middle- income taxpayers, that increased taxes
would result in significant losses to major companies that are
important players in the American economy, and that targeting
so-called sin taxes unfairly singles out millions of Americans
who use tobacco and alcohol products. </p>

<p> Alcohol Labeling </p>

<p> Federal law currently requires that each alcoholic beverage
container bear a specific warning statement that is conspicuously
and prominently located (27 USC 215). This requirement was
enacted by Congress in 1980. Both Congress and States have
authority regulating alcohol advertising. At least 35 states
regulate alcohol advertising, and self-policing by segments of
industry places some limits on advertising (e.g., the distilled
spirits industry code prohibits the advertising of liquor on
radio or television). </p>

<p> Congress has considered legislation that would require
warnings on all alcohol beverage advertising, both print and
electronic media. Congress could amend current alcohol labeling
law to require stricter labeling (e.g., multiple labels, rotating
labels, specific messages). Opponents of such action argue that
no significant relationship has been found between exposure of
individuals to alcoholic beverage advertising and/or labeling and
drinking behaviors. _ <br>

<p> <b>APPENDIX A: DRUG CONTROL POLICY IN THE UNITED STATES:
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> The United States has always been a drug-using country. In
colonial days, people drank more alcohol than they do today, with
estimates ranging from three to as many as seven times more
alcohol per year (13) While public drunkenness was a criminal
offense, it was generally considered a personal indiscretion.
(1). The temperance movement began in earnest after the
Revolution, when heavy drinking was revealed to be a problem, and
religious figures became committed to temperance. (1). Since
then, the American experience with both licit and illicit drugs
can be viewed as a series of reactions to the public's shifting
tolerance toward their use (9). </p>

<p> THE EARLY 1900s: NARCOTICS AND COCAINE </p>

<p> In the late 19th century it was possible to buy, in a store
or through mail order, many pseudomedical preparations,
containing morphine, cocaine, and even heroin (9). The ubiquitous
soft drink Coca-Cola used to contain cocaine until 1903, when it
was replaced with caffeine (9). Pharmacies sold cocaine in pure
form, as well as a number of opium-derived drugs, such as
morphine and heroin, the latter of which became well-known when
it was marketed by the Bayer Co. beginning in 1898 (10).
Physician prescriptions of these drugs increased from 1 percent
of all prescriptions in 1874 to between 20 to 25 percent in 1902;
they were not only available but they were widely used, without
major concerns about negative health consequences (14). </p>

<p> Cocaine and narcotic preparations were taken off the market
for various reasons. Increasing awareness of the hazards of drug
use and adulterated food led to such regulations as the Pure Food
and Drug Act of 1906 that required that fraudulent claims be
removed from patent medicines, as well as disclosure of
habit-forming substances. The passage of several antinarcotic and
pharmaceutical labeling laws was spurred on by these health
concerns, a growing temperance movement, the development of safe
pain relievers (such as aspirin), a broader range of medical
treatments, and the growing immigrant population thought to be
associated with specific drug-using practices. However, these
laws did not make patent remedies, cocaine, and opium illegal.
Some individual states imposed tighter restrictions on their
availability, but there was no uniformity among state laws. It
was United States involvement with international narcotics
concern that led there (9,10,14). </p>

<p> In 1909, the International Opium Commission called by the
United States, met in Shanghai, to begin an international
discussion concerning the problems of narcotics and the narcotics
trade. Twelve nations, in addition to the United States, were
present to discuss problems relating to opium. At that time the
perception in the United States was that Chinese immigrants were
to blame for the opium smoking problems. This angered the
Chinese, who had instituted strict campaigns against the sale and
use of opium within their own country. The Chinese were seeking
U.S. assurances for help in ending Western opium trafficking into
China. The State Department not only wanted to support China's
drug control efforts, but thought that international drug control
measures would help stanch the flow of drugs into the United
States, and thus the nonmedical consumption of these drugs. It
would not be until two years later, in the Hague, that a treaty
would be signed stating that all the signatories would enact
domestic legislation controlling narcotics trade, specifically
limiting the use of narcotics for medicinal purposes (9,10). </p>

<p> Hamilton Wright, the State Department's opium commissioner,
attempted to draft legislation but met opposition from the
States, the medical profession, pharmacists and pharmaceutical
companies. After nearly three years of debate, Congress passed
the Harrison Act in December 1914 (named for Representative
Francis Burton Harrison, who introduced the initial form of the
bill for the Administration). The bill provided for strict
control of opium and coca and their derivatives: both their entry
into the country and their dispersion to patients. Maintenance of
addicts by physicians was allowed until 1919. Opposition to the
Harrison Act came mainly from pharmaceutical companies and
pharmacists, who objected to what they called the Act's confusing
and complex record keeping requirements (9). </p>

<p> Passage of the Harrison Act reflected, in part, growing
public sentiment that opium and cocaine were medicines to be
taken only in times of illness (and then only when prescribed by
a physician) and that these substances could cause insanity and
crime, particularly in foreigners and minorities. Smoking opium
was associated with Chinese immigrants; popular belief also held
that cocaine would affect blacks more forcefully than whites and
incite them to violence. Marijuana was believed to have been
brought into the country and promoted by Mexican immigrants and
then picked up by black jazz musicians. These beliefs played a
part in the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act, which attempted to control
the drug's use (9). As early as 1910, many people argued against
any nonmedical use of narcotics. </p>

<p> PROHIBITION AND BEYOND </p>

<p> Focus on Alcohol </p>

<p> Ratification in 1919 of the 18th amendment prohibited the
manufacture, sale, transportation, importation, and exportation
of alcohol and shifted the Nation's focus for more than a decade
from the dangers of narcotics to the Nation's alcohol problems.
Prohibition had its roots in the Temperance Movement, which began
shortly after the Revolution. In 1784, Benjamin Rush, a physician
and signer of the Declaration of Independence, published a
pamphlet entitled, &quot;An Inquiry Into the Effects of Ardent
Spirits on the Mind and Body,&quot; which was widely disseminated
among Temperance leaders. In it he described a &quot;disease
model&quot; of excessive drinking, which characterized
drunkenness and alcohol addiction as a &quot;disease of the
will,&quot; in addition to causing many physical diseases. By the
mid-19th century, the American middle class had become more aware
of the dangers of alcohol to the family, the nation, and the
factory (1). By the late 19th century and early 20th century, the
Temperance Movement came to be associated almost exclusively with
American Protestantism as a political mechanism to control the
growing numbers of non-Protestant immigrants. This political and
social strength helped, in 1919, to ratify the 18th amendment
which forbade the sale of alcoholic beverages, and to implement
it by means of the Volstead Act in 1920 (1). </p>

<p> The shifting tolerance of Americans toward substance use is
evidenced by the successes and failures of the Prohibition era.
In 1919, many were optimistic that the prohibition of alcohol
would solve many of the country's social problems. If alcohol
contributed to the crime and unemployment associated with the
cities, then removing it from the market might help solve those
problems. However, despite evidence that consumption declined
(based on declining rates of death due to cirrhosis and of
alcoholic psychosis in State mental hospitals), there is also
evidence that widespread dishonesty existed in the enforcement of
dry laws. Jobs to enforce Prohibition were doled out as political
favors, which may have contributed to graft, corruption, and the
surge in underworld crime (9,17). In addition to the perceived
rise in corruption, the passage of progressively stricter laws
regarding violations of the Volstead Act also contributed to
waning public support of prohibition (17). The 1933 repeal of
Prohibition signaled that public sentiment had once again become
favorable toward alcohol, and alcohol and its related problems
returned to private, rather than public, arenas. </p>

<p> The scientific literature of the 1930s and early 1940s
concentrated mainly on captive alcoholic populations in jails,
mental hospitals, and skid row, allowing many Americans to
distance themselves from alcoholism (1). During this same period,
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was founded, but lacked mainstream
recognition until the 1950s and 1960s when the scientists lent
support to the disease model of alcoholism, which has always been
the central tenet of AA (1,11). </p>

<p> Focus on Narcotics </p>

<p> While alcohol experienced a transition period in respect to
public tolerance, negative attitudes toward narcotics and other
drugs remained constant, or became even more severe. During the
1920s, the Federal government expanded its antidrug efforts
through new Treasury Department regulations (8). In 1930,
President Hoover created the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and
appointed Harry Anslinger as the Commissioner of Narcotics, a
position Anslinger held from 1930 to 1962, a precursor, perhaps,
to the modern day drug czar. For more than three decades,
Anslinger oversaw all aspects of drug control, from interdiction
to domestic supply, to public relations. He effectively used
religious and other antidrug groups to maintain a high antidrug
sentiment in the country. He also controlled the flow of legal
drug supplies, by keeping watch over doctors who might prescribe
unusually large amounts of narcotics. Anslinger was opposed to
the medical treatment of addiction, and addicts, like alcoholics,
were seen as deviants (9,15). </p>

<p> Prior to the mid-1960s, marijuana use in the United States
was mostly confined to various subgroups such as Mexican
laborers, jazz musicians, and beatniks. Although portrayed as a
killer weed and a menace by antimarijuana reformers, there is
little evidence that it was either at this time. In 1937, the
Marihuana Tax Act (the Federal government then spelled marijuana
with an &quot;h&quot;), became law, making the use and sale of
marijuana without a tax stamp Federal offenses. Some companies
were permitted to apply for a license to use cannabis products
(e.g., for birdseed, paint and rope), and doctors could still
prescribe marijuana in limited circumstances. However, starting
in 1937, recreational use was punished with greater severity
(15). Some speculated that the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act
resulted from strong anti-Mexican sentiment in the Southwest and
the political power of Anslinger (5). </p>

<p> Intolerance toward drug use was very strong in the 1930s and
40s. Federal laws concerning the sale and use of drugs got
progressively stricter, culminating in the introduction of the
death penalty for the sale of heroin to anyone under 18 years old
by anyone older than 18 (10). Illicit drug use during these
decades was low in the mainstream population. This
marginalization of narcotics (or at least, of the people who used
them) may have played a part in the resurfacing of these drugs
after the 1930s. There was a concern during World War II that
American soldiers in Asia would succumb to drug supplies
available in those countries and return home with drug habits.
The Bureau of Narcotics received no budget increases, since
Congress apparently believed it was well equipped to deal with
the current drug levels (9). </p>

<p> In the 1950s, however, heroin was brought into the country in
larger quantities than at any time since it was outlawed. Dealers
learned that poor quality heroin could be sold at inflated
prices, and this higher cost pushed users into criminal
lifestyles heretofore not seen on such a wide scale (12). A
nationwide scare that drug use would spread from the urban poor
(mostly minorities) to the rest of the country erupted. The fact
that young people appeared to be the biggest users of heroin was
particularly alarming. This fear was reflected in the passage of
the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, which increased penalties for
the sale and possession of marijuana and heroin (15). </p>

<p> The reaction to this rise in drug use was not entirely
fearful, however. Scientific and technological advances offered
alternative answers to coping with the drug problem a switch from
the past tactics of law enforcement. Even though the
stereotypical heroin user was still a poor minority, new ideas
for treating and helping these people emerged as part of
increasing acceptance of the medical model of addiction. In the
1960s, methadone maintenance pilot programs were launched. By
using the long-acting opioid methadone for treatment of addiction
to the short- acting opiate heroin, these programs offer a way
for heroin addicts to control their addiction (6). </p>

<p> 1960s-PRESENT </p>

<p> In the 1960s, white middle-class youths, who were more
visible than their minority counterparts, began experimenting
with drugs, including marijuana and heroin, causing wide public
concern and demand for more treatment approaches and additional
law enforcement (17). Some of this new interest in drug use may
be attributed to the intolerance toward it in the preceding
decades. Marijuana had never been widely used, and after the
1930s its use was not a widespread concern. It was rediscovered
by young people in the 1960s, who had grown up with parents who
used alcohol. Some of the drug consumption may also be linked to
an increase in consumption generally during the late 1960s and
early 1970s, the Vietnam War protest movement, and the rapid
changes in American society that occurred in those years
(9,10,17). </p>

<p> Despite the image of the sixties as a time of widespread
experimentation, the increase of drug use activated many who had
been quiet on the issue. Marijuana, the drug of choice among many
young people, was seen by some researchers as the gateway to more
dangerous drug use. Richard Nixon was elected President in 1968
on a law and order platform, and it is said that no other
President has campaigned as hard against drug abuse (9). As
during World War II, concern rose that soldiers serving in
Southeast Asia would develop drug habits while there. In this
case, the fears were well- founded, as many servicemen did avail
themselves of cheap supplies of heroin and marijuana. However,
even among those who became addicted, many stopped their drug use
upon returning to the United States. During the 1960s, the old
linkages between corruption, Asians, and opium surfaced once
again in public opinion, leading to more stringent measures to
stop the flow of drugs into the United States from both Asia and
Latin America (8). </p>

<p> Public support of law enforcement against drugs was high
during the late 1960s and early 1970s, and President Nixon spoke
of mounting &quot;a frontal assault on our number one public
enemy [drugs],&quot; but long mandatory minimum sentences for
possession of small amounts of marijuana disturbed many
Americans, even those who did not approve of marijuana use. The
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970
lessened penalties for possession of marijuana. It also
established a system for classifying drugs into five schedules,
which is still used today. Drugs are placed in each schedule
based on their potential for abuse, their known harmfulness, and
medical value. Marijuana and heroin are listed in schedule
1--drugs with high potential for addiction and no recognized
medical value. There have been, however, limited experimental
programs approved by the DEA and FDA for the use of marijuana in
treatment of nausea due to chemotherapy and of ocular pressure
due to glaucoma. Cocaine is listed in schedule 2--drugs with
potential for addiction for acceptable for some medical
applications. Subsequent to the establishment of this system,
drug policies and laws for individual drugs have been based on
the drug's schedule (3,16). </p>

<p> In 1972, the President's National Commission on Marijuana and
Drug Abuse recommended that the laws against the use of marijuana
be relaxed, since the enforcement of these laws was becoming too
burdensome to police in some areas, and was considered intrusive
on individual privacy in others. The drug was increasingly
thought to be innocuous in its effects, both by scientists and
others (4). Several States passed decriminalization laws, which
allowed possession or use of small amounts of marijuana and
imposed fines instead of prison sentences for transgressions of
minor possession laws (10). The Commission remained strict on
cocaine, which was also seeing a surge in use, but few experts
thought it was physically addictive or should be classified in
the same category as other narcotics. </p>

<p> Despite President Nixon's emphasis on &quot;law and
order&quot; responses to drug use, his drug budget favored
prevention, education, and treatment. The National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA) was created as the lead agency for demand
reduction, directing Federal prevention and treatment services
and research. The Drug Enforcement Administration was created as
the lead agency for supply reduction, and single state agencies
were created to guide Federal funds into state and local antidrug
programs (3). </p>

<p> From the mid-sixties to the late seventies, the composition
of drug users changed substantially. While drug use was still
associated primarily with minorities and the lower classes, drug
use by middle-class whites became a widespread and more accepted
phenomenon. As in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, when middle class whites haphazardly used narcotic
preparations, this new group of drug users down-played or ignored
the dangerous effects of drugs, and extolled their virtues as
agents of nonconformity and mind-expansion. Cocaine was an
expensive and high-status drug, used mainly for recreation by
upper- and middle-class whites. </p>

<p> From the drug experiences of this cohort, which were by no
means entirely positive, the public of the late seventies was
better educated about the effects of drugs, and public
disapproval of drug use began once again to increase. Drug use,
however, particularly of cocaine and marijuana remained high. The
Ford Administration (1974-1977) focused on the drugs it thought
posed the greatest danger--heroin, amphetamines, and
barbiturates. Some even thought that drugs such as cocaine and
marijuana should be legalized, &quot;so as to end the enormous
government expenditures of money and time on a problem that only
seemed to bring profits to drug dealers and elicit contempt for
the law from an ever-growing body of drug users&quot; (9). </p>

<p> During the Carter Administration (1977- 1981), Peter Bourne,
a special assistant for health issues, argued for Federal
decriminalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana,
while focusing interdiction efforts on heroin. But Bourne
resigned over a scandal involving criticisms over his prescribing
practices. His resignation forced President Carter to take a
harder position on drugs, and Federal decriminalization never
occurred. There were still States in which marijuana was
decriminalized, but these decreased in numbers through 1990, when
the last State--Alaska--to have decriminalization repealed those
laws. </p>

<p> The departure of Bourne coincided with the emergence of
several parents' groups concerned about drug use by their preteen
children. One group in particular, in Atlanta, Georgia, became
enraged when they found that in addition to drug use at parties,
their children were able to buy drug paraphernalia and prodrug
literature in local stores. The group formed the Parent Resources
Institute on Drug Education, National Families in Action, and the
National Federation of Parents. These groups were instrumental in
prodding NIDA to publicize more widely the dangers of marijuana
and other drugs once thought of as harmless. </p>

<p> The Administration of Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) favored a
strict approach to drug use and increased law enforcement. First
Lady Nancy Reagan actively campaigned against drug use, urging
school children to &quot;Just Say No.&quot; At the same time,
funding for research and treatment decreased, while the
availability of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana remained the same
(9). The budget for antidrug related activities rose from $1.5
billion in 1981 (split nearly equally between supply reduction
(domestic law enforcement and international/border law
enforcement) and demand reduction (research, prevention and
treatment) to $4.2 billion by the end of President Reagan's
second term. Two-thirds of the funds were now allocated for law
enforcement activities, with the remaining third allocated for
demand reduction (2). In 1984, the Crime Control Act increased
dramatically Federal mandatory minimum sentencing provisions for
drug- related crime, including the manufacture, distribution, or
possession of controlled substances. It also expanded the
criminal and civil asset forfeiture laws to penalize drug
traffickers and increased Federal criminal penalties for
drug-related offenses (3). This trend continued through the
remainder of the Reagan administration as well as that of
President Bush. </p>

<p> The 1980s saw significant shifts in patterns of cocaine use.
The negative effects of cocaine use, especially long-termuse, had
previously been masked, but middle-class users with drug-related
problems suddenly were more common. Concurrently, cocaine
smuggling escalated, resulting in increased availability, lower
prices, and higher quality. Low-income, minority communities
began experiencing major drug problems, first with powdered
cocaine, then in the mid- eighties especially with the new form
of cocaine--crack. Commonly called an epidemic, the spread of
this smokable cocaine inspired both President Reagan and antidrug
groups to heightened drug intervention efforts. Crack appeared to
be highly addictive, as well as affordable, and fear of its
consequences forced many lawmakers into action. The Anti- Drug
Abuse Act of 1986 authorized more funds than ever before for the
war on drugs, most of which was designated for international
interdiction activities (9), and the establishment of the Office
of Substance Abuse Prevention (OSAP). The AIDS epidemic has also
affected patterns of drug use, since some intravenous (IV) drug
users may have switched to smoking crack in order to avoid
exposure to the AIDS virus. Other IV drug users, however, have
continued to inject, and comprise a large percentage of the
AIDS-infected population. </p>

<p> While the main focus of drug control policy in the 1980s was
interdiction of illicit drugs, significant policy initiatives
concerning alcohol were also implemented. For example, the goal
of the national minimum drinking age of 21 was stated in 1984 and
achieved by 1988. Warning labels were required on all retail
containers of alcoholic beverages beginning in 1989 (7). </p>

<p> When George Bush was elected President in 1988 the climate
within the country was highly intolerant to the use of illicit
drugs. President Bush echoed President Nixon when he declared
that the drug epidemic was &quot;public enemy number one&quot;
(16). The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 mandated the creation of
the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), to be headed
by a director, sometimes called the drug czar, who would
coordinate U.S. drug control and abuse policy, resources, and
operations (Public Law 100-690). The first director was William
Bennett, former Secretary for Education under President Reagan.
He was followed by Robert Martinez, former Governor of Florida.
The director, in conjunction with the President and Cabinet
Secretaries, sets Administration policy on drug control. However,
ONCDP lacks budgetary authority, and under President Bush the
director of ONDCP was not a Cabinet position. During the Bush
Administration, additional funds were authorized for the war on
drugs, including increased funds for treatment and prevention.
However, most of the funds were designated for law enforcement
activities. Spending for antidrug-related activities rose from
the high of $4.2 billion under President Reagan, to a proposed
$12.7 billion in the last year of President Bush's term. Again,
the monetary split was roughly two-thirds for law enforcement and
international interdiction activities and one-third for demand
reduction (2). </p>

<p> While &quot;The War on Drugs&quot; has remained part of the
political lexicon, President Clinton, after taking office in
1993, cut the Office of National Drug Control Policy from 146
positions to 25. He elevated the director of ONDCP to cabinet
status, and Lee P. Brown, former Police Commissioner of New York
City was appointed to this position. During his campaign for the
presidency, Clinton advocated drug treatment on demand, and the
addition of 100,000 new police officers to the streets. _ <br>

ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b></p>

<p><b>APPENDIX C: </b></p>

<p><b>PERSPECTIVES ON DEFINING SUBSTANCE ABUSE </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Four broad arenas that encounter substance abuse-related
issues include, mass communications, criminal justice, medicine,
and public health. These entities often operate independently of
one another and use substantially different terms when describing
the use of illicit substances or the illegal use of licit
substances. </p>

<p>MASS COMMUNICATIONS </p>

<p>The traditional realm of mass communications includes
television, radio, and popular journals and newspapers. Within
these media, the term substance abuse has become a catch-all
phrase, with no clear boundaries. Much of the general public has
become familiar with the term substance abuse within this
ambiguous context. </p>

<p>CRIMINAL JUSTICE </p>

<p>While it is well-known that many crimes are committed by
persons with substance use disorders and that these disorders can
be major contributors to their crimes, there is no systematic
policy within the criminal justice system for the evaluation of
these disorders. In many jurisdictions, whether federal, state,
or local, the prevailing sentiment is that any use of an illicit
substance and/or use of a licit substance in an illegal manner,
is considered criminal abuse. A limited set of quantitative
analyses including blood, urine, and breath tests can be
performed to detect illegal levels of alcohol and/or the presence
of illicit substances. The Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) is
0.10 grams/deciliter for all States excluding Oregon, California,
Utah, Vermont, and Maine, where the level is 0.08
grams/deciliter. As of December 1992, 15 states had lower BAC
levels for youthful offenders charged with driving while
intoxicated. These levels range from 0.00-0.02 grams/deciliter,
which is considered &quot;zero tolerance,&quot; up to 0.04
grams/deciliter (6). The alcohol breath test, while a different
procedure from the BAC, converts the results into BAC units.
Thus, the levels of intoxication for BAC and breath test are
identical. </p>

<p>However, there are limitations to these analyses. In some
jurisdictions, these tests can be performed only with the written
consent of the person. In others, the urine test measures the
presence of only one or two drugs rather than looking for the
entire range of abusable substances. </p>

<p>Besides the limited amount of testing and evaluation, there is
little use of psychological screening examinations or structured
interviews to determine the level and severity of use, abuse, or
dependence. </p>

<p>PUBLIC HEALTH </p>

<p>The traditional public health model incorporates the host-
agent-environment relationship. Each of these factors has an
individual, as well as an interrelated role in the potential use
and/or harmful use of a substance. </p>

<p>Host factors may include possible genetic, psychological, and
biological susceptibility. Agent factors incorporate the
substance's abuse liability capacity, as well as how the
substance is marketed. Lastly, environmental factors encompass
not only the availability of the substance, but the social,
cultural, political, and economic climate as well (3,4). </p>

<p>Over the past 20 years, professionals within the field of
public health have attempted to deemphasize the strict medical
concept of substance abuse. Attention had previously focused
almost exclusively on individual drug use patterns, rather than
featuring the diverse problems of drug, alcohol, and tobacco use
as being intimately tied into communities and society as a whole.
</p>

<p>Even the term &quot;substance abuse&quot; has come under
scrutiny. While the word &quot;substance&quot; may at first
appear quite generic, in many fields, this term has come to
incorrectly infer illicit drug use--reinforcing the misperception
of many individuals that alcohol and tobacco are not drugs.
&quot;Abuse&quot; generally denotes the more severe forms of
addiction. In reality, there is a continuum that begins with
initial drug use and may progress to harmful use and addiction,
with various problems present along the spectrum. In lieu of the
term &quot;abuse,&quot; public health professionals prefer terms
such as &quot;alcohol and drug problems&quot; or the
&quot;harmful/hazardous use&quot; of a drug. </p>

<p>The focus of the public health perspective is to understand
the importance social norms, environment, and availability play
in the shaping of alcohol- and drug-related problems both on an
individual and societal level. </p>

<p>MEDICAL </p>

<p>Within the fields of medicine, the two most frequently cited
texts for the definitions of substance abuse and dependence are
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
issued by the American Psychiatric Association and the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) published by the
World Health Organization (WHO). Each successive version of the
DSM and ICD has been given a number signifying its order in the
overall sequence of manuals; DSM uses Roman numerals and ICD uses
ordinary numbers. The newest version of ICD, ICD-10, was
published in 1992. The current version of DSM is the Third
Edition- Revised (DSM-III-R), which will shortly be superseded by
DSM-IV. </p>

<p>ICD </p>

<p>While the current ICD and DSM definitions of substance
dependence are nearly identical, the two manuals differ sharply
on the concepts of abuse, which ICD classifies as harmful use. </p>

<p>The ICD manual is intended to be used on an international
basis, and the socially defined &quot;American&quot; criteria
present in the DSM manual for substance abuse cannot be
adequately transferred to a wide range of cultures. The current
ICD-10 category of harmful use, while applicable
cross-culturally, is limited to: &quot;A pattern of psychoactive
substance use that is causing damage to health. The damage may be
physical (as in cases of hepatitis from the self-administration
of injected drugs) or mental ( e.g.,episodes of depressive
disorder secondary to heavy consumption of alcohol).&quot; </p>

<p>DSM </p>

<p>In the early 1950s the first DSM manual grouped alcohol and
drug use disorders under the broad category of &quot;Sociopathic
Personality Disturbances.&quot; At that time, a substance use
disorder was considered a moral weakness or the manifestation of
a &quot;deeper&quot; psychological problem, rather than a
disorder in-and-of itself with social, psychological, and perhaps
even genetic determinants. </p>

<p>Throughout the 1970s and 1980s clinical research identified
the need for separate categories for substance use disorders. The
DSM-III manual, in 1980, was the first manual in this series to
clearly identify substance abuse and dependence as pathological
conditions different from substance use alone. DSM-III also
alluded to the fact that social and cultural factors are
contributors to the onset and continuation of abuse and
dependence. The DSM-III definition of dependence emphasized
tolerance (needing to take much higher doses of the substance to
obtain the same effect) and withdrawal (having a distinct pattern
of physiological arousal upon abrupt discontinuation or reduction
in dosage), and required the presence of one or both of these
phenomena to make a dependence diagnosis. Substance abuse was
defined as problematic use with social or occupational
impairment, but with the absence of significant tolerance and/or
withdrawal. In both disorders, impairment in social and
occupational function was a prominent aspect of the definitions,
creating a significant overlap between the criteria for substance
abuse and dependence. In 1987, DSM-III was revised (DSM-III-R) to
give the behavioral aspects of substance use disorders equal
weight to the physiological components. </p>

<p>This shift away from the physiological to the behavioral
elements of dependence was strongly influenced by the work of
researchers Edwards and Gross, who had extensively studied
persons with alcohol problems. These researchers conceptualized
alcohol dependence as a syndrome of graded severity that involved
an interconnected complex of behavioral, psychological, and
physiological elements associated with loss of control over
alcohol consumption. </p>

<p>Contributing to the emphasis on behavioral aspects of
dependence was work by Brady, Thompson, and others who had shown
that animals can be taught to self-administer substances of
abuse. Once taught, it was observed that most animals will expend
tremendous amounts of energy to obtain additional doses and that
this &quot;drug-seeking behavior&quot; is very difficult to
extinguish. Efforts to repeat drug self- administration were
especially prominent if the experimental drug was one with a high
abuse liability such as morphine, methamphetamine, or
(especially) cocaine and was difficult to extinguish. </p>

<p>This body of work was among the first in a line of
investigation studying the behavioral aspects of drugs. This
field of research became known as &quot;behavioral
pharmacology&quot; and was strengthened by additional studies by
Olds and others. </p>

<p>Thus, both the work of Edwards and Gross, that of behavioral
pharmacologists, and of basic scientists pointed toward the
presence of a definable and independent syndrome that can result
after an organism has learned to self-administer abusable
substances. This syndrome was not dependent on the ability of the
drug to produce tolerance and withdrawal, but rather on its
positive reinforcing effects. These effects were evident by
observing the behavior of the organism, and could be measured by
quantifying the work that the organism would produce to obtain
the substance. </p>

<p>The development of the substance use disorders section for
DSM-IV began in 1988 and involved the most extensive process yet
undertaken for such a task. The major change in DSM-IV is in the
definition of substance abuse. Unlike DSM-III and DSM-III-R, DSM
-IV clearly separates the criteria for dependence from those of
abuse. Dependence in DSM-IV is a syndrome involving compulsive
use, with or without tolerance and withdrawal; abuse is
problematic use without compulsive use, significant tolerance, or
withdrawal. Preliminary data from the DSM-IV field trials
indicate that this change will probably increase the number of
persons diagnosed as having substance abuse, especially for those
using hallucinogens, inhalants, sedatives, and amphetamines. </p>

<p>Substance Use and the Transition to Abuse/Harmful Use or
Dependence </p>

<p>One problem in developing criteria for this second,
nondependent category, whether called abuse or harmful use, is
that though dependence has been well-studied, the progression
from use to abuse has not been adequately researched (except in
the case of alcohol); and depending on the perspective, may not
always be linear. For example, using the DSM-IV classifications,
it is possible that substances such as opiates may follow a path
that begins with use and progresses to dependence before
abuse-related problems are identified. Within the field of
alcohol research, the consensus of studies is that consuming
three to four standard-sized drinks/day by males (equal to 40 or
more grams of alcohol at 12 grams/drink) is associated with an
increased probability for the development of problems. As females
tend to absorb alcohol more quickly, studies have shown that
problems typically begin at about two to three drinks/day
(1,2,5). </p>

<p>Little work has been done on other substances. All persons who
end up with abuse, harmful use, or dependence begin with use. Use
of a substance, whether licit or illicit, does not constitute a
substance use disorder even though it may be unwise and strongly
disapproved of by family, friends, employers, religious groups,
or society at large. Use by itself is not considered a medical
disorder. For a disorder to be present, use must become something
else such as: occur more frequently; occur at higher doses; or
result in a magnitude of problems. Though there have been some
conceptual models developed for how one might approach a better
understanding of this transition, there are few data available to
clearly point out where the border lies. </p>

<p>DSM-IV AND ICD-10 DEFINITIONS </p>

<p>DSM-IV Diagnostic Criteria: </p>

<p>Abuse </p>

<p>A. A maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to
clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by
one or more of the following occurring over the same 12- month
period: </p>

<p>1. Recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfill
major role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated
absences or poor work performance related to substance use;
substance-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions from
school; neglect of children or household). </p>

<p>2. Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is
physically hazardous (e.g.,driving an automobile or operating a
machine when impaired by substance use). </p>

<p>3. Recurrent substance-related legal problems (e.g.,arrests
for substance-related disorderly conduct). </p>

<p>4. Continued substance use despite having persistent or
recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated
by the effects of the substance (e.g.,arguments with spouse about
consequences of intoxication, physical fights). </p>

<p>B. Has never met the criteria for Substance Dependence for
this substance. </p>

<p>Dependence: </p>

<p>A maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically
significant impairment or distress, as manifested by three or
more of the following occurring in the same 12- month period: </p>

<p>1. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: </p>

<p>a. need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to
achieve intoxication or desired effect </p>

<p>b. markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same
amount of the substance </p>

<p>2. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: </p>

<p>a. the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance </p>

<p>b. the same (or closely related) substance is taken to relieve
or avoid withdrawal symptoms </p>

<p>3. The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a
longer period than was intended </p>

<p>4. Any unsuccessful effort or a persistent desire to cut down
or control substance use </p>

<p>5. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to
obtain the substance (e.g., visiting multiple doctors or driving
long distances), use of the substance (e.g., chain- smoking), or
recover from its effects </p>

<p>6. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities
given up or reduced because of substance use </p>

<p>7. Continued substance use despite knowledge of having had a
persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is
likely to be caused or exacerbated by the substance (e.g.,
current cocaine use despite recognition of cocaine- induced
depression, or continued drinking despite recognition that an
ulcer was made worse by alcohol consumption) </p>

<p>Specify if: </p>

<p>o with physiological dependence: Evidence of tolerance or
withdrawal (i.e., either items (1) or (2) are present). </p>

<p>o without physiological dependence: No evidence of tolerance
or withdrawal i.e., neither items (1) nor (2) are present). </p>

<p>ICD-10 Diagnostic Criteria for Clinical Use: </p>

<p>Harmful Use: </p>

<p>A pattern of psychoactive substance use that is causing damage
to health. The damage may be physical (as in cases of hepatitis
from the self-administration of injected drugs) or mental
(e.g.,episodes of depressive disorder secondary to heavy
consumption of alcohol). </p>

<p>The diagnosis requires that actual damage should have been
caused to the mental or physical health of the user. Harmful
patterns of use are often criticized by others and frequently
associated with adverse social consequences of various kinds. The
fact that a pattern of use or particular substance is disapproved
of by another person or by the culture, or may have led to
socially negative consequences such as arrest or marital
arguments is not in itself evidence of harmful use. </p>

<p>Acute intoxication or &quot;hangover&quot; is not in itself
sufficient evidence of the damage to health required for coding
harmful use. Harmful use should not be diagnosed if dependence
syndrome, a psychotic disorder, or another specific form of drug-
or alcohol-related disorder is present. </p>

<p>Dependence Syndrome </p>

<p>A definite diagnosis of dependence should usually be made only
if three or more of the following have been experienced or
exhibited at some time during the previous year: </p>

<p>1. A strong desire or sense of compulsion to take the
substance. </p>

<p>2. Difficulties in controlling substance-taking behavior in
terms of its onset, termination, or levels of use </p>

<p>3. A physiological withdrawal state when substance use has
ceased or been reduced, as evidenced by: the characteristic
withdrawal syndrome for the substance; or use of the same (or
closely related) substance with the intention of relieving or
avoiding withdrawal symptoms. </p>

<p>4. Evidence of tolerance such that increased doses of the
psychoactive substance are required in order to achieve effects
originally produced by lower doses (clear examples of this are
found in alcohol- and opiate-dependent individuals who may take
daily doses sufficient to incapacitate or kill nontolerant
users). </p>

<p>5. Progressive neglect of alternative pleasures or interests
because of psychoactive substance use, increased amounts of time
necessary to obtain or take the substance or recover from its
effects. </p>

<p>6. Persisting with substance use despite clear evidence of
overtly harmful consequences, such as harm to the liver through
excessive drinking, depressive mood states consequent to periods
of heavy substance use, or drug- related impairment of cognitive
functioning; efforts should be made to determine that the user
was actually, or could be expected to be, aware of the nature and
extent of harm. </p>

<p>Narrowing of the personal repertoire of patterns of
psychoactive substance use has also been described as a
characteristic feature (e.g., a tendency to drink alcoholicdrinks
in the same way on weekdays and weekends, regardless of social
constraints that determine appropriate drinking behavior). </p>

<p>It is an essential characteristic of the dependence syndrome
that either psychoactive substance taking or a desire to take a
particular substance should be present; the subjective awareness
of compulsion to use drugs is most commonly seen during attempts
to stop or control substance use. This diagnostic requirement
would exclude, for instance, surgical patients given opioid drugs
for the relief of pain, who may show signs of an opioid
withdrawal state when drugs are not given but who have no desire
to continue taking drugs. </p>

<p>The dependence syndrome may be present for a specific
substance (e.g., tobacco or diazepam), for a class of substances
(e.g., opioid drugs), or for a wider ranger of different
substances (as for those individuals who feel a sense of
compulsion regularly to use whatever drugs are available and who
show distress, agitation, and/or physical signs of a withdrawal
state upon abstinence). </p>

<p>The diagnosis of the dependence syndrome may be further
specified by the following (the following roughly correspond to
the course modifiers and relapse section of DSM-IV): </p>

<p>o Currently abstinent. </p>

<p>o Currently abstinent, but in a protected environment (e.g.,
in hospital, in a therapeutic community, in prison, etc.). </p>

<p>o Currently on a clinically supervised maintenance or
replacement regime (controlled dependence, e.g., with methadone;
nicotine gum or nicotine patch). </p>

<p>o Currently abstinent, but receiving treatment with aversive
or blocking drugs (e.g., naltrexone or disulfiram). </p>

<p>o Currently using the substance (active dependence). </p>

<p>o Continuous use. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Episodic use. _ </li>
</ul>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Executive Summary<br>
</strong></font><font size="2"></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Redfern Legal Centre Drug Law Reform
Project began in mid 1994. Its objectives were to promote
informed public discussion about drug law reform, and to
contribute to bringing forward reform of the drug laws.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Project's main achievements over the past
two years are:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Published discussion papers, fact sheets,
stickers and a poster promoting a range of initiatives to end the
current prohibition policy on currently illicit drugs and move
towards a model of controlled availability; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Convened a series of community forums in South
Sydney and Cabramatta on ways that drug laws impact on the work
of community and health organisations;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Held discussions with a number of NSW
Parliamentarians, including Ministers and their advisors;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Participated in several conferences and
seminars, including the International Conference on the Reduction
of Drug Related Harm Provided formal, detailed submissions to a
range of inquiries including the Wood Royal Commission into the
NSW Police Service and the Victorian Premier's Drug Advisory
Council (Pennington Committee).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">This report includes two of the Project's most
significant publications:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Steps Towards Harm Reduction</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Harm Reduction Model of Controlled Drug
Availability. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">In addition, this report provides summaries of
comments on these publications from a diverse range of
organisations and individuals. The comments show that the Project
and its publications have made a significant contribution to the
debate about reform of the drug laws in NSW.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Future activities for the Redfern Drug Law

one part-time worker to coordinate the Project and to carry out
many of its tasks. The Project was oversighted by a small but
typically enthusiastic committee, which reported to the Centre's
Management Committee. The funding for the Project came (until
February 1996) from the Centre's own resources, primarily
litigation costs. From March until September 1996, the Project
was funded by a grant from the Law Foundation of NSW</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Redfern Legal Centre undertook this Project for
several reasons:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1. Drug prohibition fosters crime (because
prohibition artificially inflates prices for drugs on the black
market). Abandoning prohibition would be the simplest single way
to achieve a noticeable reduction in property crime, and to a
lesser but still important extent, violent crime.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2. Those affected by drug-inspired crime are
primarily the socially disadvantaged. Drug law reform is
desirable as a social equity measure.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3. Prohibition contributes to police
corruption. It is no accident that the clear majority of police
named adversely in evidence before the Wood Royal Commission into
police corruption are in some way connected to drugs - police
stealing drugs or money from drug suppliers, police selling
drugs, police planting drugs on suspects as false evidence.
Prohibition makes the drug trade so extravagantly profitable (it
is the second largest trade in the world) that it creates
enormous temptations for police and other officials. We cannot
hope to significantly reduce the opportunities for police
corruption while the drugs prohibition continues.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4. Prohibition has a significant negative
impact on the legal system. Dealing with people facing drug
charges, or charges of property crime generated by the drugs
black market, creates an enormous drain on the courts, and in
particular on public funds available to provide legal services
for the poor and disadvantaged. Reducing drug-related crime would
free up law enforcement resources for other activities, and would
improve the resource capacity of the Legal Aid Commission and
community legal services to pursue other matters, such as
consumer claims and antidiscrimination cases.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">5. Public health outcomes are compromised by
laws which drive drug use underground. In particular, the drug
laws hamper efforts to contain the spread of HIV and Hepatitis B
and C.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">6. Despite years of community debate and the
strength of the case for reform, prohibition has been fiercely
resilient . Reliance on the criminal law to control behaviour in
other areas of moral or personal choice gambling, sex work,
abortion, censorship - has generally receded in recent decades,
with the drug laws the notable exception. The demise of
prohibition is not as inevitable as it perhaps once appeared to
be.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We believe that meaningful reform of our drug
laws necessarily involves reconsidering the laws about supply as
well as possession and use of drugs, and laws about other drugs
as well as cannabis.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Harm reduction is a pragmatic approach which
emphasises reducing the personal and social harms associated with
drug use, while accepting that eliminating drug use is
impossible. Harm reduction has been officially the central goal
of Australian drugs policy since the mid 1980s, although most
public resources devoted to the drug problem continue to promote
prohibition (eg, funds to police and customs services and
unrealistic, wholly negative drug education). We believe that
harm reduction (in any meaningful definition) is incompatible
with prohibition. The Project has attempted to develop coherent
harm reduction strategies, focusing on measures which would
reduce or eliminate the drugs black market. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Community Forums</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Project convened a series of community
forums at which service providers in the health and community
sectors in particular were invited to identify, from their
perspective, the ways in which existing legal approaches to drugs
impacted on their work, and to identify which legal framework
could best support drug treatment and education programs. These
forums were held in both South Sydney, where the Legal Centre is
located, and in Cabramatta, Sydney's major heroin distribution
point. The discussion at these forums was invaluable in assisting
the Project to developing strategies and proposals for change.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Publications</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Two discussion papers were written and
distributed in the course of the Project.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Harm Reduction Model of Controlled Drug
Availability, published in May 1995, attempted to tackle
concretely the question of what exactly drug law reform could
look like. Most previous proposals for law reform were either
inadequate (eg, the on-the spot fine model adopted in various
forms in South Australia, the ACT and the Northern Territory), or
airy generalisations about the possibility of regulating or
deregulating the drugs market (with the idea of controlled
availability little more than a slogan). We considered it a
priority to do the work of systematically applying harm reduction
principles to all aspects of drug consumption, production and
distribution - in an open-minded but hopefully not fanciful way.
The Harm Reduction Model therefore represents a detailed
projection of what controlled availability might look like in
practice.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Harm Reduction Model was widely circulated
and was endorsed by a number of community organisations and
individuals. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">An updated and expanded second edition of The
Harm Reduction Model was published in July 1996. Importantly, the
second edition included a set of Principles for Controlled Drug
Availability to complement the essentially practical proposals
illustrating some possible means of regulating drug supply and
consumption. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Project's other discussion paper was Steps
to Harm Reduction. A companion document to the Harm Reduction
Model, this paper addressed the present and short-term future. It
provided an analysis of the possible immediate steps which could
and should be taken in drugs policy and drug law reform. Again,
the value of the paper lay in its attempt to be detailed and
specific. The paper is a blueprint for reform, providing a list
of proposals to achieve a graduated replacement of prohibition
with harm reduction. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">These two papers form the major part of this
report.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Project also produced:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Two very popular bumper stickers (slogans End
Prohibition: Support Drug Law Reform and Break the Crime Cycle:
Support Drug Law Reform)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A full colour poster, a graphic presentation of
what the future of drugs policy might look like.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A series of Fact Sheets with statistics and
other information detailing the social impact of existing drug
laws. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Discussions with politicians</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Throughout the Project, we held discussions
with a number of NSW Parliamentarians, including Ministers and
their advisors. It must be said that the political climate proved
to be not conducive to change on drug policy, despite some early
encouraging if ambiguous statements from the incoming Carr
Government. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Issues discussed included many of the issues
dealt with in this report, including the desirability of
introducing a trial of legal safe injecting spaces, and a
possible Parliamentary motion on prioritising harm reduction in
drugs policy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Inquiries</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Project also provided formal, detailed
submissions on proposals for law reform to the following
inquiries.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Wood Royal Commission into the NSW Police
Service</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Victorian Premier's Drug Advisory Council
(Pennington Committee)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Commonwealth Access to Justice Inquiry.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Conference papers</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">During the life of the Project, we participated
in a number of conferences and seminars. Perhaps the most
significant conference papers we presented were a paper in
September 1995 to the NSW Corrective Health Services Symposium on
Drug-Related Crime, and the two papers to the 7th International
Conference on the Reduction of Drug Related Harm, in Hobart in
March 1996. <br>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996</font> </p>

<p><font size="4">2. Steps To Harm Reduction<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Our existing drugs policy, grounded in
prohibition, is failing. Drug use continues at significant
levels, the drug trade continues to flourish, and the social
consequences of a thriving drugs black market - including
significant property crime and police corruption - continue to
cause concern.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We need to continue the process begun a decade
ago with the introduction of legal needle and syringe exchanges.
That is, we need to continue to shift the primary policy focus
from prohibition to harm reduction: to rely less on the criminal
law to discourage drug use and supply, and more on education,
treatment and research to make drug use as safe and responsible
as possible. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Our current approach to drugs confuses legal
status with questions of safety. Both alcohol and marijuana are
widely used in social situations, both methadone and heroin are
highly addictive, both Prozac and ecstasy induce comparable
feelings of well-being. Yet the differing legal status of each of
these drugs skews social attitudes to their appropriate use, and
distorts accurate education messages about their effects and the
dangers of misuse.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There is a limit to the constructive harm
reduction measures which can be undertaken without changes to the
law. We have probably already reached the point at which the laws
criminalising drug use represent a real impediment to programmes
aimed at minimising the personal and social harm which can be
caused by drug use. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Reducing Drug-related Harm</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Harm reduction means aiming at reducing the
harm that drugs can cause to users and to the broader community.
It involves accepting that drug use will never be eliminated,
even if we do not approve of it. Harm reduction should be the
standard against which we measure the success or failure of
existing drug laws, and proposals for change.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Redfern Legal Centre has proposed that in the
long term, we should implement a system of controlled
availability for most currently illicit drugs. The Centre's Harm
Reduction Model of Controlled Drug Availability sets out
principles for controlled availability which would produce the
greatest degree of harm reduction, and sketches some case studies
to illustrate what these principles might mean in practice.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">In the immediate future, we should take some
less dramatic steps towards reducing drug related harm. Here we
outline some immediate steps we should take to implement harm
reduction principles in the short term.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Policy Objectives</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Although drugs policy could never be described
as uncontroversial, there is some common ground. Most would agree
that drugs policy should be framed in the context of health
objectives and social policy, not with the criminal law as the
starting point. Where drug use is problematic, it should be
addressed as a health issue, not a legal issue.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">What does this mean in concrete terms?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The changes we recommend here address what we
consider to be the most significant drug policy issues impacting
on public health. The particular objectives of the proposals made
here are </font></p>

<p><font size="2">1. To establish the legal environment for the
implementation of effective education and other health programs
to:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">reduce overdose deaths</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">reduce the number of new Hepatitis C infections
associated with injecting drug use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">at least maintain (and if possible reduce)
existing low levels of new HIV infection through injecting drug
use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">improve the level of responsible disposal of
used needles</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2. Reduce socially harmful impact of criminal
justice system on users of currently illicit drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Taking the steps detailed below will not solve
all the problems associated with drug use. Change to the existing
legal framework must of necessity be made gradually. Once the
proposals for change outlined here are implemented and evaluated,
we can consider what further changes to drug law and policy are
necessary.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">These measures would have only a small initial
impact on crime rates and police corruption. These social harms
result directly from the drug laws particularly laws about drug
supply. We need to move towards greater regulation of the drugs
market to enable us as a society to influence the size and
operation of the drugs market. Achieving the maximum public
health benefits will require regulatory control over matters such
as purity, weight, recommended dosages, and labelling.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The greatest source of social harm associated
with drugs is the black market. The black market, with its
extraordinary profits, fuels police corruption, and generates
property crime. And the black market is an unregulated market,
with no controls on drug quality, multiplying the dangers of drug
use. The enormous profits to be made will always draw a steady
stream of new entrepreneurs to the production and distribution of
drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The size of the black market is determined by
the laws we make about drug supply. While it is likely that we
will never be able to completely eliminate the drugs black
market, changes to the legal approach to drugs can reduce and
marginalise the negative social impact of a contracted illicit
market.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We must explore alternative strategies to
control the size of the black market, including considering
alternative changes to the law about supply. But we cannot
sensibly undertake that consideration without first resolving
legal and policy issues about use and possession.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Each of the measures outlined below would
represent an important step on the way to creating the legal
framework for a comprehensive harm reduction strategy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">PROPOSALS FOR CHANGE</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1 . Personal Use and Possession</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Penalising drug users for the activity of drug
use does little if anything to discourage drug-taking.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Criminalising drug using behaviour adds to the
social and personal burden on drug users without any
corresponding social benefit. The current laws force drug use
underground, compounding health problems and making it more
difficult to implement effective public health programs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Police drugs strategy states that police
resources should be directed towards drug traffickers and
large-scale suppliers, rather than drug users. However, the fact
is that 60% of drug matters prosecuted involve drug use or
possession offences.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Because there is a distinct socioeconomic bias
in the manner in which different communities are policed, there
is a differential outcome in how these charges are laid. This
means that the drug laws impact unfairly on the poor, the
homeless, Aborigines and the young - disproportionately to their
actual patterns of usage.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Changing our approach to the legal treatment of
drug use would assist in HIV/Hepatitis C prevention by allowing
injecting drug users to access (and dispose of) new needles and
syringes without fear of police harassment. It would also remove
existing disincentives for drug users (such as marijuana smokers)
to openly discuss their use with doctors and other health
professionals. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">There are a number of constructive alternatives
to the criminalisation of personal use and possession of drugs.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The options are to:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a. abolish the offences of use and possession;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">b. abolish the offence of self administration
only; and/or</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">c. vary enforcement practices</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We will briefly discuss the merits of these
alternative approaches.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Option a. Abolish the offences of use and
possession </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The most straightforward solution is to remove
the offence of drug using and possession. That is, it would no
longer be a criminal offence to use an illicit drug, nor to
possess a small quantity for personal use (say 30 grams for
cannabis, 1 gram for heroin, amphetamine and other powders). In
order to minimise the number of cannabis users accessing the
black market, cultivation of up to five cannabis plants per
household should also be allowed. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Removing these offences would remove the legal
obstacle to drug users seeking appropriate health care, including
the estimated 600,000 cannabis users in this State. It would
reduce fear of police harassment by injecting drug users
accessing needle and syringe exchanges and, especially,
contribute to responsible disposal of used needles. Because
possession of a used needle is evidence of the offence of drug
use, the law currently creates incentives to dispose of used
needles quickly rather than thoughtfully.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Removing these offences would be consistent
with existing police strategy which states that police resources
should be directed towards drug traffickers, not drug users.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Option b. Abolish the offence of self
administration only</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Because drug use (&quot;self
administration&quot;) and drug possession are separate offences
under the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act, it is possible to
remove the offence of use without any change to the law
prohibiting drug possession.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Removing the criminality of the act of using a
drug would improve the capacity of educators and researchers to
communicate in direct and plain terms with people about their
past and present levels of drug use, and use behaviours.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In practical terms, it would mean that a person
who had recently consumed a drug but had no other drugs in their
possession, would be not subject to arrest or criminal charges.
This would encourage larger numbers of injecting drug users to
responsibly dispose of used needles and syringes, positively
contributing to reduction in new HIV and hepatitis infections,
and to community perceptions of public safety.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Most self administration convictions result
from the person admitting having consumed a drug, without other
evidence (blood or urine tests are not undertaken to support
these charges). This law is selectively enforced against those
who are most vulnerable and least aware of their civil rights
(especially the right to silence).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If the self administration provision is
withdrawn, there would remain ample legal power for the police to
control offensive or anti-social behaviour which might accompany
drug use. Appropriate community policing strategies would address
community concerns about unacceptable behaviour in public places
by people under the influence of illicit drugs, while also
achieving desirable public health and social equity results.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Option c. Vary enforcement practices</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The alternative to legislative amendment is to
change how these laws are enforced. There are several ways in
which this might be done.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(i) Better directed police discretion</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The police have the discretion not to arrest or
lay a charge in a wide range of circumstances, subject to their
duty to protect the peace and to uphold the law. This exercise of
discretion applies in the enforcement of the drug laws. In
practice this means that many police officers choose, in many
circumstances, not to lay charges where they become aware of
minor drug offences. The anecdotal evidence is that the police
are increasingly exercising their discretion in this way, perhaps
especially with cannabis.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The exercise of police discretion in this way
is not only legitimate but desirable. It contributes positively
to public health outcomes, and reduces what would otherwise be a
literally intolerable burden on criminal justice resources if
every episode of drug use or possession which came to police
notice were prosecuted.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is desirable however that there be some
standardisation of this exercise of discretion, to achieve
greater uniformity of police practice (and therefore social
equity) and to better target particular public health objectives.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">We propose that the Commissioner's Instructions
should be amended to give guidance to police on the exercise of
their discretion.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some suggestions are:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Police guidelines should specifically
discourage arrest in overdose and similar medical emergency
situations, of either the overdose patient or their associates.
Knowing that there was no risk of arrest would encourage people
experiencing overdose, or their friends, to seek medical help as
early as possible. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">People suffering overdose, or other physical or
psychological distress, should be able to access medical services
without fear of arrest. There are some 220 drug overdose
fatalities in NSW each year. Many of these deaths are
preventable. Studies show that one in three heroin users report
having had at least one overdose experience.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Police should be encouraged not to harass
clients of methadone clinics, even if known drug users are likely
to congregate there. [This would be an extension of existing
guidelines which discourage police harassment of clients of
needle and syringe exchanges.]</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Existing Commissioner's Instructions
(Instruction 16.02), say that police should not interrupt
injection, nor deliberately break syringes. In fact, these
practices still occur. Relevant police instructions should be
made the subject of training and greater management direction.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The Police Service should undertake a
comprehensive examination of its practices and protocols as they
impact on drugs policy. The fact that there are existing
Commissioner's Instructions which are not being applied raises
questions about the capacity of the Police Service to respond
flexibly and appropriately in this area, in the absence of
legislative reform. If measures are taken to develop the
application of police discretion in drugs policy, it must be
closely monitored to assess the degree of compliance with
guidelines. If this approach does not significantly improve the
current negative impact of law enforcement on effective drugs
policy, the only alternative is to legislate change to laws.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">(ii) Formal police cautions</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The recent Victorian Premier's Drug Advisory
Council Report (the Pennington Report) recommended that the use
and possession of illicit drugs be dealt with through a system of
automatic formal police cautions for first offenders (with
voluntary referral to drug assessment and treatment services).
Mandatory good behaviour bonds would be imposed as a sentence for
second offenders. Third offenders would be dealt with by a court
in the normal way (ie, by decision of the magistrate to impose
fines, community service orders, or other appropriate penalty).</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">A mandatory caution/bond system for drug use
and possession offences would make police contact with drug users
less negative than it is now (except for repeat offenders), and
would allow law enforcement to be accompanied by referral to
treatment or counselling services in appropriate cases.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If introduced, this system should be closely
monitored for its effect on the number and type of cases brought
before the courts. (It should be noted that introducing a system
of police referral to drug treatment services may result in an
increased demand for those services, which are now significantly
under-researched.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2">(iii) On-the-spot fines</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some jurisdictions (South Australia, the
Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory) have
introduced a system of on-the-spot fines as a method of
&quot;decriminalising&quot; the personal use and possession of
marijuana.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Since this system was implemented in South
Australia in 1987, there has been a 450% increase in the number
of fine notices issued (although research shows that marijuana
usage has increased only slightly, in line with increases in
other States). Half of the 18,000 people issued with notices last
year did not pay their fine on time, exposing them to the risk of
arrest, prosecution and incurring a criminal record.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In practice therefore, this initiative has
actually increased the cost of police and court time devoted to
marijuana law enforcement.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the ACT and NT, it is too early to say
whether there will be a similar escalation in the number of
notices issued. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">There are few apparent advantages in adopting
this measure. The other alternatives offer either more complete
and systematic solutions, or the opportunity for more flexible
policing practices.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"> Remove prison as a sentencing option for
drug use or possession</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If the offences of drug use and possession are
not abolished, then at the least, imprisonment should be removed
as an available sentencing option.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prison sentences are a completely inappropriate
penalty for minor drug possession and use offences. Imprisonment
has never been evaluated for its effects on drug use or
possession recidivism, although anecdotal evidence suggests that
it does not deter ongoing drug use. Research into the question
should be encouraged.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">About 150 people are gaoled each year in NSW
for drug use or possession of small quantities of drugs. In 1995
(the most recent figures available), there were 62 people gaoled
for use or possession of marijuana, 61 were gaoled for use or
possession of heroin, and 44 were gaoled for use or possession of
other drugs. Although custodial sentences of up to eight months
were imposed, the period of imprisonment for most was less than
two months. In relative terms, these prison terms would be
considered short. However, considering the minor nature of the
offences and prevailing social attitudes, they are
extraordinarily harsh. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">3 . Allow use of cannabis for medical purposes </font></p>

<p><font size="2">If the offences of drug use and possession are
removed, there is no need for separate treatment for those who
use cannabis for genuinely therapeutic purposes. However, if
those offences remain, an exception should exist for the medical
applications of cannabis.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Cannabis in smokable form is a valuable
alternative to other medical treatments for people living with
AIDS and for some cancer and glaucoma patients. It is useful for
nausea and pain relief, and to stimulate appetite. Smokable
cannabis is now used in the community for these purposes without
recognition, support or medical supervision.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Synthetic cannabis products in tablet form are
available on prescription, but they are not satisfactory. They
are expensive and reported to be less effective in achieving the
desired therapeutic results. Many patients who smoke marijuana to
control nausea are unable to swallow tablets. For some conditions
(eg, weight loss associated with AIDS), there are no effective
alternatives.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As well, numerous people living with hepatitis
use cannabis as a social alternative to alcohol.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4 Allow possession of drug equipment as well as
needles and syringes</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Possession of equipment intended for use of
prohibited drugs is illegal - needles and syringes are the only
exception. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It is anomalous to publicly fund the
distribution of needles and syringes, but not to allow the
possession of swabs, sterile water and tourniquets for the
purpose of using illegal drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Allowing the legal possession of all
intravenous drug using equipment would assist in HIV prevention.
It would also assist in preventing Hepatitis C infection, which
often results from sharing equipment other than needles and
syringes., and it would assist in holistic harm reduction (eg,
using sterile water to reduce the risk of injecting bacteria
which can cause a range of illnesses).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The sale and possession of bongs for the
smoking of cannabis is also illegal even though using a bong is
probably less harmful than smoking cannabis cigarettes. Further
research should be undertaken into the relative physical harms of
different methods of consuming cannabis (eg, in cigarettes,
through bongs, or in foods).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Legalising the sale and possession of cannabis
smoking equipment would assist education strategies aimed at
encouraging cannabis users to use in relatively safe ways.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">5 . Provide safe injecting spaces</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Legal safe injecting spaces (or &quot;shooting
rooms&quot;) would considerably reduce the harm associated with
injecting drug use in public places like parks and laneways. Safe
injecting spaces could reduce drug overdose deaths, and should
also reduce the number of used syringes unsafely disposed of in
public places. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Publicly funded, safe injecting spaces should
be introduced on a trial basis in areas of existing high
intravenous drug use. The trial should be conducted over two
years, with an initial review after six months.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Potential benefits include:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">i. Reduction in injecting drug use in public
places (such as parks and laneways), with the consequent public
health dangers posed by used needles being left in those places.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">ii. Improved access and personal safety for
ambulance officers and other health workers treating overdoses.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The difficulty with introducing such a trial is
that the authorities are wary of funding, even tolerating,
facilities at which people would break the law (ie by self
administration). We have made a number of suggestions above about
reform of the law, or at least law enforcement practices, around
drug use and possession. Introducing any of those proposals would
clear the way legally for the introduction of safe injecting
spaces.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The proposal for safe injecting spaces is a
logical extension of existing needle and syringe exchange
programs. The legal framework to allow shooting rooms to operate
(in the absence of more far-reaching changes to the law), would
be similar to the arrangements for needle and syringe exchange
programs, namely: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">legislative amendment to make it not an offence
to inject a prohibited drug on site at an approved safe injecting
place (at least for the duration of a trial);</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">instructions to police to not harass the
clients of the facilities (just as existing instructions direct
police to not harass needle exchange clients)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">statutory amendment to protect workers in safe
injecting places from prosecution for aiding and abetting
offences. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">6 Allow use, possession and supply of Narcan
without prescription</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Narcan is an anti-narcotic used to revive
people in the event of narcotic overdose. It has no pleasurable
effects, and no effect on someone who has not used heroin or
other narcotics. Wider availability of Narcan has been
recommended by researchers at the National Drug and Alcohol
Research Centre as an effective way to reduce fatal heroin
overdoses.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If Narcan were to be made more readily
available, it should be accompanied by an appropriately targeted
education campaign to ensure that Narcan is understood to be a
first aid measure only. The person revived from the overdose by a
shot of Narcan requires further medical attention, involving
either calling an ambulance or attendance at a hospital.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">FUTURE CHANGE</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The implementation of these proposals should be
followed by continuing attention to laws and programmes which
impact adversely on public health and other social programmes.
Relevant government agencies should undertake a comprehensive
review to identify which laws require amendment to further reduce
drug related harm. Key agencies to be involved in such a review
are the Departments of Health, Attorney-General's, Police, and
School Education.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the longer term, the nature and pace of
further changes to drug law and policy will need to be considered
and debated.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Implementing some or all of the above proposals
would significantly improve public health outcomes. Making these
changes would allow the community to decide whether and how to
take further steps.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We should begin now, in a measured way, to
explore and implement workable alternatives to the failure of
drugs prohibition. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996</font> </p>

<p><font size="4">3. Comments on Steps to Harm Reduction</font><font
size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">A version of the Steps towards Harm Reduction
section of this report was provided to people and organisations
with expertise or interest in the area of drugs policy and drugs
law, together with a questionnaire (see Appendix 2) seeking
comments on the paper.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Responses were sought from 55 individuals and
organisations (see Appendix 1). Written responses were received
from 21 respondents and eight responses were obtained by
interview (29 responses in all). Given the low response rate and
the ways that respondents were selected, this survey is not
designed to provide research evidence about support for or
against changes to drug laws. However, the responses allow us to
see where support appears to be forming and what areas continue
to be the subject of intense debate.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Responses were received from the following
individuals and organisations. Organisations are listed when they
provided an organisational response: otherwise the individuals
listed spoke only in a personal capacity and not on behalf of any
Organisation: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Major Brian Watters</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Ken Marslew</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Angela and Tony Wood Dr Peter B Paisley</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(Total responses do not always add up to 29
because some respondents did not answer all questions and some
gave overall support or opposition, rather than provide details
on specific points.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Do you support some change in the legal current
approach to personal use and possession?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">All respondents agreed that some change was
necessary. The overwhelming majority favoured change in the
direction of some liberalisation of existing legal approaches.
One respondent supported change in the form of higher penalties
for use and possession offences. One supported additional
intervention (eg, education) as well as police intervention.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;There is (and has been for decades)
overwhelming evidence that the current system not only does not
work but is cataclysmically harmful.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;[Supported] for cannabis use/possession
only. Population use of cannabis has reached the point where
prohibition does more harm than good.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Counterproductive and contrary to
principles of harm minimisation and National Drugs Strategy to
criminalise users.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Should be less criminal records for these
offences, shorter time for expungement of criminal records.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">It is important to note that almost all
respondents support some change, as one of the findings of this
process is that views are polarised on the points contained in
the Steps Towards Harm Reduction. While most respondents
supported the need for changes in all of the areas covered by the
document, several respondents opposed most such changes. Those
generally in favour of change included some church groups,
doctors, lecturers, researchers, drug educators, drug treatment
staff and community based organisations. Those generally opposed
included some church groups, doctors association, drug treatment
staff and some community members.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Several respondents chose to write letters in
support of their general position. These general comments
included:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Issues of dependency could be more easily
addressed and the transmission of blood borne viruses could be
more efficiently reduced by taking the Steps Towards Harm
Reduction.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Too much attention is focused on the
question of whether the present system of drug prohibition is
working. In my view, the answer is clearly that prohibition is
not working ... But accepting that prohibition has failed is not
enough. Whether we should get rid of it depends on what we can
come up with as a replacement. Criminal law is not the only means
of regulation nor is its central presence in drug control
strategy inevitable ... The real choice is about what type of
state control is to replace prohibition as the dominant
strategy.&quot; (original emphasis)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The case here tends to be overstated by
extrapolations and generalisations ... There cannot be a blanket
approach to encouraging safe and responsible drug use ... There
is no clear evidence that either more restrictive or more liberal
policies have achieved significant impact on the prevalence of
illicit drugs.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The (United Nations) conventions do
reflect consensus and, with the problem of substance misuse,
there has to be a line drawn somewhere. I believe that drug law
reform, at its worst, acts to destroy all the lines and to leave
only confusion to those who desperately seek direction.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Option a. Abolish the offences of use and
possession </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen respondents supported this change, six
were opposed, three were unsure.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It's a victimless crime. What you do to
yourself in the privacy of your own home is no-one's
business.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;[The current law is] counterproductive
socially and economically.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It would equal approval - a message that
drug use is OK.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;There needs to be community consultations
before progress can occur.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Option b. Abolish the offence of self
administration only</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The proposal to abolish the offence of self
administration only was not included in the questionnaire
completed by respondents. However, one response noted that the
most recent Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy meeting had
resolved to form a Working Party of the National Drug Strategy
Committee to examine the self administration laws in every
jurisdiction. This Working Party is chaired by Mr Neil Bridge of
the NSW Police Service.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Option c. Vary enforcement practices (i) Better
directed police discretion</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The version of the paper circulated for comment
did not include this section, so most respondents did not have
the opportunity to comment on the proposals. The proposals were
discussed with a small number of respondents, who indicated some
support. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">(ii) Formal Police cautions</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Twenty respondents favoured this proposal,
three were opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Among the supporters, two indicated broad
support for the concept, but disagreement with the details
proposed. Two supporters expressed the view that this proposal
was a poor alternative to the repeal of the offences. Another
advocated this approach before considering legislative amendment
at a later time.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Police contact, if it is a deterrent,
would be just as effective with a caution or bond as with a
harsher penalty.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Diversion of users away from criminal
charges should be used wherever possible. Unfortunately [the
Department of] Health does not resource sufficient treatment or
counselling services. Magistrates cannot refer if there are no
services. Neither can police.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Less intrusive and punitive. Gives some
option for the individual&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It should remain a court matter, but with
no convictions recorded.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(iii) On-the-spot fines</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Seven respondents were in favour of this
proposal, with another one &quot;half in favour&quot; and 15
opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The respondent who was partially in favour
suggested that the South Australian experience was not a fair
test of the effectiveness of this approach because the law there
does not allow the police to demand identification. This
respondent suggested a variation on the proposal, with no fines
or other police attention for amount of less than 25 grams (for
cannabis), and fines for quantities in the range of 25 grams to,
say, 100 grams.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Although I favour legalisation, on the
spot fines may be a half way house&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Fines are overused as a sanction.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;They would just fill up the fines yards
and periodic detention centres.&quot; &quot;It is too difficult,
apparently, to prevent net-widening.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">V) Other suggestions</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Respondents were invited to make other
suggestions for legal change concerning personal use and
possession.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Six respondents offered comments.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Policing priorities (I guess goes with
(b)) Licensing of IV users (?), pot smokers(?)&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Some process for referral for assessment
for treatment/ rehabilitation. Need to look at withdrawing
driving licences, eg for methadone patients.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Let people grow what they like. Let the
market place sort it out. Supply good quality seed - kill the
black market. Keep it cheap. Get away from needles.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Referral options - jobs - safe
housing.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Legalise heroin and cannabis.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Continue education and encouragement of
non-use, and not starting to use: eg, experiment.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Remove prison as a sentencing option for drug
use or possession</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Twenty respondents were in favour of this
proposal, and four were opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Two of those in favour of this change supported
the establishment of secure, custodial rehabilitation facilities
for some drug users as an alternative to prison.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;What's the point of putting users in
gaol?&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;[Yes] But it should be seldom if ever
used.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Minimise or modify prison sentence,
deviation/direction to rehabilitation or treatment agencies when
possible.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3 Allow use of cannabis for medical purposes</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen respondents were in favour of this
proposal, three were opposed. One of those in favour supported
cannabis for medical purposes on prescription only.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Even if it is only a third rate drug -
why not allow some people to benefit?&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Cannabis in smokable form is not the best
available treatment for patients suffering from any
illness.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;For some conditions (eg, AIDS related
weight loss), there is no good alternative.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4. Allow possession of drug equipment as well
as needles and syringes</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Nineteen respondents favoured the proposal
(including one who supported legal change for bongs, but was
uncertain about injecting equipment), four were opposed. One of
those opposed to this proposal thought that a new offence should
be introduced for irresponsible disposal of used needles and
syringes.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Don't want to encourage drug use.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It's a proven public health
success.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Present situation is patently
ludicrous.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">5 Provide safe injecting spaces</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen respondents were in favour of this
proposal, five were opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Definitely. Works towards increased safe
disposal (by centralising use), decrease in overdoses (monitored
use), takes away IV use from public facilities like public
toilets, provision of counselling, health monitoring. High
priority change.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Safe for whom? These could assist in
collection of used needles which a good thing. If illegal
supplies of drugs which are being trafficked, these may prove
unsafe for users.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Socially unworkable. The practicalities
of their location and operation are enormous.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Cannot assume beneficial public health
effect especially if current prohibitions remain in place. Also
have to ensure that such places are truly 'safe' and clients are
free from identification and police harassment.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;What about non-metro towns? They may need
them more.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">6 Allow use, possession and supply of Narcan
without prescription</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Eleven respondents were in favour of this
proposal, four were against. Most others were unsure.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;This is well supported in research. There
are practical difficulties with its availability. Needs to be
worked on rather than talked about!&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I don't want to see kids die.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;100% for it.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I'm not sure about this, but I suppose I
should logically support it.&quot;<br>

<p><font size="4"><strong>4. Harm Reduction Model of Controlled
Drug Availability (Second Edition)</strong></font><font size="5"><strong>
</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">This paper is in two Parts. Part A sets out
Principles which should apply to the social and legal management
of currently illicit drugs. Part B provides some examples of how
these Principles might be applied for particular drugs.
Individuals and organisations are invited to endorse the
Principles of Controlled Availability contained in this proposal.
(An earlier version of this paper was published in May 1995.)</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>PART A: PRINCIPLES</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Preamble</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Prohibition causes enormous social damage
including: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Vastly increased drug-related property crime by
drug users to pay prices inflated by the black market</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Law enforcement costs to apprehend drug users
and sellers, and those who commit drug-related crime, and
increased costs and delays in the court system to process these
cases</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Corruption flourishing at all levels and in
many forms: profits are so great that few police or other
officials are able to resist the enormous sums offered as bribes</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Violent crime developing from supplier
competition </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Thousands of Australians jailed for drug
related crimes, leading to increased costs for corrective
services and the need for more jails</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prohibition contributes to the spread of HIV
and other blood-borne diseases such as Hepatitis B and C in the
following ways:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Needle sharing among injectors of some
currently illicit drugs can spread these infections: many drug
users begin to inject to receive the greatest effect from the
smallest quantity of the expensive drug</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some users of illicit drugs are forced into
high-risk forms of sex to pay for drug use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Needle and syringe supply programs are
difficult to establish and operate under regular threat of
closure, despite significantly reducing the spread of HIV and
other blood-borne diseases</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Unsafe disposal of used needles and syringes
increases because drug injectors believe that police will use
these articles as the basis for prosecution</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug injectors sent to prison continue to use
drugs but have virtually no means to protect themselves from
infection </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Laws prohibiting certain drugs have driven
users of currently illicit drugs from their social support
networks, making it hard to reach them with education messages
about protecting themselves and others from infection</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Marginalisation of drug users (encouraged by
prohibition) has led most Australians to care little what happens
to drug users </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Prohibition causes damage to the health of drug
users (and consequently increases health costs to society) by:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Users paying black market prices for drugs,
leading to increasing malnutrition and other health deficits
related to poverty</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Adulterants and inconsistent drug type or dose
(caused by unregulated manufacturing due to prohibition) causing
health damage, overdose and death among users of currently
illicit drugs </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Marginalisation of drug users leads to lower
self esteem and decreases motivation for self-care</font> </p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Goals of Rational Drug Policy</strong></font><font
size="4"><strong> </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Drug policy should:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Have realistic goals</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Take account of the different patterns and
types of harms caused by specific drugs</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Be shown to be effective or be changed</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Separate arguments about the consequences of
drug use from arguments about morals</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Be developed in the light of the costs of
control as well as the benefits</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Ensure that the harms caused by the control
regimes themselves do not outweigh the harms prevented by them</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Recognise the existence of multiple goals, but
ensure that contradictory goals are minimised</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We believe that this proposal achieves each of
these policy objectives.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The specific goals of this proposal are to
simultaneously reduce the size and profits of the illicit drug
market by the greatest amount; and provide the greatest level of
harm reduction for users of currently illicit drugs; and minimise
the number of users of these drugs who experience problems
related to their drug use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Defining Harm Reduction</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">We use the term &quot;harm reduction&quot; to
mean: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">A policy or programme directed towards reducing
the adverse health, social and economic consequences of drug use
to the community and to the individual user, even though the user
may continue to use psychoactive drugs at this time.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Harm reduction policies and programmes must be
part of a public health approach to managing drug use. Protecting
the health of the community must include protecting the health of
drug users.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Principles of Controlled Availability</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Applying these policy goals under the above
definition of harm reduction, we propose that a system of
controlled availability of currently illicit drugs be introduced.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Such a system should have the following
principles as its key elements:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1. The use and possession of currently illicit
drugs should be made legal, in an environment of controlled
availability. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">2. The regulated manufacture, supply and sale
of selected drugs should be allowed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3. The drugs selected for controlled
availability should include cannabis, heroin, amphetamine,
ecstasy and anabolic steroids.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4. The drugs selected for should be made
available either:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a) Over the counter from licensed premises in
specified (generally low) dosages of known purity, clearly
labelled with ingredients shown; or</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">b) By prescription.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">5. The age limit for the regulated supply of
currently illicit drugs should be the same as it is for alcohol.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">6. Advertising and marketing should be the
minimum necessary (eg, for brand identification) to ensure that
non-users are not attracted into drug use by marketing.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">7. Prices of regulated drugs should be set so
that least harmful forms of the drug (usually lower dosages) are
substantially less costly than more harmful forms of the drug.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">8. Users must demonstrate adequate knowledge
about the effects of the drug they intend to purchase, and about
safe usage.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">9. Profits earned from the commercial
production or supply of drugs should be taxed. Revenues obtained
from taxes and licence fees must be applied (in whole or in large
part) to education, and to treatment for those drug users who
want it. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">10. Controlled availability should operate in a
framework of:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a) education in which doctors and other health
professionals, licensed drug sellers and drug users all
participate in baseline and follow-up education based on valid
research; and</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">b) widespread, easily accessible treatment for
drug-related problems, with funding to be provided to a wide
variety of non-coercive options for positive change.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">11. The prescription system should have the
following characteristics:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a) Appropriate criteria for a drug to be
prescribed to an individual would be: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">i. regular frequent use (usually daily);</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">ii. clear evidence of dependence;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iii. continued use having a severe effect on
lifestyle;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iv. the harms associated with non-prescribed
use being significantly greater than those associated with
prescription. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">b) A variety of forms for oral, smokable or
injectable use be made available, in a range of doses up to a
negotiated maximum dose. Users must also have access to
appropriate drug using equipment.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">C) Users of the prescription system be
registered. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">d) The prescription system would operate in a
framework of:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">i. Harm reduction and full consumer
participation.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">ii. Entry assessment to ensure that the
individual wants to be maintained on the drug: this assessment
must be carried out by a trained, qualified drugs worker and must
include a full and frank discussion of the likely consequences of
a range of options including maintenance, detoxification,
selective detoxification, and controlled using.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iii. Options for dispensing which may include:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Pharmacy dispensing</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug clinic dispensing</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Home delivery or mobile van for long-term
illness, palliative care or isolated individuals</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Safe injecting spaces (&quot;shooting
rooms&quot;) in areas with a high concentration of drug
injectors, especially those who are homeless.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iv. Reasonable cost to the consumer. Services
to clients on low incomes would be delivered through the public
health system.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>PART B: CASE STUDIES</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">In this Part we propose some concrete examples
of how these Principles might be applied for particular drugs.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">We do not suggest that the proposals in this
Part describe the only possible application of these principles.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Cannabis</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">We use the term &quot;cannabis&quot; to refer
to the complete range of cannabis products including marijuana,
hashish resin and oil, and other preparations, as well as
industrial hemp. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to grow up to 10 cannabis
plants for personal use. It would be legal to consume cannabis
products or to possess up to 50 grams (dry weight) of cannabis
for personal use. It would be legal to supply in small quantities
(up to 50 grams) to people aged 18 and over for no payment.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to grow larger quantities of
cannabis under licence to a State Government Office of Drug
Revenue (ODR). Officially sanctioned cannabis growers would be
allowed to sell their products to cannabis shops or Kafes, or to
manufacturers of other cannabis products such as biscuits and
cakes, rope, paper, textiles, etc. A regulation system would
ensure that grades of cannabis (principally by THC content) are
adhered to, providing quality assurance for end users. A
differential tax could operate with different grades being
subject to different tax.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A system of cannabis Kafes would be established
for retail sales of cannabis, both for consumption on the
premises and for take-away consumption to people aged 18 and
over. A range of cannabis products from rolled cigarettes to
biscuits might be available, together with smoking implements
designed to reduce the level of harm associated with smoking
cannabis products (eg bongs).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Other retailers (eg tobacconists) would be
licensed to sell take away cannabis products. Cannabis seeds, and
information about home cultivation, would also be available.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial cannabis suppliers would be required
to label their products with consumer information concerning
weight, THC content, recommended dosage, and approved health
warnings. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of cannabis would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prices for cannabis products should be
comparable with prices of alcoholic spirits. Prices should be set
to encourage users to eat cannabis products rather than smoke.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Sales to people under 18 and unlicensed (ie
untaxed) sales would be illegal.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Advertising and marketing of cannabis products
would be restricted to the minimum necessary (eg for brand
identification). It might include a statement outside and inside
Kafes that &quot;cannabis products are sold here&quot;, or
perhaps a discrete symbol indicating availability of cannabis
products.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Cannabis smoking would be banned in places
where tobacco smoking is banned.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A realistic education campaign about the
hazards of using cannabis, concentrating on safe cannabis use,
&quot;dope-driving&quot;, the effects of both shortterm and
chronic use, and the use of cannabis and alcohol together, would
be carried out at regular intervals. The cost of this campaign
and ongoing campaigns directed at school students, homeless and
working youth and visitors to the State would be paid for by tax
revenues from cannabis sales. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Revenues from taxes and licence fees would be
used to administer the regulatory system and to provide education
and treatment services through services funded by the Health
Department. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of cannabis, unless further research proves that
cannabis does not impair driving ability. Research should be
conducted to determine what (if any) level of cannabis
intoxication would not adversely affects drivers' ability.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
cannabis. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Heroin &amp; other opioids</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">In this section, we refer to heroin and other
currently illicit opioids such as opium, as well as currently
restricted drugs such as methadone.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to use heroin and all
currently illicit opioid products, and to possess small
quantities (2 grams) for personal use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to supply, manufacture
or traffic in currently illicit opioid drugs except as follows:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Opiated teas, tinctures, tonics and other
products, clearly showing the percentage of opioid per volume
would be manufactured under licence to a State Government Office
of Drug Revenue (ODR) and sold through pharmacies to people over
the age of 18. All ingredients of these products would be listed
on their packaging. Taxes raise from the sale of these products
would be used to fund treatment and education programs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Smokable opium and heroin would be manufactured
under licence to the ODR and sold in pharmacies to people over
the age of 18, together with smoking implements designed to
reduce the level of harm associated with opium and heroin smoking
(ie. smoke cooling equipment such as hookahs and long pipes).
Prices of these products would be set so that they would:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(a) encourage opium use over heroin use, but
which</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(b) encourage opioid smoking over opioid
injecting. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Sales of these products would be in small
quantities only (enough for 3-4 episodes of intoxication). Taxes
raised from sales would be used to fund treatment and education
programs, and to subsidise the prescription system.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">By prescription (see below).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The pharmacy sales of opiated products, opium
and heroin would be regulated by officers of the ODR, not by the
police. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The retail system would be accompanied by an
education, information and referral system. A general education
campaign would be carried out to provide the rationale for this
system and to explain its workings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning weight,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of heroin and other opioids would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There would be no advertising or marketing of
opioid products except for the minimum necessary for brand
identification. Realistic education materials would be available
in a range of formats to opioid product buyers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Training would also be provided to pharmacists
in early identification of opiate-related problems, assessment of
these problems, and referral for assistance via prescribed
opioids, drug treatment or other help as negotiated with the
consumer. Part of this training would be in obtaining information
from new buyers about their level of knowledge of opioid use, and
ensuring that new buyers especially have access to appropriate
education materials.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of heroin or other opioids.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Prescription</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">The prescribing system should be established
for registered &quot;dependents&quot; (people who are or believe
that they are dependent on a drug). Such a prescription system
would have the following as its essential elements:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The system should have as its core values harm
reduction and full consumer participation. The system should have
an entry assessment to ensure that the individual wants to be
maintained on an opioid drug. Assessment must be carried out by a
trained, qualified drugs worker. A full and frank assessment of
the likely consequences of a range of options including
maintenance, detoxification, selective detoxification, controlled
using, etc should be negotiated with the individual.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The prescription system should make available a
choice of the five most popular opioid drugs in a variety of
forms for oral or injectable use, in a range of doses up to a
negotiated maximum dose when they so desire.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">To avoid &quot;double&quot; prescribing, a
computerised register would be kept of the dependent person's
name, address, preferred drug(s) and maximum dose(s).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Options for dispensing should also be
negotiated. They may include: Pharmacy dispensing Drug clinic
dispensing Home delivery for long-term illness or palliative
care. Safe injecting spaces (&quot;shooting rooms&quot;) in areas
with a high concentration of drug injectors, especially those who
are homeless.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The system should be costed at a reasonable fee
to the consumer. Services to clients on low incomes should be
delivered through the public health system. Operating costs will
be supplemented by some of the revenues from the ODR.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
heroin and opioids.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Amphetamine</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to consume amphetamine and to
possess small quantities (2 grams) for personal use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to manufacture, supply
or traffic in currently amphetamine except as follows:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Amphetamine would be manufactured under licence
to a State Government Office of Drug Revenue (ODR) and sold in
pharmacies to people over the age of 18. Prices of these products
would be set so that they are much higher than cannabis products.
Sales of amphetamine would be in small quantities only (enough
for 3-4 episodes of intoxication). Taxes on sales would be used
to fund treatment and education programs and to subsidise that
prescription program.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">By prescription.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The pharmacy sales of amphetamine would be
regulated by officers of the ODR, not by the police.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The retail system would be accompanied by an
education, information and referral system. A general education
campaign would be carried out to provide the rationale for this
system and to explain its workings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of amphetamine would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Realistic education materials would be
available in a range of formats to amphetamine buyers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There would be no advertising or marketing of
amphetamine except for strictly limited brand identification.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning weight,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
amphetamine. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of amphetamine.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Training would also be provided to pharmacists
in early identification of amphetamine-related problems,
assessment of these problems, and referral for assistance via
prescribed amphetamine, drug treatment or other help as
negotiated with the consumer. Part of this training would be in
obtaining information from new buyers about their level of
knowledge of stimulant use, and ensuring that new buyers
especially have access to appropriate education materials.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The prescription system should be established
for registered &quot;dependents&quot; (people who are or who
believe they are dependent on a drug). Such a system should have
the same essential elements as the opioid prescribing system
described above.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Ecstasy</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to consume ecstasy and to
possess up to 2 grams or 10 tablets.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Ecstasy may be manufactured and sold under
licence in pharmacies to people over the age of 18. Licences to
manufacturers, distributors and pharmacists would be issued by a
State Government Office of Drug Revenue (ODR).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Pharmacists licensed to sell ecstasy would be
required to complete suitable training in the pharmacological
effects of MDMA. Part of this training would in obtaining
information from new buyers about their level of knowledge of
ecstasy use, and ensuring that new buyers especially have access
to appropriate education materials.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning ingredients,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings. Ecstasy should
be manufactured for sale in standardised doses.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of ecstasy would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Rave parties would be allowed subject to
promoters obtaining a licence. To qualify for a licence,
promoters must demonstrate that arrangements have been made to
provide adequate supplies of free water, chill out rooms, and
other appropriate health measures. [If a significant black market
persists, it may be necessary to have a pharmacologist on-site to
analyse tablets and powders on the request of patrons.]</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Health information should be made available in
appropriate formats at places where ecstasy use is predictable
(eg raves). This information would include advice to drink
adequate water and to rest and cool down regularly.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of ecstasy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
ecstasy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Anabolic Steroids</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Steroids represent a separate and different
phenomenon of drug use to traditional psychoactive drugs. The
relationship between effect desired and effect obtained is
specific, and has less to do with the social and environmental
context of drug use. A harm reduction approach to steroid use
would include medical supervision of training and diet, as well
as psychological and physical monitoring (such as testing for
liver and kidney function). </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to use or possess small
quantities of anabolic steroids, provided the user holds a
current prescription from a medical practitioner authorising
their use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prescriptions may be issued for a maximum
single period of one month. Prescriptions could be renewed only
after consultation with the prescriber.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Training in the physical and psychological
effects of steroid use would be provided to those medical
practitioners who wish to be steroid prescribers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning ingredients,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Education campaigns should be undertaken aimed
at encouraging steroid users to moderate the quantities and
dosages used, and to use steroids only under medical supervision.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Research should continue into the physical and
psychological effects of use of anabolic steroids, especially
long term use. The results of this research should be promoted
widely among steroid users.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Sporting organisations would be able to
continue to ban steroid users from competition, and to test
competitors for steroid use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
anabolic steroids.</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996</font> </p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>5 Comments on the Harm Reduction Model</strong></font><font
size="5"><strong> </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Respondents were asked to comment in broad
terms about the desirability of controlled availability, and
about the Principles for Controlled Availability outlined in the
paper. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Responses were received from the same group
under the same conditions outlined in Chapter 3.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>General remarks</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">General comments on the Model included:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I would argue that we need to examine
specific regulatory options in terms of their potential for harm
minimisation and, in particular, to assess the relationship
between drug-related harm and particular forms of markets and
systems of distribution. As Nicholas Dorn and Nigel South have
recently suggested in the UK context, we need to ask: 'What sort
of markets do we least dislike, and how can we adjust the control
mix so as to push markets in the least undesired (harmful)
direction.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Some of the specific goals proposed for
rational drug policy have still to be tested. The means of
implementing controls on age, advertising and marketing, and
adequate knowledge about safe use are unknown. There should
certainly be a framework of treatment for drug related problems.
The prescription system is untested, as is the assessment
process.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I wish to endorse (the Model's) contents,
especially the point that prohibition has had no positive
results. I am not competent to suggest any amendments except to
add that I was a registered nurse for about thirty-five
years.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Unfortunately, the (Model) goes much
further than the harm minimisation principles of the National
Drug Strategy, to the point of having few controls on
availability at all.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;In general, harm reduction strategies
presuppose the impossibility of addressing the undesirable
behaviour and hence direct attention to the consequences. What is
not clear, in my mind, is how we define the I undesirable
behaviour' with which we are dealing. In other words, is drug use
a cause or result of other social or behavioural problems?&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Controlled availability</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Should we adopt a &quot;controlled
availability&quot; approach in the long term as the best policy
direction for currently illicit drugs?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Fourteen were in favour of the concept of
controlled availability as outlined in the paper, six were
against.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Supported, because it's sensible.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;(Controlled availability) is needed as
the next step in harm minimisation.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;We need education about drug effects, and
research too. Controlled availability provides a means both of
generating data and of informing users.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Sends the wrong message to young
people.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Supported, provided that: it is
researched for each drug group research is open and rigorous only
move to next group if research is favourable&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Controlled availability as defined seems
more like 'uncontrolled availability' when over-the-counter
options are included. All drugs with a medical purpose that can
help people with an addiction problem should be available on
prescription, but not over-the-counter.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Can't answer for all drugs at this stage.
Support idea for cannabis.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I am unconvinced as to the merits of a
'blanket' approach to controlled availability. More convinced as
to the merits of controlled availability of cannabis, perhaps
ecstasy, and favour prescribing system for heroin.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Internal consistency</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Is the Harm Reduction Model of Controlled Drug
Availability internally coherent? For example, are the principles
consistent with the stated goals?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Seventeen said yes, four said no.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Good effort in putting all this together
... the way you've done it contains a lot of common sense.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I don't think the mechanisms of
controlled availability have been spelt out in enough detail to
make a judgment about harm minimisation for all drugs.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;They're the best considered proposals
I've yet seen coming from an Australian source ... May these
proposals enjoy wide readership.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Raises all the right questions which need
to be addressed. The current system needs to be challenged.&quot;
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The document could be strengthened by
describing the pros and cons of each method of delivery (Eg,
prescription and over the counter).&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Principles</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Do you broadly support the Principles of
Controlled Availability set out in the Harm Reduction Model of
rug Availability? </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen were in favour, five were opposed.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The closest to the mark we've seen so
far.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It is this kind of extremism that offers
opponents of harm minimisation strategies a platform from which
to jump.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;You should be congratulated for doing the
exercise. By being specific about details, you give everybody a
chance to tear it apart. But that is positive.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;We congratulate the Drug Law Reform
Project on the production of such a positive and practical Model,
one that if fully and successfully implemented by governments and
other decision makers, would most certainly contribute to a
substantial reduction of hepatitis C transmission. We look
forward to hearing of progress on its implementation.&quot;</font>

<p><font size="4">6. Future drug law reform activities</font><font
size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Future -activities for the Redfern Drug Law
Reform Project are -likely to include closer links to other
committees and organisations working on drug law reform in New
South Wales. These groups are growing in number and diversity and
include in their members the parents, siblings and friends of
people who have died from overdose, AIDS or other drug-related
causes, doctors, lawyers, professors and emeritus professors of
medicine and pharmacology, drug users, health care workers,
clerks, needle exchange workers, historians and artists.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In turn, these NSW groups are working closely
with groups in other States and with the Australian Drug Law
Reform Foundation to address issues of drug policy and related
law reform in every jurisdiction in Australia. The documents
contained in this report will be examined again next year to see
whether further changes and refinements are needed. Another
report of people's comments on the documents will also be
released at some point in 1997. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Individuals and organisations are invited to
endorse, abuse or otherwise comment on the documents and to send
these comments to:</font> </p>

<p><b>THE HISTORY OF LEGISLATIVE CONTROL OVER OPIUM, COCAINE, AND
THEIR DERIVATIVES</b> </p>

<p><b>by</b> </p>

<p><b>David F. Musto, MD</b> </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> <br>
</h1>

<p>Legislative control over dangerous drugs may be dated from
attempts in the nineteenth century to prevent acute poisoning by
certain substances that might be purchased in ignorance of their
lethal potential or might be too easily available to would-be
suicides. Opium was being sold in a crude form containing about
10 percent morphine, as well as in concoctions derived from crude
opium: paregoric, laudanum, and a solution in acetic acid known
as &quot;black drop.&quot; Morphine had been isolated from opium
in 1805 by the German pharmacist, F. W. Serturner, but production
of the powerful active ingredient of opium on a large scale was
delayed until the 1830s.1 From that time onward, in factories in
Germany, Great Britain, and the United States, morphine was
produced in great quantities. Thus when in 1868, Great Britain
came to enact pharmacy laws to control dangerous substances,
&quot;opium and all preparations of opium or of poppies&quot; was
listed alongside such substances as oxalic acid as commodities
that could not be sold without being labeled &quot;poison.&quot;'
</p>

<p>The Pharmacy Act of 1868 is an important symbol of legislative
control in a Western country. The act was not the most strict
among nations; perhaps the Prussian regulations were stricter and
more comprehensive, but establishment by the British of some
limitation on the availability of dangerous drugs-drugs that
would eventually become more serious a problem for society as
addictive agents than as tools for suicide-was a policy also
followed by other European nations. It had an apparently
discouraging effect on the per capita consumption of opium,
opiates, and cocaine in the late nineteenth century and
contributed to the low level of British consumption (at least
compared to the American) right up to the 1960s.3 </p>

<p>The experience of the United States stands in contrast to
Britain's. The Pharmacy Act of 1868 was regulated in large part
by the organized association of pharmacists, the Pharmaceutical
Society (established 1841). In order to retail, dispense, or
compound &quot;poisons,&quot; or to assume the title of chemist,
druggist, pharmacist, or dispensing druggist or chemist, the
individual had to be registered by the Pharmaceutical Society. As
well as being the testing and registering body, the Society was
also given the initial responsibility for adding new drugs to the
poison list. Thus the law, which ultimately would be enforced in
British courts, was monitored by local members of the
Pharmaceutical Society as a tool in competition with unregistered
druggists, grocers, and anyone else who might attempt to purvey
these drugs to the public. </p>

<p>While the act presumably aided the public health by having
dangerous drugs sold or dispensed by individuals knowledgeable
about their qualities, it was also a convenient aid to the trade
of registered pharmacists. Although the drugs could be obtained
with no specific restraint on the amount or frequency of sale,
the bottles had to be labeled &quot;poison.&quot; A stricter
category of substances also required that the purchaser be an
acquaintance of the pharmacist or someone the pharmacist knew.
This list included arsenic and &quot;strychnine and all poisonous
alkaloids and their salts.&quot; The impact of this modest
obstacle to the acquirement of dangerous drugs should not be
underestimated. Further, the self-interest that would motivate
registered pharmacists to monitor breaches of the law provided an
unpaid, but interested, drug enforcement cadre scattered
throughout Great Britain. &quot;Patent medicines&quot; were
excepted from these controls, and this led to a campaign against
them later in the century, but the pure forms of the drugs, e.g.,
morphine suitable for injection, were restricted in availability
from the time of the Pharmacy Act onward.' In the United States,
throughout the nineteenth century, both medicine and pharmacy
remained essentially unorganized, although there were some
physicians and pharmacists attempting to organize their
professions. The American Medical Association, which was founded
in 1847 and which we now might think of as the dominant medical
organization, was a small and nationally unrepresentative group
until about World War 1.5 The American Pharmaceutical
Association, founded four years later, grew slowly and, like the
AMA, lacked the authority to license practitioners. The pharmacy
establishment was divided sharply among drug manufacturers,
wholesalers, and retailers, whose divergent interests the APhA
tried to coordinate, but each segment of the profession came to
work through its own organization: the National Wholesale
Druggists' Association (1882), the National Association of Retail
Druggists (1898), and many other groups.6 There was no national
group for the health professions to which government could turn
for regulation, even if the American constitutional system had
permitted such an arrangement. </p>

<p>Licensing of pharmacists and physicians, which was the central
government's responsibility in European nations, was, in the
United States, a power reserved to each individual state. In the
era of Andrew Jackson, any form of licensing that appeared to
give a monopoly to the educated was attacked as a contradiction
of American democratic ideals. State after state repealed the
medical licensing laws adopted in earlier days. Practical
concerns also supported repeal: Legislators preferred to leave it
to the patients to decide which of the many competing theories of
medicine was the best. Instead of moving toward a national system
of licensing for health professionals, therefore, individual
states were deregulating the professions. American medical
schools were similarly unregulated, and many flourished-some no
better than diploma mills. The states did not begin
reestablishment of medical licensing until the 1880s, and even
then the movement was spotty, with a wide range of standards.'
Pharmacists, also seeking to raise standards and limit
competition, likewise fought at the state level for licensing,
since the U.S. Constitution placed in the hands of states the
regulation of the health professions. Although some requirements
for labeling of over-the counter medicines would come with the
Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 as an exercise of the federal
right to regulate interstate commerce, in general, the nineteenth
and early twentieth century interpretation of the Constitution
favored a strict division between state and federal powers. </p>

<p>The status of legislative control of dangerous drugs during
the nineteenth century may be summed up as follows: The United
States had no practical control over the health professions, no
representative national health organizations to aid the
government in drafting regulations, and no controls on the
labeling, composition, or advertising of compounds that might
contain opiates or cocaine. The United States not only proclaimed
a free marketplace, it practiced this philosophy with regard to
narcotics in a manner unrestrained at every level of preparation
and consumption. </p>

<p>Through a slower pace of professional development, the United
States also lagged behind Britain and other European countries in
establishing broadly based organizations representing the
nation's physicians or pharmacists to which the central
government could turn for regulation. Second, the form of
government adopted in the United States, a federation of partly
independent states, was a conscious attempt to prevent
establishment of an all-powerful central government
characteristic of Europe. In the nineteenth century, this
remarkably successful form of government entailed each state
making its own regulation if it wished to; the result was an
array of controls that varied from one state to another. In fact,
states made little attempt to control addictive drugs until quite
late in the last century, and those efforts did not prove very
effective. </p>

<p>During the first part of the nineteenth century, the amount of
opiates used in the United States may have been comparable to
that used in Britain, where some areas, notably the fen counties,
had a fairly large per capita consumption. Inhabitants there
often took a dose of laudanum or some form of opium daily to keep
away the fevers associated with the marshlands.8 More generally,
parents reputedly purchased one or another form of opium to rub
on the gums of teething infants or to spoon-feed a child to
induce sleep so that the mother without provision for child care
could work in the local factory. These accounts are anecdotal,
but recent historical studies do suggest that the taking of some
form of opium for pain, sleep, or to ward off illness was not
uncommon. The occasional death of an infant from an overdose of
opium or the suicide of an adult by means of opium prompted
parliamentary interest in the distribution and labeling of the
drug. In large measure, the 1868 Pharmacy Act was the result. One
should note however, that through the provisions of the act and
the designation of the Pharmaceutical Society as the most
responsible body, the pharmacists also achieved some control over
the profession and a lead on the other health professions. A
somewhat similar victory for U.S. pharmacy would be found in the
details of the Harrison Narcotic Act in 1914.9 </p>

<p>In nineteenth-century America, the unimpeded importation of
opium and the free economy in opiates do give an advantage to the
historian, for estimates of per capita consumption are more
reliable when there are few restrictions on the importation,
sale, and consumption of a product. Because the growth of poppies
within the country and preparation of opium from them seem to
have been a minor contributor to American use, the import
statistics, begun in 1840 and continued to the present day, are
reliable as a guide to domestic consumption until the Harrison
Act of 1914. Certainly the minimum level and the trend can be
observed. After the Harrison Act, these statistics grew less
reliable, for smuggling becomes a more uncertain variable, but we
can say that at least during the nineteenth century the annual
per capita consumption rose steadily from about 12 grains in 1840
(an average single dose being one grain) until the mid-1890s,
when it reached 52 grains annually per capita. Then statistics
show that average individual consumption gradually subsided up to
1914, by which time the per capita rate had fallen back to the
level of about 1880.&quot; In Great Britain, the per capita
consumption declined during the latter half of the nineteenth
century.&quot; During that same period, opium use in the United
States rose dramatically. The peak of opiate addiction in the
United States occurred about the turn of the century, when the
number probably was close to 250,000 in a population of 76
million, a rate so far never equaled or exceeded. 12 Heroin had
been introduced into the pharmacy in 1898 and had contrasting
impacts in Britain and the United States. In New York City, the
addiction capital of the United States, heroin became the drug of
choice for recreational addicts, and the number of addicts was
measured in the tens of thousands by 1920. In Britain, the
addiction rate for heroin addicts by 1920 was minuscule. 13 Of
course, the use of drugs is determined by many factors, but I
would like to suggest that the contrast in easy availability of
narcotics in America and Britain-created by political and social
factors removed from considerations of addiction-underlay the
strikingly different rates of addiction each country experienced
well into this century. The rise in addiction with which we are
more familiar, that of the 1950s and more recently, appears to be
associated with additional factors that will be discussed later. </p>

<p>Americans have something to learn from their earlier and
extensive consumption of opiates, including heroin, and also
massive consumption of cocaine, which occurred before World War
I. This era is forgotten. We commonly act as if the heroin
&quot;epidemic&quot; of the 1960s or the current cocaine
&quot;epidemic&quot; is a new phenomenon in the United States,
that the widespread use of a drug implies that legalization or
&quot;decriminalization&quot; is the only reasonable response.
The history of attempts at legislative control in the United
States suggests that other courses may be effective and that
these alternatives to legalization appear to have reduced
enormous opiate and cocaine consumption in the United States
earlier in this century. Therefore, it is worthwhile to consider
these early efforts at narcotic limitation if we are to approach
contemporary policy issues with an appreciation of the range of
policy options that reduce or encourage ingestion of these
substances. For in spite of the great difference in addiction
rates between the United States and Great Britain in 1920, the
United States did reduce its addiction rate to a relatively small
number. On the other hand, the low heroin addiction rate in Great
Britain prior to the 1950s did not prove a protection against
drug problems in that nation, although the level of use in
Britain has not reached the proportions to which we are
accustomed in the United States. Clearly the social and legal
factors affecting drug use are complex, and there is no single
influence that determines a particular level of drug use and
abuse. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>AMERICAN LEGISLATIVE CONTROL OVER OPIUM AND OPIATES TO 1914</b>
</p>

<p>The role of opium and its derivatives in the United States can
be traced independently from cocaine until 1914, when these
substances were linked together as &quot;narcotics&quot; through
the Harrison Act. Technically, only the opiates are narcotics,
that is, sleep-inducing, and they all have different effects.
Nevertheless, most dangerous drugs, including cannabis, were
grouped under the rubric &quot;narcotics&quot; from at least the
1920s until the 1960s. </p>

<p>As mentioned above, opium was available in many forms derived
from crude opium long before the nineteenth century. In America,
the two developments that spurred both consumption and concern
about opium were (1) the isolation of morphine and its injection
into the body with hypodermic syringes and (2) the introduction
of smoking opium, which had been brought to the United States
mainly by a feared minority, Chinese laborers imported to help
build western railroads. The much greater ease of addiction
through use of morphine compared to the more dilute forms
employed previously focused attention on the drug, medical
practitioners, and modern technology in the form of the
hypodermic syringe. </p>

<p>Consumption of opium in the United States rose steadily before
and after the Civil War. There had been complaints before the war
about &quot;opium drunkards&quot; by such prominent and
progressive physicians as Oliver Wendell Holmes, but in the
second half of the century, physicians, as well as the general
public, widely deplored opium and morphine addiction. To be
addicted to morphine was to harbor a shameful secret to be hidden
from others at whatever cost, a point illustrated in Eugene
O'Neill's moving play about his own family, Long Day's Journey
into Night. Written in his later years, it was based on his
mother's addiction by a thoughtless physician, and the pain of
this memory had remained so great that O'Neill would not permit
the play's production during his lifetime. The leading American
surgeon and the first professor of surgery at The Johns Hopkins
Hospital, William Stewart Halsted, was a morphine addict for the
last several decades of his life. His secret was kept hidden
carefully until the publication of Sir William Osler's private
diary in 1969.&quot; Osler had been Halsted's physician while
Osler was on the Hopkins faculty. Halsted's addiction did not
appear to interfere with his work. </p>

<p>Americans received opium and morphine not only from their
physicians for pain; they could receive what they wanted, for
whatever reason they chose, over the counter or from mail order
catalogues. The American free enterprise system, coupled with the
federal system of government, meant that a bottle heavily laced
with morphine could be sold across state lines as an
&quot;addiction cure&quot; and affirmed on the label to contain
no morphine whatsoever, quite within the law. States could pass
laws restricting such advertising, but they were not inclined to
do so. Patent medicine companies were the leading advertisers in
American newspapers. They developed an ingenious protection from
prying investigations or public pressure to reveal secret
formulas, or from any state requirement to make only valid claims
for effectiveness: The proprietary manufacturers included in
their lucrative contracts with newspapers a proviso that the
advertising agreement would be void if the state in which the
newspaper was published enacted any laws affecting the sale or
manufacture of the nostrums. 11 </p>

<p>In the nation's capital, the manufacturers also fought off
requirements that their nostrums be labeled as to contents. Bills
to enact such a law under the interstate commerce clause of the
Constitution were defeated repeatedly, but in the 1890s a new
reforming spirit was evident in the nation. These reforms were
extensive, ranging from control over the use of forest land, to
government inspection of meat and other comestibles and laws
relating to adulterants in foods, and to drugs considered unsafe.
Attention to the danger of narcotics using the term
broadly-accompanied the peak of per capita consumption in the
United States. It is clear that what were regarded as the most
negative aspects of drug use led to the passage of the new
legislation. The simplest reform, correct labeling, was part of
the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. Any over-the-counter medicine
- commonly these would be &quot;patent medicines&quot;-had to be
labeled correctly as to inclusion of any of the following drugs:
morphine, cocaine, cannabis, or chloral hydrate. A long-desired
reform, it simply informed the purchaser whether any of these
drugs were present; it did not prevent purchase or restrict the
amount of the drug. 16 Nevertheless, reports at the time indicate
that the amount of these substances dropped from a third to a
half as a response to public concern.17 Although the newspapers
remained quiet, widely read magazines such as Collier's and
Ladies Home Journal railed against patent medicines, especially
against morphine and cocaine. Even after passage of the
truth-in-labeling laws, the magazines continued their exposes
unabated until the next major step, which was restriction on the
availability of the drugs themselves.&quot; </p>

<p>Tracing the movement to restriction, as opposed to labeling
accuracy, requires a step back to the mid-nineteenth century.
Patent medicines are thought to have created some addiction, but
the number of addicts is difficult to estimate. That physicians
addicted or assisted in the addiction of patients is more
certain. The problem of iatroaddiction initially was approached
by limiting renewal of prescriptions for opiates. These legal
controls were mostly in the form of additions to the health
statutes and depended for their efficacy on the judgments of
physicians and pharmacists. These controls would not, of course,
affect interstate commerce in narcotics or the familiar patent
medicines, which still could be bought over the counter. No
consistent police efforts to enforce these laws appear to have
been undertaken.18 </p>

<p>As the public and leaders of the health professions became
more aware of the growing number of those addicted to opiates,
chiefly morphine, state laws were amended to be more stringent,
and the police occasionally staged crackdowns. As will be
recalled, however, the professions were pretty much unorganized
and struggling to achieve mandatory licensing; a threat to take
away a license could not hold much fear until a license was
required to begin with. Legislators also felt, or at least
claimed, a helplessness when neighboring states did not enact
strict laws-a circumstance more familiar to us with variations
in- the legal drinking age between states-with the result that
enforcement was weak. This circumstance, combined with a poorly
trained medical profession, a lack of professional organization,
and an absence of laws controlling either patent medicine or
interstate commerce in drugs, left local controls more symbolic
than effective. </p>

<p>The nineteenth century's last decade brought the rise of what
would come to be called the Progressive Movement, a set of
reforms usually taking the form of federal laws affecting the
entire nation with the ostensible purpose of improving the
nation's morals or resisting the selfish actions of the rich and
powerful. Alongside it grew a temperance, soon a prohibition,
movement that would eventuate in the Eighteenth Amendment
mandating prohibition of alcohol distribution for nonmedical
purposes in the United States. In many ways, of course, the
antialcohol movement was part of the Progressive Era; its
startling success and later dramatic repeal have given the
alcohol issue a somewhat separate development in our minds, but
the interrelation between the battles against alcohol and against
narcotics is an important one. The antialcohol crusade helped
establish the attitude that there could be no compromise with the
forces of evil, that &quot;moderation&quot; was a false concept
when applied to alcohol: Prohibition was the only logical or
moral policy when dealing with this great national problem. By
the nineteenth century a new wave of state prohibition laws was
enacted. These were tempered by the contemporary constitutional
understanding that a state prohibition law did not prevent
purchase of liquor from a &quot;wet&quot; state, for that would
be a form of interstate commerce and not subject to the states'
powers. This assumption helped placate some doubters about
prohibition, but the staunch fighters against alcohol also sought
to remove that loophole. This they did through the Webb-Kenyon
Act of 1913. Without going into the details of the broad and
involved movement that led to national prohibition, we should
note that the significance for the control of narcotics is that
another dangerous substance, over which there was even more
dispute as to the means of control, progressed inexorably toward
a policy of &quot;no maintenance&quot; and no compromise. The
moral question of how to deal with a dangerous substance was
being fought out over alcohol, but the case would be stronger
even with narcotics when that issue was brought to national
deliberation. </p>

<p>The means by which the narcotics issue arose at the federal
level was accidental. Certainly it would have come to the
attention of Congress and the president eventually as a corollary
to the alcohol prohibition movement or as a way of controlling
addiction, which was becoming a target of journalist reformers
and physicians. It was acquisition of the Philippines through the
Spanish-American War that occasioned action by the federal
government. </p>

<p>Again, in order to understand how the Philippines forced the
central government to take action on opium, it is necessary to
appreciate the divisions between federal and state powers that
were so marked until the last half-century. The Philippines,
unlike a state, came directly and wholly under the control of the
federal government. At last, Congress could not avoid making
decisions on such matters as the local availability of opium.
Opium had been provided to Chinese on the Philippine Islands
through a Spanish government monopoly. Civil Governor William
Howard Taft considered whether the monopoly should be
reinstituted. It was his judgment that this would be reasonable
and that the profits from the opium monopoly could be used to
help educate Filipinos, a task the United States eagerly accepted
as it sought to provide a model government for its first colony.
20 </p>

<p>It was at the point in 1903, when this reinstitution was
passing through the Philippine government under the eye of Civil
Governor Taft, that the moral question of compromising with
&quot;evil&quot; affected the future of opium's legal
availability in that land. Missionaries in Manila and in the
United States had learned that &quot;tainted money&quot; from
opium sales was to be employed for education, and they besought
President Theodore Roosevelt to prevent this moral wrong. He
ordered Taft to stop the bill, and that was the end of it. The
mood of moral leaders in the United States was sufficient during
the first few years of this century to prevent any such
&quot;maintenance&quot; program, even if it was restricted, as
promised, to the Chinese in the Philippines. This immediate
reaction to allowing opium to be used for purely
&quot;recreational&quot; purposes, coming even before the Food
and Drug Act, gave a signal as to how the federal government
would respond to later questions regarding the legal supply of
opium to individuals, not for medical reasons but for enjoyment
or to satisfy their addiction. </p>

<p>In response to the veto from Washington, Governor Taft
appointed an Opium Investigation Committee to consider how other
Asian territories handled the opium problem. This committee
introduces us to Bishop Charles Henry Brent, the Protestant
Episcopal bishop of the Philippines, who had come out with Taft
to help in Americanization of this new possession. Bishop Brent
later would become world famous for his pioneer efforts to launch
the ecumenical movement among Christian churches, but his second
claim to fame was as a world leader against nonmedicinal uses of
narcotics. He was appointed to the committee, which traveled to
Japan, Formosa, Shanghai, Saigon, and Singapore examining how
other nations dealt with the opium user. He and the other members
of the committee found the Japanese policy in Formosa, a Japanese
possession since its seizure from China in 1895, to be the most
effective and enlightened. Japan opposed smoking opium but did
not try to stop confirmed addicts abruptly from indulging in
their habit. Japan, hoped to &quot;mature out&quot; the opium
smokers and leave an opium-free colony. In Japan, itself, opium
use was controlled stringently by the government, rare even among
Chinese aliens, and strongly deprecated by Japanese society. </p>

<p>The Philippine Opium Investigation Committee recommended that
(1) male opium smokers over 21 should be registered in order to
receive opium from a reinstituted government monopoly and (2)
after a three-year period, the amount provided the smokers be
reduced gradually until the smokers had been completely weaned
from the drug. 1 But Congress reacted more sternly. Congress
decreed immediate opium prohibition, except for medicinal
purposes, for all native Filipinos; non-Filipinos-mostly
Chinese-were allowed a three-year period of use. Over 12,000
non-Filipino opium users were registered, and their usual dosage
was maintained for two-and-onehalf years. During the final six
months of the three-year leniency period ending March 1908, the
opium provided was gradually reduced to zero. For official
purposes, opium smoking had stopped in the Philippine Islands.
One additional point: The opium dispensing stations established
under these laws were the first American narcotic clinics,
although their goal was not long-term maintenance but rather
registration and detoxification. </p>

<p>The Philippine situation forced the federal government to take
a stand on opium use for nonmedicinal purposes, and the decision
was to prohibit. To Congress, once the question was posed,
compromise with narcotics was not a politically practical
alternative. The Philippines also gave the United States
leadership of the international control of narcotics, a role it
still holds. It was apparent to the Opium Investigating Committee
that the solution to the Philippine opium problem lay in the
control of international trafficking in opium, as well as in the
curtailment of opium production in the original producing states,
such as India, China, Burma, Persia, and Turkey, to name some of
the most prominent sites for the cultivation of the opium poppy. </p>

<p>At the time that the Philippines were perceived to be a victim
of external sources of opium, the United States was having
increasing problems with the Chinese Empire. Owing to
maltreatment of Chinese in the United States, merchants in China
planned a voluntary embargo on American goods. This worried
American industrialists, wholesalers, exporters, and the federal
government. China had also embarked on a vigorous effort to rid
itself of opium use and, employing draconian methods, was having
some success. As a means to indicate good will to China, to aid
the Philippine opium problem, and to take an international
leadership position on a moral issue of the times, the United
States proposed, following Bishop Brent's suggestion to President
Roosevelt, to convene an international meeting at Shanghai to
consider the opium traffic among nations and to suggest ways in
which China's antiopium campaign might be aided. </p>

<p>Thus, the Shanghai Opium Commission came into being. It would
meet during February 1909, with Bishop Brent as its elected
president. The group was designated a &quot;commission&quot;
because the United States was unable to gain approval for a more
powerful convocation, a &quot;conference,&quot; which under
international law could draft a treaty that would, if ratified,
bind the signatory states. A &quot;commission,&quot; on the other
hand, could make findings of only fact or opinion. In addition to
the United States and China, those who accepted invitations to
Shanghai were Great Britain, France, the Netherlands, Persia,
Japan, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Portugal, Siam, and
Russia. Turkey accepted but did not send a representative. Persia
was represented by a local merchant. </p>

<p>The resolutions adopted by the commission were merely
recommendations and, even as such, had a comfortable vagueness
that allowed a latitude of interpretations. For example,
Resolution Three, taking cognizance of the near unanimous
agreement that opium for nonmedicinal uses should be prohibited
or &quot;carefully regulated,&quot; called upon nations to
&quot;reexamine&quot; their laws. This could hardly be considered
a clarion call for prohibition of nonmedical uses, but it was
Brent's goal to achieve a series of resolutions that at least
pointed in the direction of action to control traffic in
narcotics, with the hope that a future conference would enact a
treaty initiating such control.&quot; </p>

<p>The road from the Shanghai Opium Commission to the Hague Opium
Conference, which convened in December 1911 and resulted in the
Opium Convention of 1912, was a tortuous one, but after the
Shanghai meeting, the United States continued to press for a
second and more significant gathering. Eventually, the nations
gathered in The Hague, and once again Bishop Brent was elected
the presiding officer. </p>

<p>The Hague Opium Convention (which concerned cocaine as well as
opium) placed the burden of narcotic control on the domestic
legislation of each nation. Chapter Three of the convention
called for control of each phase of the preparation and
distribution of medicinal opium, morphine, heroin, cocaine, and
any new derivative that could be shown to have similar properties
.24 </p>

<p>The convention was not put into force by the dozen nations who
attended the First Opium Conference, for it was agreed that the
requirements would be held in abeyance until all forty-six world
powers had signed and ratified the convention. Eventually three
conferences were held, the second in 1913 and the third in 1914,
only weeks before the outbreak of World War 1. A compromise was
reached regarding the implementation of the treaty: Any ratifying
nation was permitted to put the treaty into effect in 1915, even
if ratification had not been unanimous. But only seven nations
did this by the end of the World War and the beginning of the
Versailles treaty negotiations in 1919. The United States
supported incorporating the Hague Convention into the Versailles
treaty, so that ratification of the treaty ending World War I
would at the same time bring the nation under the requirements of
the Hague Convention, which required national and domestic
legislation to control the preparation and distribution of
opiates and cocaine. Of course, the United States never did
ratify the Versailles treaty, but it had already ratified the
Hague Convention in 1913 and had put it into effect in 1915. One
significant result of the inclusion of the Hague Convention in
the Versailles treaty was the passage in Britain of the Dangerous
Drugs Act of 1920, an action taken not because of any serious
problem with addiction but because, by ratifying the Versailles
treaty, Britain had committed itself to comprehensive domestic
legislation. 25 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>DOMESTIC NARCOTIC LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES</b> </p>

<p>During the year or so prior to the Shanghai Opium Commission,
the United States suggested topics to be discussed in 1909, and
one of the topics was a report on domestic antinarcotic
legislation. Americans understood that strong and enforced
domestic legislation in other nations would result in diminishing
the flow of drugs into the United States, but would other nations
understand why the United States had no national antinarcotic
legislation whatsoever? Americans knew that federal-state
separation of powers made a national antinarcotic law rather
difficult, but the State Department decided that something should
be on the books when the U.S. delegation arrived in Shanghai. </p>

<p>The simplest law that could be framed and stand a chance of
passage by the U.S. Congress before the commission opened was one
that excluded from the United States opium not intended for
legitimate medical uses or, in other words, opium prepared for
smoking. Here there was an ironic combination of political
factors. The United States hoped one of the major effects of the
Shanghai Commission would be to placate China with regard to the
poor treatment given Chinese nationals in the United States. Such
treatment was in violation of our treaty obligations with China.
The impetus for banning smoking opium from the United States,
however, had developed from the fear and loathing of the Chinese,
who were associated intimately with this particular manner of
ingesting opium. Thus, the negative American attitude toward
Chinese aliens gave the push that passed a &quot;face
saving&quot; law designed to show China the good will of the
United States. </p>

<p>After the law was enacted on February 9, 1909, it was
announced dramatically in Shanghai to the other nations as proof
of American sincerity.26 And yet no one in the American
delegation or within the State Department had any illusions that
this law would control domestic narcotic use. Additional
legislation was seen as imperative both to curtail the American
narcotics problem and to display an American example to other
nations where the implementation of narcotics control programs
was essential to the solution of the American domestic problem. </p>

<p>Dr. Hamilton Wright, a physician with political interests who
had been appointed opium commissioner by the State Department in
1908, oversaw the State Department's preparation for the Shanghai
meeting, which included culling information from police
departments, physicians, pharmaceutical houses, etc., regarding
the narcotic problem and consumption in the United States. Bishop
Brent was the chairman of the delegation, but after his elevation
to the commission's presidency, Wright became the acting head.
Back in Washington after the commission meeting, Wright took up
the battle for an international meeting that could frame a treaty
and played a leading role in the preparation of domestic
antinarcotic legislation. He had opposition within the State
Department on both questions, but he finally won the assent of
Philander C. Knox, the secretary of state, and moved ahead. </p>

<p>Wright, who combined an aggressive personal style with
self-righteousness and a thirst for political preferment, was
less effective than he otherwise might have been. He never got
the prize plum for which he yearned, the ministry to China, and
his chief claim for notability, the Anti-Narcotic Act of 1914,
known even then as the &quot;Harrison&quot; Act, left him at the
moment of achievement with almost no further role in the
antinarcotic movement. Eventually, he volunteered to help the
wounded on the western front during World War 1, was injured 27
there in an automobile accident, and died in 1917 in Washington.
His indomitable wife, Elizabeth Washburn Wright, carried on his
28 battle for world control of narcotics until her death in 1952.
</p>

<p>In late 1909 Dr. Wright proposed a domestic law that would be
based on the federal government's power of taxation. The
alternative federal power was that over interstate commerce, but
Wright believed that taxation would result in a detailed
accounting of narcotics from their introduction into the United
States to their distribution to manufacturers, wholesalers, and
retailers, including pharmacists and physicians. Heavy fines
would be levied on anyone not keeping records accurately or
selling and transferring these products without proper reporting
and payment of taxes. </p>

<p>Wright tried to solve the federal/state dichotomy in this
manner: The information obtained by this proposed law would be
made available to state boards of pharmacy and medicine, which
would then take appropriate action to ensure that &quot;the
proper relations . . . should exist between the physician, the
dispensing druggist, [and] those who have some real need of the
drugs.' &quot;29 So it is evident that at this early stage, two
years before the Hague Convention, Wright and the State
Department did not envision a federal role in policing the
relationships between, say, an addict and his or her supplying
pharmacist or physician. The sanctity of the state's police
powers would be maintained; the federal government would supply
only information. Reformers believed that the information,
however, could lead a responsible state agency to take only one
action, that is, to curb the supply of narcotics to those who did
not have a medical need for it-and &quot;mere&quot; addicts did
not fall into that category. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Foster Anti-Narcotic Bill (1910-1911)</b> </p>

<p>Republican Congressman David Foster of Vermont introduced
Wright's bill in April 1910. In addition to opium and cocaine, as
in the eventual Harrison Act, the bill was aimed at cannabis
(marijuana) and chloral hydrate, the same substances the Food and
Drug Act of 1906 required to be revealed on labels. It did not
allow small amounts of the drugs in mild remedies such as cough
syrup to be exempt from the stringent reporting requirements and
their severe penalties. Druggists feared the multitude of stamps
and labels at each stage; the fines, which would range from $500
to $5,000; and the one-to-five-year jail sentences. The word
&quot;knowingly&quot; did not qualify the prohibited actions,
making it likely that simple errors without any intention to
deceive would result in horrendous punishments. Although support
for the bill could be found, the individuals in the drug trade
would not endorse the detailed and hazardous provisions of the
Foster Bill. It never came to a vote in the Sixty-first Congress,
which ended in March 1911.30 </p>

<p>The next Congress was marked by a significant change: For the
first time in almost two decades, the Democrats gained control of
the House of Representatives. The South now had achieved new
importance, in that committee chairmanships changed hands. In the
Sixty-second Congress the Foster Bill became the Harrison Bill,
named after Francis Burton Harrison, a New York City Democrat who
served on the Foreign Relations Committee. Dr. Wright continued
his difficult task of trying to obtain the most stringent bill
consistent with winning essential political support from the
medical and pharmaceutical interests and now from the Democratic
Party. In order to mitigate the severity of the original Foster
Bill, the drug trades established the National Drug Trade
Conference, which would represent the major trade associations
and try to reach a compromise position on the complex
antinarcotic bill. The NDTC, which first met in Washington, D.C.,
in January 1913, provided the most powerful influence on the
writing of what would become known as the Harrison Act.&quot; </p>

<p>The attitude of the newly influential southern Democrats
toward any potential invasion of states' rights now had to be
taken more seriously. These politicians feared an interference
with the South's local laws, which enforced racial segregation
and Negro disenfranchisement. They remembered the era of
&quot;reconstruction,&quot; when the North ruled the South
following 1865, and wanted to maintain the authority the white
citizenry had subsequently won with the withdrawal of troops and
&quot;carpetbaggers.&quot; The narcotic control proposals
threatened to intrude federal authority into the states,
affecting local pharmacists and physicians and threatening to
reach right into a neighborhood and send an individual to federal
prison. Furthermore, this example of using the federal tax power
primarily to achieve a moral end-for the taxes were not intended
to bring in a significant revenue but rather to force disclosure
and compliance with rules of narcotics distribution-could be a
precedent for other concerns brewing in the United States, such
as protecting Negro voting rights in the South. </p>

<p>Dr. Wright, therefore, faced a new set of attitudes in the
Democratic-controlled House. He reacted by stressing the impact
of narcotics, especially cocaine, on Negroes. He attributed
attacks on whites to the crazed Negro cocaine fiend. He also
argued that many poor Negroes would not have the energy or
knowledge to send away for the cocaine, so the conclusion must be
that northern businessmen who did not care about the South's
concerns were shipping-via interstate commerce-cocaine to
Negroes. Further, unscrupulous or ignorant employers were said to
be supplying cocaine to their Negro workers .32 </p>

<p>One further concern about the precedent the antinarcotic law
would provide related to the flourishing prohibition movement. As
prohibition was achieved in state after state, the loophole for
at least the upper and middle classes was that alcohol could be
ordered across state lines and shipped into a dry state, for
interstate commerce was regulated by the federal government,
which so far was not teetotal. The Webb-Kenyon Act of 1913,
however, was passed to close this loophole, survived President
Taft's veto, and, much to the surprise of many, was declared
constitutional by the Supreme Court. This occurrence removed one
of the stumbling blocks to the Harrison Bill, for now a national
antinarcotic law could not serve as a precedent for curtailing
interstate commerce in a dangerous substance. </p>

<p>In the course of all this maneuvering, no one rallied to the
defense of any of the drugs named for control except that
occasionally cannabis was described by someone as not
habit-forming or not as serious as opium or cocaine. Perhaps
because the cannabis problem was not seen to be serious or
because the drug did not seem so dangerous, it was dropped from
the proposed law. Chloral hydrate, a sleeping medicine, was also
dropped. The attitude toward opium and cocaine, however, was
almost totally condemnatory. The only question was how to control
their distribution most efficiently, since they had medicinal
value but were also considered dangerously addicting. This was in
sharp contrast with alcohol; its use divided the nation, and huge
legitimate industries depended upon its continued consumption. </p>

<p>The government and the trades eventually reached agreement on
the proposed law by moderating the record-keeping provisions,
reducing penalties, and allowing the sale of patent medicines
with small amounts of narcotics in them. Representative Harrison
introduced it in June 1913, and it was passed quickly by the
House. In the Senate some amendments were offered, a few with an
apparent goal of destroying the bill's chances of passage. In
August of 1914, though, the Senate passed the bill, albeit with a
few modifications that were compromised in Conference Committee.
Finally, on December 17, 1914, President Wilson signed it into
law, to become effective March 1, 1915. At last the United States
had redeemed its pledge to other nations that it would enact a
stringent law, as it had urged every other nation to do. </p>

<p>The significance of the Harrison Act to strategists like Dr.
Wright, though, was more than just the satisfaction of redeeming
pledges made to questioning representatives of other nations. For
him, the Harrison Act was the implementation of the Hague
Convention of 1912, which called upon signatories to enact
domestic legislation controlling narcotics supplies and
distribution. Understood as the fulfillment of treaty
obligations, the Harrison Act would have the authority to usurp
the states' police powers, for the Constitution in Article Six
gives treaties concluded by the United States supremacy over the
laws of states. This would resolve the problem of states' rights
interfering with the ability of a national law to require a
uniform compliance with strict narcotics control .33 </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Supreme Court at first did not give a very
strict interpretation to the Harrison Act. In the first Jin Fuey
Moy case (1916), the Court declared by a six-to-two majority that
the Harrison Act could not be understood as having been required
by the Hague Convention and that physicians could prescribe as
they saw fit, even to simple addicts. 34 This decision was a
stunning blow to federal enforcement, which, from the first day
of the act's implementation, was directed at pharmacists and
physicians who sold prescriptions or treated addicts without any
intent to cure them. </p>

<p>World War 1, arriving at almost the same time as the Harrison
Act, profoundly affected American attitudes, creating an intense
desire to purify the nation as it girded itself to fight for
democracy against the barbarism of the Kaiser. The fall of Russia
and the spread of Bolshevism intensified fears of contagion and
the desire to be sure that the United States remained pure and
strong. Prohibition took giant strides during World War 1. The
Prohibition Amendment in an early form nearly passed the House in
December 1914, a week after the passage of the Harrison Act. In
1916 it did pass, and by January 1919 Prohibition had become part
of the Constitution as the Eighteenth Amendment. Earlier,
Congress had passed wartime prohibition, which was intended to
save grain for the war effort as well as to promote efficiency in
war production plants. Similarly, a battle was being fought to
overturn the Jin Fuey Moy decision, which had weakened the
government's intention for the Harrison Act. A Treasury
Department committee reported that the number of addicts in the
nation was over a million.&quot; These exaggerated figures, as
well as a fear about returning veterans having become addicted on
the battlefield and the specter of alcohol prohibition, which
might drive alcoholics to morphine and cocaine, led to a new
attempt to put teeth into the Harrison Act. This time the
government was successful. </p>

<p>In March 1919, two months after the ratification of the
Eighteenth Amendment (which would go into effect a year later),
the Supreme Court ingeniously decided, five to four, that to call
a prescription for narcotics intended to supply a
&quot;mere&quot; addict with maintenance doses was an error, for
such a script could not be considered a true prescription given
in the proper conduct of medical practice. Since it was not a
prescription, the issuing physician had conveyed narcotics
without the required tax; he had therefore violated the Harrison
Act and could be arrested. The four dissenting justices were the
conservatives, who argued that this was an invasion of states'
police powers, while the majority, including Holmes and Brandeis,
felt that more power had to be given the government if it was to
carry out its duty to protect the public from such an insidious
evil .36 At last, the intent of the reformers had been achieved:
Simple maintenance was outlawed, and the federal government could
take action nationwide to arrest and convict health professionals
who practiced it. Narcotics now had a no-maintenance policy,
which a few months later would also be the policy for alcohol.
Enforcement of both prohibitions would be the responsibility of a
unit in the Bureau of Internal Revenue, reflecting the similarity
of the two conceptions. </p>

<p><b>Enforcement During the 1920s</b> </p>

<p>Several additional laws completed the early legislative
structure of American control of opium and cocaine. Some were
minor, such as a stipulation that no finished products such as
heroin or morphine could be imported into the United States.37
The law stated that only coca leaves and crude opium could be
imported and that the finished products, cocaine, morphine,
heroin, codeine, etc., were to be manufactured in American
pharmaceutical factories, which were given a monopoly to produce
these substances. This may have made up for revenues lost, as the
amounts sold legally in the United States fell after the Harrison
Act. Other laws dealt with transshipment of drugs 38 across the
United States for foreign markets. </p>

<p><b>Heroin</b> </p>

<p>Perhaps the most important addition to the Harrison Act's
control of opiates and cocaine came in 1924, when the United
States banned the importation of opium to be used for the
manufacture of heroin.39 The observance of federal-state
boundaries is evident in this law, for it does not ban the
manufacture of heroin altogether but only the importation of
crude opium for that purpose. Just that much seemed to be within
the power of the federal government. Also, this did not require
the seizure of heroin legally available in the United States for
cough medicines (the original claim for heroin's value) or for
certain other purposes, chiefly pain control or &quot;twilight
sleep&quot; during child birth. </p>

<p>Heroin had been made available commercially by the Bayer
Company of Germany in 1898 as a superior cough suppressant.40 The
Bayer Company believed that the addition of acetyl groups to the
basic molecule would make morphine more palatable, and this
product, diacetylmorphine, the company named Heroin, a trademark
that was protected until Germany lost such protections as a
result of losing the First World War. Similarly, by adding an
acetyl group to salicylic acid to make it less irritating to the
stomach when taken for joint pains, the Bayer Company launched
another successful venture. In 1899 the company named sodium
acetyl salicylic acid Aspirin, which similarly was protected by
trademark until World War 1. Few pharmaceutical firms can take
credit for naming and distributing two drugs that remain among
the most popular in Western society even after nearly a hundred
years. </p>

<p>Heroin essentially had been unrestricted in the United States
prior to the Harrison Act, and by 1912 in New York City it had
replaced morphine as the drug of recreational choice among
youthful males, according to the records of Bellevue Hospital.
The addictive nature of heroin had been recognized rather
quickly, for the AMA issued a warning in 1902. Heroin was popular
because it could be inhaled by sniffing, like cocaine, as well as
injected by needle. When injected into the bloodstream, heroin
crossed the blood-brain barrier more quickly than morphine and
therefore gave a more intense, but briefer, &quot;high.&quot;
During the years of intense concern over social control, which
began with the First World War, heroin became linked with male
gang violence and the commission of crimes. Some believed that
heroin stimulated the user to commit crimes or at least provided
the courage to pull off a bank robbery or mugging. In the early
1920s most of the crime in New York City was blamed on drug use,
chiefly the opiates, including heroin.41 </p>

<p>The preference for heroin over morphine by recreational users,
and the belief that other opiates could fulfill heroin's role as
a painkiller and cough suppressant, led to a move to ban heroin
for medical purposes. The heroin problem also contributed to
American fear of foreign nations after World War 1, for the drug
was being manufactured in other countries and then smuggled into
the United States. The Swiss drug industries, for example,
produced large amounts of heroin, which found its way into this
country. Heroin's image as a foreign product popular with feared
domestic groups helped support an isolationist stance,
illustrated by the American refusal to join or even recognize the
League of Nations. Influential congressmen, such as Stephen G.
Porter, Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign
Relations, urged that all heroin production in the United States
be stopped. As an example he would try to get other nations 42 to
follow at the Geneva Opium Conferences of 1924 and 1925. </p>

<p>The United States did enact the legislation sought by
Congressman Porter, but it failed to achieve its goals at the
meetings in Geneva. In fact, in disgust at the refusal of other
nations to agree to curb production of poppies and coca bushes,
the ultimate source of heroin 43 and cocaine, the United States
walked out of the conference. The United States, which had
founded the world antinarcotic movement in Shanghai and The
Hague, now saw it taken over by the League of Nations (as the
Versailles treaty had mandated) and controlled by the very
nations the United States sought to shame or force into a
narcotics policy that the United States viewed as responsible.
American participation in the worldwide effort then fell to a low
point until the 1930s, when participation was resumed in
international meetings. By the outbreak of World War II, the
United States was again achieving significant participation in
international antidrug activities. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>AMERICAN DOMESTIC CONTROL TO THE MARIJUANA TAX ACT OF 1937</b>
</p>

<p>The use of cocaine, which had been in &quot;soft&quot; drinks
like Coca-Cola until 1903 and was available easily to sniff as a
treatment for sinusitis or hay fever, fell precipitously after
reaching a peak somewhere around 1905. By the 1930s cocaine use
had receded, and during the 1950s physicians and narcotics agents
alike described cocaine use as a problem that once was serious in
the United States but now was practically absent. Several reasons
for its reduced use can be suggested. The drug had been
introduced as a wonder substance-Freud had called it the first
medicine that worked as an antidepressant. The Parke-Davis
Company manufactured it after 1885 in many forms for drinking,
smoking, inhaling, or rubbing on the skin. Within about a decade,
warnings surfaced. Consumption peaked about twenty years after
its initial distribution, and around the same time the accounts
of its effect on the lives of its users and its popularly
believed-although questionable-special link with southern blacks
created in the public's mind an image so fearful that cocaine's
effects became the extreme against which other drugs would be
compared. Cocaine's association with violence, paranoia, and
collapsed careers made laws against it by 1910 a popular matter.
The first strict antinarcotic law in New York State was passed in
1913 and was directed at cocaine. Al Smith, later to be an
anti-Prohibition candidate for president and critic of
Prohibition in his state while he was governor, drew the strict
anticocaine measure in his early years as a state assemblyman.44
The combination of strict laws and intense public support of
control measures brought on a reduction in consumption, which, at
the peak of its popularity, must have seemed most unlikely if not
impossible. </p>

<p>The effect of the Harrison Act, its court interpretations, and
supplementary legislation also appear to have reduced greatly the
number of opiate addicts. The medical and pharmacy professions
were denied an easy way of providing drugs. Although it is clear
that only a fraction of either profession was liberal in their
provision, this nevertheless had been enough to maintain a large
number of users. It had been argued recently that the
recreational users began to stand out more prominently, as the
medically addicted and more sedate group declined in numbers, and
that the relatively small number of addicts in the United States,
about 50,000 in 1940, would have had an &quot;underworld&quot; or
unsavory character even without the Harrison 45 Act's
criminalization of drug use. This point of view contrasts sharply
with the argument that the Harrison Act changed citizens who were
normal except for their addiction into criminals who had 46 to
violate the law to obtain their daily supply of opiates. Whatever
the reason, the number of those addicted fell from about a
quarter million around 1900 to much less than half that number by
World War II. The war effectively reduced supplies of narcotics
to the United States, and in 1945 the United States probably had
its lowest number of opiate addicts since the mid-nineteenth
century. The rise of addiction after World War 11 may have built
on the core of addicts left in the nation, but the dynamics of
the addiction epidemic that began in the 1960s appear in certain
respects to have had a different character. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>NARCOTIC CLINICS, 1913-1925</b> </p>

<p>In order to close the story of the decline in addiction after
1900, it is necessary to consider the legendary narcotic clinics
that, like the Philippine opium dispensaries, were intended to
deal with addicts who no longer could receive opiate or cocaine
supplies from local physicians .47 The first in the United States
was opened in 1912 by Charles Terry, the public health officer of
Jacksonville, Florida, where he provided both opiates and cocaine
to men and women, blacks and whites. Dr. Terry went on to become
a student of the opium problem in the United States and compiled
a classic book of reports, excerpts from articles, and
statistical information in <a
href="../Library/studies/op/opmenu.htm">The Opium Problem</a>,
published in 1928 and co-authored by Mildred Pellens. </p>

<p>Other clinics followed, particularly after the Treasury
Department, in enforcement of the Harrison Act, prosecuted or
threatened with prosecution health professionals who supplied
addicts indefinitely. A series of clinics in New England were
established at the suggestion of officials of the Internal
Revenue Bureau. In New York State, the crackdown on druggists and
physicians emanated from state law, and clinics were established
in upper New York State through state planning and authorization.
Registration of addicts was permitted so that physicians would
restrict maintenance to those already addicted. </p>

<p>In New York City, the Health Department did not wish to
provide opiates, morphine, and heroin on an indefinite basis but
did open a clinic at the city Health Department headquarters.
This clinic provided heroin, but only as an inducement to
registration and eventual detoxification and rehabilitation.
About 7,500 addicts registered, received their drug of choice in
dosages gradually decreased until uncomfortably small, usually
three to eight grains of morphine daily, and were offered
curative treatment. Most declined to be cured. Those who did
receive treatment, at North Brother Island, seemed both
unappreciative and very liable-the estimate was 95 percent - to
return to narcotics available on the street or from a physician
or druggist. </p>

<p>The Treasury Department, armed with fresh Supreme Court
decisions of March 1919, started to close down the clinics, along
with prosecuting the dispensing physicians and druggists. One
argument was that the availability of easy maintenance inhibited
cures and also that giving legal permission for maintenance
clinics undercut the Treasury Department's position when it
brought action against a professional for reckless provision of
drugs. From a legal point of view, the &quot;reckless&quot;
provider was obeying the tax laws, as was the clinic, unless the
federal government wanted to get into the question of medical
competence, which was a state, not a federal, concern. </p>

<p>Gradually the clinics were closed, the last one in 1925 in
Knoxville, Tennessee. Some had been operated poorly, others quite
responsibly with community support. Yet, because of the
intricacies of the tax powers under which the federal law
operated, all were closed, even if unfair harassment was
necessary to discourage the operation. The number of registrants
was not large, about 3,000 if we exclude the New York City
clinic, which was not intended for maintenance but for bait to
get addicts into detoxification. The number of addicts registered
under the New York State law, which provided for maintenance not
only in clinics but also from private physicians and pharmacists,
eventually totaled about 13,000 in 1920. It can be assumed,
therefore, that the clinics were not a major element in the
maintenance of addiction in the United States. One side note: The
13,000 addicted registrants in New York State in 1920 add up to
the largest number of legally supplied addicts recorded in any
Western country this century, a number not approached yet by
Britain under the socalled &quot;British System.&quot; Although
the &quot;American System&quot; preceded and surpassed in size
any scheme attempted then or subsequently in Britain, it was in
fact the large number of addicts in America that made maintenance
so unwieldy and unpopular. </p>

<p>The demise of the clinics left drug peddlers and individual
members of the health professions as the major targets of the
federal government. Generally, the physicians did not wish to
treat addicts, nor did they have any sympathy with addicts. Those
physicians who, for whatever reason, did continue to treat
addicts with maintenance doses were threatened and arrested,
unless the maintenance had been approved by the local narcotic
agent. Some maintenance was permitted, but only on a case-by-case
evaluation. From reports prepared by agents upon investigating
narcotic clinics, it appears that an acceptable life-style was a
requirement for permission to be maintained.48 </p>

<p>A theory had been advocated, mostly among maintaining
physicians in New York City, that longstanding addiction changed
the body's physiology in such a way that opiates were necessary
for the patient to remain normal.49 Too little opiate and the
patient would experience withdrawal, too much and the patient
would be &quot;high,&quot; but just the right amount would allow
normal feelings and behavior. </p>

<p>This, of course, is close to the argument made in the 1950s by
Drs. Dole and Nyswander to justify methadone maintenance. After a
series of scientific studies shortly after World War 1, the
government concluded otherwise .50 Those physicians who insisted
on maintaining patients without approval from a narcotics agent
ran a serious risk of arrest and, if convicted, loss of a medical
license and time in a federal penitentiary. In spite of the
danger, of course, some physicians supplied narcotics without
restraint or with very poor judgment, but evidence shows that
other, responsible physicians were entrapped without good reason
in order to boost the number of an agent's arrests and thereby
bolster his chances for promotion.51 An aura of fear, therefore,
accompanied a physician's decision to give an opiate to a
patient, especially a new patient. On the other hand, the
casualness with which physicians once handed out morphine or some
other opiate was reduced considerably. </p>

<p>Along with the rejection of maintenance, physicians
unfortunately had no effective medical cure available for
addiction. Several had been promoted in many forms in the
nineteenth and early twentieth century, but each had been found
to have no scientific merit .52 The problem devolved into a
decision of whether to stop opiates abruptly and thereby cause
the patient to go directly into full Withdrawalthe so-called
&quot;cold turkey&quot; approach-or gradually to reduce the
opiate over a few days or a few weeks. Because the addicted
person frequently has a threshold of average daily consumption
below which the user becomes acutely uncomfortable, and because a
yearning for heroin or morphine often persists for months or
years after the beginning of withdrawal, the decision to detoxify
abruptly or gradually usually was a difficult path for the
patient. Nevertheless, detoxification was the preferred route for
legal reasons. Two ancient warnings about detoxification, that
the patient would die in withdrawal, or that a supply cutoff
would precipitate a rash of suicides, did not materialize. </p>

<p>During the 1920s and 1930s the number of addicts diminished in
the United States. Grossly exaggerated estimates came from
antidrug entrepreneurs like Captain Richmond Pearson Hobson, who
had been a Prohibition advocate before unleashing his energies
against heroin and later marijuana as the head of several
national and international voluntary groups.&quot; Captain Hobson
attacked heroin in a most melodramatic manner, claiming there
were 4 million addicts in the United States and comparing them
all to lepers. In spite of Hobson, the concern over opiate
addicts and cocaine users declined during the two decades after
World War I. </p>

<hr>

<p><a href="../hemp/taxact/taxact.htm"><b>MARIJUANA TAX ACT OF
1937</b></a> </p>

<p>With the battle against opiate addiction apparently at a more
stable, less alarming level in the 1930s and the use of cocaine
having declined dramatically, a new dangerous drug appeared on
the American horizon: marijuana. Marijuana smoking arrived in the
United States with Mexican farm workers who had crossed the
border, mostly to labor in agricultural fields in the Southwest
and in sugar beet fields as far north as Montana and Michigan.
During the prosperous 1920s, about half-a-million farm workers
came to the United States, but as the Depression's widespread
unemployment laid an increasingly heavy burden on the country's
citizens, the Mexicans became an unwelcome group, encouraged in
all ways to return to Mexico. Entwined with the troubles they
were said to cause local citizens was the Mexicans' custom of
growing marijuana for their own use. Hence, marijuana was linked
to violence, dissolute living, and Mexican aliens.53 </p>

<p>The greatest fear of marijuana in the United States lay in the
West and Southwest. The government was importuned to take action,
but the recent experience with alcohol prohibition (which had
ended in 1933) made the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) and its
head, Harry J. Anslinger, formerly of the Prohibition Bureau,
hesitant to get involved in a drug that grew domestically and
prolifically. Cocaine and heroin were both foreign imports and
therefore, at least theoretically, could be regulated more
easily, but marijuana appeared to be almost impossible to curb,
let alone eradicate. The FBN tried to address this drug by
including it in a recommended uniform state narcotic law that
would leave to localities the question of prosecution and
allocation of enforcement resources. Then a curious law intended
to reduce the number of machine guns provided the federal
government with a mechanism to attack marijuana nationally and at
the federal level. </p>

<p>The Firearms Act of 1934 decreed that a machine gun could not
be transferred in any way without the payment of a transfer tax
(from which law enforcement personnel were exempted). As odd as
this mechanism may sound, the law was upheld by the Supreme Court
in 1937 as a legitimate use of the power of taxation for a moral
objective. Within weeks of this decision, the Treasury
Department, which housed the FBN, appeared before Congress asking
for a transfer tax for marijuana. Without a stamp permit and the
proper tax stamps, marijuana could not be sold, bartered, or
given away. Congress quickly approved the bill, and President
Franklin Roosevelt signed it into law later in 1937.
Unfortunately for the enforcement of this law, the FBN did not
receive any more money or agents. Therefore, the FBN relied on
obnoxious descriptions of marijuana to do the job. The substance
was described to the public as a danger at least equal to cocaine
or morphine, and the penalties for its illegal use or possession
were severe. Because use of marijuana does not seem to have been
great in the 1930s, the law's extraordinary severity did not
concern the general public until the 1960s, when thousands of
users were arrested as marijuana's popularity burgeoned.
Furthermore, the contrast between the effects of marijuana
observed in the 1960s and the longstanding claims of the FBN
regarding marijuana led to a problem concerning the credibility
of official statements, which still affects popular perceptions. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>WORLD WAR II TO THE PRESENT</b> </p>

<p>The Second World War ended with relatively few opiate addicts
and very little use of cocaine or marijuana in the United States.
The only closely controlled drug rising in use was alcohol,
consumption of which had increased in per capita rates since the
repeal of Prohibition. During all this period, sleeping pills and
other barbiturates were prescribed widely but did not appear to
be a similar problem. The same holds true for the amphetamines,
which had been made available in the 1930s and continued to be
manufactured and prescribed without restriction. </p>

<p>Treatment of hard-core addicts did take place at the two
federal narcotics hospitals in Lexington, Kentucky, and Fort
Worth, Texas. Each was, in fact, a prison in which addicts were
treated and forced to detoxify, but the patients/prisoners
frequently resumed their drug habits when they returned to their
previous environments. Around 1950 a younger age group began to
be admitted for heroin addiction, an abuse that reached a very
high level in 1970 and remains high today. This threat elicited
two responses. First, the federal government enacted more severe
laws that levied mandatory sentences for conviction of dealing in
narcotics. The laws, enacted in 1951 and 1956, are the peak of
legal penalties against narcotics, including marijuana, in the
United States.55 </p>

<p>The second response reflected the domestic and international
tensions of the time. The heroin menace-and it should be
reemphasized that cocaine and marijuana were not seen as anything
but potentially major problems in the 1950s-was ascribed to the
infiltration of the drug trade by Chinese Communists who had
taken over the China mainland in 1949. The Red Chinese
purportedly sent heroin to the United States to undermine our
democracy and at the 56 same time obtain specie, for which they
had a desperate need. By the 1970s, however, the United States
was defending the People's Republic of China against the same
charge, now levied by Soviet newspapers.57 Such are the vagaries
of international relations and the domestic drug problem. </p>

<p>Heroin addicts in the 1950s mainly were young males
concentrated in black and Hispanic urban ghettos. These addicts
concerned the federal government, as well as reform-minded
lawyers, academics, and physicians. The latter groups found the
harsh penalties and the loathing attitude toward the addicts to
be inhumane. Leaders of this countermovement included sociologist
Professor Alfred Lindesmith and the attorney Rufus King. They
believed a more relaxed approach would be much more successful,
as well as more kind. Rather than depriving addicts of heroin,
heroin should be provided them. Rather than jailing addicts, they
should be hospitalized, if necessary, or just left alone.58</p>

<p>This alternative view competed with the more hard-line style
of law enforcement exemplified by Commissioner Anslinger. After
forty or more years, treating addicts medically, which had been
popular before World War I and had then been found inadequate to
the task of reducing addiction, became part of public policy in
the 1960s. Methadone, a synthetic opiate developed in Germany in
World War 11, was used by Dole and Nyswander to provide
maintenance under theories similar to those which had justified
maintenance prior to the restrictive Supreme Court decisions in
1919. This marked a major break in American narcotic control
policies; maintenance again was legal, although not with heroin
or morphine. </p>

<p>Along with the possibility of maintenance, other milder forms
of control were invoked by the federal government. Civil
commitment to a narcotic treatment center,, thought more humane
than prison sentences, became possible legally in 1966, although
in subsequent years this did not prove a practical method either
to reduce addiction or to cure addicts in any marked number.59 </p>

<p>Also in the 1960s, an enthusiasm for drug consumption of all
kinds, polydrug abuse, replaced the habitual use of one or two
drugs, which had been more common in the past. Marijuana became
very popular with young people, and then gradually its popularity
expanded in both directions to even younger and to older ages.
Psychedelic drugs, such as LSD, appeared on the scene, along with
injectable methedrine or &quot;speed.&quot; Drugs came to
symbolize opposition to the government and older mores. The
turmoil and dissension caused by the Vietnam War added to the
sense of alienation many young people already felt from the older
generation, which frowned on drug use other than alcohol and
tobacco. In addition to cultural alienation and the rapid
increase in multidrug use, the drug problem in the 1960s was
intensified by the extraordinarily large number of young people
in the ages most likely to experiment with drugs; the post-World
War 11 &quot;baby boom&quot; generation had reached the teenage
years. </p>

<p>By 1970, marijuana was used commonly, and research was showing
that it did not have the awful effects ascribed to it from the
1930s onward. Various groups and individuals initiated movements
to legalize the substance, perhaps along the lines of tobacco.
The drug situation was perceived by the public and the federal
government to be so bad and yet so difficult to control that this
seemed a good time to reevaluate the nation's entire policy. A
National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse was established
in 1971. </p>

<p>In general, the members of the commission reflected
traditional views on the subject of drug control, and therefore
it was with even greater impact that the commission recommended
in its first report, &quot;Marijuana: A Signal of
Misunderstanding,&quot; that the substance be
&quot;decriminalized.&quot; By decriminalization was not meant
legalization but a step short of that position: Marijuana
possession for individual use no longer would be a crime, but its
sale and distribution would be against the law. The purpose of
control at this stage would be to relieve law enforcement
agencies of the nuisance of arresting individual users and
thereby allow more resources to be concentrated on investigating
large-scale crime and more dangerous drugs.6o The notion of
&quot;decriminalization&quot; proved difficult for all to
understand. Some foreign nations considered it to mean
legalization. President Nixon refused to receive the report in
public or to comment on it except to affirm that marijuana was
not going to be legalized if he had anything to say about it. </p>

<p>The second and final report, published in 1973, dealt with
drugs more broadly.60 It attempted to draw attention to the
actual, measurable damage done by drugs, reflected in hospital
admissions and drug-related deaths, as opposed to the myths that
had evolved around many of them. Heroin, for example, was
misperceived as causing more deaths annually than barbiturates.
This approach intended to make more rational the discussion over
drug policy, but it also laid the groundwork for the inclusion of
cigarettes and alcohol in the antidrug crusade. It de-emphasized,
however, the effects a drug such as cocaine has on judgment and
efficiency, the less quantifiable but still real aspects of drug
use. </p>

<p>The enforcement of laws against individual possession or use
of marijuana has fallen in the United States to a very low level.
Moreover, dealers in relatively small amounts are reportedly not
prosecuted either, because the largest dealers and smugglers, who
are involved with tons, not ounces or pounds of marijuana,
require all the time of officials. There has been a de facto
decriminalization throughout large parts of the country, even if
laws against individual use remain on the books. Possession of
marijuana in some states is a small-scale misdemeanor, and the
penalty is a ticket, like a parking violation. Yet, the frequency
of marijuana use by high school seniors has been dropping since
1978, and this reduction, coupled with a more conservative
national mood, has slowed further moves toward formal federal
decriminalization or more liberality in the drug laws. </p>

<p>The rise in cocaine's availability and popularity, for the
second time this century, has further complicated the control of
drugs in the United States. The fact that first millions should
use marijuana, then millions more take cocaine raises questions
about the ability of local and national governments to control
narcotics. The corruption that follows the drug traffic and the
restraints on resources that may be allocated to drug control
combine to leave a sense of frustration with enforcement policy.
What will be the result of these trends? It all remains
uncertain. We appear to be in an era of widespread drug use that
would seem to make reasonable the revocation of antidrug
statutes. We should recall, however, that a similar condition
prevailed around 1900, shortly before an onslaught against drug
use led to a substantial reduction in the use of opiates, heroin,
cocaine, and alcohol. That such a national response could occur
must make us pause before offering predictions for the future. </p>

use of opiates to prevent painful and uncomfortable bodily and
psychic symptoms that would occur if the drug's use were abruptly
stopped. Estimates of the number of addicts in the United States
have often been susceptible to ideological and political
influences. After carefully considering contemporary surveys,
importation statistics, and other estimates, and subjecting his
findings to modern statistical analysis, Professor Courtwright
concluded that the highest rate of addiction in the United States
occurred in the 1890s at the maximum rate of 4.59 per 1,000.
Today that rate would result in 1. I million addicts, about twice
the current official estimate. </p>

travels or on a military expedition his halting-places were
always distinguished by a terrible rise in executions. Even on
the battlefield he was fond of surprising men in the act of
smoking, when he would punish them by beheading, hanging,
quartering or crushing their hands and feed. . . . Nevertheless,
in spite of all the horrors and persecution. . . the passion for
smoking still persisted.&quot; [Edward M. Brecher et al., *Licit

<p> <b>1736</b> The Gin Act (England) is enacted with the avowed
object of making spirits &quot;come so dear to the consumer that
the poor will not be able to launch into excessive use of
them.&quot; This effort results in general lawbreaking and fails
to halt the steady rise in the consumption of even legally
produced and sold liquor. [Ibid., p. 15] </p>

<p> <b>1745</b> The magistrates of one London division demanded
that &quot;publicans and wine-merchants should swear that they
anathematized the doctrine of Transubstantiation.&quot; [Ibid.,
p. 14] </p>

<p> <b>1762</b> Thomas Dover, and English physician, introduces
his prescription for a diaphoretic powder,&quot; which he
recommends mainly for the treatment of gout. Soon named
&quot;Dover's powder,&quot; this compound becomes the most widely
used opium preparation during the next 150 years. </p>

<p> <b>1785</b> Benjamin Rush publishes his *Inquiry into the
Effects of Ardent Spirits on the Human Body and Mind*; in it, he
calls the intemperate use of distilled spirits a
&quot;disease,&quot; and estimates the annual rate of death due
to alcoholism in the United States as &quot;not less than 4000
people&quot; in a population then of less than 6 million. [Quoted

shall be effective to restrain their intemperate use in the
country.&quot; [Quoted in ibid.] </p>

<p> <b>1792</b> The first prohibitory laws against opium in China

shops is strangulation. </p>

<p> <b>1792</b> The Whisky Rebellion, a protest by farmers in
western Pennsylvania against a federal tax on liquor, breaks out
and is put down by overwhelming force sent to the area by George
Washington. Samuel Taylor Coleridge writes &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;
while under the influence of opium. </p>

<p> <b>1800</b> Napoleon's army, returning from Egypt, introduces
cannibis (hashish, marijuana) into France. Avante-garde artists

<h2>William Bennett</h2>

<p> When William Bennett moved across town from the Department of
Education to be &quot;czar&quot; at the Office of National Drug
Control Policy, he brought his people with him. All white, all
male, none with law enforcement or social-service experience,
some had been with Bennett the entire eight years since his debut
at the National Endowment for the Humanities. </p>

<p> Bennett's men held themselves above the mere budget-cutters,
tax-slashers, regulation-busters, and states-rightsers that
comprised the broader executive branch. John Walters, Bennett's
chief of staff at Education and author of the punitive Schools
Without Drugs, had been to meetings of Ed Meese's Drug Policy
Board and had been appalled at their inanity. Everybody was so
busy jockeying for position that nobody ever ventured an honest
opinion or original idea. Bennett's office, on the other hand,
prided itself on being one continuous philosophy forum, with
great questions of political theory and national purpose the
stuff of daily conversation. Envisioning themselves a kind of
ideological Bennettista cavalry to the Republican infantry,
Bennett's crew saw their mission at the drug office as
fundamentally identical to that at Education or the Endowment: To
reform America's character, by force if necessary. </p>

<p> It would have been okay with them to be assigned teen
pregnancy, abortion, welfare -- any platform from which to
harangue the public about values and exact punishment for
transgression. &quot;Drugs are the hill we're fighting over at
the moment, but the war is much bigger than that,&quot; Bruce
Carnes, Bennett's budget director, would say. &quot;Our fight is
any issue that has a shade on character.&quot; </p>

<p> The &quot;hill&quot; they'd just been given to fight over,
though, wasn't just any piece of political turf, but was the
hottest hot-button issue of the decade. More than half the
country believed drugs to be the America's worst problem.
Majorities favored mandatory drug tests for all citizens,
warrantless police searches of suspected dealers' homes, and
roadblocks to search cars randomly. This wasn't mere naked
paintings or politically correct social studies textbooks. This
was a chance to preach and kick ass on the nation's brightly lit
center stage. </p>

<p> Even before Bennett's Senate confirmation, his men began
plotting their course. The same 1988 law that created the drug
czar's office also required it to produce a drug-control strategy
by September, and there was no time to waste. Bennett himself
wasn't around much. He'd checked himself into a $700-a-week
therapeutic resort to kick his two-pack-a-day cigarette habit. </p>

<p> But in the lofty and freewheeling style to which they'd
become accustomed, Bennett's core group of advisors began laying
out the assumptions on which national drug policy would hereafter
be based. </p>

<p> At this point, the United States had been fighting its War on
Drugs for twenty years. Despite the billions spent, the millions
imprisoned, and the loss of liberties to both drug user and
non-user alike, drugs were cheaper, more potent, and used by
younger children than when Nixon started the War. The drug
cartels were wealthier and more sophisticated than ever. The
number of cocaine dependents had grown. Drug violence, unheard of
at the start of the Drug War, now terrorized poor neighborhoods.
Drug combatants died daily; just the number of slain innocent
bystanders had tripled in the two years prior to Bush's
inauguration. Rather than evaluate the efficacy of the War on
Drugs and the wisdom of pursuing it, Bennett and his men merely
shuffled the deck one more time. </p>

<p> Under Nixon, heroin was the big bad drug. Halfway through
Carter's reign, marijuana nudged it aside. As the public's
passion to fight marijuana waned, cocaine was thrust forward to
draw fire. Then crack. The Drug War front shifted endlessly too,
from the border to the streets to Bolivia to the money-laundering
banks to the suburbs and back to the border again. </p>

<p> Now it was the Bennettistas' turn, and they achieved the most
radical recasting of the country's &quot;drug problem&quot; yet:
Drugs would no longer be discussed as a health problem. </p>

<p> The physical dangers of illegal drugs had always been the
Drug War's causa belli. Even the &quot;zero tolerance&quot;
policy of the late Reagan years was couched in the rhetoric of
&quot;instantaneous addiction&quot; and &quot;the poisoning of
our children&quot;: health terminology. </p>

<p> That had to stop. Because if the drug issue was going to
serve the Bennettistas' decade-long crusade to police the
nation's character, drug abuse needed to be placed in the same
category as offensive art, multicultural teaching, and ethical
relativism: a matter of morality. </p>

<p> &quot;The simple fact is that drug use is wrong,&quot;
Bennett decreed. &quot;And the moral argument, in the end, is the
most compelling argument.&quot; Terence Pell, Bennett's personal
lawyer from Education and now the drug office's chief counsel,
put it this way: &quot;We have to believe. If you think drugs are
bad, that they make people bad neighbors, horrible parents,
dangerous drivers and what have you, then you think drugs are
bad. There's a moral dimension.&quot; </p>

<p> If drugs are a health problem then addicts are
&quot;sick,&quot; and that cast them in a sympathetic light the
Bennettistas felt addicts didn't deserve. The decision to take
drugs that first time, after all, is voluntary. Walters directly
attacked the old approach. &quot;The health people say 'no
stigma,'&quot; he would say, &quot;and I'm for stigma.&quot; </p>

<p> The medical model of drug abuse was to Bennett's men a
philosophic and practical morass. If you base prohibition on
drugs' health effects, what do you say to the millions of
occasional users who convincingly claim to be uninjured by the
drugs they took? If you acknowledge that heavy drug users are
sick, you create an expectation that the government will treat
them. </p>

<p> The biggest problem with basing a prohibitive drug policy on
the health risks, though, was the invitation to comparisons. The
year the chain-smoking Bennett became drug czar, tobacco killed
some 395,000 Americans -- more than died in both world wars.
Alcohol directly killed 23,000 and another 22,400 on the
highways. The Natural Resources Defense Council in March
published a report, widely praised by medical authorities,
estimating that as many as 5,500 Americans would develop cancer
from the pesticides they ate during their preschool years. The
incidence of breast cancer in American women had more than
doubled since World War II, owing largely to dioxin and other
pollutants. Cocaine, on the other hand, killed 3,308 people that
year, slightly less than died from anterior horn cell disease.
Heroin and other opiates killed 2,743. And no death from
marijuana has ever been recorded. </p>

<p> Drugs damage without killing, of course, but even here other
preventable health problems put illegal drugs in deep shade. The
General Accounting Office, Congress's non-partisan investigative
agency, estimated that some 350,000 people were using cocaine
daily in 1989. While that's a big number, 15 times that many
children were going to bed hungry at least once a month that
year, 50 times that many Americans were sleeping on the streets,
and 100 times that many had no health insurance. </p>

<p> Discussing drugs as a moral problem obviated such
comparisons. If the case could be made that drug use is simply
wrong, then it wouldn't matter that some people use drugs safely,
that alcohol and tobacco kill more people than reefer and smack,
that more American than European children know hunger. </p>

<p> The Bennettistas worked hard to address the inconsistencies
of their approach. Their most glaring problem was the new drug
czar himself. By any medical definition, Bennett was a drug
addict, so dependent on nicotine after giving up the drug in its
smokable form that he now carried everywhere a pack of nicotine
chewing gum and was up to 40 milligrams of nicotine a day --
about as much as in two packs of cigarettes. </p>

<p> Alcohol was another problem. Bennett's drug office had no
Congressional mandate to address it, his mainstream constituency
enjoyed it, and the alcohol industry's mulitmillion-dollar lobby
wouldn't stand for further restrictions on booze. So the drug
office needed somehow to place alcohol on the &quot;moral&quot;
side of the line. No small trick. Aside from the cirrhosis and
highway deaths, booze was implicated in violent crime to a much
greater degree than any illegal drug. The Justice Department
found that half of those convicted of homicide in 1989 were using
alcohol at the time of the killing, while fewer than six percent
said they were on drugs alone. </p>

<p> Bennett's men tiptoed through the minefield of alcohol and
tobacco. John Walters took the position that marijuana, cocaine,
and heroin, &quot;enslave people&quot; and &quot;prevent them
from being free citizens&quot; in a way that alcohol and tobacco
do not. Bruce Carnes decided that drug taking was
&quot;life-denying,&quot; and &quot;inward,&quot; but that
alcohol and tobacco were not. Illegal drugs, Bennett said in a
speech that May, &quot;obliterate morals, value, character, our
relations with each other and our relation to God.&quot; None of
these conclusions was based on science, but collectively they had
the effect of royal fiat. </p>

<p> The Bennettistas also relied on a neat bit of tautology:
marijuana, heroin, and cocaine are immoral because they are
illegal. Why are they illegal? Because they are immoral.
Compliance, not health, was the real issue. &quot;Now that the
government has spoken to the subject that drugs are
unlawful,&quot; said Paul McNulty, a Bennettista soul-mate
directing communications at the Justice Department, &quot;a
person who disobeys the law has made a moral choice and should be
dealt with appropriately.&quot; Bennett freely admitted drug
enforcement was but an instrument of a wider agenda, calling for
&quot;the reconstitution of legal and social authority through
the imposition of appropriate consequences for drug dealing and
drug use.&quot; &quot;The drug crisis,&quot; he told the
Washington Hebrew congregation, &quot;is a crisis of authority,
in every sense of the term, 'authority.&quot; </p>

<p> Consequently, &quot;a massive wave of arrests is a top
priority for the War on Drugs,&quot; Bennett announced.
Washington, D.C. had arrested 45,000 of its citizens for drugs in
the two years prior to Bennett's appointment, &quot;without
making an appreciable dent in either the drug trade or the murder
rate,&quot; Newsweek noted. But Bennett wanted more of the same.
On the day he was sworn in, he declared the city a &quot;high
intensity drug trafficking area&quot; and unveiled a massive plan
to fight drugs in the nation's capital. More than eighty federal
agents would bolster the city's drug squad. A curfew would sweep
the streets of minors after 11 p.m. A judge ruled the curfew
unconstitutional, but the mood was infectious. Some members of
Congress suggested declaring de facto martial law -- placing the
D.C. police under federal control and sending in the Army and
National Guard. Of the $100 million Bennett wanted spent in D.C.,
95 percent was for law enforcement. Of that, more than half would
go to a new prison, and until that could be built, Bennett
proposed converting abandoned military buildings into makeshift
drug prisons. As for the purpose of all this new incarceration,
Bennett was characteristically blunt: &quot;I'm not a person who
says that the first purpose of punishment is
rehabilitation,&quot; he told Congress. &quot;The first purpose
is moral, to exact a price for transgressing the rights of
others.&quot; </p>

<h2>Elvis Presley</h2>

<p> The year ended on an odd note for the War on Drugs. Four days
before Christmas 1971, Egil Krogh's phone rang. It was Dwight
Chapin, from Bob Haldeman's staff. </p>

<p> &quot;The King is here,&quot; Chapin said. </p>

<p> &quot;King who?&quot; Krogh asked. &quot;No kings on the
president's schedule today.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Not just any two-bit king,&quot; Chapin answered.
&quot;The King. Elvis. The King of Rock.&quot; </p>

<p> Elvis Presley had appeared that morning at the Northwest Gate
of the White House and handed the guard a nearly illegible
six-page letter on American Airlines stationery. He was an
admirer of the president, Presley wrote, and he wanted to help
spread Nixon's anti-drug message. He was well positioned, too:.
&quot;The drug culture, the hippie elements, the SDS, Black
Panthers, etc. do not consider me as their enemy or as they call
it The Establishment.&quot; To dispel any doubts as to his own
loyalty, Presley added in bold underline, &quot;I call it America
and I love it!&quot; </p>

<p> Then Presley made his pitch. &quot;I can and will do more
good if I were made a Federal Agent at Large. . . . All I need is
the Federal credentials.&quot; </p>

<p> Presley was registered at a nearby hotel under the name Jon
Burrows. &quot;I will be here for as long as it takes to get the
credentials of a Federal Agent,&quot; Presley wrote. &quot;I have
done an in-depth study of drug abuse and Communist brainwashing
techniques and I am right in the middle of the whole thing where
I can and will do the most good.&quot; </p>

<p> Though he didn't mention it in the note to Nixon, Presley was
a collector of police badges. And he was a dopehound of legendary
excess. But in the squareball Nixon White House, Presley found
perhaps the only people in the United States who didn't know
that. Krogh certainly didn't. He took the letter at face value. </p>

<p> At 12:30, the King was relieved of his present for the chief
executive - a nickel-plated .45 automatic, complete with
ammunition -- and ushered into the office of the president. </p>

<p> Nixon was dressed like Nixon: blue suit, white shirt, tie.
Elvis was dressed like Elvis: black velvet jacket, chest hair,
gold medallions, sunglasses and a belt buckle big as a dinner
plate. He pulled up a sleeve to exhibit cufflinks the size of
hamsters. As Nixon bent close to examine them, Elvis launched
into a tirade against the Beatles, who he accused of being
anti-American. </p>

<p> &quot;You know,&quot; Nixon said. &quot;Those who use the
drugs are the protesters. You know, the ones who get caught up in
dissent and violence. They're the same group of young
people.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Mr. President,&quot; Elvis said, &quot;I'm on your
side. I want to be helpful. And I want to help get people to
respect the flag because that's getting lost.&quot; </p>

<p> Then Elvis got to the point. &quot;Mr. President, can you get
me a badge from the Narcotics Bureau?&quot; </p>

<p> Krogh was afraid of this. He'd already called the number-two
man at BNDD who earlier that day had thrown Elvis out. Elvis had
gone there before stopping at the Northwest gate, and offered a
$5,000 &quot;donation&quot; to BNDD in return for a badge. </p>

<p> Nixon, not knowing any of that, looked uncertainly at Krogh.
&quot;Bud, can we get him a badge?&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;If you want to give him a badge, I think we can get him
one.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;I'd like to do that. See that he gets one.&quot; </p>

<p> Elvis then did something nobody had ever done in the Nixon
Oval Office; he gathered the president up in his arms and gave
him a big bear hug. The staff was stunned; the photographer
didn't even get a picture. Nixon endured it stiffly, handed out
presidential tie clasps, and dismissed the King with a hearty pat
on the shoulder. </p>

<p> And so it came to pass that on the day Elvis Presley died of
a drug overdose in 1977, he was a credentialed Special Assistant
in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. </p>

        killer for injured soldiers during the Civil War. Opiates
        were the first real miracle drugs because they allowed
        the patient to be anesthetized while the doctor performed
        surgery. Before the advent of opiates, the most common
        surgery was a simple amputation. That is, the doctor got
        several big strong people to hold the patient down and
        then literally sawed off an arm or a leg while the
        patient screamed in pain. For this reason, a good doctor
        was a fast doctor. Battlefield hospitals during the Civil
        War commonly had large piles of severed arms and legs.
        The use of opiates as anesthesia gave doctors time to
        work on the patient and actually made modern surgery
        possible. </td>

        our millions of voluntary slaves still clang their

        have enslaved, is indeed a hard one; nevertheless, it is
        a paradise compared with the lot of him who has enslaved

        outlawed, because that was a peculiarly Chinese habit and
        the laws were specifically directed at the Chinese. The
        white people in the communities feared that Chinese men
        were luring white women to have sex in opium dens. <hr>
        <p>The patent medicine industry started its rise. Because
        there were no restrictions on advertising, labeling, or
        contents of any products the patent medicine industry
        made up all sorts of concoctions including the opiates,
        cocaine, and other drugs, and sold them with the most
        extravagant advertising claims. This led to a rise in

<p align="center"><b>Abstract<br>
</b></p>

<p>Soldier's Disease -- widespread addiction following massive
administration of opiates during the Civil War -- is the earliest
and most often repeated example of a drug problem before the
narcotics laws. The story exemplifies several basic themes used
in support of continued drug prohibition -- addiction is easy to
acquire, hard to kick, and is a publicly noticed, i.e. <i>asocial,
</i>problem. Soldier's Disease, though, is a myth. Not one case
of addiction was reported in medical records or the literature of
the time; under ten references were made in the Nineteenth
Century to addiction the cause of which was the Civil War; and no
perjorative nickname for addicted veterans, like Soldier's
Disease, appeared in the literature until 1 9 15, and it did not
become part of the Conventional Wisdom of drug experts until
almost a century after Appomattox. </p>

<p>Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, 1973<br>
</p>

<p>The earliest (and often the only) example of opiate addiction
as a social problem which is frequently cited by drug experts is <b>Soldier's
Disease -- </b>widespread addiction resulting from widespread
opiate use in the Civil War. Most writers who report Soldier's
Disease devote no more than three sentences to it. It is the
brevity, clarity, &quot;catchiness,&quot; and conceptual
implication of &quot;Soldier's Disease&quot; which accounts for
the contemporary significance of such a fleeting reference.
Possibly the lengthiest and most graphic description of opiate
use in the Civil War, resulting in massive addiction among
veterans, was provided by Gerald Starkey, a century after that
war: </p>

<p><i>In 1862 (sic) the Civil War broke out.... They would charge
each other, literally pound chains down cannons and fire point
blank at the enemy and these young men were presented to their
field surgeons with terrible shrapnel wounds ... along with
terrible pain.</i> </p>

<p><i>About all the field surgeon could do was use the two new
invented tools that had been presented to him in the previous
five or six years I the hypodermic needle and syringe, along with
Morphine Sulfate .... They injected the young wounded veterans
with huge amounts of Morphine daily (every four hours) to kill
their pain.... It was necessary for the surgeons to do
full-quarter amputations -- literally take the arms and legs off
right at the start of the body, usually to stop infectious
gangrene.</i> </p>

<p><i>In 1865 there were an estimated 400,000 young War veterans
addicted to Morphine.... The returning veteran could be. .
identified because he had a leather thong around his neck and a
leather bag (with) Morphine Sulfate tablets, along with a syringe
and a needle issued to the soldier on his discharge.... (T)his
was called the &quot;Soldier's Disease.&quot;</i> </p>

<p>(Starkey, 1971:482-84)1 </p>

<p>The lesson to be learned from &quot;Soldier's Disease&quot;
involves four linked hypotheses, phrased as fact, which form a
paradigm justifying today's U.S. Drug policy. This paradigm is:<br>
</p>

<p>Free access to opiates sooner or later breeds a massive use of
opiates. </p>

<p>Widespread use of opiates leads to a lot of addicts. </p>

<p>Addiction is long-term, often enough, forever. </p>

<p>Addiction is a publicly manifest problem.<br>
</p>

<p>In sum, free availability leads to a social problem.<br>
</p>

<p>The historical record shows, however, that Soldier's Disease
is a fanciful reconstruction of the past by writers I 00 years or
more after the Civil War. There was not, to my knowledge, a
single mention of Soldier's Disease, Army Disease, or any other
sobriquet referring to addicted veterans, until a half -century
after the Civil War; not one addict was noted in any writing or
statistic compiled during or immediately after the Civil War; and
reports of addicted veterans who began using during that War are
only rarely mentioned throughout the rest of the 19th Century.<br>
</p>

<p>Soldier's Disease is a modern creation that has very little to
do with the facts of 19th Century drug use. Rather, it is an idea
which fits, which shores up, modern drug policies. It is an
assertion about what opiates are supposed to do, applied to a
past situation. <br>
</p>

<p>In the next part -- Section I -- of this paper, the relevance
of Soldier's Disease to contemporary drug policy is addressed.
Soldier's Disease is the only tale of a pre-Harrison Act opiate
problem which a self-respecting scholar in recent years could
point to as a pre-1914 social problem due to opiates. In Section
2, the modern creation of Soldier's Disease, and its recent
popularity among drug experts, is shown by noting the first who
mention the concept and when, a generation or two later, it
became accepted by scholars of all persuasions. Then the focus
turns to the historical evidence which would test, in order, the
four steps in the above paradigm. In Section 3 the questions are:
&quot;were opiates widely used by soldiers during the Civil
War?&quot; and &quot;was addiction among them widespread <i>during
</i>the war?&quot; In Section 4 the questions are: &quot;was
there wide-scale addiction among veterans <i>after </i>the
war?&quot; and &quot;was this a publicly manifest problem?&quot;
What follows is the evidence for answering these four questions:
in order, &quot; a tentative yes...... no,&quot; &quot;no,&quot;
and &quot;no.&quot; The conclusions will expand further on how
the mythic and the actual situation of Civil War opiate use
relates to the current Drug policy debate. </p>

<p align="center">1. <b><u>The Relevance of Soldier's Disease</u></b>
</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>To Contemporary U.S. Drug Policy</u></b> </p>

<p>The paradigm justifying U.S. opiate policy -- availability
leads to use; use leads to addiction; addiction is long-term; and
addiction becomes a publicly manifest problem -- conveys the idea
that unavoidable <b>Social </b><i>consequences </i>of free access
to opiates justify the enormous costs of contemporary U.S. drug
policy. Of all the stories about the &quot;bad old days&quot;
when opiates were legal, only Soldier's Disease provides
convincing </p>

<p>I. evidence&quot; that opiate availability led to a publicly
manifest problem, beyond merely a substantial increase in the
numbers of addicts. Thus, only the tale of Soldier's Disease
demonstrates Step 4 of the paradigm. The very phrase
&quot;Soldier's Disease&quot; connotes a publicly manifest
problem. Otherwise, the tales told about opiates before the laws
banning them were either too far-fetched to be repeated in modern
times, or reflect a social problem only if you believe the
paradigm, (and often not even then). During and just before 1914,
the type of stories carried by the press about opiates did not
indicate a social problem which might lead to a need for
prohibition, and the absence of media coverage of the Harrison
Act during the year it was passed by Congress further suggests
the irrelevance of opiate use to a social problem. </p>

<p>There were, in the medical as well as the mass media of the
late 19th and early 20th Centuries, occasional alarms sounded
about other publicly manifest opiate problems, but no scholar in
recent years believes that these were real or significant. (For
example, the press periodically reported an opium problem,
particularly white women smoking opium in Chinatown, with Chinese
men. A racist, not an opiate problem). Even the moralistic
anti-opium writers of about a century ago, with rare and often
unbelievable exceptions, did not point to a publicly noticed
problem.2<br>
</p>

<p>Today, there are <i>imputed </i>social problems, but not a <i>demonstrated
</i>one, beyond Soldier's Disease. Historians David Musto and
David Courtwright (Musto, 1972:2-4; and Courtwright, 1982:16-28)
extend a tradition3 of research into the megatonnage of opiates
annually imported into the U.S. from well before the Civil War
through the early 20th Century. Additionally, opiates were
typically a key ingredient in patent medicines, and there was a
huge national campaign against them resulting in the Pure Food
and Drug Act. Neither the level of imports nor the widespread use
of opiates in patent medicines, in the absence of belief in a
paradigm such as we noted, suggest anything beyond widespread
availability. <br>
</p>

<p>The medical literature of the 19th Century is filled with
discussions about opiates, many written by experts who believed
its use was terrible. To them, a loss of &quot;moral will,&quot;
perhaps best exemplified by secretiveness, including husbands and
wives keeping large scale addictions hidden from their spouses
for many years,4 was a major problem. Addicts were deemed liars,
which was only natural given the opprobrium attached to addiction
in much of U.S. society long before there were drug laws.<b> </b>The
medical and pharmaceutical literature also had an on-going
contest, essentially, to report the oldest, most long-time,
addict with the largest habit. None of the above indicates that
the behavior of 19th or early 20th Century addicts was a publicly
evident problem. </p>

<p>In the years just before national drug prohibition, there was
barely a sign of an opiate-caused social problem, Two newspapers,
to my knowledge, were indexed for 1906-1912 -- the New York Times
and the San Francisco Call.5 In each, there were three basic
types of stories: recent state laws<u> </u>which were forerunners
of the Harrison Act in that they criminalized opiate use; arrests
(over half being of Chinese Americans); and international
stories. Opiates are assumed to be &quot;evil&quot; but the only
allusion to a possible social consequence in any Times story is
headlined &quot;Says Opium Aids Music Composers.-6 The only
public problem with opiates recounted in the Call, besides white
women in Chinese opiate dens7 and problems which result from the
local laws, is lethargy among the troops at The Presidio.
(&quot;It destroys the vitality of the user, and would in time
make the soldier a useless charge.&quot;) (S.F. Call, 1910b) 8 </p>

<p>The year the nation's major opiate prohibition law was passed,
the mass media, (at least the New York Times, San Francisco
Chronicle, Washington Post, and the Hearst Press), gave virtually
no coverage to Congressional discussion or passage of the
Harrison Act, or when it was signed into law or took effect.
(Aldrich, 1979) Fourteen months after it was signed, a medical
journal presented the results of a one-question survey -&quot;In
your opinion what are the five most useful and important drugs in
the materia medica?&quot; -- answered by teachers at leading
medical schools. &quot;Not only did it (opium) receive 102 votes
out of 107, but in 60 instances it was named first.&quot;
(Robinson, 1916) </p>

<p>What the above suggests is not only that the rationales to
justify opiate prohibition circa 1914 could not be repeated by
self-respecting <i>scholars </i>as rationales for continued
prohibition today, but that hardly a rationale was offered at
all. The Harrison Act crept in on tip-toes, called a tax act,
with no fanfare, no public interest or debate. When, a few years
later, it became clear that this was a criminal law with
considerable consequences, there was a brief flurry of criticism
and a rationale provided for continuing opiate prohibition,
namely the vileness and criminality of &quot;junkies&quot; and
the criminal cartels supplying them. Obviously, the consequences
of the law provided the rationale for justifying the law, but
there were not that many opiate addicts and it was not that big a
social problem for the debate to continue. </p>

<p>&quot;Evidence&quot; of a social problem is needed to justify
opiate prohibition only when such prohibition is a significant
social issue (which it was not in the years preceding the
Harrison Act) and when criticism of drug laws crescendoes. Only
then do scholars reconsider the rationales for the drug laws, and
turn to the historical record for insights into contemporary
concerns. It is only in these periods when the four parts of the
paradigm, enunciated above, have to be demonstrated if
contemporary drug policy is to be accepted. It is the final step
-- the manifestation of a problem, in public -- which makes the
other three socially significant. The only currently cited
example of the complete paradigm, in the absence of opiate
prohibition, is Soldier's Disease ... and it's a myth.<br>
<br>

<p><b>2. </b><u>Tracking The Develogment of The MM<br>
</u></p>

<p><b>A. </b><u>It's Roots</u> </p>

<p>The earliest portrayal of Soldier's Disease among Civil War
veterans appeared as World War I erupted over Europe (also the
year the Harrison Act, took effect). In &quot;The Curse of
Narcotism in America -- A Reveille,&quot; Marks, a Yale
professor, intended to alert the U.S. to an enormous addiction
problem among Civil War veterans that would be replicated in
another war: </p>

<p>Did you know that there is practically no old American family
of Civil War reputation which has not had its addicts?.... (I)t
was the &quot;army disease&quot; because of its prevalence?....
(W)ith the war that hangs over us, the drug evil will spread into
a giantism of even more terrible growth than the present?....
(T)here are something like 4,000,000 victims of opium and cocaine
in this country today? </p>

<p>(Marks, 1915:315)9 </p>

<p>Marks feared the return of the &quot;hydra-headed
drug-curse&quot; of the Civil War, but others writing during
World War I about the consequences of combat upon drug use among
servicemen made no reference to the War Between the States.
(Crothers, 1916; N.Y. Times, 1917; Stanley, 1918; and Weber,
1918)<br>
</p>

<p>In the nine years after World War I, a handful of authors
mentioned Civil War-related addiction, though none mentioned Army
Disease or any such synonym. (Bishop, 1919 and 1920; Illinois
Medical journal, 192 1; World's Work, 1924; and Fell, 1924).<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Army Disease&quot; was next noted in <u>The Opium
Problem</u>. Terry and Pellens' encyclopedic work of 1928, which
became &quot;regarded as the single most comprehensive work in
the field&quot; only several decades later.10 (Ball, 1970) For
Terry and Pellens, &quot;the Civil War gave it (chronic opium
intoxication) a considerable impetus (which) seems definitely
established.&quot; (Terry and Pellens, 1928: 5) Between 1928 and
the late 1950's, only a handful of scholars noted &quot;Army
Disease&quot; (Terry, 193 1; Woods, 193 1: Dai, 1937: Barnes,
1939; and Lindesmith, 1947), and even in the early 1960's it was
infrequently mentioned (Isbell, 1960 and 1963; Kolb, 1960 and
1962; Clausen, 196 1; Maurer and Vogel, 1962; and Sonnedecker,
1963), though prior to the drug explosion of the mid- 1960's
there were few scholars in the drug field. For the experts who
the past quarter century have claimed Soldier's Disease, if they
cite any reference it is typically Terry and Pellens. </p>

<p><b>B. </b><u>The Contemporary Conventional Wisdom<br>
</u></p>

<p>Since 1964, Soldier's Disease, in essence, was mentioned in
about 100 works by drug experts, half of these since 1973.11 It
was also mentioned in several studies by prestigious government
agencies and Drug and Crime Commissions.12 Among the experts are
many renowned critics of U.S. drug policies -- including Edward
Brecher, Alan Dershowitz, John Kaplan, Arnold Trebach and Norman
Zinberg. In the early 1970's a few writers questioned the
factuality of Soldier's (Kramer, 1971 and 1972; Swatos, 1972;
Musto, 1973; and Quinones, 1975), but shortly thereafter they
were rebutted in a detailed historical analysis. (Courtwright,
1978 and 1982)13 Since the mid- 1970's the mention of Soldier's
Disease has diminished, maybe because the critics had an impact
or because most experts stopped probing the roots of U.S. drug
policy after the early 1970's. <br>
</p>

<p>Soldiers Disease is, however, still mentioned by many experts
... and no one, yet, has responded to Courtwright. </p>

<p>Though briefly stated, a consistent theme involving three
components is reiterated by almost all the cited drug experts,
the only variation being in the synonyms used. First, morphine in
particular, and opiates in general, were administered by naive
doctors &quot;indiscriminately&quot; (also termed &quot;
promiscuous&quot;, &quot;imprudent&quot;,
&quot;uncontrolled&quot;, &quot;overdosage&quot;,
&quot;ignorant&quot;, etc.). Second, as a consequence of such
medical naivete, addiction among soldiers was massive (also
termed &quot;prevalent&quot;, &quot;commonplace&quot;,
&quot;thousands&quot;, wholesale usage&quot;,
&quot;rampant&quot;, etc.). Third, so widespread was the
addiction among soldiers and veterans that it became known as
Soldier's Disease (also termed &quot;army disease&quot;,
&quot;soldier's illness&quot;, or &quot;soldier's
sickness.&quot;),14 </p>

<p>The only clear disagreement is the few who estimate the number
of addicted Civil War veterans. Some claim 45,000 (Ashley, 1972
and 1978; Geis, 1973; Health PAC, 1970; and Kenny, 1972); others
400,000. (H. Jones and Jones, 1977; Lingeman, 1969; Schwartz,
1980; Starkey, 197 1; Summers et. al., 1975; and Westin and
Shaffer, 1972) Since no writer in either camp provides one clue
for their claim, the possibility that both estimates arose out of
the thin air circa 1970 is not ruled out. </p>

<p>Is today's conventional wisdom about Soldier's Disease an
intellectual version of the children's game of Telephone where a
simple message, after innumerable repetitions, becomes distorted
and a new &quot;catchy&quot; message takes on a life of its own
... or have recent writers captured the essence of opiate
addiction in a past era? That depends on the evidence during and
just after the Civil War.<br>
</p>

<p><b>3. </b><u>Opiate Use and Addiction During The Civil War<br>
</u></p>

<p><b>A. </b><u>The Need For and Use Of Opiates</u> </p>

<p>During the Civil War, and at least until 1914, opiates were
considered the best medicine for controlling dysentery and
diarrhea and for containing the pain from war wounds. The Surgeon
General's history of the just ended Civil War was often lavish in
its praise of opium. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Opium -- </i>this medicine merits first place among
these remedies. It was used almost universally in all cases of
severe wounds, and was particularly useful in penetrating wounds
of the chest, in quieting the nervous system and, indirectly in
moderating hemmorhage. </p>

<p>(US Surgeon General, 1870 :645) </p>

<p>But, how great was the need? How widely was it used? Given the
need, and the use, of opiates then, how many soldier addicts were
there in the Civil War?<br>
</p>

<p>Official records from the Civil War show more incidents of
severe <u>illness</u> for which opiates were the main remedy than
there were <u>wounds</u>. More died from disease than were killed
in battle or succumbed to wounds (For Union troops, 62%
&quot;disease,&quot; 19% &quot;battle,&quot; and 12%
&quot;Wounds&quot; of 360,000 deaths among Union troops).
(Duncan, 1912:397) Union medical records (for medical problems,
not deaths) show approximately 1,400,000 acute and 200,000
chronic cases of diarrhea or dysentery, 250,000 wounds, and
300,000 cases, combined, of typhoid, typhus, continued fever,
venereal disease, scurvy, delerium tremens, insanity and
paralysis. (Brooks, 1966:127) There were 30,000 amputations
reported performed by the Union's doctors. (US Surgeon General,
1883) Among Confederate prisoners, 32% of the almost 19,000 who
died in captivity in the north succumbed to diarrhea or
dysentery. (Brooks, 1966:126) In Andersonville prison from
February 1864 to April 1865, of 12,541 recorded Union soldier
captives who died, 45% did so from diarrhea or dysentery, and
only 7% from wounds, gangrene or &quot;debility.&quot; (US
Surgeon General, 1879:32) There was obviously a great <u>need</u>
for opiates. </p>

<p>Civil War physicians frequently dispensed opiates. The
Secretary of War just after 1865 stated the Union Army was issued
10 million opium pills, over 2,840,000 ounces of other opiate
preparations (such as laudunum or paregoric which, by weight,
were well under half opium), and almost 30,000 ounces of morphine
sulphate. (Courtwright, 1978:106-7 and 1982) <br>
</p>

<p><b>B. </b><u>Not One Report of Addiction In The Field<br>
</u></p>

<p>Yet for all the quantities dispensed, <i><u>there was not one
report from 1861-1865 of an addicted soldier.</u></i> </p>

<p>Could opiate addiction pass unnoticed, and have no
consequences, among troops living in raw conditions and often
moving from one place to another? Could so much morphine and
opium preparations get used without generating a single addict?<br>
</p>

<p>The 30,000 ounces of morphine is most easily explained.
Probably, most of it was <b><i>dusted </i></b>or <b><i>rubbed </i></b>into
wounds or, during anesthetization, <b><i>rubbed </i></b>into raw
tissue. (Adams, 1952; and Brooks, 1966) In the campaign of
Fredericksburg in December of 1862, &quot;hypodermic syringes
were unknown, such drugs as morphine being doled out on the point
of a knife&quot; by surgeons. (Duncan, 1985: 200) By the end of
the war, the hypodermic needle was beginning to be used, in
places -- &quot;roughly 19 per cent of Union Army physicians were
capable of administering morphine hypodermically.... and even
fewer Confederate physicians were (so) capable.&quot;
(Courtwright, 1978:105) Whether the hypodermic administration of
morphine during the Civil War was extremely rare as some have
claimed (US Surgeon General, 1888:547) or as others have implied
by their failure to note such use in medical histories of the war
(Courtwright, 1978:104-105), or was frequent as one neurologist
noted (Courtwright, 1978:106), there is not one case mentioned
where morphine was injected for pleasure, or to stave off
withdrawal pains. </p>

<p>The Civil War lasted four years, with 1,500,000 three year
enlistments on the Union side. Thus, those ten million opium
pills dispensed by Union doctors average roughly two per soldier
per year (assuming the pills survived combat conditions). Prior
to amputations or other battlefield surgery, the patient
routinely expected and was routinely given one of these pills.
Similarly, the 2,84 1,000 ounces of opiate preparations works out
to about a half -ounce per Union soldier per year. Though
physicians argued about the benefits of opiates for the relief of
pain which accompanied &quot;the fluxes&quot; (diarrhea and
dysentery), &quot;the partisans of opium were very much in the
majority&quot; and used opium for dysentery and other forms of
flux including &quot;chronic fluxes.&quot; Army physicians
&quot;united opium with almost every medicine employed to check
the progress of the disease,&quot; and despite typical failure to
cure returned &quot;almost always to opium as the drug which at
least alleviated, if it did not cure.&quot; Where the sufferings
of the patient were very great and continuous, and where
sleeplessness and restlessness had become a medical danger,
opiates were highly recommended, even by the otherwise skeptical
physician. (US Surgeon General, 1879: 743-747) Again, applying
basic arithmetic, and taking into account that there were many
more than the <i>reported </i>1.6 million cases of dysentery and
diarrhea, it is easy to understand why there were periodic
shortages of opiates. As with morphine, there is not a single
report during the Civil War of a soldier rising opium for
pleasure, and the single claim of opiates used to stave off
withdrawal pains (published 16 years after the War) was the
&quot;confession&quot; of an officer charged with &quot;deserting
in the face of the enemy, and sentenced to be shot.&quot;15
(Nolan, 1881) </p>

<p>Though modern writers have accused the military doctors in the
Civil War of not fully appreciating the addictive qualities of
opiates, one historian of Civil War medicine writes that
physicians in the field did not fully appreciate the benefits of
opium.<br>
</p>

<p>Tincture of opium and paregoric were always available, but
nowhere in the records does one get the impression that they were
used routinely in the management of the fluxes. </p>

<p align="center">(Brooks, 1966:117) <br>
</p>

<p>Morphine, too, may well have been underused, to judge from a
leading, albeit unusual, neurologist at the time, S. Weir
Mitchell, who: </p>

<p>(S)colded the medical profession for its reluctance in using
this mighty painkiller, pointing out that some patients' agonies
were so severe the choice must lie between Morphine and
amputation. </p>

<p>(Adams, 1952:138)<br>
</p>

<p>The naivete of military physicians regarding the negative
effects of opiates, often noted shortly after the Civil War, had
to do basically with their misunderstanding the medical effects
of opiates, not the addictive properties of the drug.16 (US
Surgeon General, 1879:735-750) </p>

<p>There were no reports of addiction in situations which, a
century or so later, generated numerous such references. For the
Civil War, one virtually never reads of a soldier suffering
withdrawal pains, or dying of an OD; or a physician in the field
besieged for an opiate for feeding a habit (as distinct from
easing pain or controlling diarrhea). In Wait Whitman's
description of the 80,000 to 100,000 sick and wounded he saw in
600 hospital visits during three years of the Civil War, he notes
that many patients craved tobacco, sweets, or alcohol, yet he
never once mentions opium. (Whitman, 1895) The sickness form
submitted by physicians to the Surgeon General from mid- 1 862 to
the end of the war listed 152 categories of disease, including
&quot;serpent bite,&quot; &quot;apoplexy,&quot;
&quot;insanity,&quot; &quot;night blindness,&quot;
&quot;poisoning,&quot; &quot;inebriation,&quot; &quot;delirium
tremens&quot; and &quot;chronic alcoholism&quot;, but not
addiction or opiate deprivation. (US Surgeon General, Pt. 1, V.
1). In the Surgeon General's history of the Civil War,
&quot;nostalgia ... .army itch .... poisoning .... alcoholism
.... and venereal disease,&quot; but not opiate use, are singled
out for special comment. Under &quot;nostalgia&quot; the problem
of boredom is given prominence and smoking tobacco, drinking
alcohol, and gambling are singled out for their &quot;sedative
influence,&quot; to &quot;pass the dull hours&quot; in lieu of
satisfying the craving for excitement. (US Surgeon General, 1888:
886) In sum, there is no hard evidence of addicts during the
Civil War, and it is hard to believe it would have been missed
had addiction been significant.<br>
</p>

<p><u>C. Not One Report of Addiction Immediately After The Civil
War</u> </p>

<p>If addiction among Civil War veterans was significant, it
should have been most noticed in the immediate post-War years.
There were 63,000 soldiers whose chronic diarrhea carried on
after the war, (Adams, 1889) and over 20,000 survivors of
amputations reported by Union doctors. (US Surgeon General, 1883)
When the Civil War ended, and veterans filled the prisons, New
York State prison keepers at Auburn and Sing-Sing told of
contraband smuggled into prisons, such as &quot;whiskey,
tobacco... yellow covered literature.... sugar, tea, coffee,
butter, pies, cakes, liquor, looking glasses, combs, brushes,
etc.&quot;, yet opiates were not mentioned. (North American
Review, 1867:572-74) In the Mississippi State Hospital, whose
admission records of the mentally ill go back to 1855, the first
narcotism case was recorded in 1884. (Jaquith, 1965) The edition
of the United States Dispensatory, (the enormous physician's desk
reference of the time), which appeared just after the Civil War
devotes 27 pages to &quot;opium&quot; without noting the Civil
War. (Wood and Bache, 1868) Surely a significant minority of
those 63,000 diarrhetics and 30,000 amputees were advised to take
opiates by their physicians, and willingly took what at the time
was the best relief of their problems. Yet only two references to
veterans who began using opiates during the Civil War were
published before 1880. (Day, 1868; and Oliver, 1872) (A third
pre-1880 case-history of an addicted veteran, cited by some as
demonstrating Soldier's Disease, started using opiates after the
war). (Anon, 1876) </p>

<p><b>D. </b><u>The Logic For Claiming The Existence of Many
Civil War Addicts</u> </p>

<p>How, then, could recent experts agree on massive addiction
during the Civil War? Almost certainly it has to do with trust in
the statements of Terry and Pellens without bothering to check
the original sources. The one exception -- the one historian who
has checked those sources and maintains the validity of addiction
during the Civil War -- is Courtwright, who believes that
addiction must exist ... even though it is not in evidence. For
morphine, Courtwright cites S. Weir Mitchell's claim that 40,000
morphine injections were given at one army hospital in one year.
This number is far beyond any other -- in fact, except for it
there would be no consideration of the <i>widespread </i>use of
morphine other than what was rubbed and dusted into wounds.
Courtwright considers the claim &quot;puzzling, to say the
least,&quot; (and there are reasons for doubting Weir,
personally),17 but he concludes if that number &quot;is even half
correct, it seems impossible that a substantial portion of the
patients ... did not end the war as addicts.&quot;
&quot;Impossible&quot; as it seems, not a single addict was
reported during the Civil War. </p>

<p>Courtwright also notes &quot;the frequency and casualness with
which opiates were administered&quot; and states that &quot;vast
quantities of opium preparations other than morphine were
dispensed under circumstances (such as to those with chronic
diarrhea, dysentery or malaria) which could very easily lead to
addiction.&quot; The only trouble is &quot;very easily&quot; did
not occur. </p>

<p>Disregarding the lack of documentation on a single addict
during the Civil War, Courtwright contends &quot;that the war
contributed to the spread of addiction,&quot; and <b><i>&quot;</i></b>offer<b><i>
</i></b>the fighting, sick and wounded veterans greatly expanded
the pool for iatrogenic addiction.&quot; (Courtwright,
1982:55-56, emphasis added) Since opiates were widely
administered in the early as well as last years of the Civil War,
<b>it </b>is hard to imagine why addiction would only develop
after the war. Nonetheless, accepting Courtwright's contention
for the moment, the test of the validity of Soldier's Disease
thus depends on analysis of post-war addiction among veterans.<br>
</p>

<p><b>4. </b><u>Reports of Addicted Veterans Through the 19th
Century <br>
</u></p>

<p>Were it not for Horatio Day's <u>The Opium Habit</u>,
published in 1868, the modern day notion of Soldier's Disease
might never have developed. The latter of these two sentences by
Day (quoted by Terry and Pellens) is, by far, the most widely
cited writing on Soldier's Disease: </p>

<p><i>The events of the last few years [Civil War] have
unquestionably added greatly to their [confirmed opium eaters']
number. Maimed and shattered survivors from a hundred
battlefields, diseased and disabled soldiers released from
hostile prisons, anguished and hopeless wives and mothers made so
by the slaughter of those who were dearest to them, have found,
many of them, temporary relief from their sufferings in Opium.</i>
</p>

<p>(Day, 1868:1) </p>

<p>This remark, quoted by several modern writers,18 is the only
reference to the Civil War in Day's 335 page tome. Day recounts
many types of persons who were addicts, but not one specific case
of a soldier or veteran.19 in context, Day's two-sentence
allusion to the Civil War suggests an extremely minor problem
recounted by an encyclopedic problem-seeker.<br>
</p>

<p><b>A. </b><u>Courtwright's Evidence Is Skimpy<br>
</u></p>

<p>Courtwright recognizes that &quot;army disease&quot; was not
an &quot;epidemic,&quot; but still concludes: &quot;It is
possible to document numerous references to addicted veterans
both as a class and as individuals.&quot; (Courtwright, 1978:1 1
1) Using the same evidence, and more, I reach opposite
conclusions. Why? <br>
</p>

<p>In <u>Dark Paradise: Opiate Addiction In America Before 1940</u>,
Courtwright cites 1 18 books and articles published between the
Civil War and the end of the century (Courtwright, 1982) yet in
his studies of Soldier's Disease he lists nine references to
addicted veterans, and only five appeared in the 19th Century2O
and were to veterans who had used opiates during the Civil War.
Adding two more which I uncovered (Earle, 1880; Nolan, 188 1),
and including two other brief and vague references (Crothers,
1892 and 1893), this averages one reference every 4 years between
18651899. The overwhelming majority of articles about opiate use
written in the fifteen years following Appomatox, including
several by writers who presented lists of the types of people who
were addicts, do not single out the Civil War,21 nor can I find
such a reference in newspapers of the time.22 </p>

<p>None of these nine sources demonstrates that opiate addiction
by Civil War veterans was of social significance. In addition to
those previously quoted (Day and Nolan, who writes of the alibi
used by a deserter), there were three references by the most
prolific writers of the period, Mattison and Crothers (twice).23
Mattison's sole mention appears at the end of his career, 3 years
after the War ended. (Mattison, 1898) Crothers wrote
prolifically. If a &quot;drug problem&quot; could be unearthed,
trust Crothers to lead the digging party.24 In the context of his
encyclopedic writings, Crothers' few mentions of the Civil War
suggests its role in subsequent addiction was miniscule.
(Crothers, 1892 and 1893) Further, when World War I broke out in
Europe, Crothers urged combat physicians_to use opiates
liberally, and fears of a subsequent addiction problem were
groundless. (Crothers, 1916) Two other references are of tone
addicts, one -- of a long-time successful minister --
demonstrating the difficulty of detecting addiction at the time.
(Russell, 1887; and Keeley, 198 1) </p>

<p>B. <u>&quot;Only Your Pharmacist Knows For Sure&quot;<br>
</u></p>

<p>The two other references suggest that for a while, in some
places, there were some addicted veterans ... reported by those
who would notice addicts even if the general public did not
recognize them -- i.e. the apothecaries who sold opiates. Terry
and Pellens, reviewing an 1 878 study , noted that even
physicians did not recognize the extent of addiction: <br>
</p>

<p><i>Druggists were in a much better position to know the truth
.... when counter sales were legal, and as a matter of common
practice, physicians were called upon only by those opiate users
seeking (cure).</i> </p>

<p>(Terry and Pellens, 15)<br>
</p>

<p>A Massachusetts study of 1871 &quot;consulted&quot; 20-30
druggists and got mailed responses from 125 physicians. 40 of
these physicians did not know of a single case of &quot;opium
eating,&quot; and of 46 who commented on whether &quot;the
injurious use of opium has increased of late years,&quot; 6 1 %
answered it had not and another 13% answered it was diminishing.
Only one physician, but at least two druggists, stated that
opiate use begun during the late war was an important cause for
addiction. (Oliver, 1872) Without denying the significance of
this report, these mentions of addicted veterans had no
ramifications in the drug literature at the time. It was a state
publication with very limited circulation, the few summaries or
reviews of the report in the medical literature at the time did
not mention the Civil War,25 and save for Terry and Pellens'
lengthy excerpt from it in 1928 we might never have known that
some pharmacists, at least, recognized that addicted veterans, as
a class, were among the ranks of addicts.26 </p>

<p>In Chicago in 1880, 50 pharmacists were surveyed about the
cause of addiction of their regular opiate using customers. The
most mentioned were &quot; rheumatism and neuralgia&quot; (38
each); &quot;some&quot; respondents, (but less than four),
believed addiction was caused by sickness and pain and/or the
&quot;loss of property and position in society&quot; due to the
recent war. (Earle, 1880) (On another government survey, of
doctors in Michigan in 1878, the Civil War was not mentioned).
(Marshall, 1966) </p>

<p>In toto, these surveys indicate that there was a small,
temporary phenomenon of addicted veterans, which was not a social
problem in the sense that anyone but a few pharmacists recognized
it in the quarter century after the Civil War. </p>

<p><b>C. </b><u>&quot;Any&quot; Vs. &quot;Many&quot;</u> </p>

<p>No one doubts that all the opiates used to alleviate the pain
from all the chronic diseases and continuous pain resulting from
the Civil War resulted in some soldiers using and becoming
addicted to opiates. The issue, however, is not whether there
were <u>any</u> addicted veterans but if there were <u>many</u>.
Courtwright's contention that <b>&quot;a </b><i>substantial </i>number
of them (veterans) eventually became addicted to opium or
morphine,&quot; and that &quot;two events, the Civil War and the
spread of hypodermic medication, triggered a <b><i>massive </i></b>increase
in iatrogenic opium and especially morphine addiction,&quot;
(emphasis not in the original). (Courtwright, 1982) is
unwarranted.<br>
</p>

<p>In arguing that the importance of Soldier's Disease should not
be discounted, Courtwright stresses the importance on later 19th
Century addiction of the wrenching impact that War had on society
as a whole, such as the loss of loved ones, property, fortunes
and social position. By such reasoning, any social event or
condition which occurs in reasonable proximity before an increase
in drug use can be considered a &quot;cause.&quot; Ergo, the iron
horse can be blamed for late 19th century addiction, or movies
and television for the increased drug problems of the last few
decades. (In the Massachusetts study noted above, more
pharmacists reported state restrictions on the use of alcohol a
&quot;cause&quot; of recent opiate use than reported the Civil
War). However, Soldier's Disease is cited in the drug literature
the past few decades to imply something quite specific -- namely,
the presence of opiates, outside of strict and knowledgeable
medical control, ipso facto causes massive publicly noted
addiction, Nothing less. </p>

<p><b>5. </b><u>Soldier's Disease and Drug Policy</u> </p>

<p>In sum, Soldier's Disease proves to be another myth. In
reality, the widespread use of opiates during the Civil War
generated so infinitesimal a problem that only two or three
apothecaries, and two or three of the most encyclopedic drug
experts, even speculated on the possibility of addicted soldiers
from that War for almost half a century. Soldier's Disease did
not become the Conventional Wisdom until almost a century after
that war. </p>

<p>Implicit in the concept of Soldier's Disease are four aspects
of addiction which, together, are a paradigm used to justify
current opiate laws -- easy access leads to widespread use,
addiction is easy to acquire, hard to kick, and its consequences
are powerful and publicly obvious. In the popular contemporary
idiom, the paradigm consists of &quot;it's so good, don't even
try it once&quot;; &quot;once an addict, always an addict&quot;;
and in the image of the &quot;junkie&quot;. (Belief in this
paradigm, in the early 1970's, led many experts, and particularly
critics of U.S. military policy, to sound the tocsin about opiate
use by GIs for inevitably this would lead to a huge problem of
addicted veterans ... which it didn't)27 Since each aspect of the
paradigm is contradicted by the historical evidence, Soldier's
Disease is a mythic reconstruction of the past to make it
coincide with contemporary assumptions. <br>
</p>

<p>How significant is the paradigm in justifying opiate laws?
Each year over the past two decades the nation has spent billions
in drug law enforcement, resulting in an annual average of over a
half million drug arrests, and has spent billions for trying
those arrestees and incarcerating scores of thousands of them.
Until the mid-1980's, when cocaine replaced opiates as the most
often used and most frightening &quot;hard drug,&quot; the
dangers of opiate addiction formed the core of the nation's
perceived drug problem and most of the prisoners serving drug
sentences had been convicted on opiate charges. Additionally,
drugs are a major economic alternative for young poor people, as
well as a major source of police corruption. None of this --
neither the public money, arrests, incarcerations, the
competitive illegal economy, and police corruption -existed
regarding drugs until there were prohibitory laws. </p>

<p>How significant is Soldier's Disease for the paradigm which
shows opiate availability ipso facto causes a massive social
problem? As noted in Section I of this paper, there is no other
pre-Harrison Act example of a currently believable social
problem. Though an ancient and seemingly minor issue, addiction
among Civil War veterans functions as a lynchpin or cornerstone.
Strip away Soldier's Disease, and the only problem suggested by
the paradigm are the medical consequences of addiction, which
occurs in a large percentage of opiate users. The facts about
addiction among the Civil War's soldiers and veterans indicates
that widespread addiction, too, is a natural result of free
access to drugs. </p>

<p>The facts about Civil War drug use indicate open availability
and no recognizable negative consequences; the facts, the past
few generations, show extremely limited access to opiates and an
immense &quot;drug problem.&quot; It is in the illegal context
that the modern &quot;opiate problem&quot; arises, rather than in
a legal context such as the Civil War. The chemistry lesson of
the Civil War is that opiates per se do not cause the problem,
the context does.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>FOOTNOTES</u></b> </p>

<p><b>1 </b>The imagery of the &quot;leather thong around his
neck and a leather bag&quot; is, to my knowledge, unique to
Starkey. </p>

<p>2 Occasionally a moralistic author of the late 19th Century
cited a social problem with opiates which no-one else ever
noticed, but two problems were repeated enough to warrant
comment. T.D. Crothers in several articles claimed that morphine,
in particular, led to crime. According to one scholar who studied
the period, &quot;No other writer ... asserts the strength and
ubiquity of this association .... (and) it is extremely difficult
to accept the validity of his position.&quot; (Swatos, 1972),
though at least one other expert claimed, as an alibi in a trial
for a property crime, (Kane, 1882b), that the cost of opiates
forced some persons with huge habits to steal. Still, before the
laws all but the extremely poor could easily afford any size
habit. Crothers' unique assertions about opiate-caused crime can
not justify a policy which generates the extraordinary
drug-related crime of today. </p>

<p>There were also occasional reports that addicts were lethargic
and neglectful of personal hygiene and business. However, the
types of people on 19th Century lists of addicts, were typically
in demanding jobs. That, said the experts at the time, was why
they sought the &quot;stimulating&quot; effects of opiates. The
many reports of people not knowing their spouses were long term
addicts suggests that the lethargy and inattentiveness to
business was hardly blatant. Aside from the racist comments about
opiate use in Chinatowns, the allegation that opiates effected
the performance of a class of persons, such as impeding the
performance of soldiers (S.F. Call, 19 1 Ob), was rare. </p>

<p>3 Terry and Pellens, in their encyclopedic classic The Opium
Problem, also report import statistics, as does Kane, the author
of the longest scholarly work in the early 1880's. (Terry and
Pellens, 1928:50-5 1; and Kane, 1880). <br>
</p>

<p>4 &quot;It has been reported that for many years husbands and
wives, to say nothing of other members of a family, have lived in
complete ignorance of the existence of this condition in one or
the other.&quot; (Terry and Pellens: 2)<br>

<p>7 The obvious racism manifest in such headlines as
&quot;Crafty Chinese Are Doubly Accused&quot; (S.F. Call, 1910a),
becomes a &quot;social problem&quot; when white women are
involved, as suggested by the following headline: </p>

</p>

<p>The S.F. Call on occasion linked opiate use to crime or
lunacy, but each time the details indicated the problem was a
result of the law. (S.F. Call, 1910c and d, and 1911a) New York
City's Commissioner of Corrections said that if addicts are
deprived of opiates on arrest, &quot;normal persons ... very
frequently go insane.&quot; (N.Y. Times, 1914) <br>
</p>

<p>9 Estimates of the number of opiate addicts and &quot;cocaine
fiends&quot; circa 1915 varied enormously. Marks' estimated
4,000,000; a U.S. Public Health Service expert estimated a
minimum of 70,000 and, elsewhere, &quot; I 18,000.... (and)
granting (a) somewhat improbable assertion ... a maximum not more
than 187,000 users of opium,&quot; (Marks, 1915; Wilbert, 1914
and 1915). </p>

<p>10 Had <u>The Opium Problem</u> gained earlier recognition as
a classic, Soldier's Disease might have been the conventional
wisdom of drug experts before the late 1950's. The original 1928
printing of 400 copies not sold out for decades. A 1 970 reprint
sold much better. </p>

<p>12 Soldier's Disease was cited in publications by several
influential government agencies and prestigious commissions
created to address the drug issue. Starting with 1973, references
to Soldier's Disease can be found in: Los Angeles Sheriff's
Department, 1974; National Commission on Marihuana, 1973;
Organized Crime Task Force, 1984; President's Commission on
Organized Crime, 1986; Strategy Council, 1975; U.S. Attorney
General, 1984: and U.S. Department of H.E.W., 1975. </p>

<p>13 Despite my many criticisms, I respect Courtwright's
judiciousness and his willingness to grapple with the issue
(which no other expert who claims Soldier's Disease has done), He
recognizes and responds to contrary evidence, and criticizes
simplistic recitations of Soldier's Disease. </p>

<p><b>14 </b>Of the authors the past 30 years who report
widespread addiction by Civil War veterans, over a third mention
Soldier's Disease, a third denote Army Disease, an occasional
author labels it Soldier's Illness or Soldier's Sickness, and the
others describe the phenomenon without noting a sobriquet. </p>

<p>15 The officer confessed at his trial that he was
&quot;suffering for want of the drug (opium) ... (and) so great
was the craving that he temporarily deserted his post to ...
obtain it, though knowing that his life would thereby be
forfeited.&quot; (Nolan, 188 1). This smacks of tales from the
1930's of murderers caught red-handed who, desperate to avoid the
electric chair, claimed marijuana &quot;caused&quot; their crime.
</p>

<p>16 The failure to note opiate addiction as a significant
problem was not due to the absence of the concept of addiction
during and just after the Civil War, The commissioners of the
Prison Association of New York in 1866 reported that men &quot;of
a low order of morals ... (were) addicted to habits of profanity
and intemperance.&quot; (North American Review, 1867:570) </p>

<p>17 An article on opiates by Mitchell -- on the effects of
opiates on birds -confirms him as an eccentric scientist. (Boston
MSJ, 1870) Weir found that morphia did not induce steep
&quot;beyond a slight tendency to quietude, which we can never be
sure is not due to the habit of the wounded or sick pigeon of
seeking a remote corner and remaining at rest,&quot; but
&quot;used hypodermically in excessive amounts ... act as
excitants .... (and) in the duck they approach nearest to the
typical strychnic spasm.&quot; Weir also found &quot;great
difficulty with which pigeons, especially old birds, are poisoned
by opiates.&quot; </p>

<p>In All or part of Day's two sentences on the Civil War are
quoted by five 20th Century writers, (Brecher et. al., 1972;
Courtwright, 1978; Cuskey, </p>

<p>Premkunar and Sigel, 1972; Quinones, 1975; and Terry and
Pellens, 1928), and closely paraphrased without attribution by
some others. </p>

<p>19 Calkins, Day's contemporary, refers to over 200 cases in <u>Opium
and the Opium Appetite</u>. but not one soldier who began opiate
use between 1861-65.<br>
</p>

<p>20 Courtwright and Terry and Pellens cite addicted Civil War
veterans who came to public attention in the 20th Century as
evidence of that war's impact on subsequent addiction. Besides
lending credence to the phenomenon they also demonstrate that
such addiction was benign and unnoticed. The octogenarians cited
in 1928 by Terry and Pellens (&quot;today in more than one old
soldiers' home are cases of chronic opium addiction which date
from this (Civil War) period&quot;) (Terry and Pellens, 69), or
the 82 year old Confederate veteran who &quot;had been shot in
the head during the Civil War&quot; and &quot;had been addicted
55 years&quot; under medical supervision since then, (Waldorf,
1973), reveal that the addiction of veterans was not <i>a social
problem, </i>and not even <i>a medical problem </i>until
prohibition of opiates. </p>

<p>21 Apart from Courtwright's citations, of the 29 books or
largest articles about opiates, published between 1865-1879,
which I have located, there is not an original reference to
soldiers addicted during the Civil War. (Brown, 1972: Calkins,
1867 and 1871; Chaille, 1876; M.D., 1878; Frost, 1870; Gibbons,
1870: Gould, 1878; Harrington, 1878; Ingals, 1877 and 1878;
Layard, 1874 and 1878; Lippincott's, 1868; Ludlow, 1867;
Mattison, 1876 a and b, and 1878 a and b; McFarland, 1877;
National Quarterly Review, 1870; Parrish, 1869 and 1873; Popular
Science, 1875; The Probe, 1869 a and b: Richet, 1878; R.S., 1869;
and Warren, 1867). Several times as many articles were shorter
pieces, and likewise <u>made</u> no mention of addiction linked
to the Civil War. </p>

<p>22 Four lengthy newspaper articles during the 1870's, about
non-Chinese opiate use, do not mention soldiers or veterans of
the Civil War. (New York Daily Herald, 1877 and 1878; and New
York Times, 1877 and 1878). </p>

<p>23 Two of the four 20th Century sources cited by Courtwright
were also works by Crothers. (Crothers, 1900 and 1902). </p>

<p>24 Headings of 7 of the 18 chapters in Crothers' book <u>Morphinism
and Narcomanias From Other Drugs</u> are &quot;Chloralism ....
Chioroformism .... Coffee Addiction .... Tea Inebriety ....
Tobacco Inebriety .... Ether Inebriety .... (and) Addictions From
Other Drugs,&quot; these &quot;others&quot; including arsenic,
ginger, cologne and lavender. (Crothers, 198 lb) </p>

<p>25 Three reviews of the 1872 Massachusetts study appeared in
medical journals at the time. None mentioned the Civil War (Amer.
J of Medical Sciences, 1872; and Lancet, 1873), and one even
considered the reports of opiate habituation &quot;exaggerated
.... a piece of scandal,&quot; witness that in its subsequent
annual report the Massachusetts Board of Health made &quot;no
allusion whatsoever to the subject (of opiates)&quot; (Medical
Times, 1873). </p>

<p>26 Morgan provides a lengthier excerpt of the 1872
Massachusetts study than did Terry and Pellens, but omits the
physician's, and two pharmacists', comments. The single sentence
relevant to the Civil War -- &quot;The taste for opium eating
among soldiers retired from the army is alluded to by a few of
our correspondents&quot; -- follows a listing of other causes of
addiction, (injudicious prescribing, depressed nervous systems,
overwork with deficient nutrition, a vicious mode of life, and
intemperance). </p>

<p>27 In several fundamental respects, the opiate use of soldiers
and veterans of the Vietnam War is not analogous to the Civil War
situation, though the fears about what widespread opiate use
among GIs would engender once they were mustered out exactly
parallels the fears implicit in Soldier's Disease. The soldiers
who used opiates in the Civil War did so to alleviate the pain
from wounds, and to help cure &quot;the fluxes,&quot; but using
such drugs &quot;to get high&quot; or to reduce stress were the
essential reasons for opiate use by Vietnam era GIs. In so far as
a few veterans continued regularly using opiates in the 1970's
and 1980's, they contributed to a social problem because, in the
context of illegality, any regular opiate use tends to be a
financial burden and criminal problem. The counterparts of these
GIs, a century earlier, went unnoticed. Further, the fact that so
many GIs abandoned opiate use once out of Vietnam can be argued
as a demonstration of the effects of the U.S. approach of massive
treatment opportunities and massive enforcement. The handful of
addicted veterans after the Civil War would suggest that
suppression is not the root cause of why regular opiate users

<h1>&quot;American Prohibitionists and Violence, 1865-1920&quot; </h1>

<p> by Richard Hamm </p>

<p> Today I want to post part of a paper I delivered at a Meeting
of the Alcohol and Temperance History Group as an Affiliated
Society of the American Association for the History of Medicine,
at its 68th Annual Meeting at Pittsburgh in May 1995. At that
time I said I wasn't planning to publish it, for various reasons,
but I have been urged by people whose views I value to
disseminate it, so I placed it-in pieces-on the List serve of the
ATHG. It brought forth a good string, so I have agreed to place
this piece (essentially the Pittsburgh paper) on the Web page of
the ATHG. </p>

<p> The prohibitionists were social reform agitators who sought a
major change in their society's customs. Social reformers have
been, of course, a nearly constant presence in American society
since the early 19th century. Accounts of many social reformers'
campaigns, often deal with the violence inflicted upon reformers
seeking change in society and the violence engaged in by some
reformers to achieve their ends. Indeed, violence, even killing
and attempted killing, seems almost endemic to the history of
social reforms in the United States. But, with the special cases
of the Women's crusades of 1873 and Carry Nation aside, the vast-
and ever-growing literature on the temperance movement pays
little attention to the issue of violence.(1) This gap is a
serious deficiency. </p>

<p> There are two limits to my work. First, I am most interested
in violence in its most dramatic and drastic forms, killing or
attempting to kill people. So I will be talking mostly of
killings, attempted killings, and mobbings (because after all
they can easily lead to killings). Second, I am talking about
violence in respons to or as a part of agitation and not violence
attendant to law enforcement. Thus I am going to pass over
silently the many studies, popular and not, of moonshining,
bootlegging, and violence.(2) Violence in resistance to law or
violence undertaken by law officers is somewhat separate from
violence associated with a social reform movement's agitation for
change. Such violence grows out the state's presumption to have a
monopoly of force and its willingness to resort to force to gain
the ends of its policy. To break the law of the state is to risk
its use of violence against you, hence the likelihood that the
law breaker will engage in violence. Law enforcement and violence
go together hand and glove. </p>

<p> But within these limits there still broad area of violence to
be explored as reform and violence also seem to go together. We
can break down violence associated with reform into two large
categories. First, violence, used by their opponents, to stop
reformers from agitating. Second, violence by reformers directed
at achieving their ends-in their view, a righteous violence. A
brief look of some reforms in American history shows the
existence of these two types of violence. </p>

<p> Violence to deter reform, for example, surfaces in studies
and memory of the civil rights movement. The literature is filled
with works that explore the violence directed against civil
rights advocates in the American South in the 1950s and 1960s. We
all know of the bombing of the Birmingham churches, the mobbing
of sit in protesters and freedom riders, and the killing of
Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney.(3) Similarly, contemporary
commentary on the anti-abortion movement has focused on the wave
of violence against doctors and workers at women's health
centers, most notably in the cases of Pensacola shootings and the
recent the shootings in Brookline. </p>

<p> Historians of abolitionists, perhaps the most deeply studied
of all social reform movements, have delineated both types of
violence in that crusade. They have explored the many
anti-abolitionist mobs of the Jacksonian era, including that
which mobbed and killed the abolitionist editor Eliajah Lovejoy
in 1837. Also, they have spent considerable effort exploring the
forces and meaning of John Brown's and other abolitionists'
willingness to engage in terrorism to bring about the end of
slavery.(4) But virtually no where in the vast scholarly studies
of the prohibition movement are there similar studies of the
prohibitionists and violence. Its not because violence is not
there </p>

<p> On the issue of deadly violence against agitators, the recent
scholarly literature is almost silent on the subject but the drys
themselves recorded that it happened. The temperance movement at
its peak, sought to encourage the faithful and to preserve the
records of its achievements and struggles by publishing, among
other things, prohibition encyclopedias. Two standard reference
books produced by the drys, <i>The Pocket Cyclopedia of
Temperance</i> (1916) and <i>Standard Encyclopedia of the Alcohol
Problem</i> (1925-1930) show that drys included information on
violence against prohibitionists. Both works contain articles on
so called &quot;Temperance Martyrs.&quot; Indeed, scattered
through the six volumes and 2940 page <i>Standard Encyclopedia</i>
are many accounts of mobbings, attempted killings, and killings
of drys. Some of the stories in the <i>Standard Encyclopedia</i>
are classics. For instance, it details in the article on
Pennsylvania how a county chairman of the Anti-Saloon League was
shot at in 1913, but &quot;fortunately the bullet, intended for
his heart, was arrested by a copy of the bible which he carried
under his arm.&quot; The article includes a picture of the page
where the bullet was stopped. While such miraculous tales were
rare, pedestrian tales of violence were common in the temperance
movement.(5) </p>

<p> I have combined the counts of the <i>Standard Encyclopedia</i>
and the <i>Pocket Encyclopedia</i> to come up with some ball park
figures of the violence directed against prohibitionists. These
numbers exclude from them prohibitionists who suffered violence
as a result of official or unofficial law enforcement or (from
the sources available) who suffered violence in uncertain
circumstances. For example, a minister who denounced violators of
a state prohibition law and sought to bring private prosecutions
in the courts and suffered violence would be in this estimate
engaging in unofficial law enforcement and is not included in the
figures of prohibitionist agitators who experienced violence.
Including such persons would roughly double the number of
assaults and triple the number of the killings. Combining the two
lists, I have found the names of six drys who between 1874 and
1908 were killed over their advocacy of their cause. At least
another nineteen drys were mobbed, beaten, shot at, or had their
homes (or businesses) dynamited for their support of
temperance.(6) </p>

<p> Without a doubt, advocating prohibition was a dangerous
business for some of its agitators. On the other hand, the
temperance advocates seemed not to have engaged in violence
against their enemies. I know of no prohibitionist who engaged in
violence to the point of killing to bring about their goal of a
dry nation. Some prohibitionists, Carry Nation being the most
prominent though certainly not alone, did engage in direct action
against liquor sellers, destroying their place of business and
their stock through violent means. Assaults on people sometimes
emerged from such attacks. But such &quot;hatchetation&quot;
aside, the prohibitionists did not seem to engage violence that
could lead to killing. I would like to is explain two things.
First, why the violence against drys has received so little
attention. And second, explain the relative dearth of righteous
violence by drys. </p>

<p> Why does the scholarly literature not contain much
information on the topic of violence against prohibitionist
agitators? One explanation can be dismissed out of hand, that is
that those who the opponents perpetuated their deeds against were
too obscure to make an impact. Among the six prohibitionist
killed, are a doctor, a judge, a minister, four editors of reform
or other newspapers (including the minister), and a United States
Senator. (The Senator is Edward Carmack of Tennessee.) If you
turn toward those who suffered assaults or mobbing for agitation
on the temperance question, the trend is similar with editors and
ministers predominating. Those attacked included figures of some
renown in temperance history; for example Albert Banks-clergyman,
dry editor, and propagandist- was shot and wounded and Samuel W.
(&quot;Sam&quot;) Small- journalist, dry, and evangelist-was
mobbed and beaten. The violence occurred in all areas of the
nation, though the South and West seem disproportionally
represented, and extended from the decade after the Civil War
through the second decade of the 20th century. It should appear
much more prominently in the scholarly literature. </p>

<p> Two general causes seem to explain why the violence against
prohibitionists for their agitation has received so little
attention. First, contentions from the time of the killing or
other violence that the violence had nothing to do with
prohibition may have led scholars not to consider the topic.
Second, and more importantly, there was little place for accounts
of such violence in the evolving scholarly interpretations of
prohibition. </p>

<p> I know of at least one example of a dry killed over his
advocacy of prohibition where non-prohibitionists sources
asserted that he &quot;was not slain because of his convictions
but&quot; because of a &quot;personal difficulty.&quot;(7) If
other killings and attacks have similar conflicting accounts (and
logic would indicate that they should, as it was in the interests
of the opponents of prohibition to downplay violence against
their enemies) it is likely that scholars have been misdirected
away from the topic of violence against dry agitators. But, there
is little evidence that scholars have paid any attention to the
topic at all. </p>

<p> While scholarly interpretations of prohibition have changed
dramatically over time, all of them share the trait that they
either have little room in their frameworks for discussions of
violence or have a tendency to turn scholars away from approaches
and sources that would explore issues violence. Since World War
II, scholarly interpretations of prohibition have been marked by
two large trends. First, there is the focus on the social status
of the members of the movement.(8) Second, there is the question
of how, if at all, prohibition related to the reform movements of
the day: populism, progressivism, and women's rights.(9) Scholars
working in the field have thus tended to mine the sources to
answer questions about these concerns. Thus by combing membership
rolls, church records, tax records, census data, and other
sources they have told us much about the social status of the
prohibitionists. Similarly in exploring the links between
anti-monopolism, regulation, peace reform, women's suffrage,
divorce reform, and anti-prostitution (just to name some)
scholars have illuminated the connections of the movement to
other reforms. But in doing these things they have mostly
eschewed writing narratives of movement history that would have
confronted the sources that raise the questions of violence
against drys and violence by drys.(10) It is to violence by drys
that I would like to turn now. </p>

<p> One thing is clear about violence by drys: there was no dry
equivalent to John Brown, there was no dry equivalent to Michael
F. Griffin or John Salvi The closest that the prohibition
movement ever came to such figures was Carry Nation. Nation's
trashing of saloons is the stuff of American legend and folklore.
Moreover it has been the subject of some scholarly work.(11) Thus
a look at Nation and her movement in the context of the righteous
violence of other movements is illuminating. </p>

<p> When we talk about figures in reform movements adopting
violence, two things stand out. First that they believed that
their violence is justified; violence-even killing-has become an
acceptable means of bringing about the change that they want.
Second, they act violently because they perceive that their
movement is loosing ground. Hence John Brown's moral certainty of
the evil of slavery and belief that sin could only be expatiated
by the spilling of blood convinced him that violence was
acceptable. He, in turn, convinced others to fight and kill with
him in Kansas and Virginia because, after the Compromise of 1850
with its Fugitive Slave Law and the Kansas Nebraska Act repealing
the Missouri compromise, for the abolitionists crusade their
enemies seemed to have gained the upper hand.(12) Similarly, the
justifiable homicide argument used by the advocates of violence
in the anti-abortion movement give them a moral base for their
actions.(13) Significantly, also, the first killing by
anti-abortionists came after it became clear that the Supreme
Court was not going to overturn <i>Roe v. Wade</i> </p>

<p> , the second came after a pro-abortion candidate was elected
president. How do these two factors, developing a view that see
the violence as acceptable and acting out of fear of failure of
the reform play out in the prohibition movement and in the career
of Carry Nation? </p>

<p> There was a potential for developing an ideology of righteous
violence, in the prohibition movement. And evidence of it does
not rest alone on the career of Carry Nation. Before I turn to
Nation and her ideas for justifying her violence, let me turn to
another source that show that drys did enunciate such ideas. The
1915 novel <i>Quarrytown</i>, written by Douglas Dobbins and
published by the American Issue Publishing (the press of company
of the Anti-Saloon League) shows community organized righteous
violence in a favorable light. In this fictionalized account of
the struggle against the return of saloons to a stone quarrying
town, the drys ultimately resort to violence. </p>

<p> At the opening the town is dry and virtually free of crime.
But the dry utopia vanishes, as neither law nor community action
offer adequate protection from the evil trade. Drys fail to block
the issuing of a liquor license at a state liquor licensing board
(dominated by politicians beholden to the organized liquor
interest), a dry organized boycott falters when its denounced by
a new editor of the town's newspaper, and citizen prosecutions of
the saloon keeper for violations of the law falter before
corrupted juries. Thus the saloon spreads crime and disorder
throughout the community, literally turning brother against
brother in drunken brawls. After all other means have been tried
the dry townsmen resort to violence. One night after the saloon
is shut, they engage a Boston Tea Party type raid on it,
destroying its fixtures and stock. When the newspaper editor
condemns the act as lawlessness he is ostracized by the town.
When the saloon keeper rebuilds, the temperance men of the town
blow up the establishment with three separate dynamite bombs, the
first being set away from where the proprietor slept to allow him
time to escape. Moreover, the local minister preached a sermon in
advance of the act calling for the blowing up of &quot;every
hell-hole in the United States tomorrow with dynamite!&quot; And
in case the message was not clear, the dynamite works. The saloon
keeper never came back and the town was the better for it: no
murders, or assaults, no wife beatings, and no squandering of
food and education money on whisky occur within its borders.(14) </p>

<p> Without ever saying it in so many words, this publication of
the Anti-Saloon League legitimated violence against saloons. But
it did so in a rather limited way. Violence was not the first
resort, but the last resort for the drys of Quarrytown. Its only
because law and boycotts have failed them, and only after liquor
begins to wreck havoc in their community do they take action. And
their first action, does not threaten life or limb. Even the
bombing is planned to allow the saloon keeper to escape harm.
Similarly, Carry Nation carried the conviction that her violence
was justified and resorted to violence only after other means had
failed. </p>

<p> Once you get past the myth and hype, Nation's short career as
a saloon smasher is revealing of the potential of righteous
violence in the prohibition movement. Nation captured the
national imagination in 1900 when she began single-handedly
destroying dives in Kansas. Her actions were quickly overshadowed
by the hucksterism to which she resorted to keep her agitation
going: the selling of hatchets and the appearances at resorts
like Coney Island. She remained a national figure until her death
in 1911. Nation was motivated, like many drys, by a personal
religious belief that liquor selling was sinful. Indeed, in her
autobiography she recounting receiving visions from God showing
her the evils of liquor. And she adopted violence only after
other she had tried other means.(15) </p>

<p> In 1900 Nation lived in state that had a two decade old, and
widely violated, policy of prohibition. Moreover, it must of have
seemed to her that the temperance movement was in a rut. In her
town of Medicine Lodge, working with the WCTU she closed the
town's seven bars through the tried a true techniques of the
women's crusade of 1873: picketing with song, prayer, and moral
appeals to the sellers and purchasers. These were techniques that
had been used against legal saloons, in Kansas there were nothing
but illegal ones. Moreover, for a decade now in Kansas the policy
had been widely violated, often with the contrivances of the
state's political leaders. And at the national level the
temperance movement was stalled. Between 1889 and 1907 no state
adopted prohibition. WCTU had lost its driving force with the
death of Frances Willard in 1898 and the Prohibition Party had
splintered into two warring camps. The leading temperance
organizations seemed unable to advance the cause or indeed to
stop the rollback movements in various states with prohibition.
Hence, with conviction, and at a time when the movement was
faltering, Nation turned away from moral suasion and turned to
violence. As she explained, &quot;If there's anything that's weak
and worse than useless it's this moral suasion. I despise it.
these hell traps of Kansas have fattened for twenty years on
moral suasion.&quot;(16) </p>

<p> And her violence struck a chord among some temperance
advocates. While some debated the value of violence, others
joined Nation. She soon headed an organization of several hundred
similarly minded saloon foes. And, in a two month period,
following her lead this group, and others, engaged in vigilante
action against saloons in Kansas's major cities, Topeka and
Wichita. Mobbings and riots swept the cities; people were beaten
and shots were fired in anger. And among some temperance workers
the violence was welcome. One woman letter writer to a WCTU paper
wrote: &quot;What if a few people do get killed[?] . . . I'm
tired of this sentimental gush about 'stopping before it comes to
bloodshed. . . .' I for one, hope a thousand more of them will be
smashed in Kansas before she stops.&quot; The response to Nation,
shows that the potential for righteous violence existed in the
temperance crusade.(17) </p>

<p> Which raises new questions: Why was there only one Carry
Nation? Part of the answer lays in the changing circumstances of
the prohibition movement. Soon after Nation's actions in Kansas,
the Anti-Saloon League emerged as the dominate organization in
the temperance movement. And the League's techniques of political
lobbying, official law enforcement, and public opinion building
changed the fortunes of the crusade. For example, take the topic
of national legislation; the League's Washington Office, between
1902 and 1919, pressured the United States Congress to enact laws
that: prohibited the sale of liquor in federal buildings, banned
the transport of liquor through the mails, ended liquor sales in
national soldiers' homes, retained a law excluding all alcoholic
beverages from Army posts, created Oklahoma as a dry state, and
limited and then prohibited the transportation of liquor into dry
states. A similar record of success can be found in the
prohibitionists' campaigns in the states in the same period.(18)
The very success of the drys in gaining what they wanted through
the political process made righteous violence redundant. </p>

<p> This pattern of potential righteous violence in the
prohibition crusade and the mostly unstudied violence used
against drys by their opponents, suggest that we need to look
more deeply into prohibition as a reform movement. As Robin Room
wrote over twenty years ago, &quot;we must attempt to understand
the antiliquor movement . . . as a massive, sustained organized
effort with a highly developed set of tactics and coherent,
tangible goals.&quot; (19) Indeed, if we seek a usable past, one
that might help deal with current social reform crusades, say
against abortion or cigarettes, it is imperative that we look,
far deeper than I have here, into tactics, strategies, and
contexts, of the temperance crusade to see how they prompted or
retarded violence. </p>

<h2>Notes </h2>

<p> (1) Typical of the treatment of the topic of violence and the
prohibitionists can be found in examining the three available
surveys of the movement's history. Norman Clark, <i>Deliver Us
From Evil: An Interpretation of American Prohibition</i>(New
York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1976) and Paul Aaron and David
Musto, &quot;Temperance and Prohibition In America: A Historical
Overview&quot; in Mark H. Moore and Dean Gernstein, eds., <i>Alcohol
and Public Policy: Beyond the Shadow of Prohibition</i>
(Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 1981), 127-181 devote no
space to the topic. Jack S. Blocker, Jr. <i>American Temperance
Movements: Cycles of Reform</i>(Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1989),
30- 34, 59-64, 74-79 mentions violence in connection with
enforcement of the Maine Law and in the direct action of the
women's crusades of 1873 and their precursors. Moreover, Mark
Lender, editor, <i>Dictionary of American Temperance Biography</i>
(Westport CT: Greenwood Press, 1984) does not contain a sketch of
any prohibitionists killed, either as response to agigation or
because law enforcement activities. </p>

<p> Three works discuss the role of violence associated with
temperance reform. Jed Dannebaum, <i>Drink and Disorder:
Temperance Reform in Cincinnati from the Washington Revival to
the WCTU</i> (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press,
1984) and Jack S. Blocker Jr., <i>&quot;Give to the Winds Thy
Fears&quot;: The Women's Temperance Crusade, 1873-1874</i>
(Westport, CN: Greenwood Press, 1985); Robert Bader, <i>Prohibition
in Kansas</i> (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1986). </p>

<p> On liquor law enforcement before national prohibition see:
Stephen Cresswell, <i>Mormons, Cowbosy, Moonshiners, and
Klansmen: Federal Law Enforcment in the South and West, 1870-
1893</i> (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1991); William
F. Holmes, &quot;Moonshining and Collective Violence: Georgia,
1889- 1895,&quot; <i>Journal of American History</i> 67 (1980):
589-611; William F. Holmes, &quot;Whitecapping: Agrarian Violence
in Mississippi, 1902-1906,&quot; <i>Journal of Southern History</i>
35 (1969): 165-185; Wilbur R. Miller, <i>Revenuers and
Moonshiners: Enforcing Federal Liquor Law in the Mountain South,
1865-1900</i> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press,
1991). </p>

<p> (2) Indeed, certain killings connected to the civil rights
crusade have been used to illuminate the very nature of the
movement and its opponents. See for example, Seth Cagin and
Philip Dray, <i>We Are Not Afraid: The Story of Goodman,
Schwerner and Chaney and the Civil Rights Campaign for
Mississippi</i> (New York: Bantam Books, 1988) and Herbert
Shapiro, <i>White Violence and Black Response From Reconstruction
to Montgomery</i> (Amherst: University of Massachsetts Press,
1988). </p>

<p> (3)On the topic of abolitionist violence and their reactions
to violence see, Jane H. Pease and William Pease,
&quot;Confrontation and Abolition in the 1850s,&quot; <i>Journal
of American History</i> 58 (1972): 923-937; John Demos, &quot;The
Antislavery Movement and the Problem of Violent 'Means,'&quot; <i>New
England Quarterly</i> 37 (1964): 501-526; Lewis Perry, <i>Radical
Abolitionism: Anarchy and the Government of God in Antislaery
Thought</i> (Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 1973); Michael
Fellman, &quot;Rehearsal for the Civil War: Antislavery and
Proslavery at the Fighting Point in Kansas, 1854-1856,&quot; in
Lewis Perry and Michael Fellman, <i>Antislavery Reconsidered: New
Perspectives on the Abolitionists</i> (Baton Rouge: Louisiana
University Press, 1979), 287-307; Silvan S. Tomkins, &quot;The
Psychology of Commitment: The Constructive Role of Violence and
Suffering for the Individual and for His Society, in Martin
Duberman, editor, <i>The Antislavery Vanguard: New Essays on the
Abolitionists</i> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1965),
270-298. On violence directed against abolitionists see <i>&quot;Gentleman
of Property and Standing:&quot; Anti-Aboliton Mobs in Jacksonian
America</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1970). Beyond
specific works that deal with violence, three surveys of the
abolitionist crusade show how intergal the topics of violence are
to the reform's history as they devote attention to both the
violence against and by abolitionists: Ronald G. Walters, <i>The
Antislavery Appeal: American Abolitionism After 1830</i> (New
York: Norton, 1978); Merton L. Dillon, <i>The Abolitionists: the
Growth of a Dissenting Minority</i> (Dekalb: Northern Illinois
University Press, 1974) and James B. Stewart, <i>Holy Warriors:
The Abolitionists and American Slavery</i> (New York: Hill and
Wang, 1976). </p>

editors, <i>The Pocket Cyclopedia of Temperance</i> (Topeaka:

for example see 85, and 1800-1801, &amp; 2133 (bible story); even
midway through the crusade, drys were recording the suffering of
their martyrs, see: <i>Cyclopaedia of Temperance and Prohibition</i>
(New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1891), 201-202. </p>

<p> (5) The list, derrived from <i>SEAP</i> and <i>Pocket</i>
includes: Dr. J. W. Beal and Judge D. R. Cox both killed in
Malden, Missouri on Februray 18 1907; Edward W. Carmack, United
States Senator from Tennessee, shot November 9, 1908 in
Nashville; Sam D. Cox, editor and publisher of <i>The Sentinel</i>
killed in Minatare, Nebraska on December 20 1906: Roderick D.
Gambrell, editor of <i>The Sword and Shield</i> killed in
Jackson, Mississippi on May 5, 1887; Rev. John R. Moffett, editor
of <i>Anti-Liquor</i> shot on November 11, 1892 in Danville
Virginia; and Joseph B. Rucker editor of the <i>Somerset Reporter</i>
killed in Somerset, Kentucky on September 19, 1892. Two of these
killings have received scholarly treatment, Paul Isaac, <i>Prohibition
and Politics: Turbulent Decades in Tennessee, 1885-1920</i>
(Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1965) and Richard F.
Hamm, &quot;The Killing of John R. Moffett and the Trial of J. T.
Clark: Race, Prohibition, and Politics in Danville,
1887-1893,&quot; <i>Virginia Magazine of History and Biography</i>
101 (1993): 375-404 </p>

<p> (6) This is the case of John R. Moffett, for details see:
Hamm, &quot;Killing.&quot; The assertion that Moffett did not die
for his convictions generated a controversy between the slain
man's brother and William Copeland, editor of the Danville paper
at Moffett's death and later editor of the <i>Times Dispatch</i>.

<p> (7) After the pioneering work of Joseph Gusfield on the
social status of temperance reformers, scholars rushed to test
this theory, and for nearly a generation, the study of
prohibition focused, as the title of one article put it, on
&quot;The Prohibitionists Who Were They?&quot; Joseph R.
Gusfield, <i>Symbolic Crusade: Status Politics and the American
Temperance Movement</i> (Urbana: University of Illinois Press,
1963); Jack Blocker, Jr. &quot;Modernity of Prohibitionists&quot;
and Charles A. Isetts, &quot;A Social Profile of WCTU Crusade:
Hillsboro, Ohio&quot; in Jack Blocker Jr., ed., <i>Alcohol Reform
and Society: the Liquor Issue in Social Context</i> (Westport,
CN: Greenwood Press, 1979), 99-110, 149-170; Robert A. Hohner,
&quot;The Prohibitionists: Who Were They?&quot; <i>South Atlantic
Quarterly</i> 68 (1969): 491-505; Jack S. Blocker Jr., <i>&quot;Give
to the Winds Thy Fears&quot;: The Women's Temperance Crusade,
1873-1874</i> (Westport, CN: Greenwood Press, 1985). The salience
of relgious idenity and the prohibition issue emerged as a topic
in political histories. Richard Jenson, <i>The Winning of the
Midwest, Social and Political Conflict, 1888-1896 </i>(Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1971); Paul Kleppner, <i>The Cross
of Culture: A Social Analysis of Midwestern Politics, 1885-1900</i>
(New York: MacMillian Free Press, 1970); Jed Dannebaum,
&quot;Immigrants and Temperance: Ethnocultural Conflict in
Cincinnati, 1845-1860&quot; <i>Ohio History</i> 87 (Autumn 1978):
125-139. </p>

<p> (8) On the issue of whether prohibition should be considered
a progressive reform, Richard Hofstader in <i>The American
Political Tradition</i> (New York: Vintage Books, 1954) and in <i>Age
of Reform</i> (New York: Vintage Books, 1955) and Andrew
Sinclair, <i>Era of Excess: A Social History of the Prohibition
Movement</i> (New York: Harper and Row, 1962) argued no. John
Burnham in &quot;New Perspectives on the Prohibition 'Experiment'
of the 1920s&quot; <i>Journal of Social History </i>2 (1968):
51-68; and James Timberlake in <i>Prohibition and the Progressive
Movement, 1900-1920</i> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,
1963) challenged that view. Jack S. Blocker, Jr., <i>Retreat from
Reform: The Prohibition Movement in the United States, 1890-1913</i>
(Westport: Greenwood Press, 1976) plotted the temperance
movement's abandonment of broader social reform to concentrate on
prohibition alone. Works by, Norman Clark and Austin Kerr,
utilizing the organizational interpretation of Robert Wiebe,
placed prohibition firmly within the panapoly of progressive
reforms. See Clark, <i>Deliver Us From Evil</i>; K. Austin Kerr, <i>Organized
for Prohibition: A New History of the Anti-Saloon League</i> (New
Haven, CN: Yale University Press, 1985). On the organizational
interpretation see: Louis Galambos, &quot;The Emerging
Organizational Synthesis of Modern American History,&quot; <i>Business
History Review</i> 44 (Autumn 1980): 279-90; Samuel P. Hays, <i>Response
to Industrialism, 1885-1914</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago
Press, 1957), 48- 70; Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., <i>The Visible
Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business</i>
(Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1977); Louis Galambos,
&quot;Technology, Political Economy, and Professionalization:
Central Themes of the Organizational Synthesis,&quot; <i>Business
History Review</i> 57 (Winter 1983): 471-93. Recently, the work
on temperance reform has focused on its relationship with larger
question of reform in the history of women. Ruth Bordin, <i>Woman
and Temperance </i>(Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1981),
15-33; Barbara Leslie Epstein, <i>The Politics of Domesticity:
Women, Evangelism and Temperance in Nineteenth Century America</i>
(Middletown, CN: Wesleyan University Press, 1981, 1986); Ruth
Bordin, <i>Francis Willard: A Biography</i> (Chapel Hill, NC:
University of North Carolina Press, 1986); Ian Tyrrell, <i>Woman's
World Woman's Empire: the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in
International Perspective, 1880-1930</i> (Chapel Hill, NC:
University of North Carolina Press, 19. </p>

<p> (9) I am as guilty as any other scholar in the field, see
Richard F. Hamm, <i>Shaping the Eighteenth Amendment: Temperance
Reform, Legal Culture, and the Polity, 1880-1920</i> (Chapel
Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1995). We do not have a
good modern history of the Prohibition Party, though Blocker, <i>Retreat</i>
is a good start; similarily WCTU histories have tended to trail
off with Frances Willard's death. Where such narratives are to be
found are in the local studies of an area or region. Local
studies which have looked at the mechanics of the movement like
Robert L. Hampel, <i>Temperance and Prohibition in Massachusetts,
1813- 1852</i> (Ann Arbor, MI: UMI Research Press, 1982); have
often focused on areas that did not have significant outbreaks of
violence during temperance agitation. </p>

<p> (10) The only full length biolgraphies of Nation are old and
negative, Herbert Asbury, <i>Carry Nation</i> (New York: Knopf,
1929) and Robert Lewis Taylor, <i>Vessel of Wrath: The Life and
Times of Carry Nation</i> (New York: Signet Books, 1966). The
recent work by Robert Bader is more sympathic and connects her
clearly to events in Kansas. Robert S. Bader, &quot;Mrs.
Nation,&quot; <i>Kansas History</i> 7 (1984/5): 246-262; and <i>Prohibition,
</i>133-155. Nation is desperately in need of a biography which
could use the insights of women's history, gender relations, and
temperance studies to illuminate her career. The place to begin
such a reinterpretation of Nation is her autobiography, Carry A.
Nation, <i>The Use and Need of the Life of Carry A. Nation</i>
(Topeka, KA: F. M. Stevens and Sons, 1909). </p>

<h1>Hemp Around Their Necks</h1>

<p> From The Murderers </p>

<p> THE STORY OF THE NARCOTIC GANGS </p>

<p> By HARRY J. ANSLINGER </p>

<p> U. S. Commissioner of Narcotics </p>

<p> and WILL OURSLER </p>

<p> FARRAR, STRAUS AND CUDAHY, NEW YORK, 1961 </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> In 1930 there was no federal law against smoking marijuana,
and the average American citizen in an average community had
probably never heard of &quot;reefers&quot; or &quot;tea&quot; or
other words in the argot of marijuana users. But by the middle
thirties we began to see the serious effects of marijuana on our
youth. An alarming increase in the smoking of marijuana reefers
in 1936 continued to spread at an accelerated pace in 1937.
Before this, use of reefers had been relatively slight and
confined to the the Southwest, particularly along the Mexican
border. </p>

<p> Seizures by state officers in these two years, however, had
increased a hundred percent and by hundreds of pounds. Reports I
received from thirty states showed an &quot;invasion&quot; by
this drug, either by cultivation or underworld importation. </p>

<p> Marijuana was something new and adventuresome. The angle-wise
mobsters were aiming their pitch straight at the most
impressionable age group-America's fresh, post-depression crop of
teenagers. </p>

<p> One adolescent gave a picture to an agent of a typical
&quot;smoker&quot; in an apartment or &quot;pad&quot;: </p>

<p> &quot;The room was crowded. There were fifty people but it
seemed like five hundred. It was like crazy, couples lying all,
over the place, a woman was screaming out in the hall, two,
fellows were trying to make love to the same girl and this, girl
was screaming and crying and not making any sense. Her clothes
were mostly pulled off and she was snickering and blubbering and
trying to push these two guys away.... The place was nothing but
smoke and stink and these funny little noises I could hear but
they were way out, that far I could hardly hear them and they
were right there in the room, that laughing and crying and the
music and all that stuff. It was crazy wild. But I didn't want to
do anything, I didn't want to sleep with those women or like
that. I just wanted to lie down because the room seemed big and
Eke a great tremendous crowd like at a ball game or something. .
. .&quot; </p>

<p> Made from the hemp plant known as Cannabis sativa americana,
marijuana is almost a twin brother to Cannabis sativa indica,
otherwise called hashish. There are said to be almost three
hundred names for the varieties of the hemp weed. In some parts
of Asia it is called bhang; in South Africa it is called dagga.
It is also challed chira and ganja. And many other names. </p>

<p> The hemp weed grows best in warm climates but has also been
found along roadsides north of Boston. It grows to heights of
from five and a half to fifteen or sixteen feet. Its leaves,
seeds and flowers contain a substance which when chewed or smoked
produces hallucinatory effects. </p>

<p> Elaborate technical processes have been developed for the
manufacture of Cannabis cigarettes from the resin in the plants.
Although pharmacists have never been able to isolate completely
the nature of the Cannabis &quot;principal&quot; that produces
the narcotic effect, it is known to exist in the fringes or hairs
on the leaves and in the flowers, and in the thick resin that
flows through the stalk and other parts of the plant. </p>

<p> Cannabis grows wild in many parts of the world, and is
cultivated in India, and illegally in certain areas of Africa,
Mexico, Brazil and the United States. It also grows wild in parts
of the United States, although we have been able to root the wild
Cannabis out of most communities. </p>

<p> Origins of hemp weed are ancient. Rites that go back
thousands of years, in temples long vanished, may wen have
evolved around the effects of some variant of the hemp weed.
Worshipers of the Hindu god Siva were said to use Cannabis
indica. In the eleventh century A.D., the Mohammedan sect called
the Assassins, used hashish in so-called religious observances.
They made homicide a high ritualistic art. Their name itself is
today a synonym for murder. </p>

<p> Marijuana effects on the average user are described in a
brochure we published in the Bureau for the information of lay
groups. &quot;The toxic effect produced by the active narcotic
principle of Cannabis sativa, hemp, or marijuana,&quot; the
report states, &quot;appear to be exclusively to the higher nerve
centers. The drug produces first an exhaltation with a feeling of
well being, a happy, jovial mood, usually; an increased feeling
of physical strength and power, and a general euphoria is
experienced. Accompanying this exaltation is a stimulation of the
imagination followed by a more or less delirious state
characterized by vivid kaleidoscopic visions, sometimes of a
pleasing sensual kind, but occasionally of a gruesome nature.
Accompanying this delirious state is a remarkable loss in spatial
and time relations; persons and things in the environment look
small; time is indeterminable; seconds seem like minutes and
hours like days. </p>

<p> &quot;Those who are accustomed to habitual use of the drug
are said eventually to develop a delirious rage after its
administration during which they are temporarily, at least,
irresponsible and prone to commit violent crimes. The prolonged
use of this narcotic is said to produce mental
deterioration.&quot; </p>

<p> One of the great difficulties with Cannabis is its
unpredictability. Physicians who have made hundreds of tests with
Cannabis report that there is no way to predict what effect it
have on the individual, both under controlled and noncontrolled
conditions. One man has no reaction at all; the next may go
berserk and try to stab somebody or harm himself. The medical
profession after many such experiments was forced to drop the
narcotic as a possible analgesic because of this unpredictable
quality. </p>

<p> Much of the most irrational juvenile violence and that has
written a new chapter of shame and tragedy is traceable directly
to this hemp intoxication. A gang of boys tear the clothes from
two school girls and rape the screaming girls, one boy after the
other. A sixteen-year-old kills his en tire family of five in
Florida, a man in Minnesota puts a bullet through the head of a
stranger on the road; in Colorado husband tries to shoot his
wife, kills her grandmother instead and then kills himself. Every
one of these crimes had been proceeded (sic) </p>

<p> by the smoking of one or more marijuana &quot;reefers.&quot;
As the marijuana situation grew worse, I knew action had to be
taken to get the proper legislation passed. By 1937 under my
direction, the Bureau launched two important steps First, a
legislative plan to seek from Congress a new law that would place
marijuana and its distribution directly under federal control.
Second, on radio and at major forums, such that presented
annually by the New York Herald Tribune, I told the story of this
evil weed of the fields and river beds and roadsides. I wrote
articles for magazines; our agents gave hundreds of lectures to
parents, educators, social and civic leaders. In network
broadcasts I reported on the growing list of crimes, including
murder and rape. I described the nature of marijuana and its
close kinship to hashish. I continued to hammer at the facts. </p>

<p> I believe we did a thorough job, for the public was alerted
and the laws to protect them were passed, both nationally and at
the state level. We also brought under control the wild growing
marijuana in this country. Working with local authorities, we
cleaned up hundreds of acres of marijuana we and uprooted plants
sprouting along the roadsides. </p>

<p> The 1937 law does not prohibit the sale of marijuana b puts a
tax of $100.00 an ounce on any sale or transfer of drug and makes
such sale or transfer illegal without proper registration and
approval from the Bureau. Possession without proper authorization
can bring a prison term. </p>

<p> The Marijuana Tax Act is patterned in general after the
Harrison Act, but with some major technical variations,
principally based on the fact that while marijuana is used in
laboratory tests it is not used for medical purposes. </p>

<p> There were still some WPA gangs working in those days and we
put them to good use. just outside the nation's capital, for some
sixty miles along the Potomac River, on both banks, marijuana was
growing in profusion; it had been planted there originally by
early settlers who made their own hemp and cloth. The workers
cleaned out tremendous river bank crops, destroying plants, seeds
and roots. AR through the Midwest also, WPA workers were used for
this clean-up job. The. wild hemp was rooted out of America. </p>

<p> During the Second World War, after Axis powers in the Far
East and Europe cut off our access to countries where hemp was
grown for the making of cord and cloth, we developed, under
strict controls, our own hemp growing program on the rich
farmlands of Minnesota. Less than one thousandth of one percent
was ever diverted into illegal channels. After the war this
production stopped and the fields went back to ,corn and wheat.
With the war's end, however, the narcotic branch of the
underworld was given a new lift by the publication of an
extraordinary document which has come to be known as the La
Guardia Report. </p>

<p> The title was a misnomer, it was actually a report of a
committee on marijuana which had been appointed by the
&quot;Little Flower&quot; of New York to give an objective
picture of marijuana from a scientific point of view. La Guardia
was always not only an honest official who warred against the
syndicate &quot;tin horns,&quot; as he called them, but was also
a good friend of Bureau of Narcotics. In Congress he fought
consistently for increases for our Bureau to help us to achieve
the power needed to do our job. </p>

<p> The men who issued this document were men of science doctors,
technicians, authorities Published as a book by the Jacques
Cattell Press in 1945, the report bore the tide: The Marijuana
Problem in the City of New York: Sociologic Medical,
Psychological and Pharmacological Studies, by the Mayor's
Committee on Marijuana. </p>

<p> This report declared, in effect, that those who had been
denouncing marijuana as dangerous, including myself and experts
in the Bureau, were not only in error, but were spreading
baseless fears about the effects of smoking Cannabis. I say the
report was a government printed invitation to youth and
adults-above all to teenagers-to go ahead and smoke all the
reefers they felt like. </p>

<p> Relying solely on a series of experiments with a group of 77
prisoners who volunteered to make the tests, the Mayor's experts
asserted that they found no major menace in the use of this
narcotic, which they termed &quot;a mild drug smoked by bored
people for the sake of conviviality.&quot; </p>

<p> The report further claimed that there was &quot;no
apparent&quot; connection between &quot;the weed&quot; and crimes
of violence, that smoking it did not produce aggressiveness or
belligerence as a rule, that it could be used for a number of
years without causing serious mental or physical harm and that
while it might be habit forming it could be given up abruptly
without causing distress; in other words, it did not produce the
bodily dependence found in heroin, cocaine, morphine and other
drugs. </p>

<p> Finally, the report suggested that the drug is so mild that
it might well be used successfully as a substitute in the process
of curing addiction to other drugs, or even in the treatment of
chronic alcoholism. </p>

<p> Doctors and other authorities who studied the effects of this
drug, however, tore the report apart for its inaccuracies and
misleading conclusions. The Journal of the American Medical
Association joined the. Bureau in condemning it as unscientific. </p>

<p> &quot;For many years medical scientists have considered
Cannabis a dangerous drug,&quot; the Journal's editorial of April
26, 1945 stated. &quot;Nevertheless. . . . the Mayor's Committee
on Marijuana submits an analysis by seventeen doctors of tests on
77 prisoners and, on this narrow and thoroughly unscientific
foundation, draws sweeping and inadequate conclusions which
minimize the harmlessness of marijuana. Already the book has done
harm. One investigator has described some tearful parents who
brought their 16-year-old boy to a physician after he had been
detected in the act of smoking marijuana. . . . The boy said he
had read an account of the La Guardia committee report and this
was his justification for using marijuana.. </p>

<p> A criminal lawyer for marijuana drug peddlers has already
used the La Guardia report as a basis to have defendants set free
by the Court. </p>

<p> &quot;The value of the conclusions,&quot; continued the
editorial, &quot;is destroyed by the fact that the experiments
were conducted on 77 confined criminals. Prisoners were obliged
to be content with the quantities of drug administered.
Antisocial behavior could not have been noticed, as they were
prisoners. At liberty some of them would have given free rein to
their inclinations and would probably not have stopped at the
dose producing 'the pleasurable principle. . . .' Public
officials will do well to disregard this unscientific, uncritical
study, and continue to regard marijuana as a menace where it is
purveyed,&quot; the Journal concluded. </p>

<p> There can be no doubt of the damage done by the report.
Syndicate lawyers and spokesmen leaped upon its giddy sociology
and medical mumbo-jumbo, cited it in court cases, tried to spread
the idea that the report had brought marijuana back into the
folds of good society with a full pardon and a slap on the back
front the medical profession. </p>

<p> The lies continued to spread. They cropped up on panel
discussions, in public addresses by seemingly informed
individuals. They helped once again, in a new and profitable
direction, to bewilder the public and make it unsure of its own
judgments. This carefully nurtured public doubt was to pay off
with extra millions in the pockets of the hoods. One killer who
helped to nourish that doubt-a hoodlum called Lepke took a
multi-million-dollar cut in exchange for the terror inspired by
the mere mention of his name.<br>

<h1>Confessions of an English Opium Eater </h1>

<p> <b>by Thomas de Quincey</b> </p>

<p> <b>THE PLEASURES OF OPIUM</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> It is so long since I first took opium, that if it had been a
trifling incident in my life, I might have forgotten its date:
but cardinal events are not to be forgotten; and from
circumstances connected with it, I remember that it must be
referred to the autumn of 1804. During that season I was in
London, having come thither for the first time since my entrance
at college. </p>

<p> And my introduction to opium arose in the following way. From
an early age I had been accustomed to wash my head in cold water
at least once a day: being suddenly seized with toothache, I
attributed it to some relaxation caused by an accidental
intermission of that practice; jumped out of bed; plunged my head
into a basin of cold water; and with hair thus wetted went to
sleep. </p>

<p> The next morning, as I need hardly say, I awoke with
excruciating rheumatic pains of the head and face, from which I
had hardly any respite for about twenty days. On the twenty-first
day, I think it was, and on a Sunday, that I went out into the
streets; rather to run away, if possible, from my torments, than
with any distinct purpose. By accident I met a college
acquaintance who recommended opium. Opium! dread agent of
unimaginable pleasure and pain! I had heard of it as I had of
manna or of Ambrosia, but no further: how unmeaning a sound was
it at that time! what solemn chords does it now strike upon my
heart! what heart-quaking vibrations of sad and happy
remembrances! Reverting for a moment to these, I feel a mystic
importance attached to the minutest circumstances connected with
the place and the time, and the man (if man he was) that first
laid open to me the Paradise of Opium-eaters. It was a Sunday
afternoon, wet and cheerless: and a duller spectacle this earth
of ours has not to show than a rainy Sunday in London. My road
homewards lay through Oxford-street; and near &quot;the /stately/
Pantheon,&quot; (as Mr. Wordsworth has obligingly called it) I
saw a druggist's shop. The druggist -- unconscious minister of
celestial pleasures! -- as if in sympathy with the rainy Sunday,
looked dull and stupid, just as any mortal druggist might be
expected to look on a Sunday; and, when I asked for the tincture
of opium, he gave it to me as any other man might do: and
furthermore, out of my shilling, returned me what seemed to be
real copper halfpence, taken out of a real wooden drawer.
Nevertheless, in spite of such indications of humanity, he has
ever since existed in my mind as the beatific vision of an
immortal druggist, sent down to earth on a special mission to
myself. And it confirms me in this way of considering him, that,
when I next came up to London, I sought him near the stately
Pantheon, and found him not: and thus to me, who knew not his
name (if indeed he had one) he seemed rather to have vanished
from Oxford-street than to have removed in any bodily fashion.
The reader may choose to think of him as, possibly, no more than
a sublunary druggist: it may be so: but my faith is better: I
believe him to have evanesced,{1} or evaporated. So unwillingly
would I connect any mortal remembrances with that hour, and
place, and creature, that first brought me acquainted with the
celestial drug. </p>

<p> Arrived at my lodgings, it may be supposed that I lost not a
moment in taking the quantity prescribed. I was necessarily
ignorant of the whole art and mystery of opium-taking: and, what
I took, I took under every disadvantage. But I took it: -- and in
an hour, oh! Heavens! what a revulsion! what an upheaving, from
its lowest depths, of the inner spirit! what an apocalypse of the
world within me! That my pains had vanished, was now a trifle in
my eyes: -- this negative effect was swallowed up in the
immensity of those positive effects which had opened before me --
in the abyss of divine enjoyment thus suddenly revealed. Here was
a panacea - a [pharmakon nepenthez] for all human woes: here was
the secret of happiness, about which philosophers had disputed
for so many ages, at once discovered: happiness might now be
bought for a penny, and carried in the waistcoat pocket: portable
ecstasies might be had corked up in a pint bottle: and peace of
mind could be sent down in gallons by the mail coach. But, if I
talk in this way, the reader will think I am laughing: and I can
assure him, that nobody will laugh long who deals much with
opium: its pleasures even are of a grave and solemn complexion;
and in his happiest state, the opium-eater cannot present himself
in the character of /Il Allegro/: even then, he speaks and thinks
as becomes /Il Penseroso/. Nevertheless, I have a very
reprehensible way of jesting at times in the midst of my own
misery: and, unless when I am checked by some more powerful
feelings, I am afraid I shall be guilty of this indecent practice
even in these annals of suffering or enjoyment. The reader must
allow a little to my infirm nature in this respect: and with a
few indulgences of that sort, I shall endeavour to be as grave,
if not drowsy, as fits a theme like opium, so anti-mercurial as
it really is, and so drowsy as it is falsely reputed. </p>

<p> And, first, one word with respect to its bodily effects: for
upon all that has been hitherto written on the subject of opium,
whether by travelers in Turkey (who may plead their privilege of
lying as an old immemorial right), or by professors of medicine,
writing /ex cathedra/, -- I have but one emphatic criticism to
pronounce -- Lies! lies! lies! I remember once, in passing a
book-stall, to have caught these words from a page of some
satiric author: -- &quot;By this time I became convinced that the
London newspapers spoke truth at least twice a week, viz. on
Tuesday and Saturday, and might safely be depended upon for --
the list of bankrupts.&quot; In like manner, I do by no means
deny that some truths have been delivered to the world in regard
to opium: thus it has been repeatedly affirmed by the learned,
that opium is a dusky brown in colour; and this, take notice, I
grant: secondly, that it is rather dear; which I also grant: for
in my time, East-India opium has been three guineas a pound, and
Turkey eight: and, thirdly, that if you eat a good deal of it,
most probably you must -- do what is particularly disagreeable to
any man of regular habits, viz. die.{2} These weighty
propositions are, all and singular, true: I cannot gainsay them:
and truth ever was, and will be, commendable. But in these three
theorems, I believe we have exhausted the stock of knowledge as
yet accumulated by man on the subject of opium. And therefore,
worthy doctors, as there seems to be room for further
discoveries, stand aside, and allow me to come forward and
lecture on this matter. </p>

<p> First, then, it is not so much affirmed as taken for granted,
by all who ever mention opium, formally or incidentally, that it
does, or can, produce intoxication. Now reader, assure yourself,
/meo periculo/, that no quantity of opium ever did, or could
intoxicate. As to the tincture of opium (commonly called
laudanum) /that/ might certainly intoxicate if a man could bear
to take enough of it; but why? because it contains so much proof
spirit, and not because it contains so much opium. But crude
opium, I affirm peremptorily, is incapable of producing any state
of body at all resembling that which is produced by alcohol; and
not in /degree/ only incapable, but even in /kind/: it is not in
the quantity of its effects merely, but in the quality, that it
differs altogether. The pleasure given by wine is always
mounting, and tending to a crisis, after which it declines: that
from opium, when once generated, is stationary for eight or ten
hours: the first, to borrow a technical distinction from
medicine, is a case of acute - the second, of chronic pleasure:
the one is a flame, the other a steady and equable glow. But the
main distinction lies in this, that whereas wine disorders the
mental faculties, opium, on the contrary (if taken in a proper
manner), introduces amongst them the most exquisite order,
legislation, and harmony. Wine robs a man of his self possession:
opium greatly invigorates it. Wine unsettles and clouds the
judgment, and gives a preternatural brightness, and a vivid
exaltation to the contempts and the admirations, the loves and
the hatreds, of the drinker: opium, on the contrary, communicates
serenity and equipoise to all the faculties, active or passive:
and with respect to the temper and moral feelings in general, it
gives simply that sort of vital warmth which is approved by the
judgment, and which would probably always accompany a bodily
constitution of primeval or antediluvian health. Thus, for
instance, opium, like wine, gives an expansion to the heart and
the benevolent affections: but then, with this remarkable
difference, that in the sudden development of kind-heartedness
which accompanies inebriation, there is always more or less of a
maudlin character, which exposes it to the contempt of the
by-stander. Men shake hands, swear eternal friendship, and shed
tears -- no mortal knows why: and the sensual creature is clearly
uppermost. But the expansion of the benigner feelings, incident
to opium, is no febrile access, but a healthy restoration to that
state which the mind would naturally recover upon the removal of
any deep- seated irritation of pain that had disturbed and
quarrelled with the impulses of a heard originally just and good.
True it is, that even wine, up to a certain point, and with
certain men, rather tends to exalt and to steady the intellect: I
myself, who have never been a great wine-drinker, used to find
that half a dozen glasses of wine advantageously affected the
faculties -- brightened and intensified the consciousness -- and
gave to the mind a feeling of being &quot;ponderibus librata
suis:&quot; and certainly it is most absurdly said, in popular
language, of any man, that he is /disguised/ in liquor: for, on
the contrary, most men are disguised by sobriety; and it is when
they are drinking (as some old gentleman says in Athenaeus), that
men [eantonz emfanixondin oitinez eidin]. -- display themselves
in their true complexion of character; which surely is not
disguising themselves. But still, wine constantly leads a man to
the brink of absurdity and extravagance; and, beyond a certain
point, it is sure to volatilize and to disperse the intellectual
energies: whereas opium always seems to compose what had been
agitated, and to concentrate what had been distracted. In short,
to sum up all in one word, a man who is inebriated, or tending to
inebriation, is, and feels that he is, in a condition which calls
up into supremacy the merely human, too often the brutal, part of
his nature: but the opium-eater (I speak of him who is not
suffering from any disease, or other remote effects of opium)
feels that the diviner part of his nature is paramount; that is,
the moral affections are in a state of cloudless serenity; and
over all is the great light of the majestic intellect. </p>

<p> This is the doctrine of the true church on the subject of
opium: of which church I acknowledge myself to be the only member
-- the alpha and the omega: but then it is to be recollected,
that I speak from the ground of a large and profound personal
experience: whereas most of the unscientific{3} authors who have
at all treated of opium, and even of those who have written
expressly on the materia medica, make it evident, from the horror
they express of it, that their experimental knowledge of its
action is none at all. I will, however, candidly acknowledge that
I have met with one person who bore evidence to its intoxicating
power, such as staggered my own incredulity: for he was a
surgeon, and had himself taken opium largely. I happened to say
to him, that his enemies (as I had heard) charged him with
talking nonsense on politics, and that his friends apologized for
him, by suggesting that he was constantly in a state of
intoxication from opium. Now the accusation, said I, is not
/prima facie/, and of necessity, an absurd one: but the defence
/is/. To my surprise, however, he insisted that both his enemies
and his friends were in the right: &quot;I will maintain,&quot;
said he, &quot;that I /do/ talk nonsense; and secondly, I will
maintain that I do not talk nonsense upon principle, or with any
view to profit, but solely and simply, said he, solely and
simply, -- solely and simply (repeating it three times over),
because I am drunk with opium; and /that/ daily.&quot; I replied
that, as to the allegation of his enemies, as it seemed to be
established upon such respectable testimony, seeing that the
three parties concerned all agreed in it, it did not become me to
question it; but the defence set up I must demur to. He proceeded
to discuss the matter, and to lay down his reasons: but it seemed
to me so impolite to pursue an argument which must have presumed
a man mistaken in a point belonging to his own profession, that I
did not press him even when his course of argument seemed open to
objection: not to mention that a man who talks nonsense, even
though &quot;with no view to profit,&quot; is not altogether the
most agreeable partner in a dispute, whether as opponent or
respondent. I confess, however, that the authority of a surgeon,
and one who was reputed a good one, may seem a weighty one to my
prejudice: but still I must plead my experience, which was
greater than his greatest by 7000 drops a day; and, though it was
not possible to suppose a medical man unacquainted with the
characteristic symptoms of vinous intoxication, it yet struck me
that he might proceed on a logical error of using the word
intoxication with too great latitude, and extending it
generically to all modes of nervous excitement, connected with
certain diagnostics. Some people have maintained, in my hearing,
that they had been drunk on green tea: and a medical student in
London, for whose knowledge in his profession I have reason to
feel great respect, assured me, the other day, that a patient, in
recovering from an illness, had got drunk on a beef-steak. </p>

<p> Having dwelt so much on this first and leading error, in
respect to opium, I shall notice very briefly a second and a
third; which are, that the elevation of spirits produced by opium
is necessarily followed by a proportionate depression, and that
the natural and even immediate consequence of opium is torpor and
stagnation, animal and mental. The first of these errors I shall
content myself with simply denying; assuring my reader, that for
ten years, during which I took opium at intervals, the day
succeeding to that on which I allowed myself this luxury was
always a day of unusually good spirits. </p>

<p> With respect to the torpor supposed to follow, or rather (if
we were to credit the numerous pictures of Turkish opium-eaters)
to accompany the practice of opium-eating, I deny that also.
Certainly, opium is classed under the head of narcotics; and some
such effect it may produce in the end: but the primary effects of
opium are always, and in the highest degree, to excite and
stimulate the system: this first stage of its action always
lasted with me, during my novitiate, for upwards of eight hours;
so that it must be the fault of the opium-eater himself if he
does not so time his exhibition of the dose (to speak medically)
as that the whole weight of its narcotic influence may descend
upon his sleep. Turkish opium-eaters, it seems, are absurd enough
to sit, like so many equestrian statues, on logs of wood as
stupid as themselves. But that the reader may judge of the degree
in which opium is likely to stupify the faculties of an
Englishman, I shall (by way of treating the question
illustratively, rather than argumentively) describe the way in
which I myself often passed an opium evening in London, during
the period between 1804-1812. It will be seen, that at least
opium did not move me to seek solitude, and much less to seek
inactivity, or the torpid state of self- involution ascribed to
the Turks. I give this account at the risk of being pronounced a
crazy enthusiast or visionary: but I regard /that/ little: I must
desire my reader to bear in mind, that I was a hard student, and
at severe studies for all the rest of my time: and certainly had
a right occasionally to relaxations as well as the other people:
these, however, I allowed myself but seldom. </p>

<p> The late Duke of Norfolk used to say, &quot;Next Friday, by
the blessing of Heaven, I purpose to be drunk:&quot; and in like
manner I used to fix beforehand how often, within a given time,
and when, I would commit a debauch of opium. This was seldom more
than once in three weeks: for at that time I could no have
ventured to call every day (as I did afterwards) for &quot;/a
glass of laudanum negus, warm, and without sugar/.&quot; No: as I
have said, I seldom drank laudanum, at that time, more than once
in three weeks: this was usually on a Tuesday or a Saturday
night; my reason for which was this. In those days Grassini sang
at the Opera: and her voice was delightful to me beyond all that
I had ever heard. I know not what may be the state of the Opera-
house now, having never been within its walls for seven or eight
years, but at that time it was by much the most pleasant place of
public resort in London for passing an evening. Five shillings
admitted one to the gallery, which was subject to far less
annoyance than the pit of the theatres: the orchestra was
distinguished by its sweet and melodious grandeur from all
English orchestras, the composition of which, I confess, is not
acceptable to my ear, from the predominance of the clangorous
instruments, and the absolute tyranny of the violin. The choruses
were divine to hear: and when Grassini appeared in some
interlude, as she often did, and poured forth her passionate soul
as Andromache, at the tomb of Hector, &amp;c. I question whether
any Turk, of all that ever entered the Paradise of opium-eaters,
can have had half the pleasure I had. But, indeed, I honour the
Barbarians too much by supposing them capable of any pleasures
approaching to the intellectual ones of an Englishman. For music
is an intellectual or a sensual pleasure, according to the
temperament of him who hears it. And, by the bye, with the
exception of the fine extravaganza on that subject in Twelfth
Night, I do not recollect more than one thing said adequately on
the subject of music in all literature: it is a passage in the
/Religio Medici/{4} of Sir T. Brown; and, though chiefly
remarkable for its sublimity, has also a philosophic value,
inasmuch as it points to the true theory of musical effects. The
mistake of most people is to suppose that it is by the ear they
communicate with music, and, therefore, that they are purely
passive to its effects. But this is not so: it is by the
re-action of the mind upon the notices of the ear, (the /matter/
coming by the senses, the /form/ from the mind) that the pleasure
is constructed: and therefore it is that people of equally good
ear differ so much in this point from one another. Now opium, by
greatly increasing the activity of the mind generally, increases,
of necessity, that particular mode of its activity by which we
are able to construct out of the raw material of organic sound an
elaborate intellectual pleasure. But, says a friend, a succession
of musical sounds is to me like a collection of Arabic
characters: </p>

<p> I can attach no ideas to them. Ideas! my good sir? there is
no occasion for them: all that class of ideas, which can be
available in such a case, has a language of representative
feelings. But this is a subject foreign to my present purposes:
it is sufficient to say, that a chorus, &amp;c. of elaborate
harmony, displayed before me, as in a piece of arras work, the
whole of my past life -- not, as if recalled by an act of memory,
but as if present and incarnated in the music: no longer painful
to dwell upon: but the detail of its incidents removed, or
blended in some hazy abstraction; and its passions exalted,
spiritualized, and sublimed. All this was to be had for five
shillings. And over and above the music of the stage and the
orchestra, I had all around me, in the intervals of the
performance, the music of the Italian language talked by Italian
women: for the gallery was usually crowded with Italians: and I
listened with a pleasure such as that with which Weld the
traveller lay and listened, in Canada, to the sweet laughter of
Indian women; for the less you understand of a language, the more
sensible you are to the melody or harshness of its sounds: for
such a purpose, therefore, it was an advantage to me that I was a
poor Italian scholar, reading it but little, and not speaking it
at all, nor understanding a tenth part of what I heard spoken. </p>

<p> These were my Opera pleasures: but another pleasure I had
which, as it could be had only on a Saturday night, occasionally
struggled with my love of the Opera; for, at that time, Tuesday
and Saturday were the regular Opera nights. On this subject I am
afraid I shall be rather obscure, but, I can assure the reader,
not at all more so than Marinus in his life of Proclus, or many
other biographers and auto-biographers of fair reputation. This
pleasure, I have said, was to be had only on a Saturday night.
What then was Saturday night to me more than any other night? I
had no labours that I rested from; no wages to receive: what
needed I to care for Saturday night, more than as it was a
summons to hear Grassini? True, most logical reader: what you say
is unanswerable. And yet so it was and is, that, whereas
different men throw their feelings into different channels, and
most are apt to show their interest in the concerns of the poor,
chiefly by sympathy, expressed in some shape or other, with their
distresses and sorrows, I, at that time, was disposed to express
my interest by sympathising with their pleasures. The pains of
poverty I had lately seen too much of; more than I wished to
remember: but the pleasures of the poor, their consolations of
spirit, and their reposes from bodily toil, can never become
oppressive to contemplate. </p>

<p> Now Saturday night is the season for the chief, regular, and
periodic return of rest to the poor: in this point the most
hostile sects unite, and acknowledge a common link of
brotherhood: almost all Christendom rests from its labours. It is
a rest introductory to another rest: and divided by a whole day
and two nights from the renewal of toil. On this account I feel
always, on a Saturday night, as though I also were released from
some yoke of labour, had some wages to receive, and some luxury
of repose to enjoy. For the sake, therefore, of witnessing, upon
as large a scale as possible, a spectacle with which my sympathy
was so entire, I used often, on Saturday nights, after I had
taken opium, to wander forth, without much regarding the
direction or the distance, to all the markets, and other parts of
London, to which the poor resort on a Saturday night, for laying
out their wages. Many a family party, consisting of a man, his
wife, and sometimes one or two of his children, have I listened
to, as they stood consulting on their ways and means, or the
strength of their exchequer, or the price of household articles.
Gradually I became familiar with their wishes, their
difficulties, and their opinions. Sometimes there might be heard
murmurs of discontent: but far oftener expressions on the
countenance, or uttered in words, of patience, hope, and
tranquility. And taken generally, I must say, that, in this point
at least, the poor are far more philosophic than the rich - that
they show a more ready and cheerful submission to what they
consider as irremediably evils, or irreparable losses. Whenever I
saw occasion, or could do it without appearing to be intrusive, I
joined their parties; and gave my opinion upon the matter in
discussion, which, if not always judicious, was always received
indulgently. If wages were a little higher, or expected to be so,
or the quartern loaf a little lower, or it was reported that
onions and butter were expected to fall, I was glad: yet, if the
contrary were true, I drew from opium some means of consoling
myself. For opium (like the bee, that extracts its materials
indiscriminately from roses and from the soot of chimneys) can
overrule all feelings into a compliance with the master key. </p>

<p> Some of these rambles led me to great distances: for an
opium-eater is too happy to observe the motion of time. And
sometimes in my attempts to steer homewards, upon nautical
principles, by fixing my eye on the pole-star, and seeking
ambitiously for a north-west passage, instead of circumnavigating
all the capes and head-lands I had doubled in my outward voyage,
I came suddenly upon such knotty problems of alleys, such
enigmatical entries, and such sphynx's riddles of streets without
thoroughfares, as must, I conceive, baffle the audacity of
porters, and confound the intellects of hackney- coachmen. I
could almost have believed, at times, that I must be the first
discoverer of some of these /terrae incognitae/, and doubted,
whether they had yet been aid down in the modern charts of
London. For all this, however, I paid a heavy price in distant
years, when the human face tyrannized over my dreams, and the
perplexities of my steps in London came back and haunted my
sleep, with the feeling of perplexities moral or intellectual,
that brought confusion to the reason, or anguish and remorse to
the conscience. </p>

<p> Thus I have shown that opium does not, of necessity, produce
inactivity or torpor; but that, on the contrary, it often led me
into markets and theatres. Yet, in candour, I will admit that
markets and theatres are not the appropriate haunts of the
opium-eater, when in the divinest state incident to his
enjoyment. In that state, crowds become an oppression to him;
music even, too sensual and gross. He naturally seeks solitude
and silence, as indispensable conditions of those trances, or
profoundest reveries, which are the crown and consummation of
what opium can do for human nature. I, whose disease it was to
meditate too much, and to observe too little, and who, upon my
first entrance at college, was nearly falling into a deep
melancholy, from brooding too much on the sufferings which I had
witnessed in London, was sufficiently aware of the tendencies of
my own thoughts to do all I could to counteract them. -- I was,
indeed, like a person who, according to the old legend, had
entered the cave of Trophonius: and the remedies I sought were to
force myself into society, and to keep my understanding in
continual activity upon matters of science. But for these
remedies, I should certainly have become hypochondriacally
melancholy. In after years, however, when my cheerfulness was
more fully re-established, I yielded to my natural inclination
for a solitary life. And, at that time, I often fell into these
reveries upon taking opium; and more than once it has happened to
me, on a summer-night, when I have been at an open window, in a
room from which I could overlook the sea at a mile below me, and
could command a view of the great town of Liverpool, at about the
same distance, that I have sate, from sun-set to sun-rise,
motionless, and without wishing to move. </p>

<p> I shall be charged with mysticism, behmenism, quietism,
&amp;c. but /that/ shall not alarm me. Sir H. Vane, the younger,
was one of our wisest men: and let my readers see if he, in his
philosophical works, be half as unmystical as I am. -- I say,
then, that it has often struck me that the scene itself was
somewhat typical of what took place in such a reverie. The town
of Liverpool represented the earth, with its sorrows and its
graves left behind, yet not out of sight, nor wholly forgotten.
The ocean, in everlasting but gentle agitation, and brooded over
by a dove-like calm, might not unfitly typify the mind and the
mood which then swayed it. For it seemed to me as if then first I
stood at a distance, and aloof from the uproar of life; as if the
tumult, the fever, and the strife, were suspended; a respite
granted from the secret burthens of the heart; a sabbath of
repose; a resting from human labours. Here were the hopes which
blossom in the paths of life, reconciled with the peace which is
in the grave; motions of the intellect as unwearied as the
heavens, yet for all anxieties a halcyon calm: a tranquility that
seemed no product of inertia, but as if resulting from mighty and
equal antagonisms; infinite activities, infinite repose. </p>

<p> Oh! just, subtle, and mighty opium! that to the hearts of
poor and rich alike, for the wounds that will never heal, and for
&quot;the pangs that tempt the spirit to rebel,&quot; bringest
and assuaging balm; eloquent opium! that with thy potent rhetoric
stealest away the purposes of wrath; and to the guilty man, for
one night givest back the hopes of his youth, and hands washed
pure from blood; and to the proud man, a brief oblivion for
Wrongs unredress'd, and insults unavenged; that summonest to the
chancery of dreams, for the triumphs of suffering innocence,
false witnesses; and confoundest perjury; and dost reverse the
sentences of unrighteous judges: -- thou buildest upon the bosom
of darkness, out of the fantastic imagery of the brain, cities
and temples, beyond the art of Phidias and Praxiteles -- beyond
the splendour of Babylon and Hekatompylos: and &quot;from the
anarchy of dreaming sleep,&quot; callest into sunny light the
faces of long-buried beauties, and the blessed household
countenances, cleansed from the &quot;dishonours of the
grave.&quot; Thou only givest these gifts to man; and thou hast
the keys of Paradise, oh, just, subtle, and mighty opium! </p>

<p> ----- </p>

<p> {1} /Evanesced:/ -- this way of going off the stage of life
appears to have been well known in the 17th century, but at the
time to have been considered a peculiar privilege of blood-royal,
and by no means to be allowed to druggists. For about the year
1686, a poet of rather ominous name (and who, by the bye, did
ample justice to his name), viz. Mr. Flat-man, in speaking of the
death of Charles II. expresses his surprise that any prince
should commit so absurd an act as dying; because, says he, </p>

<p> Kings should disdain to die, and only /disappear./ </p>

<p> They should /abscond/, that is, into the other world. </p>

<p> {2} Of this, however, the learned appear latterly to have
doubted: for in a pirated edition of Buchan's /Domestic
Medicine/, which I once saw in the hands of a farmer's wife who
was studying it for the benefit of her health, the Doctor was
made to say -- &quot;Be particularly careful never to take above
five- and-twenty /ounces/ of laudanum at once;&quot; the true
reading being probably five- and-twenty /drops/, which are held
equal to about one grain of crude opium. </p>

<p> {3} Amongst the great herd of travellers, &amp;c. who show
sufficiently by their stupidity that they never held any
intercourse with opium, I must caution my readers especially
against the brilliant author of /&quot;Anastasius.&quot;/ This
gentleman, whose wit would lead one to presume him an
opium-eater, has made it impossible to consider him in that
character from the grievous misrepresenta-tion which he gives of
its effects, at pp. 215-17, of vol. I. - Upon consideration it
must appear such to the author himself: for, waiving the errors I
have insisted on in the text, which (and others) are adopted in
the fullest manner, he will himself admit, that an old gentleman
&quot;with a snow-white beard,&quot; who eats &quot;ample doses
of opium,&quot; and is yet able to deliver what is meant and
received as very weighty counsel on the bad effects of that
practice, is but an indifferent evidence that opium either kills
people prematurely, or sends them into a madhouse. But, for my
part, I see into this old gentleman and his motives: the fact is,
he was enamoured of &quot;the little golden receptacle of the
pernicious drug&quot; which Anastasius carried about him; and no
way of obtaining it so safe and so feasible occurred, as that of
frightening its owner out of his wits (which, by the bye, are
none of the strongest). This commentary throws a new light upon
the case, and greatly improves it as a story: for the old
gentleman's speech, considered as a lecture on pharmacy, is
highly absurd: but, considered as a hoax on Anastasius, it reads
excellently. </p>

<p> {4} I have not the book at this moment to consult: but I
think the passage begins -- &quot;And even that tavern music,
which makes one man merry, another mad, in me strikes a deep fit
of devotion,&quot; &amp;c. <br>

<p> Another important claimant for credit in bringing about the
legislation was a young Conservative in Vancouver, H. H. Stevens.
Stevens became a very vocal MP during the narcotics debates of
the 1920s, and personally introduced several important
amendments. His zeal for narcotic drug prohibition was kindled
during his early investigations of the problem. </p>

<p> According to his own account, when he learned about the
gambling and opium trade being carried on in Vancouver's
Chinatown, he took the following actions: </p>

<p> I took it up with the Chief of Police, but he just brushed me
off. Then I went down into Chinatown itself, and visited the
gambling joints and also saw personally the Chinese preparing raw
opium for the market. When the Chief of Police refused to take
any action, I used to publish in the _Vancouver News Advertiser_
exactly what I had seen the night before. This I did for several
weeks. It created quite a sensation in Vancouver, and as a result
the civic authorities discharged the Chief and appointed Mr.
Chamberlain. This man, when he became Chief of Police, did an
excellent job in clearing up Chinatown(29). </p>

<p> He described his role in bringing about the first opium Act
as follows: </p>

<p> (In 1908) I was responsible for the matter being brought to
the attention of the then government. I remember taking some very
prominent eastern gentlemen around Pacific Coast cities and
showing them the effects and use of these drugs. They returned to
Ottawa and put it up to Sir Wilfred Laurier, and the result was
the Bill that was introduced(13d,p.2899). </p>

<p> &lt;SNIP&gt; </p>

<p> The motives of H. H. Stevens and of the city councils are
open to question. They appear in this instance to have been
concerned about moral reform and civic order but all were
associated with anti-Chinese policies in other contexts. Stevens
came to be recognized as the &quot;the city's leading
anti-Oriental spokesman&quot; (30, p.91), in Parliament as at
local rallies. Civic politicians, too, had an anti-Chinese
rhetoric as part of their election kit and, once elected, usually
supported the use of municipal ordinances and licensing powers
for discriminatory purposes. </p>

<p> &lt;SNIP&gt; </p>

<p> The League's (Vancouver Anti-Opium League) representations to
King(Mackenzie) included an urgent telegram at the time when the
Bill was being sent to the Senate and the opium manufacturers
were lobbying for a moratorium to protect their financial
interests. </p>

<p> INFORM GOVERNMENT NOT TO LET MANUFACTURERS DELAY LEGISTAION.
CHINESE AT LARGE FAVOUR IMMEDIATE SUPPRESSION(2d). </p>

<p> &lt;End pgs 66-68&gt; </p>

<p> &lt;Begin pg 203&gt; </p>

<p> THE PUBLIC </p>

<p> Interested sections of the public became very vocal and
active during the same period in in demanding more severe
penalties. The cry for heavier punishment was the result of a
drug scare created almost entirely by alarmist stories in the
mass media. The stories, of which Emily Murphy's articles in
_Maclean's_ were a prime example, reinforced pre-existing
hostility to Orientals and augmented the horrifying spectre of
the &quot;dope fiend.&quot; The negative racial stereotypes and
alarming drug mythology, spread by people who claimed to have
first-hand knowledge, were accepted uncritically. The immediate
result of these fears and hostility was the emergence of a
British Columbia drug lobby in 1921, with the straightforward
goals of compulsory imprisonment and whipping for all traffickers
and, where possible, deportation. Public fears about narcotic
drugs were particularly intense in British Columbia, the province
with the largest concentration of Chinese immigrants.
Accordingly, the greatest pressure on legislators for severe
penalties originated in that province. Much of the demand for
greater punitiveness was linked to animus against the Chinese and
a desire to get rid of them, seen most clearly in the proposal
for deportation. </p>

<p><font size="4">What Shall They Do to Be Saved?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I have just returned from forty-eight hours'
friendly and professional attendance at a bedside where I would
fain place every young person in this country for a single hour
before the Responsibilities of Life have become the sentinels and
Habit the jailor of his Will.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">My patient was a gentleman of forty, who for
several years of his youth occasionally used opium, and, for the
last eight has habitually taken it. During these eight years he
has made at least three efforts to leave it off, in each instance
diminishing his dose gradually for a month before its entire
abandonment, and in the most successful one holding the enemy at
bay but for a single summer. In two cases he had no respite of
agony from the moment he dropped till he resumed it. In the third
case, a short period of comparative repose succeeded the first
fiery battle, but in the midst of felicitations on his victory he
was attacked by the most agonizing hemicranial headaches
(resulting from what I now fear to have been already permanent
disorganization of the stomach), and went back to his nepenthe in
a state of almost suicidal despair, only after the torture had
continued for weeks without a moment's mitigation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">He had first learned its seductions, as happens
with the vast majority of Anglo-Saxon opium-eaters, through a
medical prescription. An attack of inflamed cornea was treated
with caustic applications, and the pian assuaged by internal
doses of M'Munn's Elixir. When my friend came out of his dark
room and bandages at the end of a month he had consumed twenty
ounces of this preparation, whose probable distinction from the
tincture known as laudanum I point out below in the note. [FN*]</font></p>

<p><font size="3">________</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* Mr. Frank A. Schlitz has kindly made for me a
special analysis of M'Munn's Elixir which seems to prove that the
process of its preparation amounts to more than the
denarcotization of opium, which is spoken of on the wrapper of
each vial. As nearly as can be ascertained, M'Munn's Elixir is
simply an aqueous infusion of opium--procured by the ordinary
maceration--and preserved from decomposing by the subsequent
addition of a small portion of alcohol. Narcotin being absolutely
insoluble in water is eliminated as the circular says. This face
along would not account for the difference between its action and
that of laudanum. This is explained by the fact that all the
other alkaloids possess diverse rates of solubility in water, and
exist in M'Munn's Elixir in very different relative proportions
from those which they bear to each other in the alcoholic
tincture called laudanum. _____</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Here it may not be superfluous to say that the
former preparation has all the essential properties of the
latter, save certain of the constipatory and stupefying
tendencies which, by a private process known to the assigns of
the inventor, have been so masked or removed that it possesses in
many cases an availableness which the practitioner can not
despise, though compelled by the secrecy of its formula to rank
it among quack medicines. The amount of it which my friend had
taken during this month's eclipse represents an ounce of dry gum
opium--in rough measurement a piece as large as a French billiard
ball. I thus particularize because he had never previously been
addicted to the drug; had inherited a sound constitution, and
differed from any other fresh subject only in the intensity of
his nervous temperament. I wish to emphasize the fact that the
system of a mere neophyte, with nothing to neutralize the effects
of the drug save the absorbency, so to speak, of the pain from
which it was given, could so rapidly adapt itself to them as to
demand an increase of the dose in such an alarming ratio. There
are certain men to whom opium is as fire to tow, and my friend
was one of these. On the 1st of October he sensibly perceived the
trifling dose of fifty drops; on the first of November he was
taking, without increased sensation, an ounce vial of
&quot;M'Munn&quot; daily.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">From that time--totally ignorant of the
terrible trap which lay grinning under the bait he dabbled
with--he continued to take opium at short intervals for several
years. When by the physician's orders he abandoned
&quot;M'Munn,&quot; on the subsidence of the eye-difficulty, his
symptoms were uneasy rather than distressing, and disappeared
after a few days' oppression at the pit of the stomach and a few
nights' troubled dreaming. But he had not forgotten the sweet
dissolving views at midnight, the great executive achievements at
noonday, the heavenly sense of a self-reliance which dare go
anywhere, say anything, attempt anything in the world. He had not
forgotten the nonchalance under slight, the serenity in pain, the
apathy to sorrow, which for one month set him calm as Boodh in
the temple-splendors of his darkened room. He had not forgotten
that the only perfect peace he had ever experienced was there,
and he remembered that peace as something which seemed to blend
all the assuaged passion and confirmed dignity of old age with
that energy of high emprise which thrills the nerves of manhood.
He had tasted as many sources of earthly pleasure as any man I
ever knew; but the ecstasies of form and color, wine, Eros,
music, perfume, all the luxuries of surrounding which wealth
could purchase or high-breeding appreciate, were as nothing to
him in comparison with the memory of that time on which his
family threw away their sympathy when they called it his
&quot;month of suffering.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Accordingly, without much more instinct of
concealment than if it were an occasional tendency to some slight
convivial excess, he had resort to M'Munn, in ounce doses,
whenever the world went wrong with him. If he had a headache or a
toothache; if the weather depressed him; if he had a certain
&quot;stint&quot; of work to do without the sense of native vigor
to accomplish it; if he was perplexed and wished to clear his
head of passion; if anxieties kept him awake; if irregularities
disturbed his digestion--he had always one refuge certain. No
fateful contingency could pursue him inside M'Munn's enchanted
circle. He was a young and wealthy bachelor, living the life of a
refined bon vivant; an insatiable traveler, surrounded by
flatterers, and without a single friend who loved him enough to
warn him of his danger excepting those who, like himself, were
too ignorant to know it. After three years of dalliance he became
an habitual user of opium, and had been one for eight years when
I was first called to him.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">By the time that the daily habit fastened
itself he had learned of other opiate preparations than M'Munn's,
and finding a certain insufficiency characterize that tincture as
he increased the size of the dose, had recourse to laudanum,
which contains the full native vigor of the drug unmodified. This
nauseated him. He had the same experience with gum opium, opium
pills, and opium powder; so that he was driven to that form of
exhibition which sooner or later naturally strikes almost every
opium-eater as the most portable, energetic, and
instantaneous--morphia or one of its salts. My friend usually
kept the simple alkaloid in a paper, and dissolved it as he
needed it in clear water, sometimes substituting an equivalent of
&quot;Magendie's Solution,&quot; which contains sixteen grams of
the salt diffused through an ounce of water by the addition of a
few drops of sulfuric acid. When I first saw him he had reached a
daily dose of twelve grains of sulphate of morphia, and on
occasions of high excitement had increased his dose without
exaggerating the sensible effect to nearly twenty. The twelve
which formed his habitual per diem were divided into two equal
doses, one taken immediately after rising, the other just before
sundown.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As yet he had not begun to feel the worst
physical effects which sooner or later visit the opium-eater. His
digestion seemed unimpaired so long as he took his morphia
regularly; he was sallow and somewhat haggard, but thus far no
distressing biliary symptoms had manifested themselves; his sleep
was always dreamy, and he woke at short intervals during the
night, but invariably slept again at once, and had so adjusted
himself to the habit as to show no signs of suffering from
wakefulness; his hand was steady; his muscular system easily
exhausted, but by no means what one would call feeble. As he
himself told me, he had come to the conclusion to emancipate
himself because opium-eating was a horrible mental bondage. The
physical power of the drug over him he only realized when
attempting its abandonment. Its spiritual thralldom was his
hourly misery. He was connected by blood and marriage with
several of the best families in the land. Money had not been
stinted in his education, and his capabilities were as great as
his advantages. He was one of the bravest, fairest, most generous
natures I ever came in contact with; was versatile as a Yankee
Crichton; had ridden his own horse in a trotting match and beaten
Bill Woodruff; had carried his own little 30-ton schooner from
the Chesapeake to the Golden Gate through the Straits of
Magellan; had swum with the Navigators' Islanders, shot buffalo,
hunted chamois, and lunched on mangosteens at Penang. Through all
his wanderings the loftiest sense of what was heroic in human
nature and divine in its purified form, the monitions of a most
tender conscience, and the echoes of that Puritan education which
above all other schemes of training makes human responsibility
terrible, had gone with him like his tissue. He saw the good and
great things within reach of a fulfilled manhood, and of a sudden
waked up to feel that they could on earth never be his. He was
naturally very truthful, and, although the invariable tendency of
opium-eating is to extirpate this quality, could not flatter
himself. Other minds around him responded to a sudden call as his
own did not. Every day the need of energy took him more by
surprise.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The image-graving and project-building
characteristic of opium, which comes on with a sense of genial
radiation from the epigastrium about a quarter of an hour after
the dose, had not yet so entirely disappeared from its effect on
him, as it always does at a later stage of the indulgence. But
instead of being an instigation to the delightful reveries which
ensued on his earlier doses, this peculiarity was now an
executioner's knot in the hands of Remorse. He was daily and
nightly haunted by plans and pictures whose feverish unreal
beauty he remembered having seen through a hundred times. Those
Fata Morgana plans, should he again waste on them the effort of
construction? The result had been a chaos of aimless, ineffectual
days. Those pictures, why were they brought again to mock him?
Were they not horrible impossibilities? Were they not, through
the paralysis of his executive faculties, mere startling
likenesses of Disappointment? In his opium dreams he had seen his
own ships on the sea; commerce bustling in his warehouse; money
overflowing in this bank; babies crowing on his knee; a wife
nestling at his breast; a basso voice of tremendous natural power
and depth scientifically cultivated to its utmost power of
pleasing artists or friends; a country estate on the Hudson, or
at Newport, with emerald lawns sloping down to the amber river on
the leek-green sea; the political and social influence of a great
landholder. How pleasurably he had once perceived all these
possible joys and powers! How undeludedly he now saw their
impossible execution!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">So, coming to me, he told me that his object in
trying to leave off opium was to escape from these horrible
ghosts of a life's unfulfilled promise. Only when he tried to
abandon opium did he realize the physical hold the drug had on
him. Its spiritual thralldom was his hourly misery.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For three months I tried to treat him in his
own house, here in the city. A practitioner of any experience
need not be told with what success. I could reduce him to a dose
of half a grain of sulphate of morphia a day, keep him there one
week, and making a morning call at the expiration of that time
discover that some nocturnal nervous paroxysm had necessitated
either a return to five grains or a use of brandy (which, though
no drinker, he tried to substitute) sufficient to demand a much
larger dose of opium in its reaction. He had lost most of his
near connections, and not for one hour could any hired attendant
have withstood his appeal, or that marvelous ingenuity by which,
without appeal, the opium-eater obtains the drug which, to him,
is like oxygen to the normal man.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This ingenuity manifests itself in subterfuges
of a complicated construction and artistic plausibility which
might have puzzled Richelieu; but it is really nothing to wonder
at when we recollect the law of nature by which any extreme
agony, so long as it continues remediable, sharpens and
concentrates all a man's faculties upon the one single object of
procuring the remedy. If my house is on fire, I run to the
hydrant by a mere automatic operation of my nerves. If my leg is
caught in the bite of a paying-out hawser, my whole brain focuses
at once on that single thought, &quot;an axe.' If I am enduring
the agony which opium alone can cause and cure, every faculty of
my mind is called to the aid of the tortured body which wants it.
When a man has used opium for a long time the condition of his
brain supervening on his deprivation of the drug for a period of
twenty-four hours is such as very frequently to render him
suicidal. Cottle tells us how Coleridge one day took a walk along
Bristol wharves, and sent his attendant down the pier to inquire
the name of a vessel, while he slipped into a druggist's on the
quay and bought a quart of laudanum; but in no fibre of his
nature could Cottle conceive the awful sense of a force
despotizing it over his will, a degradation descending on his
manhood, which Coleridge felt as he concentrated on that one
single cry of his animal nature and the laudanum which it spoke
for, fall the faculties of construction and insight which had
created the &quot;Ancient Mariner&quot; and the &quot;Aids to
Reflection.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Likewise I suppose there are very few people
who could patiently regard the fact that one of the very purest
and bravest souls I ever knew had become so demoralized by the
perseverance of disease and suffering as to deal like a lawyer
with his best friends, and shuffle to the very edge of falsehood,
when his nature clamored for opium. I was particular to tell him
whenever I detected any evasion (an occasion on which his shame
and remorse were terrible to witness) that I, personally, had
nonetheless respect for him. I knew he was dominated, and in no
sense more responsible for breaking his resolution than he would
have been had he vowed to hold his finger in the gas-blaze until
it burned off. In this latter case the mere translation of
chemical decomposition into pain, and round the automatic
nerve-arc into involuntary motion, would have drawn his finger
out of the blaze, as it did in the cases of Mutius Sevola and
Cranmer, if they ever attempted the feat credited them by
tradition. In his case the abandonment of opium brought on an
agony which took his actions entirely out of voluntary control,
eclipsing the higher ideals and heroisms of his imagination at
once, and reducing him to that automatic condition in which the
nervous system issues and enforces only those edicts which are
counseled by pure animal self- preservation. Whatever may have
been the patient's responsibility in beginning the use of
narcotics or stimulants (and I usually find, the case of
opium-eaters, that its degree has been very small indeed,
therapeutic use often fixing the habit forever before a patient
has convalesced far enough even to know what he is taking)
habituation invariably tends to reduce the man to the automatic
plane, in which the will returns wholly to the tutelage of
sensation and emotion, as it was in infancy; while all the
Intellectual, save Memory, and the most noble and imperishable
among the Moral faculties may survive this disorganization for
years, standing erect above the remainder of a personality
defrauded of its completion to show what a great and beautiful
house might have been built on such strong an shapely pillars.
Inebriates have been repeatedly known to risk imminent death if
they could not reach their liquor in any other way. The grasp
with which liquor holds a man when it turns on him, even after he
has abused it for a lifetime, compared with the ascendancy
possessed by opium over the unfortunate habituated to it for but
a single year, is as the clutch of an angry woman to the embrace
of Victor Hugo's Pieuvre. A patient whom, after habitual use of
opium for ten years, I met when he had spent eight years more in
reducing his daily dose to half a grain of morphia, with a view
to its eventual complete abandonment, once spoke to me in these
words:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;God seems to help a man in getting out of
every difficulty but opium. There you have to claw your way out
over red-hot coals on your hands and knees, and drag yourself by
main strength through the burning dungeon- bars.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This statement does not exaggerate the feeling
of many another opium- eater whom I have known.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Now, such a man is a proper subject, not for
reproof, but for medical treatment. The problem of his case need
embarrass nobody. It is as purely physical as one of small-pox.
When this truth is as widely understood among the laity as it is
known by physicians, some progress may be made in staying the
frightful ravages of opium among the present generation. Now,
indeed, it is a difficult thing to prevent relatives from
exacerbating the disorder and the pain of a patient, who, from
their uninformed standpoint, seems as sane and responsible as
themselves, by reproaches at which they would shudder, as at any
other cruelty, could they be brought to realize that their friend
is suffering under a disease of the very machinery of volition;
and no more to be judge harshly for his acts than a wound for
suppurating or the bowels for continuing the peristaltic motion.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Finding--as is common with all physicians I
have found so many times before--that no control of the case
could be obtained while the patient stayed at home, and deeply
renewing my often-experienced regret that the science and
Christian charity of this country have perfected no scheme by
which either inebriates or opium-eaters may be properly treated
in a special institution of their own, I was at length
reluctantly compelled to send my friend to an ordinary water-cure
at some distance from town.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The cause of my reluctance was not the prospect
of a too liberal use of water, for by arrangement with the heads
of the establishment I was able to control that as I chose;
moreover, an employment of the hot-bath in what would ordinarily
be excess is absolutely necessary as a sedative throughout the
first week of the struggle. I have had several patients whom
during this period I plunged into water at 110 degrees Fahrenheit
as often as fifteen times in a single day--each bath lasting as
long as the patient experienced relief. In some cases this
Elysium coming after the rack has been the only period for a
month in which the sufferer had anything resembling a doze. My
reluctance arose from the necessity of sending a patient in such
an advanced state of the opium disease so far away from me that I
must rely on reports written by people without my eyes, for
keeping personally au courant with the case; that I must consult
and prescribe by letter, subject to the execution of my plans by
men, who, though excellent and careful, were ignorant of my
theories of treatment, and had never made this particular disease
a specialty. I accordingly sent Mr. A. away to the water-cure,
all friendless and alone to fight the final battle of his life
against tougher odds than he had ever before encountered. At no
time in my life have I realized with greater bitterness the
helplessness of a practitioner who has no institution of his own
to take such cases to than when I shook his poor, dry sallow hand
and bade him goodbye at the station.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">As I said in the beginning, I am just home from
seeing the result. Mr. A. has fared as special cases always do
where there is no special provision for them. To speak plainly,
he had been badly neglected; and that, undoubtedly, without the
slightest intention on the part of the heads of the house to do
other than their duty. Six weeks ago I heard from the first
physician that any friend was entirely free from opium, and,
though still suffering, was steadily on the mend. I had no
further news from him till I was called to his bedside by a note
which said he feared he was dying, penciled in a hand as
tremulously illegible as the confession of Guy Fawkes. I was with
him by the earliest train I could take, after arranging with a
neighbor for my practice, and found him in a condition which led
him to say, as I myself said at the commencement of this article:
&quot;Would to God that every young person could stand for a
single hour by this bedside before Life's responsibilities have
become the sentinels and Habit the jailer of the Will!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I had not been intelligently informed
respecting the progress of his case. He had been better at no
time when I was told he was so, though his freedom from opium had
been of even longer duration than I was advised. For ninety days
he had been without opium in any form. The scope of so
untechnical an article leaves no room to detail what had been
done for him as alleviation. His prostration had been so great
that he could not correspond with me himself until the moment of
his absolutely extremity; and only after repeated entreaties to
telegraph to myself and his family had been refused on the ground
that his condition was not critical, he managed to get off the
poor scrawl which brought me to his side.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For the ninety days he had been going without
opium he had known nothing like proper sleep. I desire to be
understood with mathematical literalness. There had been periods
when he had been semi-conscious; when the outline of things in
his room grew vaguer and for five minutes he had a dull sensation
of not knowing where he was. This temporary numbness was the only
state which in all that time simulated sleep. From the hour he
first refused his craving, and went to the battlefield of bed, he
had endured such agony as I believe no man but the opium-eater
has ever known. I am led to believe that the records of fatal
lesion, mechanical childbirth, cancerous affection, the stake
itself, contains no greater torture than a confirmed opium-eater
experiences in getting free. Popularly this suffering is supposed
to be purely intellectual-- but nothing can be wider of the
truth. Its intellectual part is bad enough, but the physical
symptoms are appalling beyond representation. The look on the
face of the opium sufferer is indeed one of such keen mental
anguish that outsiders may well be excused for supposing that is
all. I shall never forget till my dying day that awful Chinese
face which actually made me rein my horse at the door of the
opium hong where it appeared, after a night's debauch, at six
o'clock one morning when I was riding in the outskirts of a
Pacific city. It spoke of such a nameless horror in its owner's
soul that I made the sign for a pipe and proposed, in
&quot;pigeon English,&quot; to furnish the necessary coin. The
Chinaman sank down on the steps of the hong, like a man hearing
medicine proposed to him when he was gangrened from head to foot,
and made a gesture, palms downward, toward the ground, as one who
said, &quot;It has done its last for me--I am paying the matured
bills of penalty.&quot; The man had exhausted all that opium
could give him; and now, flattery past, the strong one kept his
goods in peace. When the most powerful alleviative known to
medical science has bestowed the last Judas kiss which is
necessary to emasculate its victim, and, sure of the prey,
substitutes stabbing for blandishment, what alleviative, stronger
than the strongest, shall soothe such doom? I may give
chloroform. I always do in the denouement of bad
cases--ether--nitrous oxide. In employing the first two agents I
secure rest, but I induce death nine cases out of ten. Nothing is
better known to medical men than the intolerance of the system to
chloroform or ether after opium. Nitrous oxide I am still
experimenting with, but its simple undiffused form is too
powerful an agent to use with a patient who for many days must be
hourly treated for persevering pain. So the opium-eater is left
as entirely without anesthetic as the usual practice leaves him
without therapeutic means. Both here and abroad opium-eaters have
discovered the fact that, in an inveterate case, where opium
fails to act on the brain through the exhausted tissues of the
stomach, bichloride of mercury in combination with the dose
behaves like a mordant in the presence of a dye, and, so to
speak, precipitates opium upon the calloused surfaces of the
mucous and nervous layers. This expedient soon exhausts itself in
a death from colliquative diarrhea, produced partly by the final
decompositions of tissue which the poisonously antiseptic
property of opium has all along improperly stored away; partly by
the definite corrosions of the new addition to the dose. But in
no case is there any relief to a desperate case of opium-eating
save death.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Remembering that Chinaman's faced I can not
wonder at the popular notion regarding the abandonment of opium.
Men say it is a mental pain; because spiritual woe is the
expression of the sufferer's countenance. And so it is, but this
woe is underlain by the keenest brute suffering. Let me sketch
the opium-eater's experience on the rugged road upward.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Let us suppose him a resolute man, who means to
be free, and with that intent has reduced to a hundred drops the
daily dose which for several years had amounted to an ounce of
laudanum. I am not supposing an extreme case. An ounce of
laudanum is a small per diem for any man who has taken his
regular rations of the drug for a twelvemonth. In the majority of
cases I have found an old habitue's daily portion to exceed
three, or the equivalent of that dose in crude opium or morphia;
making seventy-two grains of the gum or twelve of its most
essential alkaloid. In one most interesting case I found a man
who having begun on the first of January with one half a grain of
sulphate of morphia for disease, at the end of March was, to all
appearance, as hopeless an opium-eater as ever lived, taking
thirty-two grains of the salt per day in the form of Magendie's
Solution. This, however, was an unusual case. According to my
experience the average opium-eater reaches twelve grains of
morphia [microfiche illegible]... and may live after that to
treble the amount: the worst case I ever knew attaining a dose of
ninety grains, or one and a half of the drachm vials ordinarily
sold. I am happy, in passing, to add that for more than two years
both the extreme cases just mentioned have been entirely cured.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If the opium-eater has been in the habit of
dividing his daily dose he begins to feel some uneasiness within
an hour after his first deprivation, but it amounts to nothing
more than an indefinite restlessness. In any case his first
well-marked opium torments occur early after he has been without
the drug for twenty-four hours.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At the expiration of that time he begins to
feel a peculiar corded and tympanic tightness about the
epigastrium. A feverish condition of the brain, which sometimes
amounts to absolute phantasia, now ensues, marked off into
periods of increasing excitement by a heavy sleep, which, after
each interval, grows fuller of tremendous dreams, and breaks up
with a more intensely irritable waking. I have held a man's hand
while he lay dreaming about the thirty-sixth hour of his
struggle. His eyes were closed for less than a minute by the
watch, but he awoke in a horrible agony of fear from what seemed
to have been a year-long siege of some colossal and demoniac
Vicksburg.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">After the opium-eater has been for forty-eight
hours without his solace this heavy sleep entirely disappears.
While it stays it never lasts over half an hour at a time, and is
so broken by the crash of stupendous visions as not to amount to
proper slumber. During its period of continuance the opium-eater
woos its approaches with an agony which shows his instinct of the
coming weeks of sleeplessness. It never rests him in any valid
sense. It is a congestive decomposition rather than any normal
reconstruction of the brain. He wakes out of it each time with a
heart more palpitating; in a perspiration more profuse; with a
greater uncertainty of sense and will; with a more confused
memory; in an intenser agony of body and horror of hopelessness.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Every nerve in the entire frame now suddenly
awakes with such a spasm of revivification that no parallel agony
to that of the opium-eater at this stage can be adduced, unless
it be that of the drowned person resuscitated by artificial
means. Nor does this parallel fully represent the suffering, for
the man resuscitated from drowning re-oxidizes all his surplus
carbon in a few minutes of intense torture, while the anguish
which burns away that carbon and other matter, properly effete,
stored away in the tissues by opium, must last for hours, days,
and weeks. Who is sufficient for this long, long pull?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">From the hour this pain begins to manifest
itself it continues (in any average case of a year's previous
habituation to the drug) for at least a week without one second's
lull or exhaustion. A man may catch himself dozing between spasms
of tic-douloureux or toothache; he never doubts whether he is
awake one instant in the first week after dropping his opium. One
patient whom I found years ago at a watercure followed the
watchman all night on crutches through his tour of inspection
around the establishment. Other people, after walking a long
time, shift from chair to chair in their rooms, talking to
anybody who may happen to be present in a low-voiced, suicidal
manner, which inexperience finds absolutely blood-freezing. Later
such rock to and fro, moaning with agony, for hours at a time,
but saying nothing. Still others go to their beds at once, and
lie writhing there until the struggle is entirely decided. I have
learned that this last class is generally the most hopeful.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The period during which this pain is to
continue depends upon two elements.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">1st. How long has the patient habitually taken
opium?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">2d. How much constitutional strength remains to
throw it off?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;How much has he taken in the
aggregate?&quot; is practically not an equivalent of the first
question. I have found an absolutely incurable opium-eater who
had never used more than ten grains of morphia per diem; but he
had been taking it habitually for a dozen years. In another case
the patient had for six months repeated before each meal the
ten-grain dose which served the other all day; but he was a man
whose pluck under pain equaled a woman's, and after a fortnight's
anguish of such horror that one could scarcely witness it without
being moved to tears came out into perfect freedom. The former
patient, although he had never in any one day experienced such
powerful effects from opium as the latter, had used the drug so
long that every part of his system had reconstructed itself to
meet the abnormal conditions, and must go through a second
process of reconstruction, without any anodyne to mask the pain
resulting from its decomposition, before it could again tolerate
existence of the normal kind. If opium were not an anodyne the
terrible structural changes which it works would cause no
surprise; it would be felt eating out its victim's life like so
much nitric acid. During the early part of the opium-eater's
career these structural changes go on with a rapidity which
partly accounts for the vast disengagements of nervous force, the
exhilaration, the endurance of effort, which characterize this
stage, later to be substituted by utter nervous apathy. By the
time the substitution occurs something has taken place throughout
the physical structure which may be rudely likened to the final
equilibrium of a neutral salt after the effervescence between an
acid and an alkali. So to speak, the tissues have now combined
with their full equivalent of all the poisonous alkaloids in
opium. Further use of it produces no new disengagements of
nervous force; the victim may double, quadruple his dose, but he
might as well expect further ebullition by adding more
aqua-fortis to a satisfied nitrate as to develop with opium
exhilarating currents in a tissue whose combination with that
drug have already reached their chemical limit. FN* _____ *FN I
say &quot;chemical&quot; because so much it is possible to known
experientally; and the very interesting examination of such
higher forces as constantly seem to intrude in any nervous
disturbance would here involve the discussion of a theoretical
&quot;vital principle&quot;-- something apart from and between
the soul and physical activities--which scientific men are
universally abandoning. ___</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The opium-eater now only continues his habit to
preserve the terrible static condition to which it has reduced
him, and to prevent that yet more terrible dynamic condition into
which he comes with every disturbance of equilibrium; a condition
of energetic and agonizing dissolutions which must last until
every fiber of wrongly changed tissue is burned up and healthily
replaced. Though I have called the early reactions of opium
rapid, they are necessarily much less so than those produced by a
simple chemical agent. No drug approaches it in the possession of
cumulative characteristics; its dependence on the time element
must therefore be always carefully considered in treating a case.
This fact leads us to understand the other element in the
question, how long the torments of the opium-fighter must
continue. Having ascertained the chronology of his case, we must
say, &quot;Given this period of subjection, has the patient
enough constitutional vigor left to endure the period of
reconstruction which must correspond to it?&quot; ** FN -------
** (FN) Not correspond day by day. At that rate a reforming
opium-eater (I use the particle in the physical sense, for very
few opium-eaters are more to blame than any other sick persons)
must pay a &quot;shent per shent&quot; which no constitution
could survive. The correspondence is simply proportional. -------</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I am naturally sanguine, and began my study of
opium-eaters with the belief that none of them were hopeless.
Experience has taught me that there is a point beyond which any
constitution--especially one so abnormally sensitive as the
opium-eater's--can not endure keen physical suffering without
death from spinal exhaustion. I once heard the eminent Dr.
Stevens say that he made it a rule never to attempt a surgical
operation if it must consume more than an hour. Similarly, I have
come to the conclusion never to amputate a man from his
opium-self if the agony must last longer than three months.
Uneasiness--corresponding to the irritations of dressing a
stump--may continue a year longer; and few victims of the habit
outlive a certain opium-prurience, which has also its analogue in
the occasional titillation of a healed wound--these are
comparatively tolerable; but, if we expect to save a patient's
life, we must not protract an agony which so absolutely
interferes with normal sleep as that of the opium-eater's for
longer than three months in the case of any constitution I have
thus far encountered.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Usually as early as the third day after its
abandonment (unless the constitution has become so impaired by
long habituation that there will probably be no vital reaction)
opium begins to show its dissolutions from the tissue by a
profuse and increasingly acrid bilious diarrhea, which must not
be checked if diagnosis has revealed sufficient constitutional
vigor to justify any attempt at abandonment of the drug.
Hemorrhoids may result; they must be topically treated; mild
astringents may be used when the tendency seems getting out of
eventual control; bland foods must be given as often as the
usually fastidious appetite will tolerate them; the only tonic
must be beef-tea--diffusible stimulus invariably increasing the
agony, whether in the form of ale, wine, or spirits. Short of
threatened collapse, the bowels must not be retarded. There is
nothing in the faintest degree resembling a substitute for opium,
but from time to time various alleviates, which can not be
discussed in an untechnical article, may be administered with
benefit. The spontaneous termination of the diarrhea will
indicate that the effete matters we must remove have been mainly
eliminated, and that we may shortly look for a marked mitigation
of the pain, followed by conditions of great debility but
increasingly favorable to the process of reconstruction. That
process, yet more than the alleviate, demands a book rather than
an article.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I have intentionally deferred any description
of the agony of the opium struggle as a sensation, until I
returned from depicting general symptoms, to relate the
particular case which is my text. The sufferings of the patient,
from whom I have just returned, are so comprehensive as almost to
be exhaustively typical.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">When simple nervous excitement had for two days
alternated with the already mentioned intervals of delirious
slumber, a dull, aching sensation began manifesting itself
between his shoulders and in the region of the loins. Appetite
for food had been failing since the first denial of that for
opium. The most intense gastric irritability now appeared in the
form of an aggravation of the typantic tightness, corrosive acid
ructations, heartburn, water-brash, and a peculiar sensation, as
painful as it is indescribable, of self-consciousness in the
whole upper part of the digestive canal. The best idea of this
last symptom may be found by supposing all the nerves of
involuntary motion which supply that tract with vitality,
suddenly to be gifted with the exquisite sensitiveness to their
own processes which is produced by its correlative object in some
organ of special sense--the whole organism assimilating itself to
a retina or a finger-tip. Sleep now disappeared. This initiated
an entire month during which the patient had not one moment of
even partial unconsciousness.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In less than a week from the beginning the
symptoms indicated a most obstinate chronic gastritis. There was
a perpetual sense of corrosion at the pit of the stomach very
like that which characterizes the fatal operation of arsenic.
There was less action of the liver than usually indicates a
salvable case, and no irritation of the lowest intestines. Pari
passu with the gastritic suffering, the neuralgic pain spread
down the extremities from an apparent center between the kidneys,
through the trunk, from another line near the left margin of the
liver, and through the whole medullary substance of the brain
itself. Although I was so unfortunate as not to be beside him
during this stage, I can still infallibly draw on my whole
experience for information regarding the intensity of this pain.
Tic-douloureux most nearly resembles it in character. Like that
agonizing affection, it has periods of exacerbation; unlike it,
it has no intervals of continuous repose. Like tic-douloureux,
its sensation is a curiously fluctuating one, as if pain had been
fluidized and poured in trickling streams through the tubules of
nerve tissue which are affected by it; but, unlike that, it
affects every tubule in the human body--not a single diseased
locality. Charles Reade chaffs the doctors very wittily in
&quot;Hard Cash&quot; on their penchant for the word
&quot;hyperaesthesia,&quot; but nothing else exactly defines that
exaggeration of nervous sensibility which I have invariably seen
in opium-eaters. Some of them were hurt by an abrupt slight
touch, and cried out at the jar of a heavy footstep like a
patient with acute rheumatism. Some developed sensitiveness with
the progress of expurgating the poison, until their very hair and
nails felt sore, and the whole surface of the skin suffered from
cold air or water like the lips of a wound. After all, utterly
unable to convey an idea of the kind of suffering, I must content
myself by repeating, of its extent, that no prolonged pain of any
kind known to science can equal it. The totality of the
experience is only conceivable by adding this physical torture to
a mental anguish which even the Oriental pencil of De Quincey has
but feebly painted; an anguish which slays the will, yet leaves
the soul conscious of its murder; which utterly blots out hope,
and either paralyzes the reasoning faculties which might suggest
encouragements, or deadens the emotional nature to them as
thoroughly as if they were not perceived; an anguish which
sometimes includes just, but always a vast amount of unjust
self-reproach which brings every failure and inconsistency, every
misfortune or sin of a man's life as clearly before his face as
on the day he was first mortified or degraded by it--before his
face, not in one terrible dream, which is once for all over with
sunrise, but as haunting ghosts, made out by the feverish eyes of
the soul down to the minutest detail of ghastliness, and never
leaving the side of the rack on which he lies for a moment of
dark or daylight, till sleep, at the end of a month, first drops
out of heaven on his agony.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A third element in the suffering must briefly
be mentioned. It results directly from the others. It is that
exhaustion of nervous power which invariably ensues on protracted
pain of mind or body. it proceeds beyond reaction to collapse in
a hopeless case; it stops this side of that in a salvable one.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On reaching his room I found my friend
bolstered upright in bed, with a small two-legged crutch at hand
to prop his head on when he became weary of the perpendicular
position. This had been his attitude for fifty days. Whether from
its impeding his circulation, the distribution of his nervous
currents, or both, the prostrate posture invariably brought on
cessation of the heart and the sense of intolerable strangling.
His note told me he was dying of heart disease, but, as I
expected, I found that malady merely simulated by nervous
symptoms, and the trouble purely functional. His food was
arrowroot or sago, and beef-tea. Of the vegetable preparation he
took perhaps half a dozen tablespoonfuls a day; of the animal
variable quantities, averaging half a pint per diem. This, though
small, was far from the minimum of nutriment upon which life has
been supported through the most critical periods. Indeed, I have
known three patients tided over stages of disease otherwise
desperately typhoid by beef-tea baths, in which the proportion of
ozmazone was just perceptible, and the sole absorbing agency was
a faint activity left in the pores of the skin. But these
patients had suffered no absolute disorganization. The
practitioner had to encounter a swift specific poison, not to
make over tissues abnormally misconstructed by its long insidious
action. On examination I discovered facts which I had often
feared, but never before absolutely recognized, in my friend's
case. The stomach itself, in its most irreproducible tissue, had
undergone a partial but permanent disorganization. The substance
of the organ itself had been altered in a way for which science
knows no remedy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Hereafter, then, it can only be rechanged by
that ultimate decomposition which men call death. Over the
opium-eater's coffin at least, thank God! a wife and sister can
stop weeping and say, &quot;He's free.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I called to my friend's bedside a consultation
of three physicians and the most nearly related survivor of his
family. I laid the case before them; assisted them to a full
prognosis; and invited their views. I spent two nights with my
friend. I have said that during the first month of trial he had
not a moment of even partial unconsciousness. Since that time
there had been perhaps ten occasions a day, when for a period
from one minute in length to five, his poor, pain-wrinkled
forehead sank on his crutch, his eyes fell shut, and to outsiders
he seemed asleep. But that which appeared sleep was internally to
him only one stupendous succession of horrors which confusedly
succeeded each other for apparent eternities of being, and ended
with some nameless catastrophe of woe or wickedness, in a waking
more fearful than the stage volcanically ruptured by it. During
the nights I sat by him these occasional relaxations, as I
learned, reached their maximum length, my familiar presence
acting as a sedative, but from each of them he woke bathed in
perspiration from sole to crown; shivering under alternate
flushes of chill and fever; mentally confused to a degree which
for half an hour rendered every object in the room unnatural and
terrible to him; with a nervous jerk, which threw him quite out
of bed, although in his waking state two men were requisite to
move him; and with a cry of agony as loud as any under
amputation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The result of our consultation was a unanimous
agreement not to press the case further. Physicians have no
business to consider the speculative question, whether death
without opium is preferable to life with it. They are called to
keep people on the earth. We were convinced that to deprive the
patient longer of opium would be to kill him. This we had no
right to do without his consent. He did not consent, and I gave
him five grains of morphia** FN ----- ** (FN) To the younger men
of the profession rather than to the public generally I need here
to say that this dose is not as excessive as it would naturally
appear to be in the case of a man who had used no form of opium
for ninety days. When you have to resume the drug go cautiously.
But you will generally find the amount of it required to produce
the sedative effects in any case which returns to opium, after
abandonment of a long habituation, startlingly large, and slow in
its effects. ----- between 8 and 12 o'clock on the morning of the
day I had to return here. He was obliged to eat a few mouthfuls
of sago before the alkaloid could act upon his nervous system. I
need only point out the significance of this indication. The
shallower lying nervous fibers of the stomach had become
definitely paralyzed, and such digestion as could be perfected
under these circumstances was the only method of getting the
stimulant in contact with any excitable nerve-substance. In other
words, mere absorbent and assimilative tissue was all of him
which for the purpose of receiving opium partially survived
disorganization of the superficial nerves. Of that surviving
tissue, one mucous patch was irredeemably gone. (This particular
fact was the one which cessation from opium more distinctly
unmasked.) At noon he had become tolerably comfortable; before I
left (7 p.m.) he had enjoyed a single half hour of something like
normal slumber.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">He will have to take opium all his life.
Further struggle is suicide. Death will probably occur at any
rate not from an attack of what we usually consider disease, but
from the disintegrating effects on tissue of the habit itself.
So, whatever he may do, his organs march to death. He will have
to continue the habit which kills him only because abandoning it
kills him sooner; for self-murder has dropped out of the purview
of the moral faculties and become a mere animal question of time.
The only way left him to preserve his intellectual faculties
intact is to keep his future daily dose at the tolerable minimum.
Henceforth all his dreams of entire liberty must be relegated to
the world to come. He may be valuable as a monitor, but in the
executive uses of this mighty modern world henceforth he can
never share. Could the immortal soul find itself in a more
inextricable, a more grisly complication?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In publishing his case I am not violating that
Hippocratic vow which protects the relations of patient and
adviser; for, as I dropped my friend's wasted hand and stepped to
the threshold, he repeated a request he had often made to me,
saying:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;It is almost like Dives asking for a
messenger to his brethren; but tell them, tell all young men,
what it is, 'that they come not into this torment.'&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Already perhaps--by the mere statement of the
case--I might be considered to have fulfilled my promise. But
since monition often consists as much in enlightenment as
intimidation, let me be pardoned for briefly presenting a few
considerations regarding the action of opium upon the human
system while living, and the peculiar methods by which the drug
encompasses its death.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">What is Opium?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It is the most complicated drug in the
Pharmacopeia. though apparently a simple gummy paste, it
possesses a constitution which analysis reveals to contain no
less than 25 elements, each one of them a compound by itself, and
many of them among the most complex compounds known to modern
chemistry. Let me concisely mention these by classes.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">First, at least three earthy salts--the
sulphates of lime, alumia, and potassa. Second, two organic and
one simpler acid--acetic (absolutely vinegar), meconic (one of
the most powerful irritants which can be applied to the
intestines through the bile), and sulfuric. All three exist
uncombined in the gum, and free to work their will on the mucous
tissues. A green extractive matter, which comes in all vegetal
bodies developed under sunlight, next deserves a place by itself,
because it is one of the few organic bodies of which no rational
analysis has ever been pretended. Though we cannot state the
constitution of this chlorophyll, we know that, except by turning
acid in the stomach, it remains inert on the human system, as one
might imagine would happen if he swallowed a bunch of green
grass. Lignin, with which it is always associated, is mere woody
fiber, and has no direct physical action. In no instance has any
stomach been found to digest it save an insect's-- some
naturalists thinking that certain beetles make their horny wing-
cases of that. I believe one man did think he had discovered a
solvent for it in the gastric juice of the beaver, but that view
is not widely entertained. So far as it exists in opium it can
only act as a foreign substance and a mechanical irritant to the
human bowels. Next come two inert, indigestible, and very similar
gummy bodies, mucilagin and bassorin. Sugar, are powerfully
active volatile principle, and a fixed oil (probably allied to
turpentine) are the only other invariable constituents of opium
belonging to the great organic group of the hydro- carbons.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I now come to a group by far the most important
of all. Almost without exception the vegetable poisons belong to
what are called the &quot;nitrogenous alkaloids.&quot; Strychnia,
brucia, ignatia, calabarin, woovarin, atropine, digitalin, and
many others, including all whose effect is most tremendous upon
the human system, are in this group. Not without insight did the
early discoverers call nitrogen azote, &quot;the foe to
life.&quot; It so habitually exists in the things our body finds
most deadly that the tests for it are always the first which
occur to a chemist in the presence of any new organic poison. The
nitrogenous alkaloids owe the first part of their name to the
fact of containing this element; the second part to that of their
usually making neutral salts with acids, like an alkaline base.
The general reader may sometimes have asked himself why these
alkaloids are diversely written-- as, e.g., sometimes
&quot;morphia,&quot; and sometimes &quot;morphine.&quot; The
chemists who regard them as alkalies write them in the one way,
those who consider them neutrals, in the other. Of these
nitrogenous alkaloids, even the nuts of the tree, which furnishes
the most powerful, swift poison of the world, contains but
three--the above-named strychnia, brucia, and ignatia--principles
shared in common with its pathological congener, the St. Ignatius
bean. Opium may be found to contain twelve of them; but as one of
these (cotarnine) may be a product of distillation, and the other
(pseudo-morphia) seems only an occasional constituent, I treat
them as ten in number--rationally to be arranged under three
heads.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">First, those whose action is merely acrid--so
far as known expending themselves upon the mucous coasts.
(Pseudo-morphia when it occurs belongs to these.) So do
porphyroxin; narceine; probably papaverine also; while meconin,
whose acrid properties in contact with animal tissue are similar
to that of meconic acid, forms the last of the group.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The second head comprises but a single
alkaloid, variously called paramorphia or thebaine. (It may
interest amateur chemists to know that its difference from
strychnia consists only in having two less equivalents of
hydrogen and six of carbon--especially when they know how closely
its physical effects follow its atomic constitution.) A dose of
one grain has produced tetanic spasms. Its chief action appears
to be upon the spinal nerves, and there is reason to suppose it a
poison of the same kind as nux vomica without the concentration
of that agent. How singular it seems to find a poison of this
totally distinct class--bad enough to set up the reputation of
any one drug by itself--in company with the remaining principles
whose effect we usually associate with opium and see clearest in
the ruin of its victim!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The remainder, five in number, are the opium
alkaloids, which act generally upon the whole system, but
particularly, in their immediate phenomena, upon the brain. I
mention them in the ascending order of their nervine power:
narcotine; codeine; opianin; metamorphia, and morphia.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The first of these the poppy shares in common
with many other narcotic plants--tobacco the most conspicuous
among the number. In its anti- periodic effects on the human
system it has been found similar to quinia, and it is an
undoubted narcotic poison acting on the nerves of organic life,
though, compared with its associates in the drug, comparatively
innocent.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The remaining four act very much like morphia,
differing only in the size of the dose in which they prove
efficient. Most perfectly fresh constitutions feel a grain of
morphia powerfully; metamorphia is soporific in half-gain doses
(American Journal of Pharmacy, September, 1861); opianin in its
physical effects closely approximates morphia; codeia is about
one-fifth as powerful; a new subject may not get sleep short of
six grains; its main action is expended on the sympathetic
system. It does not seem to congest the brain as morphia does;
but its action on the biliary system is probably little less
deadly than that of the more powerful narcotic.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Looking at the marvelous complexity of opium we
might be led to the a priori supposition that its versatility of
action on the human system must be equally marvelous.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Miserably for the opium-eater, fortunately for
the young person who may be dissuaded from following in his
footsteps, we are left in no doubt of this matter by the
conclusions of experience. In practical action opium affects as
large an area of nervous surface, attacks it with as much
intensity, and changes it in as many ways as its complexity would
lead us to expect. I have pointed out the existence in opium of a
convulsive poison congeneric with brucia. The other chief active
alkaloids, five in number, are those which specially possess the
cumulative property. Poisons of the strychnia and hydro-cyanic
acid classes (including this just mentioned opium alkaloid,
thebaine), are swifter agents; but this perilous opium quintette
signs to every sense a lulling song from which it may not awake
for years, but wakes a slave. Every day that a man uses opium
these cumulative alkaloids get a subtler hold on him. Even a
physician addicted to the practice has no conception how their
influence piles up.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At length some terrible dawn rouses him out of
a bad sleep into a worse consciousness. Though the most
untechnical man, he must already know the disorder which has
taken place in his moral nature and his will. For a knowledge of
his physical condition he must resort to his medical man, and
what, when the case is ten years old, must a practitioner tell
the patient in any average case?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Sir, the chances are entirely against
you, and the possession of a powerfully enduring constitution, if
you have it, forms a decided offset in your favor.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">He then makes a thorough examination of him by
ear, touch, conversation. If enough constitution responds to the
call, he advises an immediate entrance upon the hard road of
abnegation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If the practitioner finds the case hopeless he
must tell the patient so, in something like these words:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;You have either suffered a
disorganization of irreproducible membranes, or you have
deposited so much improper material in your tissue that your life
is not consistent with the protracted pain of removing it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;One by one you have paralyzed all the
excretory functions of the body. Opium, aiming at all those
functions for their death, first attacked the kidneys, and with
your experimental doses you experienced a slight access of
dysuria. As you went on, the same action, progressively paralytic
to organic life, involved the liver. Flatulence, distress at the
epigastrium, irregularity of bowels, indicated a spasmodic
performance of the liver's work, which showed it to be under high
nervous excitement. your mouth became dry through a cessation of
the salivary discharge. Your lachrymal duct was parched, and your
eye grew to have an arid look in addition to the dullness
produced by opiate contraction of the pupil.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">All this time you continued to absorb an agent
which directly acts for what by a paradox may be called fatal
conservation of the tissues. Whether through its complexity
combined nitrogen, carbon, or both, the drug has interposed
itself between your very personal substance and those oxidations
by which alone its life can be maintained. It has slowed the
fires of your whole system. It has not only interposed but in
part it has substituted itself; so that along with much effete
matter of the body stored away there always exists a certain
undecomposed quantity of the agent which sustains this morbid
conservation. **FN ----- ** (FN): I frequently use what
hydropaths call &quot;a pack&quot; to relieve opium distress, and
with great benefit. After an hour and a half of perspiration, the
patient being taken out of his swaddlings, I have found in the
water which was used to wash out his sheet enough opium to have
intoxicated a fresh subject. This patient had not used opium for
a fortnight. -----</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;When this combination became established,
you began losing your appetite because no substitution of fresh
matter was required by your body for tissue wrongly conserved.
The progressive derangement of your liver manifested itself in
increased sallowness of face and cornea; the organ was working on
an inadequate vital supply because the organic nervous system was
becoming paralyzed; the veins were not strained of that which is
the bowels' proper purgative and the blood's dire poison. You had
sealed up all but a single excretory passage--the pores of the
skin. Perhaps when you had opium first given you you were told
that its intent was the promotion of perspiration but did not
know the rationale. The only way in which opium promotes
perspiration is by shutting up all the other excretory processes
of the body, and throwing the entire labor of that function upon
the pores. (When the skin gives out the opium- eater is shut up
like an entirely choked chimney, and often dies in delirium of
blood-poisoning.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;For a while--the first six years,
perhaps--your skin sustained the work which should have been
shared by the other organs--not in natural sweat, but violent
perspiration, which showed the excess of its action. Then your
palms became gradually hornier--your whole body yellower--at the
same time that your muscular system grew tremulous through
progressively failing nervous supply.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;About this time you may have had some
temporary gastric disturbance, accompanied with indescribable
distress, loathing at food, and nausea. This indicated that the
mucous lining of the stomach had been partially removed by the
corrosions of the drug, or that nervous power had suddenly come
to a standstill, which demanded an increase of stimulation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Since that time you have been taking your
daily dose only to preserve the status in quo. The condition both
of your nervous system and your stomach indicate that you must
always take some anodyne to avoid torture, and your only anodyne
is opium.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;The rest of your life must be spent in
keeping comfortable, not in being happy.:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Opium-eaters enjoy a strange immunity from
other disease. They are not liable to be attacked by miasma in
malarious countries; epidemics or contagions where they exist.
They almost always survive to die of their opium itself. And an
opium death is usually in one of these two manners:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The opium-eater either dies in collapse through
nervous exhaustion (with the blood poisoning and delirium
above-mentioned), sometimes after an overdose, but oftener
seeming to occur spontaneously; or in the midst of physical or
mental agony, as great and irrelievable, as men suffer in hopeful
abandonment of the drug, and with a colliquative diarrhea, by
which--in a continual, fiery, acrid discharge--the system
relieves itself during a final fortnight of the effete matters
which have been accumulating for years.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Either of these ends is terrible enough; let us
draw a curtain over their details.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Opium is a corrosion and paralysis of all the
noblest forms of life. The man who voluntarily addicts himself to
it would commit in cutting his throat a suicide only swifter and
less ignoble. The habit is gaining fearful ground among our
professional men, the operatives in our mills, our weary sewing
women, our fagged clerks, our disappointed wives, our former
liquor-drunkards, our very day-laborers, who a generation ago
took gin; all our classes, from the highest to the lowest, are
yearly increasing their consumption of the drug. The terrible
demands, especially in this country, made on modern brains by our
feverish competitive life, constitute hourly temptations to some
form of the sweet, deadly sedative. Many a professional man of my
acquaintance, who twenty years ago was content with his
tri-diurnal &quot;whiskey,&quot; ten years ago, drop by drop,
began taking stronger &quot;laudanum cocktails,&quot; until he
became what he is now--an habitual opium-eater. I have tried to
show what he will be. If this article shall deter any from an
imitation of his example, or excite an interest in the
question--&quot;What he shall do to be saved?&quot;--I am
content. </font></p>

<h1>Are The Drug Laws Constitutional? </h1>

<p> <b>A Historical Perspective</b> </p>

<p> From _Our Right To Drugs_ by Thomas Szasz, Praeger
Publishers, NY (1992): </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2>*The Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906* </h2>

<p> Before 1907, all drugs could be sold and bought like any
other consumer good. The manufacturer did not even have to
disclose the contents of his concoction. Hence the name patent
medicine, the adjective alluding to the fact that the composition
was a trade secret, protected by a patented name. </p>

<p> Although there is no evidence that the American consumer ever
complained about the free market in drugs, there is plenty of
evidence that his self appointed protectors complained bitterly
and loudly. The first landmark event in the federal regulation of
drugs (and foods) was the Food and Drugs Act of 1906. What did
Congress intend to achieve with this seemingly laudable
legislation? To protect people from the sale of
&quot;adulterated&quot; or &quot;misbranded&quot; foods or drugs,
that is, &quot;assur[ing] the customer of the identity of the
article purchased, not of its usefulness.&quot; </p>

<p> I say Congress's aim in enacting this legislation was
seemingly laudable because, while it is desirable that people
know what drugs they buy, forcing manufacturers by law to list
the ingredients of their products is an unnecessary infringement
on the free market -- the foot in the door of
paternalistic-statist protectionism. If Great American Drugs,
Inc., wants to market a mystery product, there is no reason why
the government should prevent it from doing so. And if I want to
buy such a pig in a poke, why should the government prevent me
from making that choice? People who want to be informed about the
drugs they buy and use would abstain from purchasing mystery
products, and market forces would then create a supply of
truthfully labeled drugs. In short, there would be no need to
prohibit the non-disclosure of the contents of medicinal (or
other) products. It is enough to prohibit false disclosure and to
punish it, as fraud, by both criminal and civil penalities. As
for nondisclosure, it would be &quot;punished&quot; by the
invisible hand of the market. The truth is that behind Congress's
ostensible aim of combating drug misbranding lay its growing
antagonism to the habit of pharmacological self-pleasuring,
manifested by the act's specifically mandating the listing on the
label of what were then the main ingredients of Americans'
favorite nostrums: alcohol, hypnotics, and sedatives. The
relevant lines of the Food and Drugs Act read as follows: </p>

<p> That for purposes of this Act an article shall also be deemed
misbranded: ... if the package fails to bear a statement on the
label of the quantity or proportion of any alcohol, morphine,
opium, cocaine, heroin, alpha or beta eucaine, chloroform,
cannabis, chloral hydrate, or acetanilide. </p>

<p> It is implicit in this sentence that, back then, Congress
took for granted the legality of a free market in drugs,
including cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and morphine. </p>

<p> [...] </p>

<h2>*The Harrison Act (1914) and It's Aftermath* </h2>

<p> In 1914, Congress enacted another landmark piece of anti-drug
legislation: the Harrison Narcotic Act. Originally passed as a
record-keeping law, it quickly became a prohibition statute. In
the course of the next seven years, by a curious coincidence of
history -- if, indeed, it is a coincidence -- in Russia the
Soviet Union replaced the czarist empire, while in the United
States the free market in drugs was replaced by federal drug
prohibition possessing unchallengeable authority. Excerpts from
two key Supreme Court decisions quickly tell the story. </p>

<p> In 1915, in a test of the Harrision Act, the Court upheld it
but expressed doubts about its constitutionality: &quot;While the
Opium Registration Act of December 17, 1914, may have a moral
end, as well as revenue, in view, this court, in view of the
grave doubt as to its constitutionality except as a revenue
measure, construes it as such.&quot; </p>

<p> Yet, only six years later the Court considered objection to
federal drug prohibition a taboo. In Whipple v. Martinson the
justices declared, </p>

<p> &quot;There can be no question of the authority of the State
in the exercise of its police power to regulate the
administration, sale, prescription, and use of dangerous and
habit-forming drugs.... </p>

<p> The right to exercise this power is so manifest in the
interest of public health and welfare, that it is unnecessary to
enter upon a discussion of it beyond saying that it is too firmly
established to be successfully called in question. </p>

<p> In 1914, trading in and using drugs was a right. In 1915,
limited federal drug controls were a constitutionally
questionable tax revenue measure. By 1921, the federal government
had gained not only complete control over so-called dangerous
drugs, but also a quasi-papal immunity to legal challenge of its
authority. Thus has the rejection of one of our most basic
constitutional rights become transformed into reverence for one
of our most baneful therapeutic-religious dogmas. Once ignited,
the fire of &quot;progressive&quot; drug protectionism spread and
soon enveloped the whole contry, transforming the Harrison Act
into the legislative embodiment of the &quot;moral principle that
taking narcotics for other than medicinal purposes was harmful
and should be prevented.&quot; That threw the monkey wrench
medicinal purpose into the machinery of the trade in drugs; this
undefined and undefinable concept has haunted us ever since. In
1920, drug prohibitionists won another major victory: America
was, at last, alcohol-free -- if not de facto, then at least de
jure. Since 1924, when Congress made it illegal to manufacture,
possess, or sell heroin, America has been free from heroin as
well -- if not in practice, then at least in theory. </p>

<p> [...] </p>

<p> In retelling this tale, it is impossible to overemphasize
that, although initially the drug laws were intended to protect
people from being &quot;abused&quot; by drugs others wanted to
sell them, this aim was soon replaced by that of protecting them
from &quot;abusing&quot; drugs they wanted to buy. The government
thus succeeded in depriving us not only of our basic right to
ingest whatever we choose, but also of our right to grow,
manufacture, sell, and buy agricultural products used by man
since antiquity. <br>

<h1>EVIDENCE FOUND OF ANCIENT MARIJUANA USE </h1>

<p>Albany (NY) Times Union, 20 May 1993 </p>

<p>(attributed to Newsday) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>The first physical evidence that marijuana was used as a
medicine in the ancient Mideast was reported Wednesday by Israeli
scientists who found residue of the drug with the skeleton of a
girl who apparently died in childbirth 1,600 years ago. </p>

<p>The researchers said the marijuana probably was used by a
mid-wife trying to speed the birth, as well as ease the pain.
Until now, the researchers wrote in a letter to the journal
Nature, &quot;physical evidence of cannabis (marijuana) use in
the ancient Middle East has not yet been obtained.&quot; </p>

<p>The seven researchers -- from Hebrew University, the Israel
Antiquities Authority and the National Police Headquarters
forensic division -- said references to marijuana as a medicine
are seen as far back as 1,600 B.C. in Egyptian, Assyrian, Greek
and Roman writings. But physical evidence that the hemp weed,
cannabis sativa, was used for that purpose has been missing. </p>

<p>The researchers' examination of an undisturbed family tomb
near Jerusalem dating to the fourth century AD indicated the
girl, about 14, died because her pelvis was too small to permit
normal birth. <br>

<h1>From Mr Sin to Mr Big </h1>

<p> Auth: Desmond Manderson </p>

<p> Published: 1993 </p>

<p> Publisher: Oxford University Press Australia </p>

<p> ISBN: 0 19 553531 6 </p>

<h2>Background to the Book. </h2>

<p> (From back cover) </p>

<p> From Mr Sin to Mr Big is a compelling legal and social
history of the origins and development of drug laws in Australia.
It argues that the selective enactment of 'drug' laws has been
driven by fear, racism, powerful international pressures, and the
vested interests of the medical profession, bureaucrats and
politicians, rather than by genuine concerns about the welfare of
users. </p>

<p> Behind the emotion and contoversy that surround the use of
illegal drugs lie previously unexamined assumptions about how and
why certain substances - such as opium, herion and cannabis -
have been prohibited, while others - such as alcolhol and tobacco
- have not. This book challenges these assumptions, while also
examining the power and efficacy of law as a means of achieving
social change. </p>

<p> Desmond Manderson traces the legislative developments, from
the anti-opium laws directed against the Chinese in the
nineteenth century, to the complex web of our present drug laws,
and illustrates the gradual politicisation of the drugs debate.
From Mr Sin to Mr Big argues that Australia's current drug laws
are a product of the past, and it is only by understanding this
past that we can begin a rational debate about reform in the
future. </p>

<p> [note] </p>

<p> Desmond Manderson is a lawyer and historian who has written
extensively on drug history and policy. After studying and
teaching at the Australian National University in Canberra for
several years, he is currently engaged in research at the Centre
for Medicine, Ethics, and Law at McGill University in </p>

<p> Montreal, Canada. [accurate at 1993 : PH] </p>

<p> [summary of the research programs] </p>

<p> As part of his Honours thesis in History, Manderson
researched for a small publication funded by the Research into
Drug Abuse Program (RIDAP) of the National Campaign Against Drug
Abuse (NCADA). </p>

<p> Following his Honours thesis, it was suggested that he work
on a larger project into the history of drug laws in Australia,
again supported by RIDAP, under the Commonwealth (Federal, for
our world audience) Department of Community Services and Health. </p>

<h2>Interesting quotes from the book. </h2>

<p> (page 7) </p>

<p> In nineteenth-century Australia, opium was the preserve of
neither the creative few nor the urban poor. It was freely
available and freely used. Furthermore, perhaps partly as a
consequence of the weakness of the medical profession, the line
which is now seen to divide medical 'use' form non-medical
'abuse' was not yet apparent. Many people who consumed opium
undoubtedly did so out of habit. Indeed, temperance activists who
would rather forfiet their lives than drink a nip of whiskey, but
who were addicted to opium, were the butt of many jokes. 'I
believe the teetotalers have too little pleasure in this world,
whatever they may hope for in the next,' said Godfrey Carter, a
member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly well known for his
opposition to the temperance movement, in 1898, &quot;and when I
think what little joy they have here at present is derived, to a
great extent, from the use of morphine, chlorodyne, painkiller,
and a variety of other preparations of opium, why should we
prevent them from going to their chemists and getting these
things?&quot; </p>

<p> (page 19) </p>

<p> As the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, whose masthead proudly
proclaimed 'Australia for the White Man', stated in 1889: </p>

<p> &quot;The badness of the Chinaman, socially and morally, is
the outcome of his low wages ... If Chinamen will tomorrow refuse
to work for less wages, man for man, than Britons, and will
refuse to work longer hours, the head and front of the objections
to their presence will disappear.&quot; </p>

<p> For the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, the Chinese were
'jaundice-coloured apostles of unlimited competition'. </p>

<p> The proponents of a 'White Australia', however, slid with
ease from arguments of economic protectionism to visceral racism.
The Chinese were painted as living squalidly and in filth, their
habits depraved and their lives degraded. The absence of Chinese
women was seen as a threat to the honor and chastity of innocent
European women and girls (and prostitution certainly flourished
in the Chinatowns of large communities). That the Chinese men
worked on Sundays was portrayed as an indication of the
infiltration of paganism and devil-worshipping into god-fearing
Australian society. In the slandering of the Chinese, almost
anything went, as this extract from a tract written by someone
who went by the ironic pseudonym 'Humanity' shows: </p>

<p> &quot;The Chinese amidst their evil surroundings, and their
filthy and sinful abodes of sin and swinish devilry [will be]
entered into by the servants of the Most High God! May the
wayside scattering of the seed of holiness and truth take root in
the hotbed of all unholy and unclean vices! ... It would never be
believed that our Saxon and Norman girls could have sunk so low
in crime as to consort with such a herd of Gorilla
Devils...&quot; </p>

<p> (page 23-24) </p>

<p> Opium was seen as a pollutant, moral as well as physical; it
was tainted by the environment of its consumption and by its
connections with the Chinese themselves. The potency of these
separate aesthetic revulsions-against dirtiness, the Chinese, and
the smell of opium-was compounded by their mutual association, as
can be seen from the description of an opium den contained in the
'Bulletin's&quot; 1886 feature on 'The Chinese in Australia': </p>

<p> &quot;Down from the fan-tan den are stairs leading to lower
and dirtier abodes: rooms darker than and more greasy than
anything on the ground floor: rooms where the legions of
aggressive stinks peculiar to Chinamen seems to linger ... Yet
the rooms are not naturally repulsive, nor would they be so when
occupied by other tenants; but the Chinaman has defiled their
walls with his filthy touch; he has vitiated what was once a
reasonably pure atmosphere with his presence, and he has polluted
the premises with his disgusting habits; and so it is that nought
save suggestions of evil, incentives of disgust and associations
of vice, now seems to move in the fetid atmosphere ... The very
air of the alley is impregnated with the heavy odour of the
drug.&quot; </p>

<p> From being seen as a dirty habit in dirty people, opium
smoking came to be seen as an immoral habit in hated people. It
was a small step readily taken: from a symbol of depravity, opium
became a cause of it; from a sign of evil, it became an active
agent of it. </p>

<p> (page 32) </p>

<p> Sub-title: 'They all go to the Chinaman': Aboriginal Opium
Laws and the Chinese In fact, the first laws specifically to
prohibit opium did not seem to deal with the Chinese use of it at
all. The Queensland &quot;Sale and Use of Poison Act 1891&quot;
penalised &quot;any person who supplies, or permits to be
supplied, any opium to any aboriginal native of Australia or
half-caste of that race ... except for medicinal purposes
...&quot; </p>

<p> (page 36) </p>

<p> A man named Corbett, 'speaking for all other farmers',
complained that 'they could not get the blacks to work when they
wanted them, while the Chinese', who farmed half of the
surrounding land, could always get them, a fact which he
accounted for by saying that the Celestial paid their Aboriginal
employees in opium'. The solution seemed simple. As the local
carpenter argued, 'the blacks should be taken from the Chinese
and compelled to work for any European who might require their
services'. Opium was, as ever, a scapegoat. The local White
farmers, wanting cheap Black labour, could not understand why
they would rather work for the Chinese. The use of opium was
fastened upon as the only possible explanation for such a
perverse choice. </p>

<p> The more likely truth was that the Chinese treated the
Aboriginal with a modicum of respect. Roth reported the local
police as saying that is the White population ceased starving and
mistreating its Black employees, it could get as many workers as
it wanted. But even the crudest kind of decency appears to have
been beyond some of the locals. A man named Putt expressed his
grievance with incredulity: </p>

<p> &quot;I have shot thirteen or fourteen niggers in this
District and this is all the Government has done for me:-I can't
get a _____ nigger when I want one. They all go to the
Chinaman.&quot; </p>

<p> (page 204-205) </p>

<p> Senator Peter Baume, amongst others, has spoken with more and
more conviction as the years have passed. In one of his last
parliamentary speeches on the subject, before retiring to take up
an appointment as Professor of Community Medicine at the
University of New South Wales, he said: &quot;Our strategies seek
to prevent the production of certain designated illegal
substances, and fail to do so; they seek to prevent the
importation of substances, and fail to do so; they seek to
prevent the distribution of substances, and fail to do so; they
seek to prevent the sale and use of substances, and fail to do
so.&quot; </p>

<p> (page 207) </p>

<p> One thing is apparent. 'Drugs' is a subject which people
approach with many erroneous preconceptions, and a little
knowledge can change people's opinions profoundly. Both Peter
Baume and Peter Cleeland, chairmen of influential parliamentary
committees on the subject, have stressed to me how much their
thinking began to change when they first started to read and to
listen. <br>

<h3>Part II Continued</h3>

<h1>The Costs of Prohibition</h1>

<h2>Prohibition Threatens Public Health</h2>

<h3><a name="sd">Spread of Disease</a></h3>

<h4><a name="sn">Sharing Needles</a></h4>

<p><a name="sn">Because the possession of hypodermic needles is
generally illegal, users of injectable drugs routinely share
needles and syringes with one another, often in &quot;shooting
galleries&quot; where dozens of addicts may line up to use a
single needle rented out by the dealers and not sterilized
between uses. This sharing of needles has become a </a><a
href="footnotes4.htm#126">major source of transmission</a> of
blood-borne diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(&quot;AIDS&quot;) and hepatitis. According to a recent national
review, &quot;more than <a href="footnotes4.htm#127">33% of new
AIDS cases</a> occur among injecting drug users or people having
sexual contact with them.&quot; In New York State, the majority
of new AIDS cases since 1988 have been reported among users of
injectable drugs and their sexual partners. Both the Centers for
Disease Control and the New York State Department of Health have
estimated that more than <a href="footnotes4.htm#128">75% of
pediatric AIDS cases</a> are children whose mothers either
injected drugs or were the sexual partners of persons who
injected drugs. The data suggest, at the very least, that sterile
hypodermic needles should be readily and freely available to drug
users. So long as drug use remains unlawful, however, <a
href="footnotes4.htm#129">free needle distribution</a> is not
likely to attract a substantial portion of the user population.
In response, some <a href="footnotes4.htm#130">courts have
circumscribed laws</a> dealing with the unlawful possession of
hypodermic needles by applying defenses of medical necessity.</p>

<h4><a name="tsd">Trading Sex for Drugs</a></h4>

<p><a name="tsd">Because illicit drugs are expensive, many
addicts turn to </a><a href="footnotes4.htm#131">prostitution</a>
to make money to support their habits, or exchange sexual
services directly for drugs. Prostitute drug addicts often do not
protect themselves from contracting <a href="footnotes4.htm#132">sexually
transmitted diseases</a> carried by their customers, and they
pass such diseases on to other customers, their lovers, and their
children. The crack epidemic, in particular, has been blamed for
the recently noted resurgence of syphilis and other sexually
transmitted diseases. Dr. Robert Rolfs of the Centers for Disease
Control placed the blame squarely on cocaine and its high cost: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>People---especially women---have high-risk sex and
    practice prostitution to support their habits. And it is
    occurring in a relatively poor population where people have a
    lot of things that prevent their access to treatment.
    Therefore, they stay infected longer and are more likely to
    pass their infections on to others. <a
    href="footnotes4.htm#133">[133]</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fewer addicts would be forced to resort to prostitution if the
current prohibitions against drugs were lifted.</p>

<h4><a name="nh">Neglect of Health</a></h4>

<p><a name="nh">Because of addicts' preoccupation with obtaining
and using drugs, and the debilitating effects of some of the
drugs themselves, many addicts are in very poor health. </a><a
href="footnotes4.htm#134">Malnutrition</a> is a frequent problem
and, in turn, contributes to many others. Addicts' poor health
makes them especially susceptible to diseases ranging from scurvy
and shingles to tuberculosis and the flu. Addicts are also more
likely to contract communicable diseases and therefore more
likely to spread them. The interrelated urban problems of
homelessness and illegal drug abuse have contributed to the
development of <a href="footnotes4.htm#135">multi-drug-resistant
strains of diseases</a> such as tuberculosis, which was once
thought to be on the verge of eradication. These more virulent
diseases know few geographical limitations and pose risks to the
general population.</p>

<h4><a name="ahcs">Avoidance of the Health-Care System</a></h4>

<p><a name="ahcs">Individuals who use illegal drugs often put off
addressing their health problems for fear of prosecution or other
</a><a href="footnotes4.htm#136">adverse consequences</a> (<i>e.g.</i>,
rebuffs by doctors, loss of job). This reluctance to seek medical
care is compounded by the fact that many drug addicts have no
private physicians and rely instead on public hospitals or
clinics for any care they might get.</p>

<p>Prohibition, therefore, has perverse results on health; drug
abusers tend to enter the health-care system only if and when
their need for care is acute, which is also when care is most
costly to deliver. If, for example, a woman avoids pre-natal
care, she may give birth to a baby with low birth weight and
other medical difficulties. If a drug abuser puts off seeking
treatment for illnesses and injuries, he or she may end up in the
<a href="footnotes4.htm#137">emergency room</a> and the intensive
care ward.</p>

<p>Mothers and pregnant women face the additional and justifiable
fear that any detectable drug use may be reported as a possible
indication of child abuse or neglect. In many large city
hospitals, the urine of newborn babies is tested for prohibited
drugs, and mothers whose babies test positive for pre-natal
exposure are reported to the child abuse authorities. Until
recently, in New York City, such babies were routinely kept from
their mothers pending investigations that often lasted many
months, interfering with normal bonding and necessarily adversely
affecting the infant's development and relationship with the
parent. Moreover, these women have, in some jurisdictions, been <a
href="footnotes4.htm#138">prosecuted for pre-partum distribution</a>
of prohibited drugs.</p>

<p>In addition to the obvious costs to the individuals who become
infected with catastrophic illnesses directly through drug use,
and the high costs to the health care system of treating them,
prohibition contributes to the spread of such diseases throughout
society, particularly to the sexual partners and children of
infected drug users. Left untreated, users and addicts are more
likely to give birth to unhealthy children, to abuse or neglect
their children after they are born, or to have their <a
href="footnotes4.htm#139">children</a> placed in foster care.</p>

<h3><a name="liqc">Lack of Information and Quality Control</a></h3>

<h4><a name="addddup">Adulterated Drugs, Designer Drugs, and
Drugs of Unknown Potency</a></h4>

<p><a name="addddup">Because drugs are manufactured and
distributed in secret, it is impossible for users to guard
against adulteration or to determine the purity and potency of
the drugs they use. The problem is compounded by drug growers,
manufacturers, and distributors who, to minimize the risks of
apprehension, develop and purvey the drug varieties that pack the
most intoxicating effect into the smallest package. According to
an experienced New York City researcher, </a></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><a name="addddup">The fact that cocaine, heroin and
    related drugs are illegal encourages the use of injection.
    Severe statutory restrictions greatly increase the cost of
    illicit substances to nonmedical users. Injecting provides a
    way to economize. Injectable forms of opiates and coca are
    much more concentrated than traditional forms, such as opium
    or coca tea. Injection provides an intense and economical
    effect by maximizing the amount of drug that reaches the
    brain. People who sniff or smoke drugs say that if they
    inject they need only one third of the amount of the drug to
    maintain a habit. </a></p>
    <p><a name="addddup">Because the injection forms of illicit
    drugs are concentrated, they are [also] relatively easier to
    ship. </a><a href="footnotes4.htm#140">[140]</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has been demonstrated that, as law enforcement and criminal
penalties intensify, dealers also find other ways to economize by
inventing new drugs---so-called &quot;designer drugs&quot;---that
are not yet prohibited. This places the ill-informed consumers of
such drugs at greater risk of overdose and other health problems.
Illnesses and deaths have resulted from (1) the introduction of
dangerous substances into drugs that could otherwise have been
used with greater safety, (2) inadvertent overdoses due to
variations in potency, and (3) the development of &quot;designer
drugs&quot; intended to give the effect of familiar intoxicants
with new chemical compositions that put them <a
href="footnotes4.htm#141">beyond the reach of current laws</a>.
Just as the prohibition against alcohol led to sales of poisonous
wood alcohol and the prohibition against abortion led to
coat-hanger abortions, the prohibition against drug manufacture,
sale, and possession results in <a href="footnotes4.htm#142">unnecessary
deaths</a> due to adulteration, variable purity, and
&quot;designer drugs.&quot; This contrasts sharply with the
government's current regulation of alcoholic beverages, which
ensures that the beverages are pure and that buyers know how
strong they are and what some of their health effects may be.
Experts have noted that heightened efforts to enforce drug laws
and amend them to encompass new formulations or ban precursor
substances may only <a href="footnotes4.htm#143">push dealers to
take greater risks</a>, selling ever more potentially dangerous
substances.</p>

<h4><a name="lkasu">Lack of Knowledge About Safer Use</a></h4>

<p><a name="lkasu">Because many drugs are outlawed, individuals
considering drug use rarely have access to accurate information
about the effects of drugs. While a cautious user may err on the
side of avoiding certain activities while under the use of drugs,
he or she may have no way of knowing, beyond trial and error, the
possible adverse health consequences of certain combinations of
drugs and his or her individual tolerance for particular
substances. Because of its penchant for exaggeration and
cartoonish treatment of the issues, most current education about
drugs is not taken seriously by young people. As a result, it is
far less effective than other health education (e.g., about
nutrition, fitness, and smoking cigarettes).</a></p>

<h4><a name="uatisd">Using Alcohol and Tobacco Instead of
&quot;Soft Drugs&quot;</a></h4>

<p><a href="footnotes4.htm#144">Alcohol and tobacco</a> are
completely legal yet do much more harm, statistically speaking,
than illegal drug use. It is also generally recognized that
alcohol, at least when used to excess, can cause <a
href="footnotes4.htm#145">aggressive, anti-social behavior</a>.
The current prohibitionist laws against marijuana, generally
considered an &quot;a-motivational&quot; drug, and other
so-called &quot;soft drugs&quot; have the effect of influencing
some people to choose alcohol over these &quot;soft drugs.&quot;
Peter Reuter, an economist at the Rand Corporation, concludes
that &quot;If marijuana is a substitute for alcohol..., alcohol
is, by definition, a substitute for marijuana. Thus tough <a
href="footnotes4.htm#146">marijuana enforcement must increase
drinking</a>.&quot; Similarly, Frank Chaloupka, an economist at
the University of Illinois, found through statistical analysis
&quot;that states without criminal sanctions against marijuana
possession suffered <a href="footnotes4.htm#147">fewer auto
fatalities</a>.&quot; Finally, Karen Model, a Ph.D. candidate at
Harvard, found that &quot;states decriminalizing marijuana
reported <a href="footnotes4.htm#148">lower overall rates of
drug- and alcohol-related emergencies</a>.&quot; To the extent
that users are choosing alcohol rather than marijuana or other
&quot;soft drugs,&quot; the overall public health effects are
probably worse than they would be otherwise.</p>

<h3><a name="idv">Injuries Due to Violence</a></h3>

<p><a name="idv">The high prices commanded by prohibited drugs
create competition among groups and individuals willing to break
the law to supply drugs to consumers. Their competition often
becomes violent and has contributed to the build-up of arms and
the </a><a href="footnotes4.htm#149">pervasiveness of violence</a>
in many areas. Gunshot wounds and other traumas due to the
illegal drug business have become commonplace in big-city
hospital emergency rooms. Not only traffickers, but also law
enforcement officers and innocent bystanders are often the <a
href="footnotes4.htm#150">victims</a>. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
recently noted:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The victims of the [ ] gun battles [of street-level drug
    dealers] are innocent bystanders---and often young children.
    Last year alone, about 500 New York City children were shot;
    of these, 89 were innocent bystanders hit by crossfire. <a
    href="footnotes4.htm#151">[151]</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cost of prohibiting drugs must be measured in terms of
lost lives and expensive medical care and include the hidden
costs of lost productivity and the psychological damage to
individuals and entire communities living in fear, helpless and
hopeless.</p>

<p>With the possible exceptions of cocaine and PCP, <a
href="footnotes4.htm#152">drugs themselves do not generally cause
violent behavior</a>. It is, instead, turf wars for the control
of black markets and the drug users' need for money to purchase
such substances that leads to violence. Indeed, marijuana and
heroin have been shown to render their users disinclined to
violence or incapable of violence while under the influence.
These substances are <a href="footnotes4.htm#153">much less
dangerous</a> in this regard than alcohol.</p>

<h3><a name="drtp">Diversion of Resources from Treatment and
Prevention</a></h3>

<p><a href="footnotes4.htm#154">Prohibition diverts money</a>
that could otherwise be used for preventing and treating drug
abuse. Federal anti-drug legislation provides a single budget for
&quot;supply reduction&quot; and &quot;demand reduction&quot;
efforts. Law enforcement agencies have always received much more
than prevention, treatment, and research programs combined. The
ABA recently reported that &quot;[s]ince the early 1980s,
treatment has been a declining priority. In 1991, treatment
received 14% of the $10.5 billion federal drug budget compared to
25% ten years earlier.&quot; During the same period,
&quot;federal <a href="footnotes4.htm#155">spending on law
enforcement increased 737%</a>, with interdiction efforts leading
the increase.&quot; Ending drug prohibition would, by definition,
eliminate the need for any special law enforcement funds for drug
interdiction. It would also allow for the redirection of law
enforcement resources to concentrate on violent crime and quality
of life issues.</p>

<hr>

<h1>What this page is all about </h1>

<p>Debate? What debate? In the last year or so, the people and
organizations who support the War on Some Drugs have realized
that they simply cannot win an open and honest debate on drug
policy. As a rational matter, there is no rational defense for
our current policy. As a result, they have gone into a
hunkered-down mode where they are refusing to engage in any
dialogue at all on drug policy - because they realize they will
lose <b><u>badly</u></b>. </p>

<p>We think it is important to point out and name all the people
and organizations who want to try to tell the world what we ought
to be doing about drugs, but then refuse to engage in
constructive debate or dialogue with anyone who might propose any
modification to the current system. In short, they have pushed
themselves into an extremist corner, and we think it ought to be
publicly known. </p>

<p>Therefore, we are listing below the people and organizations
who have been invited for a polite, open, and honest public
debate on drug policy but have so far refused. We think they are
chicken - afraid to debate because they know they will be soundly
beaten. We feel that the media and everyone else who reads this
page should call it to their attention that their refusal to
discuss drug policy is unreasonable and counter-productive. If
they are really interested in finding a drug policy which works,
then we ought to be talking together, not hiding as these people
are doing. </p>

<p><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> </p>

<p>We wholeheartedly invite any of the people or organizations
listed below to respond and participate in this debate by posting
their responses, arguments, or whatever. We have already
established links to their web pages so readers may compare the
respective arguments, and understand why these people don't want
to debate. We will post whatever responses they want to make. </p>

<hr>

<h2>The Chickens </h2>

<h3>The Drug Enforcement Administration </h3>

<p>The DEA refuses to discuss drug policy in any environment
where they might be subjected to either honest debate or direct,
probing questions about our drug policies. This is despite the
fact that they held a major conference in August, 1994, to try to
teach their people how to survive in a drug policy debate and
even wrote a book called &quot;How to Hold Your Own in a Drug
Legalization Debate&quot;. Why do they refuse to debate? Very
simple - they know from past history that they will get their
butts kicked without any question. </p>

<p><b>Prove it to yourself. </b>Call your local DEA office and
tell them you are setting up a public forum and would like them
to come to speak to whatever community group. They will gladly
volunteer - because they have public relations officers with that
specific task - until they hear the rest. Then tell them that
there will be people from the drug policy reform movement there,
and you would like to set up an open and honest
discussion/debate. Their answer will be short and simple:
&quot;We don't debate.&quot; If you ask them why, they will tell
you it is because it would lend credibility to the other side. Of
course, they will still refuse even if you have recognized
medical authorities, Nobel prize winners, or anyone else who
already has credibility. The real reason is: They are chicken! </p>

<h3>Thomas Constantine </h3>

<p><b>Administrator, Drug Enforcement Administration</b> </p>

<p>After putting his pretty face on the book he masterminded -
&quot;How to Hold Your Own in a Drug Legalization Debate&quot; -
Mr. Constantine has apparently wisely decided not to try it
himself. We have posted his book, along with our reply which,
among other things, found that they had cited books which didn't
even exist. That's no way to win a debate! In recent months he
has openly admitted that the drug war of the 1980s has had
little, if any, effect on the flow of drugs despite all the
billions spent. Mr. Constantine may now be frightened to come out
and debate this policy on any rational basis, or he may just be
getting his resume ready because he realizes that, sooner or
later, the jig is up. </p>

<h3>Robert Bonner </h3>

<p><b>Former Administrator, Drug Enforcement Administration</b> </p>

<p>Mr. Bonner relies on the same standard old arguments in
supporting the drug war but, curiously, doesn't want to put
himself in a position where anyone can question him about what he
says. He has been given numerous opportunities to debate credible
proponents of drug policy reform but rarely accepts any
invitation where he has any opposition at all. We believe it is
because he realizes he really can't &quot;hold his own&quot; in
the drug policy debate. </p>

<h2><img src="biden.gif" align="bottom" width="112" height="134">
Senator Joseph Biden of the US Senate </h2>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>&quot;What we do not need is a debate that treats our
    nation's serious drug problem as a political football; what
    we do not need are more charges of who should do more and who
    hasn't done enough.&quot; -Sen Joseph Biden April 28, 1996
    Wilmington News Journal page A8 </i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joe, you really don't get the point, do you? The point, Joe,
is your fundamental ignorance of many facets of the issues. The
purpose of a debate is to educate people like you. Open and
honest discussion of the issues has always been a fundamental
part of the American political process - clear back to the days
when George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were still growing
hemp. </p>

<p>The following are some of his quotes, or close to them: (Most
of this section is supplied by Scott Ehlers.) </p>

<ul>
    <li><i>&quot;General McCaffrey, you should take this
        administration by the ears...If they don't give you real
        power, then you should quit&quot;</i>; (That ought to be
        a short job.) </li>
    <li><i>&quot;this war must be fought on the streets of every
        community&quot;;</i> (That's OUR community you are
        talking about fighting a war in, Joe.) </li>
    <li><i>&quot;hard-core addicts must face swift and tough
        punishment even if they are first-time or nonviolent
        offenders&quot;</i>; (OK, there are about 2.7 million of
        them and not a single available jail cell. Tell me how
        that works out, Joe.) </li>
    <li><i>&quot;gratuituous violence is due to cocaine
        users...you can bet they're on cocaine&quot; </i>(Joe,
        you just proved you haven't read the Federal Government's
        own reports on this issue. Start with <a
        href="../GOVPUBS/psycviol.htm">Psychoactive Substances
        and Violence</a> by the Department of Justice, -- click
        on the title there and you can read the whole thing.) </li>
    <li><i>&quot;Bill Bennett was the best drug czar because he
        hollered, and I hope you'll holler as well Gen.
        McCaffrey&quot; </i>(Personally, I want more out of
        Government officials than the ability to holler -
        especially when what he is hollering doesn't make any
        sense anyway.) </li>
    <li><i>&quot;Just act, we don't need any more studies...we've
        done plenty of studies...don't listen to the
        people.&quot;</i> (Would you care to share with us any of
        those studies that you have read? I have a number of them
        on these web pages and not one of them agrees with this
        drug policy. See the list - <a
        href="../LIBRARY/studies/studies.htm">Major Studies of
        Drug Policy</a>) </li>
</ul>

<p>Biden also added some interesting new &quot;facts&quot; to the
record that I was not aware of, namely: the Harrison Act was
passed in 1917; there was more drug education in 1923 than there
is today; and 10 to 20 times more drugs were confiscated under
McCaffrey than under his predecessors. (Yes, this is a U.S.
Senator and according to him, he's been studying the drug problem
for 20 years!) </p>

<p>Joe Biden has been a major supporter of the War on Some Drugs
for many years. His obvious ignorance of the basic facts about
the issue is all the more shocking, considering he is one of the
major congressional leaders and has been ranting about this for
years. He has admitted on several occasions that our drug policy
clearly leaves something to be desired but, for Joe at least, an
honest discussion of the issues - and how to make our policy
better - is out of the question. Unless you already agree with
his preconceived notions, don't bother to call. </p>

<p>Joe Biden is up for re-election again in 1996, so the obvious
questions come up: </p>

<p>Will Joe Biden ever have the courage to face someone from the
&quot;legalization&quot; camp in an open and honest debate? I
seriously doubt it. An open and honest debate would mean that
those long, rambling, say-nothing statements he makes would be
subject to some real examination. My personal opinion is that he
would look like a major fool in short order against any of the
top advocates for reform. </p>

<p>Who should you vote for if you live in Delaware? Clearly,
anybody more honest and forthright on the issue than Joe Biden -
such as any candidate who is willing to discuss his ideas in an
open forum and put them to an honest test. </p>

<p>I have included links to a page on Joe Biden, and another page
by one of his opponents so you can judge for yourself. </p>

<h2>Dr. Eric Voth </h2>

<p><a href="voth1.htm">Dr. Voth's List of Research</a> - wherein
he finds support for his position. The list is most curious
because much of the information listed plainly does not support
his point of view. </p>

<p>Dr. Voth is one of the Grand Poobahs of Drug Watch
International and a few other pro-prison organizations and is
well-known for histrionic appearances before congressional
committees where, to hear him tell it, the entire future of
civilization rests on the grand plan to incarcerate every pot
smoker. (Dr. Voth, when you read this, please remember that I
will be glad to post any statements you want to make about the
issue, including a rebuttal of everything I say here - but look
out, because that will probably start the debate you are trying
so hard to avoid.) </p>

<p>I have had several private e-mail conversations with him and
it is quite clear that Dr. Voth would be no match for me or
anyone I have trained and would quickly look quite foolish in
front of all but the most extreme audiences. </p>

<p>Dr. Voth's initial tactic, like those of the Drug Watch
International folks in general, is to try to turn the whole
debate into a series of personal attacks. I had extreme
difficulty in getting him to address any substantive issue about
drugs because he kept making accusations against everyone in the
drug-policy reform movement. For example: </p>

<ul>
    <li>He said that the drug policy reform movement was composed
        of a bunch of drug addicts. I pointed out to him that
        simple logic should tell him this was wrong. Why would
        anyone want to try to organize a bunch of drug addicts?
        The reasons they would not be good activists seem pretty
        obvious to me. </li>
    <li>He said that the real force behind the movement was a
        bunch of people like Dick Cowan (formerly head of the
        National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws)
        who wanted the laws changed just so they could get stoned
        and so they could get rich selling pot after the laws
        were changed. I can't tell you all of Dick Cowan's
        reasoning for wanting the laws changed but it is my clear
        impression that neither one of these two reasons are high
        up on the list. As for making money from pot after it is
        legal, I don't think Dick Cowan is stupid enough to
        believe that he could. (Dick can correct me, if I am
        wrong.) If anyone wanted to make money from pot, the best
        time to do it would be under the current policy. <br>
        But, the bottom line is that Dick Cowan's motives (or any
        other individual's motives) don't really have much to do
        with the issue of whether it makes sense to incarcerate
        millions of people for drug offenses. As I pointed out to
        Dr. Voth, Dick Cowan may not know any more about this
        issue than Dr. Voth does. </li>
</ul>

<p>Dr. Voth persisted in this kind of routine for quite some
time, until I finally hit him with a long list of corruption and
dishonesty on the other side, starting with the lies told by
Harry Anslinger starting in 1937. People who live in glass houses
shouldn't throw stones. </p>

<p>Once I hit him back, he stopped that routine (a little) and we
went on to some *real* issues, but the conversation was marked by
his inability to answer almost any question I asked him. For
example: </p>

<ul>
    <li>He claims he is a &quot;world-renowned expert&quot; on
        marijuana, and especially marijuana addiction. Yet, it is
        obvious to me that he has never read many of the basic
        research texts that I have posted on this web page and is
        woefully ignorant of many other facets of the subject. As
        one small example, he is not familiar with the various
        ways in which cannabis can be consumed medically. I
        pointed him to the web pages, especially the work of Dr.
        Tod Mikuriya, but it is doubtful if he will ever bother
        to read it. </li>
    <li>I asked him to provide me with his credentials and the
        full text of any research he has done on the issue, or
        that he thinks is important to understanding the issue. I
        assured him that I would post anything he sends me
        unaltered. So far he hasn't come forth with a single page
        of anything but his personal opinions. On the other hand,
        I have received reams of information from many other
        &quot;experts&quot; on the issue, including people with
        better medical credentials than Dr. Voth. </li>
    <li>He says that he supports the use of cannabinoids as
        medicine but wants people to use &quot;medicines&quot;,
        not &quot;potions.&quot; It occurred to me that, since
        the active ingredient in Marinol, an FDA-approved
        prescription drug, comes directly from the marijuana
        plant, that the difference between a &quot;medicine&quot;
        and a &quot;potion&quot;, was very much the same as the
        difference between a Vitamin C tablet and an orange. Some
        patients, it would seem, would naturally prefer the
        &quot;medicine&quot; (the tablet), while others would
        prefer the &quot;potion&quot; (the orange). I asked him
        to explain what I had missed, but he had no response. </li>
</ul>

<p>Most interesting is Dr. Voth's response to my request for a
debate. He said the conditions would have to be right. I told him
that my conditions were pretty simple: Any time, any place, any
audience, any rules - just show up. </p>

<p>Dr. Voth's terms for a debate were quite a bit different. They
are: </p>

<ol>
    <li>The forum needs to be high visibility such as a major
        media event like national talk show, news show, etc. I
        suggested any number of possible forums, including
        online, taped radio or TV appearances, etc. He said all
        of them could be edited to make him look foolish. (No
        editing required for that.) I even suggested that we do
        it online and then post matching transcripts on our
        respective web pages with links to each other - just so
        we could make sure that neither one of us had done any
        editing. No dice. </li>
    <li>No pro-legalization forum. Either a totally neutral
        audience or something on his turf. (One should note that
        a totally neutral audience would be almost impossible to
        find. I don't really see what the audience has to do with
        it anyway - they just watch, they don't participate.) </li>
    <li>He wants all his costs covered. (That shouldn't be a
        problem, I know lots of people who would buy tickets just
        to watch him fall). </li>
</ol>

<p>In short, Dr. Voth just isn't very eager for a public debate
with any knowledgeable opponent. He seems to have a lot to say
when nobody has the microphone but him, but he quickly craps out
when faced with any significant opposition. </p>

<p>If you happen to read about Dr. Voth in the newspaper, or see
him on the media, make it a point to write to the media source
and include a copy of this segment of the Chicken Page.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Dr. Kim Edward Light </h3>

<p>Dr. Light has a relatively small (by comparison to any of
ours) web site devoted to a few articles making poorly documented
and plainly illogical arguments against &quot;legalization.&quot;
His web page invites responses and even purports to maintain a
commentary area where people can comment, but he has never
responded to any invitation to debate, or even any comments on
his web page that anyone can determine. We invite Dr. Light to
join us in debate. We don't expect that he will do so any time
soon. </p>

<h1>Drug Legalization: Myths and Misconceptions </h1>

<h4><img src="blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"

<h4>U.S. Department of Justice </h4>

<h4>Drug Enforcement Administration </h4>

<h4>220 W. Mercer Street, Suite 104 Seattle, Washington 98119 </h4>

<p>May 12, 1994 </p>

<p>Dear Friends, </p>

<p>Law enforcement has a responsibility to be involved in the
prevention of all illegal or harmful activities. At this time in
our nation's history, there is no crime problem of graver
consequence than the drug problem. While law enforcement acts as
a deterrent to drug abuse and drug trafficking, we know that the
long-term answer to the drug problem goes beyond traditional law
enforcement actions. </p>

<p>In 1987, the Drug Enforcement Administration initiated a drug
prevention and education program when Special Agents were
assigned as Demand Reduction Coordinators in each of the agency's
19 field divisions. With limited resources they have provided
support, assistance and training to grassroots organizations.
Many requests are for information on the issue of drug
legalization. </p>

<p>Lee P. Brown, the Director of the Office of National Drug
Control Policy stated in the 1993 Interim National Drug Control
Strategy, &quot;Drug use among our nation's youth has dropped
since its peak in 1985 and 1986, prompting some to conclude that
the drug problem, if not over, is no longer a crisis. This
conclusion is as dangerous as it is wrong. The loss of public
focus has also allowed the voices of those who would promote
legalization to ring more loudly and be heard more clearly. The
declines thus far in the use of drugs are in part because they
are illegal. Legalization is a formula for self-destruction. The
[Clinton] Administration is unequivocally opposed to any 'reform'
that is certain to increase drug use.&quot; </p>

<p>S/A Tom Pool has compiled and edited a list of the most common
arguments used by proponents of drug legalization. These
arguments fall into eleven general areas, hence the eleven
chapters in the attached manual. These arguments are analyzed and
information is provided to defeat these arguments. </p>

<p>This manual will be revised and expanded. I solicit the
readers to assist us by submitting comments, position papers,
research, and documented sources of information to: </p>

<p>S/A Tom Pool - Demand Reduction Coordinator </p>

<p>Drug Enforcement Administration </p>

<p>220 West Mercer Street, Suite 104 </p>

<p>Seattle, WA 98119 </p>

<p>Tel: (206) 553-5443 </p>

<p>I hope that this <i>&quot;debate manual&quot; </i>will prove
useful to the police officers, parents, teachers, and others
faced with the myths and misconceptions of drug legalization. </p>

<h1>The Wrong Message Of Legalizing Illicit Drugs </h1>

<p><b>By the Partnership for a Drug-Free America</b> </p>

<p>18-Aug-94 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>A new publication that discusses that any policy discussion
that includes consideration of legalizing illicit drugs reflects
either a complete misunderstanding or ignorance of the key
factors that affect trial and use of these substances.
Legalization sends the societal message of public approval,
eroding the anti-drug attitudes of our youth and encouraging them
to try and use illegal drugs. What we need is the reverse --
establishing the unequivocal message that our public behavior
standard and social norm is 'no-use,&quot; continuously
reinforced </p>

<p>through the attitudes of harm/risk and social disapproval that
are prevent inhibitors to our youth trying and using these
substances. </p>

<p>First, it is critical to recognize that drug abuse is, at its
core, the result of the demand we as individuals and society
create for these drugs. Prior to drug use becoming the disease of
addiction, all drug trial and use is the result of
decisions/choices we make to use or not use. The primary
determinant in these decisions are the </p>

<p>attitudes of 1) perceived harm/risk and 2) social disapproval.
This is true across ethnicity, demography and geography. All
progress in reducing drug use and, ultimately, addiction, is the
result of increasing anti- drug attitudes in order to change the
behavior. </p>

<p>The message of legalization is precisely antithetical to
everything we've learned about preventing the demand for illegal
drugs. The epidemic of illegal drug use over the past three
decades was the result of these substances, their use, and their
users becoming &quot;normalized&quot; -perceived as benign and an
accepted part of normal social behavior. Normalization has led to
nearly 80 million Americans having tried illegal drugs. Because
we did not understand the impairment and harm that results from
using illegal drugs, we passively and actively moved away from
the behavior standard and social norm of no-use. </p>

<p>The reverse process of &quot;denormalization&quot; that began
with the death of Len Bias in 1986 has resulted in a decline of
more than 50% in the number of Americans using illicit drugs.
This fact is not well known, and probably is responsible for much
of the sense of hopelessness and helplessness that often
surrounds the issue of drug abuse. As a nation, we began to
recognize the harmfulness of drug use, and we began to
re-establish the social norm of no- use. All the declines in
trial and non-addicted use of illicit drugs are directly
correlated </p>

<p>with the increase in the attitudes of perceived harm/risk and
social disapproval. </p>

<p>Importantly, however, most recent trends among young teens
indicate an erosion in their key anti-drug attitudes of risk and
disapproval, resulting in higher usage rates of marijuana, LSD,
cocaine and inhalants. Further confusion in the behavior standard
and social norm of no-use, especially consideration of legalizing
(read 'normalizing&quot;) illicit drugs, will surely accelerate
this disturbing trend and put us back into the drug epidemic of
the 1970's and early 1980's. </p>

<h1>Introduction to the Hoover Resolution </h1>

<p>by Clifford A. Schaffer </p>

<p>July 15, 1993 </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On December 28, 1992 I wrote to Judge James P. Gray of Orange
County, California to ask him to help me draft a letter which
prominent people could sign, and ask others to sign, to show that
they were united in demanding major reform of our national drug
policy. Judge Gray, Dr. Clarke Smith, and I, wrote the bulk of
the wording of what was to become known as the Hoover Resolution.
By happy coincidence, Kathy Smith, the wife of Dr. Clarke Smith,
arranged a meeting with Dr. Milton Friedman and Joseph McNamara
to discuss the resolution. News of the meeting spread farther and
more quickly than even we had intended and, before we knew it, we
had a list of attendees for the meeting which included some of
the world's most prominent citizens and internationally
recognized experts on drug abuse, some of whom have been in the
field for more than fifty years. </p>

<p>On February 26, 1992 we met at the Hoover Institution at
Stanford University, finalized the wording, and signed the
resolution which calls for an objective Federal Commission to
review the evidence on drug policy and to form a new drug policy
which does not do so much harm. A list of these signers is
enclosed. </p>

<p>The purpose of the resolution is to 1) draft a statement which
all fair-minded people would agree with, and thus build a
consensus for reform and 2) call for concrete action for reform. </p>

<p>Reaction to the resolution has been beyond our wildest dreams.
The mayors and chiefs of police of San Francisco, Oakland, and
San Jose held an unprecedented joint press conference to publicly
sign the resolution. Major medical organizations, religious
organizations, and literally dozens of judges, law enforcement
officials, and others have publicly announced their support of
the Hoover Resolution and the call for a Federal Commission to
review and rewrite drug policy. We are also beginning to receive
major support for the resolution from around the world. There
will be more news about this later. </p>

<p>The resolution has received major news coverage across the
nation, including an excellent article by Federal Judge Jack B.
Weinstein in the NY Times, July 8, 1993, and a call for the
Federal Commission by three Federal judges on Nightline on (or
about) July 10, 1993. It has also received a combined total of
several complete pages of coverage in the LA Times, the San
Francisco Examiner, and the SF Chronicle, the Oakland Tribune,
the San Jose News-Mercury, the Baltimore Sun, Newsweek (June 14,
1993), and many, many others. It has received more favorable news
coverage for drug policy reform than any other single event of
the last twenty-five years. </p>

<p>Some of the original signers of the resolution support
&quot;legalization&quot; or &quot;decriminalization&quot;.
However, we do not ask anyone to support or endorse any
particular approach to the drug problem. We simply ask everyone
to admit that the current drug policy has not worked and that it
is time to review the evidence in an open and honest commission
and to form a new drug policy which does not do so much harm --
whatever that policy may be. Let's lay the facts on the table,
and let the chips fall where they may. </p>

<p>I have enclosed a copy of the resolution, along with a list of
signers, and some of the more important facts relative to drug
policy. </p>

<p>We (the signers of the Hoover Resolution), ask that you sign
the Resolution and send a copy to President Bill Clinton, The
White House, Washington, DC. We also ask that you ask others to
sign the resolution and send it in to Bill Clinton. If the
Resolution is signed or endorsed by any groups or organizations
we ask that you send those endorsements to: C. A. Schaffer, P.O.
Box 1430, Canyon Country, CA 91386-1430. </p>

<p>Please remember that we are not asking you to endorse
legalization, or decriminalization, or any other approach to
drugs. We are simply asking you to admit that the time has come
to re-examine the facts and fairly investigate other possible
approaches. <br>

<h1>Resolution for a Federal Commission on Drug Policy</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>RESOLUTION </h1>

<p><b>Whereas</b>, the overall situation regarding the use of
drugs in our society and the crime and misery that accompanies it
has continued to deteriorate for several decades; and </p>

<p><b>Whereas</b>, our society has continued to attempt, at
enormous financial cost, and loss of civil liberties, to resolve
drug abuse problems through the criminal justice system, with the
accompanying increases of prisons and numbers of inmates; and </p>

<p><b>Whereas, </b>the huge untaxed revenues generated by the
illicit drug trade are undermining legitimate governments
world-wide; and </p>

<p><b>Whereas</b>, the present system has spawned a cycle of
hostility by the incarceration of disproportionate numbers of
African-Americans, Hispanics, and other minority groups; and </p>

<p><b>Whereas</b>, the number of people who have contracted AIDS,
hepatitis, and other diseases from contaminated hypodermic
needles is epidemic under our present system; and </p>

<p><b>Whereas</b>, in our society's zeal to pursue our criminal
approach, legitimate medical uses for the relief of pain and
suffering of patients have been suppressed. </p>

<p><b>Therefore be it resolved </b>that our society must
recognize drug use and abuse as the medical and social problems
that they are and that they must be treated with medical and
social solutions; and </p>

<p><b>Further be it resolved</b> that an objective commission be
immediately empowered by the President and by Congress to
recommend revision of the drug laws of these United States in
order to reduce the harm our current policies are causing. </p>

<p> Resolution </p>

<p> Whereas, the overall situation regarding the use of drugs in
our society and the crime and misery that accompanies it has
continued to deteriorate for several decades; and </p>

<p> Whereas, our society has continued to attempt, at enormous
financial cost, and loss of civil liberties, to resolve drug
abuse problems through the criminal justice system, with the
accompanying increases of prisons and numbers of inmates; and </p>

<p> Whereas, the huge untaxed revenues generated by the illicit
drug trade are undermining legitimate governments world-wide; and
</p>

<p> Whereas, the present system has spawned a cycle of hostility
by the incarceration of disproportionate numbers of
African-Americans, Hispanics, and other minority groups; and </p>

<p> Whereas, the number of people who have contracted AIDS,
hepatitis, and other diseases from contaminated hypodermic
needles is epidemic under our present system; and </p>

<p> Whereas, in our society's zeal to pursue our criminal
approach, legitimate medical uses for the relief of pain and
suffering of patients have been suppressed. </p>

<p> Therefore be it resolved that our society must recognize drug
use and abuse as the medical and social problems that they are
and that they must be treated with medical and social solutions;
and </p>

<p> Further be it resolved that an objective commission be
immediately empowered by the President and by Congress to
recommend revision of the drug laws of these United States in
order to reduce the harm our current policies are causing. </p>

<p> Introduction </p>

<p> On February 26, 1993 a group of concerned citizens met at the
Hoover Institution on the campus of Stanford University and
unanimously passed a resolution which recommends that our country
investigate the possibility of change in the way we handle our
drug problem. The Resolution, which recommends that these medical
and social problems be treated with medical and social solutions,
is attached hereto. It further recommends that one final blue
ribbon commission be immediately empowered by the President to

<h2>THE ATLANTA RESOLUTION </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>We, the Mayors of the United States of America, </b>believe
that drug abuse is one of the most critical problems facing our
cities, and that it is inextricably linked to crime and violence.
Cutting across all cultural, racial and economic lines, illicit
drugs impair millions of Americans. Drug use and addiction
contribute to the breakdown of our families, the abuse of adults
and children, the spread of HIV/AIDS, school dropouts and the
declining quality of education, homelessness, urban decay, high
health care costs, and low economic productivity that compromises
our ability to compete in the global marketplace. We must reduce
the number of people who use drugs and the number of people with
the disease of addiction to significantly improve the most
pressing domestic issues we face. <b>Drug use is a preventable
behavior and drug addiction is a treatable disease.</b> </p>

<p><b>1. We, the nation's mayors, reject all proposals to
legalize illicit drugs. This is not the answer to the drug
problem in our cities. </b>We reject legalization, and other
simplistic forms such as decriminalization, because it is morally
reprehensible to consider an action that would a) simultaneously
erode our children's anti-drug attitudes of perceived risk and
social disapproval and b) make harmful and addictive drugs far
more accessible to far more people. We support the medical use of
any drug that research proves is safe and effective under
guidelines established by the Food and Drug Administration. While
we support attempts to reduce harm, we believe that the way to
decrease such problems is to prevent drug use from starting and
to help those who are already in trouble with drugs. </p>

<p><b>2.</b> <b>Prevention works: We have achieved real progress
in decreasing drug use and in</b> <b>understanding what works. </b>Since
1979, dramatic increases in public attitudes of perceived risk
and social disapproval toward illicit drugs produced a decline of
nearly 50 percent in the number of first-time users and
nonaddicted users through all segments of the population.
Throughout the nation, drug prevention efforts came together at
the community level-in families, schools, the media, law
enforcement, youth groups and workplaces-to establish nonuse as
the behavioral standard and social norm. This progress in
prevention has also significantly reduced the numbor of people
who would have become addicted. </p>

<p><b>3.</b> <b>However, diminishing resources and public focus
now threaten future success. </b>The gains so preciously earned
in anti-drug attitudes and declining use are now threatened.
Since the early 1990s there has been decreased attention to the
drug issue and increased pro-drug and pro-legalization publicity.
This has contributed to <b>a reversal in the attitudes of
perceived risk and social disapproval that distinguish nonusers
from users, and significant increases in</b> <b>the number of
young people using illicit drugs. </b>Finally, and despite
increasing evidence of the cost-effectiveness of drug treatment,
we have made little progress in reducing the number of people
already addicted. This reflects a current system that can treat
only one-fifth of the estimated 6 million people in trouble with
drugs. </p>

<p><b>4.</b> <b>We must provide significantly greater resources
and leadership-from governmental, corporate and nonprofit sectors
at national, state and local levels-for the demand reduction
efforts of prevention, intervention, treatment and research. </b>Effective
drug policy requires investment in both supply and demand
reduction, but our nation is not providing enough funding for
prevention or treatment. These are proven, cost-effective
solutions for reducing both drug use and addiction and their
impact on other critical domestic problems. Initial drug use is a
matter of choice, and with sufficient resources, we can influence
that choice positively. When addiction overtakes choice, we can
treat addiction for those who require it. Our focus must combine
efforts to reduce both the number of people who use and the
number of people who are addicted to illicit drugs. </p>

<p><b>a)</b> <b>Preventing drug use by young people, and by all
who influence them, must be the cornerstone of national, state
and local drug strategies and resources if we are to build safe
and healthy families and communities. </b>We must reestablish and
affirm the individual choice to remain drug-free. We must
consistently reinforce the message that drug use is harmful and
unacceptable. This message is vital to preventing drug
experimentation and reducing drug use before it becomes
addiction. We must effectively influence the decisions our young
people make about illicit drugs by providing drug education at
home and in school and by involving local law enforcement
officers and judges, the faith community, health care
professionals, the media, employers, and other community
resources. Comprehensive community prevention programs
significantly reduce adolescent drug use. We support the recently
created National Prevention League, designed to coordinate
prevention efforts and to emphasize the need for prevention as
the first priority in reducing substance abuse. </p>

<p><b>b) We must make treatment more available, more effective
and more accessible if we are to reduce the impact of drugs in</b>
<b>our cities. </b>Treatment is critical to reducing the social
pathology conveyed by those already addicted to drugs. Most acute
is the lack of treatment for those who are least able to function
or whose drug involvement has profound implications for
themselves, their families and society at large. People in the
criminal justice system, pregnant women and women with children,
the homeless, and those infected with HlV/AlDS face intolerable
shortages of treatment slots. Early intervention in the drug
abuse process, aimed especially at adolescents but including
adults as well, decreases harm and increases rehabilitation. </p>

<p><b>c)</b> <b>Law enforcement must remain</b> <b>a strong
component of, and be better linked to, demand reduction efforts. </b>On
the national, state and especially the local level, law
enforcement and the judicial system are critical to the success
of preventing and treatingdrug abuse. We<b> </b>need to increase
cooperation<b> </b>among law enforcement agencies and between law
enforcement and prevention and treatment programs within the
community. </p>

<p><b>d)</b> <b>Research is critical to understanding,
replicating and improving the effectiveness and cost efficiency
of demand reduction efforts. </b>Research, not ideology, must
provide the foundation for drug policies and practices. More
research is needed to improve our understanding of the ways drugs
affect the brain and change behavior, of the reasons for
reversing drug attitude and use trends, of the importance of
community-based prevention programs, and of why particular
treatment approaches are more successful than others. </p>

<p><b>e)</b> <b>Worldwide cooperation in reducing illicit drug
abuse will</b> <b>not only help the international community, but
also will reduce the flow of drugs into our cities. </b>The
spread of illicit drugs throughout Europe and other parts of the
world imperils our ability to reduce drug abuse in our cities. We
support European Cities Against Drugs, which organized last year
to fight the legalization movement abroad. Today, we announce the
formation of American Cities Against Drugs to support our sister
organization in Europe and similar organizations that may form
throughout the world. </p>

<p><b>We believe that reducing drug abuse is essential to the
most important things all Americans care about: </b>our children<b>
</b>and families, our safety, our neighborhoods and communities,
our health, our economy, our freedom to grow and prosper and our
obligation as citizens to help each other build healthy families
and communities. We must maintain our public will. We must elicit
leadership from all segments of society, especially from
individuals and communities. We must recognize that each of us
has a role to play in the solution and all of us have a stake in
the outcome. Drug abuse is a preventable behavior and drug
addiction is a treatable disease. <b>We, the Mayors of the United
States of America, commit ourselves to reducing drug abuse by
mobilizing our citizens and concentrating our resources to
prevent this behavior and treat this disease.</b> </p>

<h2>Issues and Findings </h2>

<p> Discussed in the Research in Brief: The current status of
research on the links connecting violence to alcohol and illegal
psychoactive drugs, and evaluations of interventions to prevent
violence related to these substances. </p>

<p> Key issues: Correlations between violence and psychoactive
substances; the social, economic, cultural, psycho-social,
neurobehavioral, and other factors that explain the correlations;
and prevention strategies for reducing the violence associated
with these substances. </p>

<h3>Key findings: </h3>

<ul>
    <li>Research has uncovered strong correlations between
        violence and psycho-active substances, including alcohol
        and illegal drugs, but the underlying relationships
        differ by type of drug. </li>
    <li>The links between violence and psychoactive substances
        involve broad social and economic forces, the settings in
        which people obtain and consume the substances, and
        biological processes that underlie all human behavior.
        These factors interact in chains of events that may
        extend back from an intermediate triggering event such as
        an argument to long-term predisposing processes that
        begin in childhood. </li>
    <li>Of all psychoactive substances, alcohol is the only one
        whose consumption has been shown to commonly increase
        aggression. After large doses of amphetamines, cocaine,
        LSD, and PCP, certain individuals may experience violent
        outbursts, probably because of preexisting psychosis.
        Research is needed on the pharmacological effects of
        crack, which enters the brain more directly than cocaine
        used in other forms. </li>
    <li>Alcohol drinking and violence are linked through
        pharmacological effects on behavior, through expectations
        that heavy drinking and violence go together in certain
        settings, and through patterns of binge drinking and
        fighting that sometimes develop in adolescence. </li>
    <li>The most promising strategies for reducing
        alcohol-related violence are to reduce underage drinking
        through substance abuse preventive education, taxes, law
        enforcement, and peer pressure. </li>
    <li>Illegal drugs and violence are linked primarily through
        drug marketing: disputes among rival distributors,
        arguments and robberies involving buyers and sellers,
        property crimes committed to raise drug money and, more
        speculatively, social and economic interactions between
        the illegal markets and the surrounding communities. </li>
    <li>The most promising strategy for reducing violence related
        to illegal drugs appears to be reducing the demand that
        fuels violent illegal markets. Promising tactics include
        preventive education, pretrial monitoring of arrestees
        through urinalysis and, for convicted violent offenders,
        in-prison therapeutic communities integrated with
        postrelease treatment followup. </li>
    <li>In the future, medications may reduce violence by
        reducing cocaine craving and by blocking the
        aggression-promoting effects of opiate withdrawal and
        alcohol consumption. </li>
</ul>

<p> Target audience: State and local policymakers, court
administrators, law enforcement and juvenile justice
practitioners, and drug treatment program staff. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> As noted by the Panel on the Understanding and Control of
Violent Behavior, the character of violence presents simultaneous
challenges to understanding and opportunities for prevention.
First, violence is diverse. Acts as different as spontaneous
drive-by shootings and met-iculously planned serial killings, for
example, are both included in the legal and statistical category
of murder. Second, the causes of violence are complex, involving
a very wide variety of factors. The panel found it useful to
classify these factors in terms of four levels of analysis at
which they are usually studied: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Broad social and economic forces (macrosocial). </li>
    <li>Encounters between people in particular settings
        (microsocial). </li>
    <li>Individual behavioral development from childhood through
        adulthood (psychosocial). </li>
    <li>Neurobehavioral and other biological processes that
        underlie all human behavior (neurobehavioral). </li>
</ul>

<p> Factors at these four levels operate and interact in chains
of events that may begin long before the violent event that
results. Therefore, the panel's classification framework also
categorized causal factors in terms of their temporal proximity
to the violent event itself: from the immediate triggering
mechanism (for example, a response to an insult), back through
the situation that led up to the triggering event, to
predisposing factors that months or years earlier increased the
risk of a future violent event. </p>

<p> This diversity and complexity might at first glance seem to
discourage efforts to prevent violence. In fact, however, they
create promising opportunities. Merely acknowledging the
diversity breaks the overall &quot;violence problem&quot; into
separate problems that may be preventable through interventions
by different public agencies. Recognizing the causal complexity
expands the list of options for preventing a particular violence
problem by highlighting all the points at which chains of events
leading to it may be breakable. Problem-solving
initiatives--programs that involve design and evaluation of
preventive interventions at various links in these chains of
events, that revise these interventions in light of the
evaluation findings, and that replicate the evaluations--have the
potential to simultaneously reduce violence and increase the
understanding of its causes. </p>

<p> Many chains of causal events for violence include links to
alcohol or to illegal psychoactive drugs. The panel found these
links worth exploring in depth for at least three reasons. First,
statistics consistently demonstrate correlations between violent
events and involvement with alcohol and other psychoactive drugs.
Second, the variety of potential causal links between violence
and different psychoactive substances--alcohol, opiates, cocaine
in smokable and powdered form, amphetamines, hallucinogens, and
other illegal drugs--presents an especially rich example of the
panel's classification framework. Third, preliminary evidence
from research and evaluations suggests that certain interventions
related to psychoactive substances should be considered in
developing strategies for controlling violence. </p>

<h3>Correlations between violence and psychoactive substances </h3>

<p> Research supported by the National Institute of Justice and
other organizations has repeatedly found strong correlations
between violence and psychoactive substances: </p>

<ul>
    <li>For at least the last several decades, alcohol
        drinking--by the perpetrator of a crime, the victim, or
        both--has immediately preceded at least half of all
        violent events, including murders, in the samples studied
        by researchers. </li>
    <li>Chronic drinkers are more likely than other people to
        have histories of violent behavior. </li>
    <li>Criminals who use illegal drugs1 commit robberies and
        assaults more frequently than do nonuser criminals, and
        they commit them especially frequently during periods of
        heavy drug use. </li>
    <li>In a study of New York City murders in 1988, researchers
        classified more than half the homicides (53 percent) as
        drug-related: 39 percent in the course of drug
        distribution, 8 percent through pharmacological effects
        on the offender, 2 percent while the offender was
        obtaining money to buy drugs, and 4 percent through more
        than one of these links.2 </li>
</ul>

<p> Data from the National Institute of Justice Drug Use
Forecasting (DUF) program, which tests for drug use among booked
arrestees in 24 sites nationwide, showed the following patterns
in 1989: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Most males and females who were interviewed after arrest
        for a violent crime reported drinking alcohol within 72
        hours before the crime for which they were arrested. </li>
    <li>About 60 percent of arrestees booked for violent crimes
        were confirmed by laboratory test to have used at least
        one illegal drug3 in the hours before arrest. </li>
</ul>

<h3><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h3>

<h3>Explaining the correlations </h3>

<p> While these statistical patterns strongly suggest that
psychoactive substances play significant roles in acts of
violence, they do not explain the nature of those relationships.
In trying to sort out links between violence and psychoactive
substances, the panel categorized potential links in terms of the
four levels noted above: </p>

<h4>o Social and economic forces (macrosocial): </h4>

<p> Processes that affect large social units such as nations or
communities. Examples include cultural practices related to
alcohol use and, in the United States, economic and social
processes surrounding the illegal markets in which psychoactive
drugs other than alcohol are sold. </p>

<h4>o Encounters between people (microsocial): </h4>

<p> Characteristics of encounters between people. Examples
include group drinking in settings where violence is expected and
socially acceptable; arguments that are begun or aggravated
because the participants are under the influence of drugs or
alcohol; and disputes involving organizations, buyers, and
sellers in illegal drug markets. </p>

<h4>o Psychosocial: </h4>

<p> Influences on individuals' behavior patterns, which begin
developing in early childhood and continue to evolve throughout
adulthood. Examples include patterns of heavy drinking and
aggression that develop during adolescence and psychoses that
predispose a few individuals toward violent psychotic episodes
while under the influence of certain drugs. </p>

<h4>o Neurobehavioral: </h4>

<p> Processes in the brain that underlie all human behavior and
that may be altered by pharmacological effects of alcohol and
other drugs. Examples include effects of substance abuse during
pregnancy on fetal development, effects of chronic substance
abuse on brain functioning, and temporary neurological effects of
being &quot;high&quot; or &quot;blue.&quot; </p>

<p> These and other examples of links at all four levels between
violence and alcohol or other drugs are displayed in table 1.
Much of the evidence for specific links is suggestive rather than
conclusive. One challenge in understanding and verifying the
links is the complexity of interactions among factors at
different levels. It would be difficult at best to sort out such
interactions. What makes the challenge even greater is that most
studies measure factors at only one or two levels at a time, so
that the full range of interactions is rarely observed in a
single study. In addition, it is difficult to study violent
events using methods that yield generalizable conclusions.
Controlled experiments under laboratory conditions produce the
strongest confirmation of factors that influence behavior, but
practical and ethical constraints generally limit those methods
to studies of behaviors that are far milder than the potentially
lethal violence that occurs in homes and communities. At present,
therefore, there are only fragments of scientific evidence
providing partial support for the existence of many causal links
between psychoactive substances and violence. These findings
neither explain definitively how the links interact nor provide a
basis for ranking them in order of importance in explaining
variation in violence related to alcohol or other drugs. </p>

<h5>Neurobehavioral explanations </h5>

<p> Research on humans and many animal species suggests there are
several neurobehavioral links between violence and psychoactive
substances: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Expectant mothers' use of psychoactive substances during
        pregnancy adversely affects fetal development. The
        resultant damage causes learning and communication
        problems that, in turn, increase the risk of early grade
        school failure, a well-documented precursor of violent
        behavior. </li>
    <li>Alcohol is the only psychoactive drug that in many
        individuals tends to increase aggressive behavior
        temporarily while it is taking effect. However, factors
        at other levels--behavior patterns when people are not
        drinking, the setting in which people drink, and local
        drinking customs, for example--influence the strength of
        this relationship. </li>
    <li>Among alcohol abusers, those who also abuse other
        psychoactive substances, who are diagnosed with
        antisocial personality disorder, and whose parents have
        been diagnosed as alcohol abusers are at especially high
        risk of chronic violent behavior. Some researchers have
        suggested that a genetic process may contribute to this
        relatively rare pattern. </li>
    <li>Marijuana and opiates temporarily inhibit violent
        behavior, but withdrawal from opiate addiction tends to
        exaggerate both aggressive and defensive responses to
        provocations. </li>
</ul>

<p> Individual humans and animals deviate widely from these
&quot;average&quot; behaviors. For example, the
aggression-promoting effects of alcohol are strongest in animals
having high blood levels of testosterone, the principal male
hormone that distinguishes males from females; humans may or may
not exhibit the same pattern. A study of violent Finnish alcohol
abusers suggests that the alcohol-violence link may be associated
with abnormally low levels of blood sugar (that is, hypoglycemia)
and of metabolites of the brain chemical serotonin. Another study
suggests that the alcohol-violence link is especially strong in
people who exhibit certain abnormal brain wave patterns, both at
rest and while responding to outside stresses. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h3>

<h3>Common Assumptions Called Into Question </h3>

<p> On the other hand, several common assumptions about
connections between drugs and violence are called into question
by research findings: </p>

<ul>
    <li>There is no evidence to support the claim that snorting
        or injecting cocaine stimulates violent behavior.
        However, research is urgently needed on the behavioral
        effects of smoking cocaine in crack form, which affects
        the brain more directly. </li>
    <li>Anecdotal reports notwithstanding, no research evidence
        supports the notion that becoming high on hallucinogens,
        amphetamines, or PCP stimulates violent behavior in any
        systematic manner. The anecdotes usually describe chronic
        users with histories of psychosis or antisocial behavior,
        which may or may not be related to their chronic use of
        drugs. </li>
    <li>Occasional anecdotes about &quot; 'roid
        rages&quot;--violent outbursts by men who use anabolic
        steroids to accelerate muscle growth--appear to describe
        isolated coincidences rather than any common, systematic
        effect. </li>
</ul>

<h3><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h3>

<h3>Psychosocial links </h3>

<p> Evidence from research on animals and humans indicates that
patterns of substance abuse and aggressive behavior reinforce
each other. It cannot be said that one &quot;causes&quot; the
other. For example, alcohol may trigger violent episodes in
aggressive animals and people, but rarely in submissive ones. </p>

<p> Patterns of aggressive behavior and substance abuse often
become intertwined starting in childhood. Early childhood
aggression is a predictor of later heavy drinking, and the
combination is associated with an above-average risk of adult
violent behavior, especially among those who also abuse other
psychoactive drugs. </p>

<p> Research suggests at least four possible explanations for the
link between substance abuse and violent behavior in adolescents.
First, adolescents may chronically use psychoactive substances to
help them temporarily escape from such feelings as rage, guilt,
worthlessness, or depression--emotions that often precede
aggressive behavior. Second, repeated family arguments over
teenage substance abuse may eventually take on a violent
character. Next, underlying family problems or socially expected
responses may lead some adolescent males to patterns of heavy
drinking and fighting as ways to demonstrate their masculinity.
Last, boys who regularly observe older males fighting while
drinking may learn to expect that violent behavior accompanies
alcohol use. All of these processes may be at work, but their
roles, interactions, and importance as explanations have not yet
been sorted out. </p>

<p> Preexisting psychosis appears to account for occasional
violent outbursts by people who are under the influence of
amphetamines or hallucinogens, especially PCP. While these drugs
are well known to cause disorganized, bizarre behavior, they
trigger violence in very few people who are not also psychotic.
In studies of laboratory mice and monkeys, bizarre behavior on
the part of animals under the influence of PCP fairly commonly
provokes violent attacks by others in the group. Anecdotal
information and newspaper accounts report similar attacks on
humans using alcohol, amphetamines, powdered cocaine, or LSD, but
this relationship has not been systematically studied in humans. </p>

<h4>Encounters between people </h4>

<p> In a variety of ways, alcohol and drugs modify encounters
between people in ways that make these substances greater hazards
for violence. In the case of alcohol, these hazards tend to be
related to use, while for illegal psychoactive drugs they tend to
be related to distribution and purchase. </p>

<p> Alcohol use and sexual violence. Some therapists who treat
violent sex offenders have reported that their patients tend to
have both histories of alcohol abuse and high blood levels of
testosterone. Without comparisons to men who are not violent sex
offenders, these clinical observations cannot demonstrate that
alcohol abuse or high testosterone levels cause sexual violence.
Studies of many animal species suggest a causal connection--that
alcohol reduces testosterone levels but has stronger
aggression-promoting effects in individual high-testosterone
animals. However, that relationship has not yet been tested in
humans. The frequent involvement of alcohol in acquaintance rapes
suggests that social expectations may also be at work; that is,
young men who expect to have sex after drinking may try to
satisfy their expectations, sometimes forcibly if they encounter
resistance. </p>

<p> Illegal drug markets. Illegal drug markets operate outside
the world of contract law, courts and mediators for resolving
disputes, and business customs that distinguish socially
acceptable from unac- ceptable approaches to buying and selling.
Illegal markets often develop substitute mechanisms that involve
the threat or actual use of violence. Examples include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Violence by drug distributors in the course of
        territorial disputes between rival organizations, threats
        of violence to make &quot;staff&quot; obey organizational
        rules, violent punishment of rulebreakers to keep the
        threats credible, battles with police, and protection of
        sellers or drugs on the street. </li>
    <li>Violence between buyer and seller during a drug
        transaction, caused, for example, by attempted robbery of
        one or the other, failure to hand over drugs or money, or
        &quot;honest&quot; misunderstandings of local rules of
        the game on the part of buyers and sellers. </li>
    <li>Violence involving people other than buyers and sellers
        who are found around drug markets--third parties such as
        innocent bystanders and people operating in related
        illegal markets for &quot;protection,&quot; guns, or
        prostitution. </li>
</ul>

<p> As places where violence tends to occur for the reasons
listed above, illegal drug markets may also serve as
&quot;magnets.&quot; As such, they attract valuable drugs and
cash, weapons, and people who are accustomed to violence. The mix
of these ingredients creates hazardous conditions for robberies
and other forms of violence that may not be directly related to
drugs. </p>

<p> Obtaining drug purchase money. In some settings, the need for
money to buy drugs also increases the chance of a violent
encounter. A taxi driver carrying a passenger late at night, for
example, is presumably at greater risk of being robbed if the
passenger wants to buy drugs but lacks the cash to do so. While
robbery is still a common way to obtain money to buy drugs, it
has been replaced by drug selling in some large cities. </p>

<p> Using alcohol and drugs. If alcohol caused violence only by
making individuals behave more aggressively, violence would be
equally common in all places where drinking occurs. In fact,
however, most drinking places are rarely scenes of violence. A
few acquire reputations as &quot;animal houses&quot; or
&quot;fighting bars,&quot; where people expect drinking and
violence to go hand in hand. </p>

<p> Just what characteristics of a drinking place make it a
hazard for violence are not precisely known, but there is
supporting evidence for several possible explanations. People who
drink in fighting bars may behave violently in order to &quot;fit
in&quot; or to advance socially. People who experience anger or
frustration may seek out such settings, because they believe that
drinking in these types of establishments means social permission
to engage in violent behavior. One study of a group of young men
who were observed during an evening of drinking illustrates this
by suggesting that behavior patterns and situational influences
may play off each other. As the evening progressed, the group
began both to behave more aggressively and to move on to
establishments where aggressive behavior was more socially
acceptable. </p>

<p> Connections between drinking and violence have been
identified by researchers in many countries with predominantly
European cultures. But they have not been found in many tribal
and folk societies, even where binge drinking is common. For
reasons not yet known, expectations that violence follows
drinking have failed to develop in those cultures. </p>

<p> Finally, it seems likely that substance abuse is indirectly
related to violence in ways that are difficult to identify and
count. Examples of indirect relationships include robberies
committed to replace household money spent on drugs or alcohol,
or spouse assaults arising from disputes over money or time spent
away from home drinking or taking drugs. </p>

<p> Violence is related to the distribution, purchase, and use of
illegal drugs or alcohol in a wide variety of human interactions.
Unfortunately, the difficulty of counting such interactions makes
it also difficult to rank them in order of importance. Better
counts would help in focusing violence prevention strategies on
the most common interactions in which drug- and alcohol-related
violence occurs. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h3>

<h3>Social and economic forces </h3>

<p> If the patterns of behavior discussed above were the only
links between illegal drug distribution and violence, every city
that experienced a crack epidemic in the 1980's would also have
seen a substantial increase in homicide at the same time. Indeed,
policymakers have occasionally claimed a &quot;uniform, straight
line relationship&quot; between illegal drug use and murder.4 </p>

<p> The reality is more complex. The murder rate increased 350
percent in Washington, D.C., and by a smaller amount in New York
City as their crack epidemics unfolded. However, during the crack
epidemics in Detroit and Los Angeles these cities experienced
decreases in the murder rate. This suggests that the
relationships between illegal drug market activity and lethal
violence are intertwined with social and economic processes in
the surrounding community. </p>

<p> What are these processes? Because causal patterns at the
social level are especially difficult to establish, the answers
are necessarily speculative. Fragments of evidence suggest that
some or all of the following factors may influence the
relationship between levels of violence and illegal drug market
activity: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Stability of drug market control: Situations that produce
        violent encounters--fights over territorial allocations
        or misunderstandings between buyers and sellers, for
        example--arose relatively infrequently in markets
        controlled by old, stable organizations that had
        developed operating rules decades ago and enforced them
        through a standing threat to punish violators violently.
        Where the spread of crack manufacturing technology
        encouraged new organizations to enter the markets, the
        resulting destabilization may temporarily have increased
        the frequency of violent encounters. </li>
    <li>Community access to legitimate economic opportunities:
        Where the rise of crack markets followed the exodus of
        legitimate economic opportunities from central cities,
        economic rewards shifted away from skills valued by
        legitimate employers to those valued by crack
        distribution organizations; these included the ability to
        threaten and use violence. </li>
    <li>Strength of informal violence controls: Where the exodus
        of legitimate economic opportunities from urban
        communities took with it many people committed to legal,
        nonviolent values, those people were no longer available
        for roles in preventing drug-related violence. They were
        not available, for example, as nonviolent role models for
        adolescents, as passers-by who might discourage drug
        buyers or intervene in emerging violent events, or as
        concerned individuals who might inform parents if their
        children began drifting toward involvement in drug
        markets. </li>
    <li>Social status and moral authority: During crack epidemics
        in some communities, successful young drug entrepreneurs
        either supplanted or intimidated neighborhood &quot;old
        heads&quot;--unofficial community leaders who upheld
        traditional values and had exercised moral authority in
        the neighborhood. Where this occurred, it tended to
        weaken cultural restraints against violence in all
        contexts, including drug markets. </li>
</ul>

<p> Because such relationships are difficult to verify, evidence
supporting their influence is only suggestive and fragmentary,
and new research is needed to explore them more fully. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>Preventive interventions </h2>

<p> A number of intervention strategies for preventing violence
related to psychoactive substances have been proposed: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Police disruption of illegal drug markets. </li>
    <li>Selectively longer incarceration of violent drug-using
        criminals. </li>
    <li>Reducing teenagers' access to alcohol. </li>
    <li>Substance abuse prevention. </li>
    <li>Drug abuse treatment. </li>
    <li>Pharmacological therapies to reduce drug craving and
        aggressive tendencies associated with alcohol use and
        heroin addiction. </li>
</ul>

<p> Some of these strategies have been evaluated to test their
effectiveness in reducing violence. Only a few have demonstrated
success under any conditions; none have shown universal
effectiveness. Developing better interventions will require
collaborative problem-solving initiatives that involve
representatives of criminal justice agencies, providers of
substance abuse treatment and other social services, and
evaluation researchers. These initiatives are needed to turn
promising ideas into workable programs, to evaluate the programs,
and to refine them in light of the evaluation results. The
findings of evaluations conducted thus far are summarized in the
following sections. </p>

<p> <strong>Disrupting illegal drug markets.</strong> Police
attack illegal drug markets through a number of tactics:
undercover investigations leading to dealers' arrests;
cooperation with community antidrug efforts; and large-scale,
high-visibility crackdowns. Evaluations of these tactics in
Birmingham, Alabama; Lawrence and Lynn, Massachusetts; New York
City; Oakland, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and
Washington, D.C., present a mixed picture. Perhaps the strongest
supportable statement is that their chance of success is improved
by intervening early in emerging markets, by creating a highly
committed police force, and by generating community receptivity
and cooperation in advance. NIJ's Drug Market Analysis (DMA)
program is helping with the first prerequisite--early detection
of drug markets. Specific techniques for creating supportive
climates in police departments and the surrounding communities
are less well understood, although many approaches are now being
tested as part of community policing initiatives. </p>

<p> <strong>Incarcerating violent drug-using criminals. </strong>Researchers
have generally found that compared to other violent offenders,
those who use drugs tend to have higher average frequencies of
violent crimes such as robbery and assault. This finding raises
the possibility that sentencing drug-involved offenders who are
convicted of these crimes to longer prison terms might reduce
violence. However, analyses suggest that this strategy of
&quot;selective incapacitation&quot; would reduce violent crime
levels very little unless it were accompanied by massive
increases in prison populations. </p>

<p> <strong>A related strategy--monitoring pretrial releasees'
drug use through urinalysis</strong>--showed rather surprising
effects in a Washington, D.C., evaluation. Although positive drug
test results did not predict significantly higher pretrial
rearrest rates, failure to show up for the test was a strong
predictor of subsequent new crimes leading to rearrest. </p>

<p> <strong>Reducing teenagers' access to alcohol.</strong>
Evidence is fairly clear that increases in tax rates and other
measures that reduce the availability of alcohol to adolescents
(social pressure and enforcement of underage drinking laws) in
turn reduce drinking and certain associated problems such as
death rates due to auto collisions. Therefore, these strategies
may also reduce adolescents' disproportionate share of violence.
That conjecture remains to be tested, however. </p>

<p> <strong>Substance abuse prevention. </strong>By reducing the
demand that fuels violent, illegal drug markets, substance abuse
prevention should, in theory, reduce violence levels. Many
substance abuse prevention programs have been evaluated,
including the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE), which
brings police officers into classrooms as instructors.
Evaluations of prevention programs have generally found them
effective in delaying the onset of tobacco, alcohol, and
marijuana use. Evaluations have not generally found that
education succeeds in preventing use of &quot;harder&quot; drugs,
perhaps because use of those drugs was rare even in the control
groups that did not receive preventive education. However, to the
extent that minor drugs are &quot;stepping stones&quot; to the
harder ones,5 the programs may have meaningful, yet delayed,
effects for violence reduction. </p>

<p> <strong>Prevention</strong> may have an especially important
role to play for one category of adolescents--males whose
behavior meets diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality
disorder and whose parents abuse alcohol. Research indicates that
these two factors, coupled with both alcohol and drug abuse,
create a high-risk profile for violent behavior in adulthood. </p>

<p> <strong>Drug abuse treatment</strong>. Successful drug
treatment programs reduce criminal activity among adult clients.
For drug abusers who are not in prison, stays of at least 3
months in therapeutic communities reduce the tendency to commit
crime after discharge. Up to about 18 months, longer stays in the
therapeutic community produce greater reductions. </p>

<p> For drug abusers in prison, treatment usually involves only
individual or group sessions a few times a week with no
postrelease followup. Evaluations of this approach have not found
it sufficient to reduce criminal behavior following release.
However, a more intensive approach--combining inprison
therapeutic communities, planning for postrelease treatment, and
postrelease treatment in the community--reduces overall rearrest
rates of inmates who complete the program. At least three
programs have used this approach: Stay 'n Out (in a New York
prison), Cornerstone (in the Oregon State Hospital), and the
California Civil Addict Program. </p>

<p> In addition to these beneficial effects of drug treatment on
offenders' behavior, successful treatment may reduce aggregate
levels of violence related to drug markets by lowering the demand
that fuels the markets. Such an effect would, however, be
difficult to measure. </p>

<p> <strong>Pharmacological interventions.</strong> Like other
forms of drug treatment, pharmacological therapies that reduce
drug craving may also lower the demand that supports violent drug
markets. For decades, methadone and related chemicals have been
used to reduce craving for heroin. There is no analogue to
methadone for treating addiction to cocaine in powdered or
smokable form. However, using animals as test subjects,
researchers have identified the receptors for certain subtypes of
two brain chemicals, dopamine and norepinephrine, as promising
sites to begin developing such medications. Animal research also
suggests neurochemical starting points for developing medications
that reduce violence in other ways: by disrupting the
aggression-promoting effects of alcohol and by preventing
aggression during withdrawal from heroin addiction. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>

<p> Too few of the links between violence and psychoactive
substances have been established with enough certainty to
advocate a comprehensive national policy for preventing violence
related to those substances. Instead, a program of testing and
evaluating tactics for implementing a variety of promising
strategies is called for. Among these strategies, criminal
justice agencies have particular roles in developing and testing
tactics to disrupt illegal drug markets, in monitoring drug use
of pretrial releasees, in establishing drug abuse treatment for
convicted criminals, and in creating effective substance abuse
prevention programs. Fulfilling these roles will require
cooperation between the criminal justice system and drug
treatment, prevention, and education authorities. Eventually,
efforts to prevent drug-related violence may be assisted by
pharmacological therapies to reduce the aggression-promoting
effects of alcohol and the craving for other psychoactive drugs. </p>

<h2>Notes </h2>

<p> 1. Among studies of this relationship, many group all illegal
drugs together. Those that distinguish among drugs usually list
cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, barbiturates, and hallucinogens
other than marijuana. See, for example, Elliott, D.S., and D.
Huizinga, The Relationship Between Delinquent Behavior and ADM
[Alcohol, Drug, and Mental Health] Problems, National Youth
Survey Report No. 26. Boulder, Colorado: Behavioral Research
Institute, 1984. </p>

Problems 16 (Winter 1989):651--687. </p>

<p> 3. The DUF program uses urinalysis to confirm self-reports.
The urine specimens are tested for cocaine, opiates, marijuana,
PCP, methadone, benzodiazepine (Valium), methaqualone,
propoxyphene (Darvon), barbiturates, and amphetamines. Samples
are collected at the time of arrest on a voluntary basis; an
average of 80 percent of arrestees voluntarily cooperate. Test
criteria are set to detect use of most drugs in the preceding 24
to 48 hours, but marijuana and PCP can be detected in the urine
several weeks after use. </p>

Abusers Fuel Nation's Crisis,&quot; Washington Post, August 17,
1990. </p>

<p> 5. Until recently, research on developmental pathways
consistently found these drugs to be &quot;gateways&quot; or
&quot;stepping stones&quot; to cocaine use. Preliminary findings,
presented after the Panel completed its report, suggest that
since the New York City &quot;crack epidemic&quot; of the early
1980's, crack-using youth in increasing numbers are skipping the
gateway drugs and starting directly with crack. </p>

<p> Author's Biography </p>

<p> Dr. Jeffrey A. Roth served as study director for the Panel on
the Under-standing and Control of Violent Behavior. Currently he
is research director in the Bethesda, Maryland, office of the Law
and Public Policy area of Abt Associates, Inc. </p>

<p> Sidebar 1 </p>

<p> Panel on the Understanding and Control of Violent Behavior </p>

<p> Violence is universally recognized as a pervasive part of
contemporary American society and of our Nation's past as well.
Many of the attempts to understand the phenomenon have been made
in response to specific situations, such as the lawlessness of
the Prohibition era, the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, and the urban riots of the mid-1960's. Other attempts at
understanding violence singled out particular causes for
analysis. In none of these studies, however, was the full body of
research on violence reviewed comprehensively, and none of them
took an interdisciplinary approach. </p>

<p> The Panel on the Understanding and Control of Violent
Behavior was set up to meet the need for a more comprehensive
assessment of what is known about violent behavior. It was
established in response to a request made by three Federal
agencies: the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National
Institute of Justice (NIJ), and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC). NSF asked for a review of current knowledge
about the causes of violent behavior and recommendations for
future research. The other two agencies shared these goals, but
their areas of interest reflected their particular missions. As
the research arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, NIJ wanted to
find out about means to prevent and control violent crime. The
CDC wanted assistance in setting priorities for preventing
injuries and deaths caused by violence. </p>

<p> Created in 1989, the panel reviewed research on
&quot;interpersonal violence&quot;--events involving at most a
few perpetrators and victims. This limitation excluded suicide
and self-mutilation as well as large-scale collective and State
violence. The focus was on describing, understanding, and
controlling violence in the United States. Research in
biomedical, psychological, and other social sciences was
reviewed. The work of the panel was intended both to help guide
future research and evaluation projects aimed at prevention and
control and to suggest strategic directions for violence control
policy. </p>

<p> The findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the panel
were published in Volume 1 of Understanding and Preventing
Violence, published by the National Academy Press. Three volumes
of background papers commissioned by the panel are forthcoming.
The panel concluded that numerous, often interacting factors give
rise to violent events. Although the underlying interactions are
not well understood, attention to the factors suggests many
promising preventive interventions. Testing and evaluating these
interventions creates opportunities to prevent particular types
of violence while gaining better understanding of them. The panel
made recommendations in a number of areas, among them development
of problem-solving initiatives to control and understand
violence; better statistical systems for measuring violence; and
a program of research to identify underlying causes. This
Research in Brief is one of a series that summarizes the panel's
findings. </p>

<p> NIJ is committed to implementing the recommendations of the
panel. Its commitment has begun through support for the Program
on Human Development and Criminal Behavior, a longitudinal,
multicommunity research project that is exploring the factors
associated with violence. In addition, the panel's
recommendations have helped shape the goals of NIJ research and
evaluation activities and its long-range plans for research. </p>

<h2>Federal Financial Analysis of Legalization of Drugs </h2>

<p>This Federal financial analysis of legalization comes from
Theodore R. Vallance, Former chief of the Planning Branch of the
National Institutes of Mental Health. His main professional
effort for many years was directed at just this sort of analysis.
The analysis was published in the 7-10-95 issue of National
Review. </p>

<h2><a name="q1">1. Why were the laws against drugs passed in the
first place? </a></h2>

<p>The first American anti-drug law was an 1875 San Francisco
ordinance which outlawed the smoking of opium in opium dens. It
was passed because of the fear that Chinese men were luring white
women to their &quot;ruin&quot; in opium dens. &quot;Ruin&quot;
was defined as associating with Chinese men. It was followed by
other similar laws, including Federal laws in which trafficking
in opium was forbidden to anyone of Chinese origin, and
restrictions on the importation of smoking opium. The laws did
not have anything really to do with the importation of opium as a
drug, because the importation and use of opium in other forms --
such as in the common medication laudunum -- were not affected.
The laws were directed at smoking opium because it was perceived
that the smoking of opium was a peculiarly Chinese custom. In
short, it was a way of legally targeting the Chinese. </p>

<p>Cocaine was outlawed because of fears that superhuman
&quot;Negro Cocaine Fiends&quot; or &quot;Cocainized
Niggers&quot; (actual terms used by newspapers in the early
1900's) take large amounts of cocaine which would make them go on
a violent sexual rampage and rape white women. There is little
evidence that any black men actually did this, if only because it
would have been certain death. The United States set a record in
1905 with 105 recorded lynchings of black men. At the same time,
police nationwide switched from .32 caliber pistols to .38
caliber pistols because it was believed that the superhuman
&quot;Negro Cocaine Fiend&quot; could not be killed with the
smaller gun. </p>

<p>Dr. Hamilton Wright is sometimes referred to as the
&quot;Father of American Drug Laws&quot;. Dr. Wright was the
Opium Commissioner at the time and had previously become famous
because he had &quot;scientifically proved&quot; that beri-beri
was a communicable disease. Beri-beri is a vitamin deficiency. </p>

<p>The Harrison Act which &quot;outlawed&quot; these drugs was,
on its face, a simple licensing law which simply required sellers
to get a license if they were going to handle the opiates and
cocaine. As the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs
has said, it is doubtful that very many members of Congress would
have thought that they were passing what would later be regarded
as a general drug prohibition. The law even contained a provision
that nothing in the law would prohibit doctors from prescribing
these drugs in the legitimate practice of medicine. </p>

<p>In fact, even the people who wrote the Harrison Act and the
Marijuana Tax Act in 1937 agreed that a general prohibition on
what people could put into their own bodies was plainly an
unconstitutional infringement on personal liberties. For
comparison, see the history of the constitutional amendment which
was required to prohibit alcohol. There is no fundamental reason
why a constitutional amendment should be required to prohibit one
chemical and not another. </p>

<p>The trick was that the bureaucrats who were authorized to
issue licenses never did so, and there was a heavy penalty for
not having the license. This heavy penalty required that the
enforcing bureaucrats needed more staff and, therefore, more
power, which, in turn required tougher laws. Over the years,
through a series of court rulings, they gradually got the courts
to change what had been well-established constitutional law.
Specifically, they got the courts to accept the notion that it
really was a tax violation when people got arrested for drugs,
and that the fact that the government would not issue any
licenses was not a defense. They also got the courts to bypass
the old issue of whether the Federal Government had the right to
control what an individual puts into their own bodies by creating
the fiction that whatever the person puts into their bodies must
have come as a result of some form of interstate commerce, which
is regulated by the Federal Government in the form of taxes and
licenses and, therefore, since the Federal Government is allowed
to levy a tax it is -- by rather indirect logic -- allowed to
regulate what anyone may put into their own bodies. </p>

<p>Marijuana was outlawed in 1937 as a repressive measure against
Mexican workers who crossed the border seeking jobs during the
Depression. The specific reason given for the outlawing of the
hemp plant was its supposed violent &quot;effect on the
degenerate races.&quot; (Testimony of Bureau of Narcotics
Commissioner Harry J. Anslinger, in testimony before Congress in
hearings on the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937). The American Medical
Association specifically testified that they were opposed to the
law. When the supporters of the law were asked about the AMA's
view on the law on the floor of Congress, they lied and said that
the AMA was in favor of the law because they knew the law would
never pass without the AMA's endorsement. The law passed, and the
AMA later protested, but the law was never repealed. </p>

<p>In both cases, newspapers across the country carried lurid
stories of the awful things that these drugs did to racial
minorities, and of the horrors that people of racial minorities
inflicted on innocent white people while they were under the
influence of these drugs. Later research has shown that not a
single one of the stories used to promote these laws could be
substantiated. </p>

<p>There never was any scholarly evidence that the laws were
necessary, or even beneficial, to public health and safety and
none was presented when the laws were passed. </p>

<h2><a name="q2">2. How many people use drugs in the United
States?</a> </h2>

<p>This is a difficult question to answer with any certainty. </p>

<p>The Federal Government's Household Survey on Drug Abuse,
conducted annually, is the most commonly cited set of statistics
on the prevalence of drug use. According to the latest surveys,
cited by the DEA themselves, there are about 12.7 million people
who have used some illegal drug in the last month and perhaps 30
to 40 million who have used some illegal drug within the last
year. Of the 12.7 million who used illegal drugs in the last
month, about 10 million are presumed to be casual drug users, and
about 2.7 million are addicts. </p>

<p>But there are a number of problems with these figures. The
survey is conducted by calling people on the telephone at random
and asking them about their use of illegal drugs. Some of the
problems with this technique are: </p>

<ol>
    <li>It only reaches people who have a telephone. If the
        effects of drugs are as bad as some people claim, it
        seems only reasonable that a lot of addicts would no
        longer have a telephone. </li>
    <li>It only reaches people who answered the telephone. There
        are many groups of people who would not necessarily
        answer the phone, including addicts who are out looking
        for drugs, as well as business people out for a
        two-martini lunch. </li>
    <li>The survey crew calls people they don't know and asks
        them if anyone in their household has committed a felony
        (used drugs) recently. In a time of increasing penalties
        for drug use, and increasing publicity about those
        penalties, it seems only logical that most people would
        not answer this question entirely honestly, particularly
        if they were currently using drugs and, therefore, were
        acutely aware of the penalties. Rather than a measure of
        the number of people who use drugs, the Household Survey
        may be a better measure of the number of people stupid
        enough to answer the question. </li>
</ol>

<p>Other surveys put the number of drug users at levels that are
perhaps twice as high as the figures produced by the Household
Survey on Drug Abuse. The very disparity of the estimates of
various surveys points to one of the problems caused by a general
drug prohibition. Because these drugs are illegal, it is
difficult to get accurate information about their use. </p>

<p>The source for the number of drug users comes from, among
other sources, the Household Survey on Drug Abuse, a Federal
survey, available through any of the sources listed here. The
costs to imprison them are based upon figures published by the
Department of Justice, available through the sources mentioned
here. </p>

<h2><a name="q3">3. How many people are actually killed by drugs?</a>
</h2>

<p>The number of drug deaths in the US in a typical year is as
follows: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Tobacco kills about 390,000. </li>
    <li>Alcohol kills about 80,000. </li>
    <li>Sidestream smoke from tobacco kills about 50,000. </li>
    <li>Cocaine kills about 2,200. </li>
    <li>Heroin kills about 2,000. </li>
    <li>Aspirin kills about 2,000. </li>
    <li>Marijuana kills 0. There has never been a recorded death
        due to marijuana at any time in US history. </li>
    <li>All illegal drugs combined kill about 4,500 people per
        year, or about one percent of the number killed by
        alcohol and tobacco. Tobacco kills more people each year
        than all of the people killed by all of the illegal drugs
        in the last century. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="q4">4. Which drug causes the greatest burden on our
medical facilities? </a></h2>

<p>Alcohol and tobacco are the clear leaders. Some authorities
have estimated that up to forty percent of all hospital care in
the United States is for conditions related to alcohol. </p>

<p>As a medical hazard, few drugs can compete with alcohol or
tobacco on any scale. A study at Rockefeller University in 1967
concluded that &quot;Tobacco is unquestionably more hazardous to
the health than heroin.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<h2><a name="q5">5. Which drugs are the most addictive? </a></h2>

<p>This is a difficult question to answer because it depends upon
a lot of factors in both the drug and the person who uses it. In
an attempt to define clearly what is meant by addiction, and
which drugs are the most addictive, Dr. Jack E. Henningfield of
the National Institute on Drug Abuse and Dr. Neal L. Benowitz of
the University of California at San Francisco ranked six
psychoactive substances on five criteria. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Withdrawal -- The severity of withdrawal symptoms
        produced by stopping the use of the drug. </li>
    <li>Reinforcement -- The drug's tendency to induce users to
        take it again and again. </li>
    <li>Tolerance -- The user's need to have ever-increasing
        doses to get the same effect. </li>
    <li>Dependence -- The difficulty in quitting, or staying off
        the drug, the number of users who eventually become
        dependent </li>
    <li>Intoxication -- The degree of intoxication produced by
        the drug in typical use. </li>
</ul>

<p>The tables listed below show the rankings given for each of
the drugs. Overall, their evaluations for the drugs are very
consistent. It is notable that marijuana ranks below caffeine in
most addictive criteria, while alcohol and tobacco are near the
top of the scale in many areas. </p>

<p>The rating scale is from 1 to 6. 1 denotes the drug with the
strongest addictive tendencies, while 6 denotes the drug with the
least addictive tendencies. </p>

<h2><a name="q6">6. Do illegal drugs cause violent crime? </a></h2>

<ul>
    <li>Of all psychoactive substances, alcohol is the only one
        whose consumption has been shown to commonly increase
        aggression. After large doses of amphetamines, cocaine,
        LSD, and PCP, certain individuals may experience violent
        outbursts, probably because of preexisting psychosis.
        Research is needed on the pharmacological effects of
        crack, which enters the brain more directly than cocaine
        used in other forms. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Alcohol drinking and violence are linked through
        pharmacological effects on behavior, through expectations
        that heavy drinking and violence go together in certain
        settings, and through patterns of binge drinking and
        fighting that sometimes develop in adolescence. . . . </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Illegal drugs and violence are linked primarily through
        drug marketing: disputes among rival distributors,
        arguments and robberies involving buyers and sellers,
        property crimes committed to raise drug money and, more
        speculatively, social and economic interactions between
        the illegal markets and the surrounding communities. </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="../GOVPUBS/psycviol.htm">Psychoactive Substances and
Violence</a><i>, by Jeffrey A. Roth, Department of Justice
Series: Research in Brief, Published: February 1994</i> </p>

<p>All major authorities agree that the vast majority of
drug-related violent crime is caused by the prohibition against
drugs, rather than the drugs themselves. This was the same
situation which was true during alcohol Prohibition. Alcohol
Prohibition gave rise to a violent criminal organization. Violent
crime dropped 65 percent in the year Prohibition was repealed. </p>

<p>There are about 25,000 homicides in the United States each
year. A study of 414 homicides in New York City at the height of
the crack epidemic showed that only three murders, less than one
percent, could be attributed to the behavioral effects of cocaine
or crack. Of these, two were victim-precipitated. For example,
one homicide victim tried to rape someone who was high on crack
and got killed in the process. </p>

<p><img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"

<h2><a name="q7">7. Can we win the war on drugs this way? </a></h2>

<p>We could win the war on drugs if we could be successful in at
least one of three areas: </p>

<h3><img src="../GRAPHICS/subbutto.gif" align="bottom" width="18"
height="15">We could stop drug production in other countries. </h3>

<p>On December 28, 1992 ABC Television aired a major special on
the drug war in Bolivia which, according to the Bush
Administration, is our &quot;best hope&quot; for winning the drug
war in South America. They concluded decisively that there was no
hope and that the war on drug production has already been lost. </p>

<p>By the US Federal Government's own estimates, the entire
United States consumption of illegal drugs could be supplied by
approximately one percent of the worldwide drug crop. In their
best year, US Drug Enforcement Agents working together with
foreign governments seized about one percent of the worldwide
drug crop, leaving 99 percent free to supply the US. The US
Government also states that, in the unlikely event that drug
production was stopped in South America, several countries would
suffer a major economic collapse. </p>

<p>There is no credible evidence anywhere to suggest that there
is any possibility that drug production can be eliminated in
other countries. </p>

<p>&quot;Peter Jennings Reporting: The Cocaine War, Lost in
Bolivia,&quot; ABC News, December 28, 1993 </p>

<p>US Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics
Matters, <u>International Narcotics Control Strategy Report</u>
(INCSR) (Washington: US Department of State, April, 1993 </p>

<h3><img src="../GRAPHICS/subbutto.gif" align="bottom" width="18"
height="15">We could stop drugs at the border. </h3>

<p>No. Any examination of the statistics regarding border
interdiction shows quite clearly that border interdiction is an
expensive failure. In 1990, the General Accounting Office
completed a major study on border interdiction. They reported
that border interdiction was a waste of money and that no
conceivable increase in funding or effort would make it any
better. </p>

<p>In 1988, Stirling Johson, the Federal prosecutor for New York,
stated that the police would have to increase drug seizures by at
least 1,400 percent to have any impact at all on the drug market,
assuming there were no corresponding increases in production.
That was before the police busted twenty tons of cocaine in a
single location and had to revise all their estimates of the
cocaine market upward. </p>

<p>The best Federal Government evidence has concluded that there
is no way to stop, or even greatly reduce, either production of
drugs in foreign countries or the smuggling of drugs into the US.
</p>

<p>There is no credible evidence anywhere that we could stop, or
even greatly reduce, the flow of drugs across our borders. In
fact, all of the Federal Government's own evidence shows that
this is impossible and it is a waste of money to try. </p>

Participation in Drug Interdiction</u>, Peter Reuter, The Rand
Corporation, Santa Monica, CA, 1988 </p>

Detection and Monitoring on Cocaine Flows,&quot; General
Accounting Office, September 19, 1991 </p>

<h3><img src="../GRAPHICS/subbutto.gif" align="bottom" width="18"
height="15">We could stop the sale of drugs within the United
States, </h3>

<p>The first question to address is how many drug dealers are
there? Under the law, all drug users are drug dealers because the
laws in most states state that any distribution of illegal drugs
is considered a sale, regardless of whether there is a profit or
monetary interest involved. Therefore, under the law, anyone who
ever passed a joint to the next person at a rock concert is a
&quot;drug dealer&quot;. If we use the strict legal definition of
a &quot;dealer&quot; then there are somewhere between 12 and 40
million drug dealers in the United States. </p>

<p>We might use a more restricted definition and assume that we
will imprison only the drug dealers who distribute drugs on a
regular basis. Research has long established that most drug sales
are between friends who have known each other for a long time.
Still, under this tighter definition, most drug users would be
classed as &quot;drug dealers&quot; and we are left with the same
problem of potentially incarcerating tens of millions of
Americans. </p>

<p>No. Most of the prisons and jails in the United States are
already far in excess of their planned capacity and correctional
institutions in 24 states are under Federal court order to
release prisoners. Arresting all of the drug dealers would
require construction of at least five new prison beds for every
one which now exists, assuming that no new drug dealers came
along to fill the gap. </p>

<p>In September, 1992 Sheriff Sherman Block announced that he
would release 4,000 prisoners, about twenty percent of the total
Los Angeles County jail population, because there was no room to
keep them and no more tax dollars to build more jails. For every
person who goes to jail from now on, another one will be
released. Tough drug laws have done all they can do and they have
not solved the problem. The &quot;get-tough&quot; policy is over.
</p>

<p>There is no credible evidence anywhere that we could stop, or
even greatly reduce, the sale of drugs within the United States.
In fact, all of the Federal Government's own evidence shows that
this is impossible and not only is it a waste of money to try,
but it actually does more harm than if we did nothing at all. </p>

<p>Many sources, including the list of major studies and Sterling
Johnson, Federal Prosecutor for the District of New York, in
testimony before the House Select Committee on Narcotics and Drug
Abuse, September, 1988. </p>

<p><img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<h2><a name="q8">8. How many millions of people will have to go
to prison?</a> </h2>

<p>There are currently about 1.5 million people in state and
Federal prisons and jails throughout the United States. At the
current time, at least 24 states are under Federal court orders
to relieve prison overcrowding. </p>

<p>The following chart shows the growth of the US prison
population since 1960. The US prison population was relatively
stable from about 1926, when figures were first compiled, through
1970. After this point, the effects of Nixon's war against drugs,
and later the Reagan and Bush war against drugs, produced a
dramatic increase in the number of prisoners. </p>

</p>

<p>There are an estimated thirty to forty million people who have
used illegal drugs in the last year. If we imprisoned all of
them, we would have to build a prison large enough to hold the
combined populations of California, Arizona, and New Mexico. The
total cost to imprison them for five years, including the costs
of arrest and prosecution would be roughly ten to fifteen
trillion dollars, or about ten times the total Federal annual
budget. This does not include the related costs to society which
would be caused by the imprisonment of millions of gainfully
employed, tax-paying citizens. </p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be any clear answer to this question. I
have asked public officials of all kinds, including law
enforcement officers, elected officials and all three of the US
Federal Drug Czars. To date, the only person who has ever replied
with an actual numerical estimate is Michael Levine, one of the
DEA's former top agents. He estimated that the optimum number of
drug offenders to put in prison would be about 2.7 million -- in
addition to the people who are currently in prison. His
assumption, he said, was that we would put all of the addicts in
prison, and he estimated the number of addicts at about 2.7
million, based on other government figures. Mr. Levine's plan
would require that, for every prison cell which now exists, we
would have to build three more just like it. He did not say what
he would do about the fact that even this plan would leave tens
of millions of recreational drug users free to continue their
drug use with little fear of prosecution. </p>

<h2><a name="q9">9. What does it cost to put a single drug dealer
in jail? </a></h2>

<p>The cost to put a single drug dealer in jail is about
$450,000, composed of the following: </p>

<p>The cost for arrest and conviction is about $150,000. </p>

<p>The cost for an additional prison bed is about $50,000 to
$150,000, depending upon the jurisdiction. </p>

<p>It costs about $30,000 per year to house a prisoner. With an
average sentence of 5 years, that adds up to another $150,000. </p>

<p>The same $450,000 can provide treatment or education for about
200 people. In addition, putting a person in prison produces
about fifteen dollars in related welfare costs, for every dollar
spent on incarceration. Every dollar spent on treatment and
education saves about five dollars in related welfare costs. </p>

<h2><a name="q10">10. What does this drug policy do to the black
community? </a></h2>

<p>At the present time, one-fourth of all of the young black men
in America are either in prison or on parole. Most of them were
arrested on non-violent drug charges. </p>

<p>In Washington, DC, the Bush administration's
&quot;demonstration&quot; city, half of all of the black men in
the city are currently in jail or on parole. More than ninety
percent have arrest records. The same is true of inner city black
men in Baltimore, New York, New Jersey, and Florida. </p>

<p>Two-thirds of all of today's black male high school students
will be dead, disabled, or in prison before their thirtieth
birthday. The majority will go to prison because of non-violent
drug charges. For every black man who goes to college, three will
go to prison. </p>

<p>By the year 2000, about half of all black men in America will
have gone to prison. Most of them will go to prison for
non-violent drug charges. Most of those who go to prison will be
released into society again. Because they are black men with a
prison record, they will be permanently unemployable. </p>

<h2><a name="q11">11. How does our policy compare with the
policies of other countries?</a> </h2>

<p>Europe is beginning to form uniform drug laws as a result of
European unification. Europe is decriminalizing drugs along the
lines of the programs used in England and the Netherlands. Most
of the countries have already approved the Frankfort Accord,
which adopts decriminalization as the primary approach to drugs. </p>

<p>Let's compare the results of two roughly comparable major
cities which both have a drug problem. The cities are New York,
and Liverpool, England. </p>

<ul>
    <li>In New York, heroin and cocaine addicts suffer from
        tremendous medical problems. In Liverpool, England, most
        heroin and cocaine addicts suffer few medical problems. </li>
    <li>In New York, most drug addicts are unemployed criminals.
        In Liverpool, most drug addicts are gainfully employed
        taxpayers. </li>
    <li>In New York, crime committed by drug addicts is a major
        problem. In Liverpool, it is a very minor problem. </li>
    <li>In New York, drug addicts often have their children taken
        away and live under miserable conditions. In Liverpool,
        most addicts live with their families in stable homes and
        manage to raise healthy, well-adjusted children. </li>
    <li>In New York, thousands of babies are permanently damaged
        every year by their mother's drug use. In Liverpool,
        health authorities report no cases of harm to infants as
        a result of their mother's drug use. </li>
    <li>In New York, sixty percent of all intravenous drug users
        are infected with AIDS, and they are a major cause of the
        spread of AIDS. In Liverpool, only one percent of the
        intravenous drug users are infected with AIDS and they
        are a very minor source of infection for the rest of the
        population. </li>
    <li>In the United States, drug use is illegal and the police
        hunt down drug users to throw them in prison. Four
        thousand people died from illegal drugs in the US last
        year and we now have more than 600,000 people in prison
        on drug charges. </li>
    <li>In Liverpool, England, the police do not arrest drug
        users any more. Instead, health care workers seek them
        out and encourage them to come in for counseling and
        medical treatment. Both counseling and medical treatment
        are provided on demand. The medical treatment often
        includes maintenance doses of narcotics under the
        management of a physician. </li>
</ul>

<p>Liverpool, England, has adopted the same approach as the
Netherlands and has had substantially the same results. They both
chose decriminalizatiion. </p>

<h2><a name="q12">12. Do the illegal drugs have any legitimate
uses?</a> </h2>

<p>Heroin is a powerful pain-killer and could be used to control
extreme chronic pain or the pain of severe diseases, such as
cancer. The medical literature shows that heroin is significantly
less hazardous than most of the drugs which are given in its
place. </p>

<p>Cocaine is used as a topical anesthetic in medicine. </p>

<p>There are about 50,000 products which can be made from the
marijuana (hemp) plant. It has been used since the dawn of
history for the widest variety of uses. These uses include
fibers, fuels, materials, and medicine. The first American laws
regarding marijuana were passed in the 1700's and required
farmers to grow hemp (marijuana) because of its tremendous
commercial value for dozens of uses. It was grown throughout the
United States as a commercial product well into the 1940's. It
was made illegal in 1937 largely as a result of pressure from oil
and chemical companies who feared the competition from marijuana.
Despite the laws, during World War II marijuana was considered so
vital to the national interest that the US Government exempted
farmers from military duty if they grew marijuana. Local 4-H
clubs were encouraged to have their members grow marijuana and
the US Government produced a film called &quot;Hemp for
Victory&quot;' </p>

<p>Marijuana produces fibers which are ideal for ropes, cloth,
paper, and dozens of other products. The fiber is unusually
strong, soft, absorbent and cheap to produce. If we grew
marijuana solely for paper production, we could completely
eliminate cutting forests for paper. Marijuana produces eighty
times as much usable fiber per acre as a comparable stand of
forest. </p>

<p>Marijuana can produce several different kinds of fuel. In the
1800's and 1900's hempseed oil was the primary source of fuel in
the United States and was commonly used for lamps and other oil
energy needs. The diesel engine was originally designed to run on
marijuana oil because Rudolf Diesel assumed that it would be the
most common fuel. Mairjuana is also the most efficient plant for
the production of methanol. It is estimated that, in one form or
another, marijuana grown in the United States could provide up to
ninety percent of the nation's entire energy needs. </p>

<p>Marijuana is useful for a wide variety of medical problems
and, according the the Drug Enforcement Administration's Chief
Administrative Law Judge, &quot;marijuana is probably the safest
therapeutically active substance known to man,&quot; and &quot;it
is safer than many of the foods we commonly eat.&quot; Marijuana
is often the most effective treatment for chronic pain, glaucoma,
nausea from chemotherapy, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and other
medical conditions. </p>

<p>Marijuana can also be used to restore the life of depleted
farmland. It grows quite readily under even extreme conditions
and actually replenishes and extends the life of the soil in
which it is grown. Depleted soil is now becoming a major problem
in some of our most productive agricultural farmlands, such as
the Central Valley of California. For much of this farmland,
marijuana could be the cheapest and most effective remedy. </p>

<h2><a name="q14">13. Does marijuana lead to harder drugs?</a> </h2>

<p>There is no evidence that smoking marijuana leads to the use
of harder drugs. In the first place, it is chemically illogical
that the consumption of any drug could give someone the craving
for another drug they have never had. </p>

<p>When the Marihuana Tax Act was first passed in 1937, Harry
Anslinger, then head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics testified
before Congress and was asked specifically if there was any
association between the use of marijuana and the use of harder
drugs. He replied specifically that there was no such connection
and that the users of the different types of drugs commonly did
not associate with each other. </p>

<p>This myth arose in the 1950's when it became apparent that the
old motives for the law against marijuana would no longer be
viable. It was then that Anslinger contradicted his earlier
testimony and started saying that marijuana led to harder drugs.
This change occurred most prominently in the hearings for the
Boggs Act of 1951, after a series of doctors had just destroyed
everything Harry Anslinger had said about marijuana in 1937. </p>

<p>For Harry Anslinger's testimony, see the hearings for the <a
href="../hemp/taxact/taxact.htm">Marihuana Tax Act</a>. </p>

&quot;gateway&quot; myth and how it arose at the hearings for the
Boggs Act see <a href="../history/whiteb1.htm">The History of the
Drug Laws</a>, a short speech by Professor Charles Whitebread, of
USC Law School. </p>

<h2>14. What should we do about drugs? </h2>

<p>The overwhelming weight of the scholarly evidence on drug
policy supports decriminalization. Every major study of drug
policy in history has recommended a non-criminal approach. This
is irrefutable. </p>

<p>I recommend that you start with: <a

Licit and Illicit Drugs</a>, published by the Editors of Consumer

<h2><a name="q15">15.</a> How dangerous is marijuana, really? </h2>

<p>Not very. The DEA's own Chief Administrative Law Judge, after
listening to the evidence for two years concluded that marijuana
in its natural form is safer than many of the foods we commonly
eat. More detailed information can be found in the following

<h2><a name="q16">16.</a> Would &quot;legalization&quot; cost
more than it saves? </h2>

<p><img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p>No. The best analysis done to date by any Federal official
shows that &quot;legalization&quot; of the now illegal drugs
would result in a net $37 Billion annual savings. This estimate
is considered conservative. That is, it is likely that the
savings would be more. </p>

Legalization of Drugs</a> </p>

<p>This Federal financial analysis of legalization comes from
Theodore R. Vallance, Former chief of the Planning Branch of the
National Institutes of Mental Health. His main professional
effort for many years was directed at just this sort of analysis.

<h3>Part II Continued</h3>

<h1>The Costs of Prohibition</h1>

<h2>Prohibition Threatens Public Health</h2>

<h3><a name="sd">Spread of Disease</a></h3>

<h4><a name="sn">Sharing Needles</a></h4>

<p><a name="sn">Because the possession of hypodermic needles is
generally illegal, users of injectable drugs routinely share
needles and syringes with one another, often in &quot;shooting
galleries&quot; where dozens of addicts may line up to use a
single needle rented out by the dealers and not sterilized
between uses. This sharing of needles has become a </a><a
href="footnotes4.htm#126">major source of transmission</a> of
blood-borne diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(&quot;AIDS&quot;) and hepatitis. According to a recent national
review, &quot;more than <a href="footnotes4.htm#127">33% of new
AIDS cases</a> occur among injecting drug users or people having
sexual contact with them.&quot; In New York State, the majority
of new AIDS cases since 1988 have been reported among users of
injectable drugs and their sexual partners. Both the Centers for
Disease Control and the New York State Department of Health have
estimated that more than <a href="footnotes4.htm#128">75% of
pediatric AIDS cases</a> are children whose mothers either
injected drugs or were the sexual partners of persons who
injected drugs. The data suggest, at the very least, that sterile
hypodermic needles should be readily and freely available to drug
users. So long as drug use remains unlawful, however, <a
href="footnotes4.htm#129">free needle distribution</a> is not
likely to attract a substantial portion of the user population.
In response, some <a href="footnotes4.htm#130">courts have
circumscribed laws</a> dealing with the unlawful possession of
hypodermic needles by applying defenses of medical necessity.</p>

<h4><a name="tsd">Trading Sex for Drugs</a></h4>

<p><a name="tsd">Because illicit drugs are expensive, many
addicts turn to </a><a href="footnotes4.htm#131">prostitution</a>
to make money to support their habits, or exchange sexual
services directly for drugs. Prostitute drug addicts often do not
protect themselves from contracting <a href="footnotes4.htm#132">sexually
transmitted diseases</a> carried by their customers, and they
pass such diseases on to other customers, their lovers, and their
children. The crack epidemic, in particular, has been blamed for
the recently noted resurgence of syphilis and other sexually
transmitted diseases. Dr. Robert Rolfs of the Centers for Disease
Control placed the blame squarely on cocaine and its high cost: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>People---especially women---have high-risk sex and
    practice prostitution to support their habits. And it is
    occurring in a relatively poor population where people have a
    lot of things that prevent their access to treatment.
    Therefore, they stay infected longer and are more likely to
    pass their infections on to others. <a
    href="footnotes4.htm#133">[133]</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fewer addicts would be forced to resort to prostitution if the
current prohibitions against drugs were lifted.</p>

<h4><a name="nh">Neglect of Health</a></h4>

<p><a name="nh">Because of addicts' preoccupation with obtaining
and using drugs, and the debilitating effects of some of the
drugs themselves, many addicts are in very poor health. </a><a
href="footnotes4.htm#134">Malnutrition</a> is a frequent problem
and, in turn, contributes to many others. Addicts' poor health
makes them especially susceptible to diseases ranging from scurvy
and shingles to tuberculosis and the flu. Addicts are also more
likely to contract communicable diseases and therefore more
likely to spread them. The interrelated urban problems of
homelessness and illegal drug abuse have contributed to the
development of <a href="footnotes4.htm#135">multi-drug-resistant
strains of diseases</a> such as tuberculosis, which was once
thought to be on the verge of eradication. These more virulent
diseases know few geographical limitations and pose risks to the
general population.</p>

<h4><a name="ahcs">Avoidance of the Health-Care System</a></h4>

<p><a name="ahcs">Individuals who use illegal drugs often put off
addressing their health problems for fear of prosecution or other
</a><a href="footnotes4.htm#136">adverse consequences</a> (<i>e.g.</i>,
rebuffs by doctors, loss of job). This reluctance to seek medical
care is compounded by the fact that many drug addicts have no
private physicians and rely instead on public hospitals or
clinics for any care they might get.</p>

<p>Prohibition, therefore, has perverse results on health; drug
abusers tend to enter the health-care system only if and when
their need for care is acute, which is also when care is most
costly to deliver. If, for example, a woman avoids pre-natal
care, she may give birth to a baby with low birth weight and
other medical difficulties. If a drug abuser puts off seeking
treatment for illnesses and injuries, he or she may end up in the
<a href="footnotes4.htm#137">emergency room</a> and the intensive
care ward.</p>

<p>Mothers and pregnant women face the additional and justifiable
fear that any detectable drug use may be reported as a possible
indication of child abuse or neglect. In many large city
hospitals, the urine of newborn babies is tested for prohibited
drugs, and mothers whose babies test positive for pre-natal
exposure are reported to the child abuse authorities. Until
recently, in New York City, such babies were routinely kept from
their mothers pending investigations that often lasted many
months, interfering with normal bonding and necessarily adversely
affecting the infant's development and relationship with the
parent. Moreover, these women have, in some jurisdictions, been <a
href="footnotes4.htm#138">prosecuted for pre-partum distribution</a>
of prohibited drugs.</p>

<p>In addition to the obvious costs to the individuals who become
infected with catastrophic illnesses directly through drug use,
and the high costs to the health care system of treating them,
prohibition contributes to the spread of such diseases throughout
society, particularly to the sexual partners and children of
infected drug users. Left untreated, users and addicts are more
likely to give birth to unhealthy children, to abuse or neglect
their children after they are born, or to have their <a
href="footnotes4.htm#139">children</a> placed in foster care.</p>

<h3><a name="liqc">Lack of Information and Quality Control</a></h3>

<h4><a name="addddup">Adulterated Drugs, Designer Drugs, and
Drugs of Unknown Potency</a></h4>

<p><a name="addddup">Because drugs are manufactured and
distributed in secret, it is impossible for users to guard
against adulteration or to determine the purity and potency of
the drugs they use. The problem is compounded by drug growers,
manufacturers, and distributors who, to minimize the risks of
apprehension, develop and purvey the drug varieties that pack the
most intoxicating effect into the smallest package. According to
an experienced New York City researcher, </a></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><a name="addddup">The fact that cocaine, heroin and
    related drugs are illegal encourages the use of injection.
    Severe statutory restrictions greatly increase the cost of
    illicit substances to nonmedical users. Injecting provides a
    way to economize. Injectable forms of opiates and coca are
    much more concentrated than traditional forms, such as opium
    or coca tea. Injection provides an intense and economical
    effect by maximizing the amount of drug that reaches the
    brain. People who sniff or smoke drugs say that if they
    inject they need only one third of the amount of the drug to
    maintain a habit. </a></p>
    <p><a name="addddup">Because the injection forms of illicit
    drugs are concentrated, they are [also] relatively easier to
    ship. </a><a href="footnotes4.htm#140">[140]</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has been demonstrated that, as law enforcement and criminal
penalties intensify, dealers also find other ways to economize by
inventing new drugs---so-called &quot;designer drugs&quot;---that
are not yet prohibited. This places the ill-informed consumers of
such drugs at greater risk of overdose and other health problems.
Illnesses and deaths have resulted from (1) the introduction of
dangerous substances into drugs that could otherwise have been
used with greater safety, (2) inadvertent overdoses due to
variations in potency, and (3) the development of &quot;designer
drugs&quot; intended to give the effect of familiar intoxicants
with new chemical compositions that put them <a
href="footnotes4.htm#141">beyond the reach of current laws</a>.
Just as the prohibition against alcohol led to sales of poisonous
wood alcohol and the prohibition against abortion led to
coat-hanger abortions, the prohibition against drug manufacture,
sale, and possession results in <a href="footnotes4.htm#142">unnecessary
deaths</a> due to adulteration, variable purity, and
&quot;designer drugs.&quot; This contrasts sharply with the
government's current regulation of alcoholic beverages, which
ensures that the beverages are pure and that buyers know how
strong they are and what some of their health effects may be.
Experts have noted that heightened efforts to enforce drug laws
and amend them to encompass new formulations or ban precursor
substances may only <a href="footnotes4.htm#143">push dealers to
take greater risks</a>, selling ever more potentially dangerous
substances.</p>

<h4><a name="lkasu">Lack of Knowledge About Safer Use</a></h4>

<p><a name="lkasu">Because many drugs are outlawed, individuals
considering drug use rarely have access to accurate information
about the effects of drugs. While a cautious user may err on the
side of avoiding certain activities while under the use of drugs,
he or she may have no way of knowing, beyond trial and error, the
possible adverse health consequences of certain combinations of
drugs and his or her individual tolerance for particular
substances. Because of its penchant for exaggeration and
cartoonish treatment of the issues, most current education about
drugs is not taken seriously by young people. As a result, it is
far less effective than other health education (e.g., about
nutrition, fitness, and smoking cigarettes).</a></p>

<h4><a name="uatisd">Using Alcohol and Tobacco Instead of
&quot;Soft Drugs&quot;</a></h4>

<p><a href="footnotes4.htm#144">Alcohol and tobacco</a> are
completely legal yet do much more harm, statistically speaking,
than illegal drug use. It is also generally recognized that
alcohol, at least when used to excess, can cause <a
href="footnotes4.htm#145">aggressive, anti-social behavior</a>.
The current prohibitionist laws against marijuana, generally
considered an &quot;a-motivational&quot; drug, and other
so-called &quot;soft drugs&quot; have the effect of influencing
some people to choose alcohol over these &quot;soft drugs.&quot;
Peter Reuter, an economist at the Rand Corporation, concludes
that &quot;If marijuana is a substitute for alcohol..., alcohol
is, by definition, a substitute for marijuana. Thus tough <a
href="footnotes4.htm#146">marijuana enforcement must increase
drinking</a>.&quot; Similarly, Frank Chaloupka, an economist at
the University of Illinois, found through statistical analysis
&quot;that states without criminal sanctions against marijuana
possession suffered <a href="footnotes4.htm#147">fewer auto
fatalities</a>.&quot; Finally, Karen Model, a Ph.D. candidate at
Harvard, found that &quot;states decriminalizing marijuana
reported <a href="footnotes4.htm#148">lower overall rates of
drug- and alcohol-related emergencies</a>.&quot; To the extent
that users are choosing alcohol rather than marijuana or other
&quot;soft drugs,&quot; the overall public health effects are
probably worse than they would be otherwise.</p>

<h3><a name="idv">Injuries Due to Violence</a></h3>

<p><a name="idv">The high prices commanded by prohibited drugs
create competition among groups and individuals willing to break
the law to supply drugs to consumers. Their competition often
becomes violent and has contributed to the build-up of arms and
the </a><a href="footnotes4.htm#149">pervasiveness of violence</a>
in many areas. Gunshot wounds and other traumas due to the
illegal drug business have become commonplace in big-city
hospital emergency rooms. Not only traffickers, but also law
enforcement officers and innocent bystanders are often the <a
href="footnotes4.htm#150">victims</a>. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
recently noted:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The victims of the [ ] gun battles [of street-level drug
    dealers] are innocent bystanders---and often young children.
    Last year alone, about 500 New York City children were shot;
    of these, 89 were innocent bystanders hit by crossfire. <a
    href="footnotes4.htm#151">[151]</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cost of prohibiting drugs must be measured in terms of
lost lives and expensive medical care and include the hidden
costs of lost productivity and the psychological damage to
individuals and entire communities living in fear, helpless and
hopeless.</p>

<p>With the possible exceptions of cocaine and PCP, <a
href="footnotes4.htm#152">drugs themselves do not generally cause
violent behavior</a>. It is, instead, turf wars for the control
of black markets and the drug users' need for money to purchase
such substances that leads to violence. Indeed, marijuana and
heroin have been shown to render their users disinclined to
violence or incapable of violence while under the influence.
These substances are <a href="footnotes4.htm#153">much less
dangerous</a> in this regard than alcohol.</p>

<h3><a name="drtp">Diversion of Resources from Treatment and
Prevention</a></h3>

<p><a href="footnotes4.htm#154">Prohibition diverts money</a>
that could otherwise be used for preventing and treating drug
abuse. Federal anti-drug legislation provides a single budget for
&quot;supply reduction&quot; and &quot;demand reduction&quot;
efforts. Law enforcement agencies have always received much more
than prevention, treatment, and research programs combined. The
ABA recently reported that &quot;[s]ince the early 1980s,
treatment has been a declining priority. In 1991, treatment
received 14% of the $10.5 billion federal drug budget compared to
25% ten years earlier.&quot; During the same period,
&quot;federal <a href="footnotes4.htm#155">spending on law
enforcement increased 737%</a>, with interdiction efforts leading
the increase.&quot; Ending drug prohibition would, by definition,
eliminate the need for any special law enforcement funds for drug
interdiction. It would also allow for the redirection of law
enforcement resources to concentrate on violent crime and quality
of life issues.</p>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY</h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We first became interested in the opium traffic during a visit
to the Far East in 1916. Like most Americans, we had vaguely
heard of this trade, and had still vaguer recollections of a war
between Great Britain and China, which took place about
seventy-five years ago, known as the Opium War. From time to time
we had heard of the opium trade as still flourishing in China,
and then later came reports and assurances that it was all over,
accompanied by newspaper pictures of bonfires of opium and opium
pipes. Except for these occasional and incidental memories, we
had neither knowledge of, nor interest in the subject. On our way
out to Japan, in the July of 1916, we met a young Hindu on the
boat, who was outspoken and indignant over the British policy of
establishing the opium trade in India, as one of the departments
of the Indian Government. Of all phases of British rule in India,
it was this policy which excited him most, and which caused him
most ardently to wish that India had some form of
self-government, some voice in the control and management of her
own affairs, so that the country could protect itself from this
evil. Without this, he declared, his country was powerless to put
a stop to this traffic imposed on it by a foreign government, and
he greatly deplored the slow, but steady demoralization of the
nation which was in consequence taking place. As he produced his
facts and figures, showing what this meant to his people-this
gradual undermining of their moral fiber and economic efficiency
we grew more and more interested. That such conditions existed
were to us unheard of, and unbelievable. It seemed incredible
that in this age, with the consensus of public opinion sternly
opposed to the sale and distribution of habit-forming drugs, and
with legislation to curb and restrict such practices incorporated
in the laws of all ethical and civilized governments, that here,
on the other side of the world, we should come upon opium traffic
conducted as a government monopoly. Not only that, but conducted
by one of the greatest and most highly civilized nations of the
world, a nation which we have always looked up to as being in the
very forefront of advanced, progressive and humane ideals. So
shocked were we by what this young Hindu told us, that we flatly
refused to believe him. We listened to what he had to say on the
subject, but thinking that however earnest he might be, however
sincere in his sense of outrage at such a policy, that he must of
necessity be mistaken. We decided not to take his word for it,
but to look into the matter for ourselves. </p>

<p>We did look into the matter. During a stay in the Far East of
nearly a year, in which time we visited Japan, China, Hong Kong,
French IndoChina, Siam and Singapore, we looked into the matter
in every country we visited. Wherever possible we obtained
government reports, and searched them carefully for those
passages giving' statistics concerning the opium trade-the amount
of opium consumed, the number of shops where it was sold, and the
number of divans where it was smoked. We found these shops
established under government auspices, the dealers obtaining
their supplies of opium from the government, and then obtaining
licenses from the government to retail it. In many countries, we
visited these shops and divans in person, and bought opium in
them freely, just as one goes to a shop to buy cigarettes. We
found a thorough and complete establishment of the opium traffic,
run by the government, as a monopoly. Revenue was derived through
the sale of opium, through excise taxes upon opium, and through
license fees paid by the keepers of opium shops and divans* -A
complete, systematic arrangement, by which the foreign government
profited at the expense of the subject peoples under its rule. In
European countries and in America, we find the governments making
every effort to repress the sale of habit-forming drugs. Here, in
the Far East, a contrary attitude prevails. The government makes
every effort to encourage and extend it. </p>

<p>Two notable exceptions presented themselves. </p>

<p>One was Japan. There are no opium shops in Japan, and the
Japanese Government is as careful to protect its people from the
evils and dangers of opium as any European country could be. It
must be remembered, however, that Japan is a free and independent
country. It has never been conquered by a European country, and
perhaps one explanation as to why the Japanese are a powerful,
virile people, is because Japan is the one Oriental nation that
has never been dominated by a European power, and in consequence,
never drugged. </p>

<p>The other exception is our own possession of the Philippines,
which although a subject country, has never had the opium traffic
established as part of the machinery of an alien government. </p>

<p>On our return to America, we were greatly exercised over these
facts which we had unearthed. We continued our researches as to
the opium traffic in the New York Public Library, and in the
Library of Congress, in Washington, in both of which places there
is a rich and abundant literature on the subject. We obtained
ready access to official blue books and government reports,
issued by the British Government, and it is from these sources
that the material in this book is largely drawn. We were somewhat
hampered in our investigations by the fact that because of the
war, these blue books have not always been of recent date, some
of them being two or three years old. For this reason, it has not
always been possible to give the most recent figures as to opium
consumption and distribution in the various countries. However,
we feel that we have obtained enough information to uphold our
case, and in any event, there is no doubt that the opium traffic,
as fostered by the British Government, still continues. In
looking over the list of British colonies where it is
established, we may find here and there a diminution in the
amount of opium consumed, but this is probably due to the
exigencies of war, to the lack of shipping and transportation,
rather than to any conscientious scruples or moral turnover;
because the revenue derived from the opium trade is precious. In
some instances, as in the case of the Straits Settlements, the
local British Government derives from forty to fifty percent of
its revenue from this source. Yet, taken in relation to the
whole, it is not large. However valuable it may be, however large
the percentage in the case of any particular colony, it can
surely never be large enough to compensate for the stigma
attached.- It is a blot upon the honor of a great nation to think
that she deliberately runs her colonies on opium: No revenue,
whether large or small, can be justified when coming from such a
source as this. </p>

<p>In all these blue books and official reports, the question of
the Opium Monopoly, as it is called, is dealt with freely. There
is no attempt to hide or suppress the facts. The subject is
reported frankly and fully. It is all there, for any one to read
who chooses. How then, does it happen that we in America know
nothing about Great Britain's Opium Monopoly? That the facts are
new to us and come to us as a shock? One is because of our
admiration for Great Britain. Those who know and there are a
few-hesitate to state them. Those who know, feel that it is a
policy unworthy of her. We hesitate to call attention to the
shortcomings of a friend. There are other reasons also for this
conspiracy of silence-fear of international complications, fear
of endangering the good feeling between the two countries,
England and America. Consequently England has been able to rely
upon those who know the facts to keep silent, either through
admiration or through fear. Also the complete ignorance of the
rest of us has been an additional safeguard. Therefore, for
nearly a century, she has been running her Opium Monopoly
undisturbed. It began as a private industry, about the time of
the East India Company, but later on passed out of the hands of
private individuals into the department of Opium Administration,
one of the branches of the colonial government&quot; But, loyal
as we have been all these years, we can remain silent no longer.
The time is now rapidly approaching when the two countries,
England and America, are to become closely united. How can we
become truly united, however, when on such a great moral question
as this we stand diametrically opposed? </p>

<p>There is still another reason why we should break silence. The
welfare of our own country is now at stake. The menace of opium
is now threatening America, and our first duty is to ourselves.
Little by little, surreptitiously, this drug has been creeping in
over our borders, and to-day many thousands of our young men and
young women are drug addicts, habituated to the use of one of the
opium derivatives, morphia or heroin. The recent campaign against
drug users, conducted by the New York Department of Health, has
uncovered these addicts in great numbers; has brought them before
us, made us see, in spite of ourselves, that thousands of them
exist and that new ones are being created daily. The question
arises, how do they obtain the drug? It was the fortune of the
writer to be present during the first week of the opening of the
Health Department Clinic for Drug Addicts, and her work consisted
in taking the histories of these pitiful, abject wrecks of men
and women who swarmed to the clinic in hundreds, seeking supplies
of the drug which they could not obtain elsewhere. The history of
these patients was almost invariably the same-there was a
monotony in their tragic, pathetic recital as to how they became
victims, how they first became acquainted with the drug. As a
rule, they began in extreme youth, generally between fifteen and
twenty years of age, one boy having begun at the age of thirteen.
In nearly every case they had tried it as a lark, as an
experiment. At &quot;parties,' they said, when some one of the
company would pass round a box full of heroin, inviting them to
snuff it. To snuff it, these children, very much as a small boy
goes behind the barn to try his first cigarette. In many
instances those who produced the box were peddlers, offering it
as a gift at first, knowing that after a dose or two the fatal
habit would be formed and another customer created. These
peddlers doubtless obtained their supplies from smugglers. But
that takes us back to our argument, namely, the part played by
that great nation which grows and distributes opium to the world.
For that nation produces an oversupply of opium, far more than is
needed by the medical profession for the relief of pain. Opium is
not profitable in its legitimate use. It is only profitable
because of the demands of addicts, men and women deliberately
debauched, either through the legalized machinery of colonial
governments, or through the illegal activities of smugglers. A
moral sentiment that will balk at this immense over-production,
the sole object of which is to create drug victims, is the only
weapon to fight it. In giving this book to the public, we are
calling upon that moral sentiment. We feel that we shall number
among our staunchest supporters that great body of men and women
in England who have for years been vainly fighting the opium
traffic. No more bitter opponents of this policy are to be found
than amongst the English people themselves. From time to time, in
Parliament, sharp debates have arisen as to the advisability of
continuing it, and some of the greatest men in England have been
steadfastly opposed. The great Gladstone has described it as
&quot;morally indefensible.&quot; The time has now come for us,
people of both countries, to unite to stop it.<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>I - GREAT BRITAIN'S OPIUM MONOPOLY</h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"><br>
</p>

<p>In a book shop in Shanghai, we came upon a small book with an
arresting title, &quot;Drugging a Nation,&quot; by Samuel Merwin.
It was published in 1908, eight years before we chanced upon it,
shabby and shop worn, its pages still uncut. The people of
Shanghai, the great International Settlement of this largest city
and most important seaport of China, did not have to read it.
They knew, doubtless, all that its pages could disclose. We,
however, found it most enlightening. In it there is this
description of the British Opium Monopoly: </p>

<p>&quot;In speaking of it as a 'monopoly' I am not employing a
cant word for effect. I am not making a case. That is what it is
officially styled in a certain blue book on my table which bears
the title, 'Statement Exhibiting the Moral and Material Progress
of India during the year 1905-'6,' and which was ordered by the
House of Commons to be printed, May 10, 1907. . . . Now to get
down to cases, just what this Government Opium Monopoly is, and
just how Goes it work? An excerpt from the rather ponderous blue
book will tell us. It may be dry but it is official and
unassailable. It is also short. </p>

<p>&quot;'The opium revenue'-thus the blue book-'is partly raised
by a monopoly of the production of the drug in Bengal and the
United provinces, and partly by the levy of a duty on all opium
imported from native states. . . . In these two provinces, the
crop is grown under the control of a government department, which
arranges the total area which is to be placed under the crop,
with a view to the amount of opium required.' </p>

<p>&quot;So much for the broader outline. Now for a few of the
details: 'The cultivator of opium in these monopoly districts
receives a license, and is granted advances to enable him to
prepare the land for the crop, and he is required to deliver the
whole of the product at a fixed price to opium agents, by whom it
is dispatched to the government factories at Patna and Ghazipur.'
</p>

<p>&quot;The money advanced to the cultivator bears no interest.
The British Indian government lends money without interest in no
other cases. Producers of crops other than opium are obliged to
get along without free money. </p>

<p>&quot;When it has been manufactured, the opium must be
disposed of in one way and another; accordingly: 'The supply of
prepared opium required for consumption in India is made over to
the Excise Department . . . the chests of &quot; provision &quot;
opium, for export, are sold at monthly sales, which take place at
Calcutta.' For the meaning of the curious term, 'provision opium'
we have only to read on a little further. 'The opium is received
and prepared at the government factories, where the out-turn of
the year included 8,774 chests of opium for the Excise
Department, about three hundred pounds of various opium
alkaloids, thirty maunds of medical opium; and 51,770 chests of
provision opium for the Chinese market.' There are about <b>i4o </b>pounds
in a chest. . . . Last year the government had under poppy
cultivation 654,928 acres. And the revenue to the treasury,
including returns from auction sales, duties and license fees,
and deducting all 'opium expenditures' was nearly <font size="1">$22,000,000.
</font></p>

<p>As the blue book states, this opium is auctioned off once a
month. At that point, the British Government, as a government,
washes its hands of the business. Who buys the opium at these
government auctions, and what afterwards becomes of it? &quot;The
men who buy in the opium at these monthly auctions and afterwards
dispose of it are a curious crowd of Parsees, Mohammedans,
Hindoos and Asiatic Jews. Few British names appear in the opium
trade to-day. British dignity prefers not to stoop beneath the
taking in of profits; it leaves the details of a dirty business
to dirty hands. This is as it has been from the first. The
directors of the East India Company, years and years before that
splendid corporation relinquished the actual government of India,
forbade the selling of its specially-prepared opium direct to
China, and advised a trading station on the coast whence the drug
might find its way 'without the company being exposed to the
disgrace of being engaged in illicit commerce.&quot;' </p>

<p>&quot;So clean hands and dirty hands went into partnership.
They are in partnership still, save that the most nearly
Christian of governments has officially succeeded the company as
party of the first part.&quot; </p>

<p>You will say, if the British Government chooses to deal in
opium, that is not our concern. It is most emphatically our
concern. Once a month, at these great auction sales, the British
Government distributes thousands of pounds of opium, which are
thus turned loose upon the world, to bring destruction and ruin
to the human race. The buyers of this opium are not agents of the
British Government. They are merely the distributors, through
whom this drug is directed into the channels of trade.' The
British Government derives a certain portion of its revenue from
the sale of opium, therefore depends upon these dealers to find a
market for it. ' They are therefore, as distributors, the
unofficial agents of the British Government, through whom it is
sold legitimately, or smuggled around the world. In seeking to
eradicate the drug evil, we must face the facts, and recognize
clearly that the source of supply is the British Government,
through whose agents, official and unofficial, it is distributed.
</p>

<p>America, so they tell us, is now menaced by the drug evil. Now
that prohibition is coming into effect, we are told that we are
now confronted by a vice more terrible, far more deteriorating
and dangerous. If that is true, then we must recognize our danger
and guard against it. Some of the opium and morphia which reaches
this country is smuggled in; the rest is imported by the big
wholesale drug houses. There is an unlimited supply of it. As we
have seen, the British Government encourages poppy production,
even to the extent of lending money <i>without interest </i>to
all those who are willing to raise this most profitable crop. The
monopoly opium is sold once a month to the highest bidders, and
some of these highest bidders are unscrupulous men who must find
their markets how and where they can. That fact, of course, is of
no moment to the British Government. It is of deepest concern to
Americans, however. To the north of us we have the Dominion of
Canada. To the south, the No-Man's Land of Mexico. At the present
moment, the whole country is alarmed at the growing menace of the
drug habit, which is assuming threatening proportions.<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>II -- THE INDIAN OPIUM MONOPOLY </h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p><font size="1">LET </font>us quote from another dry official
record, of unimpeachable veracity-the Statesman's YearBook, for
1916. On page 140<b>, </b>under the heading of The British
Empire: India and Dependencies, we read: &quot;Opium. In British
territory the cultivation of the poppy for the production of
opium is mainly restricted to the United Provinces, and the
manufacture of the opium from this region is a State monopoly. A
limited amount is also grown in the Punjab for local consumption
and to produce poppy seeds. In the monopoly districts the
cultivator receives advances from Government to enable him to
prepare the land for the crop, and he is bound to sell the whole
of the produce at a fixed price to Government agents, by whom it
is despatched to the Government factory at Ghazipur to be
prepared for the market. The chests of manufactured opium are
sold by auction in Calcutta at monthly sales. A reserve is kept
in hand to supply the deficiencies of bad seasons, and a
considerable quantity is distributed by the Indian excise
departments. Opium is also grown in many of the Native States of
Rajaputana and Central India. These Native States have agreed to
conform to the British system. No <font size="1">6 </font>opium
may pass from them into British territory for consumption without
payment of duty. </p>

<p>&quot;The bulk of the exports of opium from India has been to
China. By arrangements with that country, the first one being in
I907, the exports from India have been limited, and provision
made for the cessation of the export to China when the native
Chinese production of opium shall be suppressed. The trade with
China is now practically suspended.&quot; </p>

<p>The important things to notice in the above statement are
these: The growing of poppies, the manufacture of opium, and the
monthly auction sales continue. Also, the opium trade with China
is practically at an end. The history of the opium traffic in
China is a story complete in itself and will be dealt with in
another chapter. At present, we must notice that the trade with
China is practically suspended, but that the British Government
is still auctioning off, once a month at Calcutta, great
quantities of opium. Where does this opium go--who are the
consumers? If not to China, then where? </p>

<p>The same reliable authority, the Statesman's Year-Book for
1918<b>, </b>has this to say on the subject. On page 130 we read:
&quot; Opium: In British territory the cultivation of the poppy
for the production of opium is practically confined to the United
Provinces, and the manufacture of opium from this region is a
State monopoly. The bulk of the exported opium is at<b> </b>present
either sent to the United Kingdom, or supplied direct to the
Governments of consuming countries in the Far East; a certain
quantity is also sold by auction in Calcutta at monthly sales.
Opium is also grown in many of the Native States of Rajputana and
Central India, which have agreed to conform to the British
system.&quot; The following tables, taken from most reliable
authority, give some idea of the exports to the &quot;consuming
countries of the Far East.&quot; Note that Japan began buying
opium in 1911-12<font size="1">2. </font>We shall have something
to say about the Japanese smuggling later. Also note that it was
in 1907<b> </b>that Great Britain and China entered into
agreement, the outcome to be the suppression of the opium trade
in China. But see the increasing imports into the treaty ports;
up till almost the very last moment British opium being poured
into China. In the second table, observe the increasing
importation into England, (United Kingdom), synchronous with the
increased exports to Japan, which will be discussed later.<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<p>III -- JAPAN AS AN OPIUM DISTRIBUTOR </p>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p><font size="1">IN </font>an article which appeared in the <i>New
York Times, </i>under date of February 14, 1919<b>, </b>we read:
&quot;A charge that the Japanese Government secretly fosters the
morphia traffic in China and other countries in the Far East is
made by a correspondent in the <i>North China Herald </i>in its
issue of December 21st<b> </b>last. The correspondent asserts
that the traffic has the financial support of the Bank of Japan,
and that the Japanese postal service in China aids, although
'Japan is a signatory to the agreement which forbids the import
into China of morphia or of any appliances used in its
manufacture or application.' </p>

<p>&quot;Morphia no longer can be purchased in Europe, the
correspondent writes. The seat of industry has been transferred
to Japan, and morphia is now manufactured by the Japanese
themselves. Literally, tens of millions of yen are transferred
annually from China to Japan for the payment of Japanese morphia.
. . . </p>

<p>&quot;In South China, morphia is sold by Chinese peddlers,
each of whom carries a passport certifying that he is a native of
Formosa, and therefore entitled to Japanese protection. Japanese
drug stores throughout China carry large stocks of morphia.
Japanese medicine vendors look to morphia for their largest
profits. Wherever Japanese are predominant, there the trade
flourishes. Through Dairen, morphia circulates throughout
Manchuria and the province adjoining; through Tsingtao, morphia
is distributed over Shantung province, Anhui, and Kiangsu, while
from Formosa morphia is carried with opium and other contraband
by motor-driven fishing boats to some point on the mainland, from
which it is distributed throughout the province of Fukien and the
north of Kuangtung. Everywhere it is sold by Japanese under
extra-territorial protection.&quot; </p>

<p>The article is rather long, and proves beyond doubt the
existence of a well-organized and tremendous smuggling business,
by means of which China is being deluged with morphia. In the
body of the article we find this paragraph: </p>

<p>&quot;While the morphia traffic is large, there is every
reason to believe that the opium traffic upon which Japan is
embarking with enthusiasm, is likely to prove even more
lucrative. In <i>the Calcutta opium sales, Japan has become one
of the considerable purchasers of Indian </i>opium. . . . <i>Sold
by the Government of India, this opium is exported under permits
applied for by the Japanese Government, </i>is shipped to Kobe,
and from Kobe is transshipped to Tsingtao. Large profits are made
in this trade, in which are interested some of the leading firms
of Japan.&quot; </p>

<p>This article appears to be largely anti-Japanese. In fact,
more anti-Japanese than anti-opium. Anti Japanese sentiment in
America is played upon by showing up the Japanese as smugglers of
opium. The part the British Government plays in this traffic is
not emphasized. &quot;In the Calcutta opium sales, Japan has
become one of the considerable purchasers of Indian opium . . .
sold by the Government of India.&quot; We are asked to condemn
the Japanese, who purchase their stocks of opium as individuals,
and who distribute it in the capacity of smugglers. We are not
asked to censure the British Government which produces,
manufactures and sells this opium as a State monopoly. We are
asked to denounce the Japanese and their nefarious smuggling and
shameful traffic, but the source of supply, which depends upon
these smugglers as customers at the monthly auctions, is above
reproach. A delicate ethical distinction. </p>

<p>However, there is no doubt that the Japanese are ardent
smugglers. In an article in the March, 1919<b>, </b>number of
&quot;Asia&quot; by Putnam Weale, we find the following bit: *
&quot;At all ports where Japanese commissioners of Maritime
Customs (in China) hold office, it is undeniable that centres of
contraband trade have been established, opium and its derivatives
being so openly smuggled that the annual net import of Japanese
morphia (although this trade is forbidden by International
Convention) is now said to be something like 20<b> </b>tons a
year-sufficient to poison a whole nation.&quot; </p>

<p><font size="1">* &quot; A Fair Chance for Asia,&quot; by
Putnam Weale, page 227.</font> </p>

<p>Mr. Weale is an Englishman, therefore more anti-Japanese than
anti-opium. We do not recall any of his writings in which he
protests against the opium trade as conducted by his Government,
nor the part his Government plays in fostering and encouraging
it. </p>

<p>However, there are other Englishmen who see the situation in a
more impartial light, and who are equally critical of both Great
Britain and Japan. In his book, Trade Politics and Christianity
in Africa and the East,&quot; by A. J. Macdonald, M. A., formerly
of Trinity College, Cambridge, we find the facts presented with
more balance. Thus, on page 229: &quot;. . . In the north of
China another evil is springing up. The eradication of the opium
habit is being followed by the development of the morphia
traffic. . . . The morphia habit in northern China, especially
Manchuria, is already widespread. The Chinese Government is alert
to the evil, but their efforts to repress it are hampered by the
action of traders, mainly Japanese, who elude the restrictions
imposed by the Chinese and Japanese Governments. . . . China is
being drenched with morphia. It is incredible that anything
approaching the amount could possibly be devoted to legitimate
purposes. It is said that in certain areas coolies are to be seen
covered all over with needle punctures.' An injection of the drug
can be obtained for three or four cents. In Newchang 2,000<b> </b>Victims
of the morphia habit died in the winter of 1914-15. Morphia
carries off its victims far more rapidly than opium. . . .
Morphia is not yet manufactured in any appreciable quantities in
the East, and certainly even Japan cannot yet manufacture the
hypodermic injectors by means of which the drug is received. The
bulk of the manufacture takes place in England, Germany and
Austria. . . . In this traffic, two firms in Edinburgh and one in
London are engaged. The trade is carried on through Japanese
agents. The Board of Trade returns show that the export of
morphia from Great Britain to the East has risen enormously
during the last few years. </p>

<p>1911 - 5.5 tons </p>

<p>1912 - 7.5 tons </p>

<p>1913 - 11.25 </p>

<p>1914 -- 14 </p>

<p>The freedom which allows three British firms to supply China
with morphia for illicit purposes is a condemnation of English
Christianity. </p>

<p>This book of Mr. Macdonald's was published in 1916<b>. </b>Mr.
Weale's article was published in 1919<b>, </b>in which he speaks
of an importation of about twenty tons of morphia. Apparently the
three British firms which manufacture morphia, two in Edinburgh
and one in London are still going strong. Japan, however, appears
to be growing impatient with all this opprobrium cast upon her as
the distributor of drugs, especially since much of the outcry
against this comes from America. Our own country seems to be
assisting in this traffic in a most extensive manner. The Japan
Society Bulletin No. 60 calls attention to this:<br>
</p>

<p>NEW TURN IN MORPHIA TRAFFIC </p>

<p>The morphia traffic in China has taken a new turn, according
to the <i>Japan Advertiser. </i>It quotes Putnam Weale to the
effect that whilst in recent years the main distributors have
been Japanese, the main manufacturers have been British. The
morphia has been exported in large quantities from Edinburgh to
Japan, but as the result of licensing the exports of this drug
from Great Britain, the shipments to Japan dropped from <font
size="1">6oo,229 </font>ounces in 1917 to one-fourth that amount
in 1918<b>. </b><i>The Japan Chronicle, </i>speaking from
&quot;absolutely authentic information,&quot; states that 113,000
ounces of morphia arrived in Kobe from the United States in the
first five months of 1919<b>. </b>These figures are not given as
the total shipments received in Kobe, but merely as the quantity
of which <i>The Chronicle </i>has actual knowledge. It states
further that this morphia is being transhipped in Kobe harbor to
vessels bound for China. Dr. Paul S. Reinsch, who has resigned
his post as Minister to China, has stated that he will use every
resource in his power to stop the shipment from America of
morphia intended for distribution in China, in defiance of the
international convention which prohibits the sale of the drug in
that country. </p>

<p>If sufficient publicity is cast upon the distributors,
Japanese, English and American, public sentiment may in time take
cognizance of the source of all this mischief, namely, the
producer.<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>IV -- SINGAPORE</h2>

<hr>

<p>In January, 1917, we found ourselves at Singapore, a British
dependency, situated at the end of the Malay Peninsula, and one
of the greatest seaports of the Orient. We were stopping at the
Hotel de l' Europe, a large and first class hotel. The first
morning at breakfast, the waiter stood beside us, waiting for our
order. He was a handsome young Malay, dressed in white linen
clothes, and wearing a green jade bracelet on one wrist. We gave
him our order and he did not move off. He continued to stand
quietly beside our chairs, as in a trance. We repeated the
order-one tea, one coffee, two papayas. He continued to stand
still beside us, stupidly. Finally he went away. We waited for a
long time and nothing happened. At last, after a long wait, he
returned and set before us a teapot filled with hot water.
Nothing else. We repeated again-tea, coffee, papayas. We said it
two or three times. Then he went away and came back with some
tea. We repeated again, coffee and fruit. Eventually he brought
us some coffee. Finally, after many endeavors, we got the fruit.
It all took a long time. We then began to realize that something
was the matter with him. He could understand English well enough
to know what orders we were giving him, but he seemed to forget
as soon as he left our sight. We then realized that he was
probably drugged. It was the same thing every day. In the morning
he was stupid and dull, and could not remember what we told him.
By evening his brain was clearer, and at dinner he could remember
well enough. The effects of whatever he had been taking had
apparently worn off during the day. </p>

<p>We learned that the opium trade was freely indulged in, at
Singapore, fostered by the Government. Singapore is a large city
of about 300,000 inhabitants, a great number of which are
Chinese. It has wide, beautiful streets, fine government
buildings, magnificent quays and docks-a splendid European city
at the outposts of the Orient. We found that a large part of its
revenue is derived from the opium traffic-from the sale of opium,
and from license fees derived from shops where opium may be
purchased, or from divans where it may be smoked. The customers
are mainly Chinese. </p>

<p>I wanted to visit these Government-licensed opium shops and
opium dens. A friend lent me two servants, as guides. We three
got into rickshaws and went down to the Chinese quarter, where
there are several hundred of these places, all doing a
flourishing business. It was early in the afternoon, but even
then, trade was brisk. The divans were rooms with wide wooden
benches running round the sides, on which benches, in pairs,
sharing a lamp between them, lay the smokers. They purchased
their opium on entering, and then lay down to smoke it. The
packages are little, triangular packets, each containing enough
for about six smokes. Each packet bears a label, red letters on a
white ground, &quot;Monopoly opium.&quot; </p>

<p>In one den there was an old man-but you can't tell whether a
drug addict is old or not, he looked as they all do, gray and
emaciated-but as he caught my eye, he laid down the needle on
which he was about to cook his pill, and glanced away. I stood
before him, waiting for him to continue the process, but he did
not move. </p>

<p>&quot;Why doesn't he go on?&quot; I asked my guide. &quot;He
is ashamed to have you see him,&quot; came the reply. </p>

<p>&quot;But why should he be ashamed?&quot; I asked, &quot;The
British Government is not ashamed to sell to him, to encourage
him to drug himself, to ruin himself. Why should he be
ashamed?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Nevertheless, he is,&quot; replied the guide. &quot;You
see what he looks like-what he has become. He is not quite so far
gone as the others-he is a more recent victim. He still feels
that he has become degraded. Most of them do not feel that way
after a while.&quot; </p>

<p>So we went on and on, down the long street. There was a
dreadful monotony about it all. </p>

<p>House after house of feeble, emaciated, ill wrecks, all
smoking Monopoly Opium, all contributing, by their shame and
degradation, to the revenues of the mighty British Empire. </p>

<p>That evening after dinner, I sat on the wide verandah of the
hotel, looking over a copy of the &quot;Straits Times.&quot; One
paragraph, a dispatch from London, caught my eye. &quot; Chinese
in Liverpool. Reuter's Telegram. London, January 17, 1917
Thirty-one Chinese were arrested during police raids last night
on opium dens in Liverpool. Much opium was seized. The police in
one place were attacked by a big retriever and by a number of
Chinese, who threw boots and other articles from the
house-top.&quot; </p>

<p>Coming fresh from a tour of the opium-dens of Singapore, I
must say that item caused some mental confusion. It must also be
confusing to the Chinese. It must be very perplexing to a Chinese
sailor, who arrives in Liverpool on a ship from Singapore, to
find such a variation in customs. To come from a part of the
British Empire where opium smoking is freely encouraged, to Great
Britain itself where such practices are not tolerated. He must
ask himself, why it is that the white race is so sedulously
protected from such vices, while the subject races are so eagerly
encouraged. It may occur to him that the white race is valuable
and must be preserved, and that subject races are not worth
protecting. This double standard of international justice he must
find disturbing. It would seem, at first glance, as if subject
races were fair game-if there is money in it. Subject races,
dependents, who have no vote, no share in the government and who
are powerless to protect themselves-fair game for exploitation. </p>

<p>Is this double-dealing what we mean when we speak of &quot;our
responsibility to backward nations, 1) or of &quot;the sacred
trust of civilization&quot; or still again when we refer to
&quot;the White Man's burden &quot; ? </p>

<p>Pondering over these things as I sat on the hotel verandah, I
finally reached the conclusion that to print such a dispatch as
that in the &quot; Straits Times&quot; was, to say the least,
most tactless. </p>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>V -- THE STRAITS SETTLEMENTS OPIUM COMMISSION<br>
</h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>FROM time to time, certain people in England apparently have
qualms as to Great Britain's opium traffic, and from time to time
questions are raised as to whether or not such traffic is morally
defensible. In February, 1909, apparently in answer to such
scruples and questionings on the part of a few, a very
interesting report was published, &quot;Proceedings of the
Commission appointed to Enquire into Matters Relating to the Use
of Opium in the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay
States. Presented to both Houses of Parliament by Command of His
Majesty.&quot; This document may be found in the New York Public
Library and is well worth careful perusal. </p>

<p>This Commission consisted of about a dozen men, some English,
some natives of the Straits Settlements. They apparently made an
intensive and exhaustive study of the subject, carefully
examining it from every angle. Countless witnesses appeared
before them, giving testimony as to the effects of opium upon the
individual. This testimony is interesting, in that it is of a
contradictory nature, some witnesses saying that moderate opium
indulgence is nothing worse than indulgence in alcoholic
beverages, and like alcohol, only pernicious if taken to excess.
Other witnesses seemed to think that it was most harmful. The
Commission made careful reports as to the manner of licensing
houses for smoking, the system of licensing opium farms, etc.,
and other technical details connected with this extensive
Government traffic. Finally, the question of revenue was
considered, and while the harmfulness of opium smoking was a
matter of divided opinion, when it came to revenue there was no
division of opinion at all. As a means of raising revenue, the
traffic was certainly justifiable. It was proven that about fifty
per cent of the revenues of the Straits Settlements and the
Federated Malay States came from the opium trade, and, as was
naively pointed out, to hazard the prosperity of the Colony by
lopping off half its revenues, was an unthinkable proceeding. </p>

<p>The figures given are as follows. </p>

<p>1898. Revenue derived from 0pium....45.9 percent </p>

<p>1899 44.8 </p>

<p>1900 43.3 </p>

<p>1901 53.2 </p>

<p>1902 48.3 </p>

<p>1903 47.1 </p>

<p>1904 59.1 </p>

<p>1905 46. </p>

<p>1906 53.3 </p>

<p>There was one dissenting voice as to the conclusions reached
by this Opium Commission, that of a Bishop who presented a
minority report. But what are moral scruples against cold facts
that there's money in the opium trade? </p>

<p>This Commission made its report in 1909. But the opium
business is apparently still flourishing in the Straits
Settlements. Thus we read in the official Blue Book for 1917,
&quot;Colony of the Straits Settlements &quot; that of the total
revenue for the year, $18,672,104, that $9,182,000 came from
opium. What per cent is that?<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>VI --OPIUM IN SIAM</h2>

<hr>

<p>BANGKOK, Siam, January, 1917- Siam, an independent kingdom. As
a matter of fact, &quot;protected&quot; very sternly and
thoroughly by Great Britain and France, so that its
&quot;independence&quot; would about cover an oyster cracker.
However, it is doubtless protected &quot;benevolently&quot; for
what protectorate is anything but benevolent? The more rigorous
the protectorate, the more benevolent its character. The Peace
Conference seems to have given us a new word in
&quot;mandatory.&quot; We do not know as yet what adjective will
be found to qualify mandatory, but it will doubtless be fitting
and indicative of idealism-of sorts. Therefore, all will be well.
Our suspicions will be lulled. It is high time that a substitute
was found for &quot;benevolent protectorate.&quot; </p>

<p>The particular form of benevolence noted in Siam was the total
inability of the Siamese to exclude British opium. They are
allowed, by the benevolent powers, to impose an import duty on
all commodities imported except opium. That is free. The treaty
between Siam and Great Britain in 1856 says so. We rather fancy
that Great Britain had more to say about this in 1856 than Siam
but maybe not. Anyway poor old Siam, an independent kingdom, is
bound to receive as much opium as may be imported, and is quite
powerless, by the terms of this treaty, to enact laws to exclude
it. In the last year or two, the Government of Siam has been
obliged to put the opium traffic under government control, in
order to minimize the worst evils in connection with it, although
to restrict and regulate an evil is a poor substitute for the
ability to abolish it. </p>

<p>All this, you will see, is rather tough on the Siamese, but
good business for the British Empire. </p>

<p>However, opium is not bad for one. There are plenty of people
to testify to that. We Americans have a curious notion to the
contrary, but then, we Americans are so hysterical and gullible.
An Englishman whom we met in Bangkok told me that opium was not
only harmless, but actually beneficial. He said once that he was
traveling through the jungle, into the interior somewhere. He had
quite a train of coolies with him, carrying himself and his
baggage through the dense forests. By nightfall, he found his
coolies terribly exhausted with the long march. But he was in a
hurry to press on, so, as he expressed it, he gave each of them a
&quot;shot&quot; of morphia, whereupon all traces of fatigue
vanished. They forgot the pain of their weary arms and legs and
were thus enabled to walk all night. He said that morphia
certainly knocked a lot of work out of men-you might say, doubled
their capacity for endurance. </p>

<p>The night we left Bangkok, we got aboard the boat at about
nine in the evening. The hatch was open, and we looked into the
hold upon a crowd of coolies who had been loading sacks of rice
aboard the ship. There they lay upon the rice sacks, two or three
dozen of them, all smoking opium. Two coolies to a lamp. I rather
wondered that a lamp did not upset and set the boat on fire, but
they are made of heavy glass, with wide bottoms, so that the
chances of overturning them are slight. So we leaned over the
open hatch, looking down at these little fellows, resting and
recuperating themselves after their work, refreshing themselves
for the labor of the morrow. </p>

<p>Opium is wonderful, come to think of it. But why, since it is
so beneficial and so profitable, confine it to the downtrodden
races of the world? Why limit it to the despised races, who have
not sense enough to govern themselves anyway? </p>

<p>The following figures are taken from the Statistical Year
Books for the Kingdom of Siam: </p>

<p>Foreign trade and navigation of the port of Bangkok, imports
of opium: </p>

<p>1911-12 1,270 chests of opium </p>

<p>1912-13 1,775 </p>

<p>1913-14 1,186 </p>

<p>1 914-15 2,000 Imported from India and Singapore. </p>

<p>1915-16 2,000 </p>

<p>1916-17 1,100 </p>

<p>1917-18 1,850 </p>

<p>Also, from the same source, we find the number of retail opium
shops: </p>

<p>1912-13 2,985 </p>

<p>1913-14 3,075 </p>

<p>1914-15 3,132 </p>

<p>1915-16 3,104 </p>

<p>1916-17 3,111<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>VII -- HONGKONG</h2>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Crown Colony of Hongkong was ceded by China to Great
Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the treaty
of Nanking in August, 1842; and the charter bears date April 5,
1843. Hongkong is the great center for British commerce with
China and Japan, and a military and naval station of first-class
importance.&quot; </p>

<p>Thus the Statesman's Year Book. This authority, however, omits
to mention just exactly how this important piece of Chinese
territory came to be ceded to Great Britain. It was the reward
that Great Britain took unto herself as an &quot;indemnity&quot;
following the successful prosecution of what is sometimes spoken
of as the first opium war-a war of protest on the part of China
against Great Britain's insistence on her right to deluge China
with opium. China's resistance was in vain-her efforts to stem
the tide of opium were fruitless-the might, majesty, dominion and
power of the British Empire triumphed, and China was beaten. The
island on which Hongkong is situated was at that time a blank
piece of land; but strategically well placed-ninety miles south
of the great Chinese city of Canton, the market for British
opium. </p>

<p>The opposite peninsula of Kowloon, on the mainland, was ceded
to Great Britain by treaty in 1861, and now forms part of
Hongkong. By a convention signed at Peking in June, 1898, there
was also leased to Great Britain for 99 years a portion of
Chinese territory mainly agricultural, together with the waters
of Mirs Bay and Deep Bay, and the island of Lan-tao. Its area is
356 square miles, with about 81,000 inhabitants, exclusively
Chinese. Area of Old Kowloon is 3 square miles. Total area of
colony, 391 square miles. </p>

<p>The population of Hongkong, excluding the Military and Naval
establishments, and that portion of the new territory outside New
Kowloon, was according to the 1911 census, 366,145 inhabitants.
Of this number the Chinese numbered 354,187. </p>

<p>This colony is, of course, governed by Great Britain, and is
not subject to Chinese control. Here is situated a Government
opium factory, and the imports of Indian opium into Hongkong for
the past several years are as follows: </p>

<p>1903-4 3,576,431 pounds sterling </p>

<p>1904-5 4,036,436 </p>

<p>1905-6 3,775,82.6 </p>

<p>1906-7 3,771,409 </p>

<p>1907-8 3,145,403 </p>

<p>1908-9 2,230,755 </p>

<p>1909-10 3,377,222 </p>

<p>1910-11 3,963,264 pounds sterling </p>

<p>1911-12 3,018,858 </p>

<p>1912-13 2,406,084 </p>

<p>1913-14 1,084,093 </p>

<p>1914--15 110,712 </p>

<p>These figures are taken from &quot;Statistical Abstract
Relating to British India, 1905-6 to 1915,&quot; and &quot;
Statistical Abstract Relating to British India, 1903-4 to
1912-13.&quot; The falling off in imports of opium noticed in
1914-15 may be due to the war, lack of shipping, etc., or to the
fact that the China market was due to close on April 1, 1917. The
closing of the China market 400,000,000 of people destined no
longer to have opium supplied to them (except illegally, by
smuggling, etc.) is naturally a big blow to the British opium
interests. That is where the menace to the rest of the world
comes in. Opium has been proved such a profitable commodity, that
if one market is shut off, others must be found as substitutes.
The idea of closing the trade altogether naturally does not
appeal to those who profit by it. Therefore, what we should hail
at first sight as a welcome indication of a changed moral
sentiment, is in reality but the pause which proceeds the casting
about for new markets, for finding new peoples to drug. </p>

<p>The Colonial Report No. 972, Hongkong Report for 1917, gives
the imports and exports of opium: Page 7- </p>

<p>&quot;The imports and exports of certified opium during the
year as follows: </p>

<p>Imports......... 7 chests </p>

<p>Export.......... 224 chests </p>

<p>Of these, however, the imports all come from Shanghai, and of
the total export Of 224 chests, 186 went to Shanghai.&quot; </p>

<p>Opium received from other sources than Shanghai makes a better
showing. &quot; Seven hundred and forty chests of Persian opium
imported during the year, and seven hundred and forty-five
exported to Formosa. Nine hundred and ten chests of uncertified
Indian opium were imported: Four hundred and ten chests by the
Government Monopoly, and the remaining five hundred for the Macao
opium farmer.&quot; </p>

<p>Macao is a small island off the coast of China, near Canton-a
Portuguese settlement, owned by Portugal for several centuries,
where the opium trade is in full blast. But somehow, one does not
expect so much of Portugal. The most significant feature of the
above paragraph, however, lies in the reference to the
importation of Persian opium. &quot; Seven hundred and forty
chests of Persian opium imported.&quot; Query, who owns Persia? </p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of this poor showing, in spite of the
decrease in opium importation as compared with the balmy days,
all is not lost. The Crown Colony of Hongkong still continues to
do an active trade. In the Colonial Office List for 1917, on page
218, we read: &quot;Hongkong. Revenue: About one-third of the
revenue is derived from the Opium Monopoly.&quot;<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>VIII -- SARAWAK<br>
</h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>NEAR British North Borneo. Area, 42,000 square miles, many
rivers navigable. The government of part of the present territory
was obtained in 1842 by Sir James Brooke from the Sultan of
Brunei. Various accessions were made between 1861, 1885, and
188o. The Rajah, H. H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G. C.M.G.,
nephew to the late Rajah, born June 3, 1829, succeeded in 1868.
Population estimated at 500,000, Malays, Dyaks, Kayans, Kenyahs,
and Muruts, with Chinese and other settlers. </p>

<p>Thus the Statesman's Year Book, to which we would add a
paragraph from an article in the National Geographic Magazine for
February, 1919. Under the title: &quot;Sarawak: The Land of the
White Rajahs&quot; we read: &quot;With the recent death of Sir
Charles Brooke, G. C. M. G., the second of the white rajahs of
Sarawak, there came to an end one of the most useful and unusual
careers among the many that have done credit to British rule in
the Far East. For nearly 49 years he governed, as absolute
sovereign, a mixed population of Chinese, Malays, and numerous
pagan tribes scattered through the villages and dense jungles of
an extensive territory on the northwest coast of Borneo. </p>

<p>&quot; Constant solicitude for the welfare of his people won
the sympathy and devotion which enabled this white man, supported
by an insignificant army and police, to establish the peaceful
occupations of civilization in place of barbarous tyranny and
oppression.&quot; </p>

<p>How thoroughly this &quot;civilizing&quot; process was
accomplished may be judged somewhat by turning to the Colonial
Office List for 19I7, where on page 436 we read: &quot;Sarawak:
The principal sources of revenue are the opium, gambling, pawn
shops, and arrack, producing: </p>

<p>1908 $483,019 </p>

<p>1909 460,416 </p>

<p>1910 385,070 </p>

<p>1911 420,151 </p>

<p>1912 426,867 </p>

<p>1913 492,455 </p>

<p>In the Statesman's Year Book for 1916 we find the total
revenue for this well-governed little colony as follows, given
however in pounds sterling, instead of dollars, as in the above
table. Thus: </p>

<p>Revenue-1910 221,284 pounds sterling </p>

<p>1911I 159,456 </p>

<p>1912 175,967 </p>

<p>1913 210,342 </p>

<p>1914 208,823 </p>

<p>It would seem as if forty-nine years of constant solicitude
for the welfare of a people, establishing the peaceful
occupations of civilization, might have resulted in something
better than a revenue derived from opium, gambling, pawn shops
and arrack. </p>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>IX -- SHANGHAI<br>
</h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"><br>
</p>

<p>IN the New York Library there is an interesting little book,
about a quarter of an inch thick, and easy reading. It is
entitled: &quot;Municipal Ethics: Some Facts and Figures from the
Municipal Gazette, 1907-1914. An Examination of the Opium License
policy of the Shanghai Municipality. In an Open Letter to the
Chairman of the Council, by Arnold Foster, Wuchang. For 42 years
Missionary to the Chinese.&quot; </p>

<p>Shanghai, being a Treaty Port, is of two parts. The native or
Shanghai city, under the control and administration of the
Chinese. And the foreign concessions, that part of the city under
the control and administration of foreigners. This is generally
known as the International Settlement (also called the model
settlement), and the Shanghai Municipal Council is the
administrative body. Over this part the Chinese have no control.
In 1907, when China began her latest fight against the opium
evil, she enacted and enforced drastic laws prohibiting opium
smoking and opium selling on Chinese soil, but was powerless to
enforce these laws on &quot;foreign&quot; soil. In the foreign
concessions, the Chinese were able to buy as much opium as they
pleased, merely by stepping over an imaginary line, into a
portion of the town where the rigid anti-opium laws of China did
not apply. </p>

<p>Says Mr. Arnold, in his Open Letter: &quot;It will be seen
that the title of the pamphlet, Municipal Ethics, describes a
situation which is a complex one. It concerns first the actual
attitude of the Shanghai Municipal Council towards the Chinese
national movement for the suppression of the use of opium. This,
we are assured by successive Chairmen of the Council, has been
one of &quot;sincere sympathy...... the greatest sympathy,&quot;
and more to the same effect. Certainly no one would have guessed
this from the facts and figures reproduced in this pamphlet from
the columns of the &quot; Municipal Gazette.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The second element in the ethical situation is the
actual attitude of the Council not only towards the Chinese
national movement, but also towards its own official assurances,
protestations and promises. </p>

<p>&quot;It is on this second branch of the subject before us
that I specially desire to focus attention, and for the facts
here stated that I would bespeak the most searching examination.
The protestations of the Council as to its own virtuous attitude
in regard to opium reform in China are made the more emphatic,
and also the more open to criticism, by being coupled with some
very severe insinuations made at the time, as to the insincerity
and unreliability of the Chinese authorities in what they were
professing, and in what they were planning to do in the same
matter of opium reform. It so happens, as the event proves, that
these sneers and insinuations were not only quite uncalled for,
but were absolutely and utterly unjust. When a comparison is
instituted between (a) 'official pronouncements' made two years
ago by the Chinese authorities as to what they then intended to
do for the suppression of the opium habit, and (b) the 'actual
administrative results' that in the meanwhile have been
accomplished, the Chinese have no cause to be ashamed of the
verdict of impartial judges. What they have done may not always
have been wise, it may sometimes have been very stern, but the
outcome has been to awaken the astonishment and admiration of the
whole civilized world! When, on the other hand, a comparison is
instituted between (a) the fine professions and assurances of the
Shanghai Municipal Council made six or seven years ago as to its
own attitude towards the 'eradication of the opium evil' and (b)
the 'actual administrative results' of the Council's own
proceedings, the feelings awakened are of very different order.
Here, not to mention any other consideration, two hard facts
stare one in the face: First, in October, 1907, there were
eighty-seven licensed opium shops in the International
Settlement. In May, 1914, there were six hundred and sixty-three.
In 1907 the average monthly revenue from opium licenses, dens and
shops combined, was Taels 5,450- In May, 1914, the revenue from
licenses and opium shops alone was Taels 10,995. The Council will
not dispute these figures.&quot; </p>

<p>At the beginning of the anti-opium campaign in 1907, there
were 700 dens (for smoking) in the Native City, and 1600 in the
International Settlement. The Chinese closed their dens and shops
at once. In the Settlement, the dens were not all closed until
two years later, and the number of shops in the Settlement
increased by leaps and bounds. Table I shows an outline of the
Municipal opium-shop profits concurrent with the closing of the
opium houses-and subsequently: </p>

<p>Year Month Dens Shops Monthly revenue, shops only </p>

<p>1908 Jan. 1436 87 Taels, 338 </p>

<p>Oct. 1005 131 623 </p>

<p>1909 Jan. 599 166 1,887 </p>

<p>Mr. Arnold quotes part of a speech made by the Chairman of the
Municipal Council, in March, 1908. The Chairman says in part:
&quot;The advice which we have received from the British
Government is, in brief, that we should do more than keep pace
with the native authorities, we should be in advance of them, and
where possible, encourage them to follow us.&quot; It must have
been most disheartening to the native authorities, suppressing
the opium traffic with the utmost rigor, to see their efforts
defied and nullified by the increased opportunities for obtaining
opium in that part of Shanghai over which the Chinese have no
control. A letter from a Chinese to a London paper, gives the
Chinese point of view: &quot;China . . . is obliged to submit to
the ruthless and heartless manner in which British merchants,
under the protection of the Shanghai 'Model Settlement' are
exploiting her to the fullest extent of their ability.&quot; </p>

<p>There is lots of money in opium, however. The following tables
compiled by Mr. Arnold show the comparison between the amount
derived from opium licenses as compared with the amount derived
from other sorts of licenses. </p>

<p>1913. Wheelbarrows Taels, 38,670 </p>

<p>Carts 22,944 </p>

<p>Steam launches.... . 2,221 </p>

<p>Total, 86,480 </p>

<p>Opium shops 86,386 Opium, 86,3 86 </p>

<p>Another table shows the licensed institutions in Shanghai
representing normal social life (chiefly of the Chinese) as
compared with revenue from opium shops: </p>

<p>1913. Tavern Taels, 16,573 </p>

<p>Total.. 85,983 </p>

<p>Opium shops 86,386 </p>

<p>Treaty Ports are those cities in China, in which the foreign
powers have extra-territorial holdings, not subject to Chinese
jurisdiction. Shanghai is one of them, the largest and most
important. The Statistical Abstract Relating to British India for
I903-4 to I912-I3 shows the exports of British opium into these
Treaty Ports. </p>

<p>1903-4 1,610,296 pounds sterling </p>

<p>1911-12 3,64,887 </p>

<p>1912-13 3,242,902 </p>

<p>It was in 1907 that China began her great fight against the
opium evil, and enacted stringent laws for its prohibition on
Chinese soil. On page 15 of his little book, Mr. Arnold quotes
from Commissioner Carl, of Canton: &quot;The 1912 figure (for the
importation of foreign opium) is the largest on record since
1895. The great influx of Chinese into the foreign concessions,
where the antiopium smoking regulations cannot be enforced by the
Chinese authorities, and where smoking can be indulged in without
fear of punishment, no doubt accounts for the unusual increase
under foreign opium.&quot; <br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>X -- INDIA </h2>

<hr>

<p>INDIA is the source and fount of the British opium trade, and
it is from Indian opium that the drug is chiefly supplied to the
world. As we have said before, it is a government monopoly.
Cultivators, who wish to plant poppies, may borrow money from the
Government free of interest, the sole condition being that the
crop be sold back to the Government again. It is manufactured
into opium at the Government factory at Ghazipur, and once a
month, the Government holds auctions at Calcutta, by means of
which the drug finds its way into the trade channels of the
world-illicit and otherwise.* </p>

<p>*This description of the Opium Department is to be found in
Statistics of British India, Financial Statistics, Vol. 11, 8th
Issue, page 159: </p>

<p>OPIUM. The region in which the poppy was cultivated in 1916-17
for the manufacture of &quot;Bengal opium&quot; comprises 32
districts of the United Provinces of Agra and Ouhd. The whole
Department has, with effect from the 29th September, 1910, been
under the control of one Opium Agent, with headquarters at
Ghazipur. At Ghazipur there is a Government factory where the
crude opium is manufactured into the form in which it passes into
consumption. The cultivation of the poppy and the manufacture of
opium are regulated by Act XIII of 1857, as amended by Act I of
1911, and are under the general control of the Lieutenant
Governor and the Board of Revenue of the United Provinces, and
the immediate supervision of the Opium Agent at Ghazipur. The
possession, transport, import and export of opium are regulated
by rules framed under the Indian Opium Act. Cultivation is
permitted only under licenses granted under the authority of the
Opium Agent. The area to be cultivated is fixed by the license,
and the cultivator is bound to sell the whole of his production
to the Opium Department at the rate fixed by Government..........
Advances, on which no interest is charged, are given to licensed
cultivators at the time of executing the agreement and from time
to time (though ordinarily no more than two advances are given)
until final delivery. In March, April and May the opium is made
over to the officers of the Department, and weighed and tested,
and as soon as possible afterwards each cultivator's accounts are
adjusted, and the balance due is paid him. After weighment the
opium is forwarded to the Government factory at Ghazipur, where
it is manufactured in 3 forms-(a) opium intended for export to
foreign countries, departmentally known as &quot;provision
opium&quot;(b) opium intended for consumption in India and Burma,
departmentally known as &quot;excise opium&quot; and (c) medical
opium for export to London. Provision opium is made up in the
form of balls or cakes, each weighing 3.5 lbs., and is packed in
chests, each chest containing forty cakes, weighing 140 1/7 lbs.
It is generally of 71' efficiency. Excise opium is made up in
cubical packets, each weighing one seer, 60 of which are packed
in a case. It is of higher consistency than the &quot;provision
opium.&quot; Medical opium is made up into cakes weighing 2 lbs.
Provision opium is sold by public auction in Calcutta. A
notification is published annually, generally about the month of
June, stating the number of chests which will be put up for sale
in each month of the next calendar year, and the quantities so
notified are not altered without three months notice. Sales are
conducted month by month by the Bengal Government; 7,000 chests
were notified for sale in 1917 for shipment to non-China markets.
The number of chests actually sold was 4,615. In addition to
this, 4,500 chests were sold to the Government of the Straits
Settlements, 2,200 to the Government of Netherland Indies, and 00
to the Government of Hongkong. The duty levied by Government on
each chest may be taken to be the difference between the average
price realized and the average cost. </p>

<p>The following facts are taken from &quot; Statistics of
British India. Financial Statistics, Volume II,Eighth
Issue,&quot; to be found at the New York Public Library: </p>

<p>AREA UNDER POPPY CULTIVATION </p>

<p>Acreage: </p>

<p>1910-11 362,868 </p>

<p>1911-12 200,672 </p>

<p>1912-13 178,263 </p>

<p>1913-14 144,561 </p>

<p>1914-15 164,911 </p>

<p>1915-16 167,155 </p>

<p>1916-17 204,186 </p>

<p>In the hey-day of the China trade, 613,996 acres were under
cultivation in the years 1905-6, consequently this is a drop in
the extent of acreage. But, as we have said before, the closing
of the China market simply means that other outlets must be
found, and apparently they are being found, since from I914
onwards, the acreage devoted to poppy planting is slowly
increasing again. </p>

<p>The opium manufactured in the Government factory is of three
kinds-provision opium for export; excise opium, for consumption
in India, and medical opium, for export to London. It is this
latter form of opium which, according to Mr. MacDonald, in his
&quot;Trade Politics and Christianity in Africa and the
East&quot; is being manufactured into morphia by three British
firms, two in Edinburgh and one in London, which morphia the
Japanese are buying and smuggling into North China. </p>

<p>The &quot;Statistics of British India&quot; shows the
countries into which Indian opium has been exported: we will take
the figures for the last five years, which show the number of
chests sent out. </p>

<p><img src="img00003.gif" align="bottom" width="195"
height="543"> <br>
</p>

<p>In some countries we see a falling off, as in China.
Cochin-China, the French colony, shows a considerable
increase--the little Annarnites, Tonquinese, Cambodgians and
other inhabitants of this colony of the French Republic being
shown what's what. Mauretius, a British Colony five hundred miles
off the coast of Madagascar, in the Indian ocean, seems to be
coming on. The falling off in shipments to the United Kingdom may
possibly have been due to the war and the scarcity of ships.
&quot;Other countries&quot; seem to be holding their own. With
the end of the war, the increase in ships, and general trade
revival, we may yet see compensation for the loss of China. With
the increase of drug addicts in the United States, it may be that
in time America will no longer be classed under &quot;other
countries&quot; but will have a column all to itself. </p>

<p>In another table we find a comparison as to the number of
chests of provision or export opium and of excise opium, or that
intended for consumption in India. Thus: <br>
</p>

<p><img src="img00004.gif" align="bottom" width="350"
height="144"> </p>

<p>Each chest contains roughly about one hundred and forty
pounds. <br>
</p>

<p>REVENUE </p>

<p>The revenue of India is derived from various sources, and is
classified under eight heads. Thus: for 1916-17-<br>
</p>

<p><img src="img00005.gif" align="bottom" width="349"
height="383"> </p>

<p>Out of these eight classifications, opium comes fourth on the
list. </p>

<p>But in addition to the direct opium revenue, we must add
another item, Excise, which is found under the third heading,
taxation. In the &quot;India Office List for i9i8&quot; we find
&quot;Excise&quot; explained as follows: Page 383: &quot;Excise
and Customs: Excise duties in India are levied with the two fold
object of raising revenue and restricting the use of intoxicants
and narcotics.&quot; In the same book, on page 385, we also read:
&quot;Excise and Customs Revenues: The total of the excise and
customs revenues on liquors and drugs in i 9 i 5-i 6 was in round
figures ten million pounds. This total gives an average of rather
more than ninepence a head on the whole population of British
India as the revenue charge on drink and drugs during the
year.&quot; </p>

<p>These excise duties are collected on spirits, beer, opium and
intoxicating drugs, such as ganja, charas, and bhang, all forms
or preparations of Indian hemp (Cannabis Indica), known in some
countries as hashish. In 1917-18 there were 17,369 drug shops
throughout India. The excise duties collected from these sources
was pretty evenly distributed. Excise revenue for a period of
years is as follows:<br>
</p>

<p><img src="img00006.gif" align="bottom" width="334"
height="194"> </p>

<p>The &quot;Statistics of British India for 1918&quot; has this
to say on the subject of Excise (page 218): &quot;Revenue: During
the ten years ending with 1916-17 the net receipts from Excise
duties increased . . . at the rate of 47 per cent. The receipts
from opium (consumed in India, not exported) being at the rate of
44 per cent. The net receipts from liquors and from drugs other
than opium . . . the increase at the rate Of 48 per cent. This
large increase is due not merely to the expansion of consumption,
but also to the imposition of progressively higher rates of duty
and the increasingly extensive control of the excise
administration. The revenue from drugs, (excluding opium) has
risen in ten years . . . the increase being at the rate of 67 per
cent.&quot; </p>

<p>A national psychology that can review these figures with
complacency, satisfaction and pride is not akin to American
psychology. A nation that can subjugate 300,000,000 helpless
people, and then turn them into drug addicts-for the sake of
revenue is a nation which commits a cold blooded atrocity
unparalleled by any atrocities committed in the rage and heat of
war. The Blue Book shows no horror at these figures. Complacent
approval greets the increase of 44 per cent of opium consumption,
and the increase of 67 per cent in the use of other habit-forming
drugs. Approval, and a shrewd appreciation of the possibilities
for more revenue from &quot;progressively higher rates of
duty,&quot; knowing well that drug addicts will sell soul and
body in order to procure their daily supply.<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>XI -- TURKEY AND PERSIA </h2>

<hr>

<p>NEXT to India, the greatest two opium-producing countries in
the world are Turkey and Persia. The Statesman's Year Book for
1918 has this to say about it. On page 1334: &quot;The principal
exports from Turkey into the United Kingdom..... in two years
were:<br>
</p>

<p><img src="img00007.gif" align="bottom" width="333"
height="115"> </p>

<p>These are the only articles mentioned in this list of chief
exports. There are others, doubtless, but the Statesman's Year
Book is a condensed and compact little volume, dealing only with
the principal things exported. In i9i5 we therefore notice that
the opium export was second on the list, being exceeded by but
one other, dried fruit. In i9i6, the third year of the war, the
opium export is decidedly less, as are all the other articles
exported, except dried fruit and wool-which were articles
probably more vital to the United Kingdom at that time even than
opium. </p>

<p>PERSIA </p>

<p>THE same authority, the Statesman's Year Book for 1918, gives
a table on page 1162, showing the value of the chief exports from
Persia. The values are given in thousands of kran, sixty kran
equaling one pound sterling. <br>
<img src="img00008.gif" align="bottom" width="333" height="46"> </p>

<p>Since the war, both Turkey and Persia are more or less under
control of the British Empire, which gives Great Britain virtual
control of the world's output of opium. With this monopoly of the
opium-producing countries, and with a million or so square miles
added to her immense colonial Empire, one wonders what use Great
Britain will make of the mandatory powers she has assumed over
the lives and welfare of all these subject peoples! Will she find
these helpless millions ready for her opium trade? Will she
establish opium shops, and opium divans, and reap half the costs
of upkeep of these newly acquired states by means of this
shameful traffic?<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<p><b>XII - MAURETIUS</b> </p>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>ANOTHER British colony is Mauretius, acquired by conquest in
1810, and formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris
in 1814. This island is in the Indian Ocean, 500 miles east of
Madagascar, with an area of about 720 square miles. The
population is about 377,000, of which number 258,000 are Indian,
and 3,000 Chinese. Opium appears to be sold in the colony, since
the Blue Book mentions that licenses are required for opium
sellers. As far as we can discover, by perusal of these
Government Reports, the sale of opium is not conducted by the
Government itself, as in India, the Straits Settlements,
Hongkong, etc., but is carried on by private dealers who obtain
licenses before they can open opium shops. A part of the revenue,
however, is derived from opium; thus, according to the Blue Book
for the Colony of Mauretius for 1915, page V 73, we read that the
imports of opium for the year amounted to 1,353 kilos, with a
duty collected of 54,126 rupees. The Blue Book for 1916 shows a
gratifying increase. Thus, the import of crude opium from India
amounted to 5,690 kilos, with a duty collected of 227,628 rupees.
(See page V 64-) </p>

<p>Statistics for British India, Eighth Issue, gives these
figures: </p>

<p>OPIUM EXPORTED TO MAURETIUS </p>

<p>1912-13 -- 10 chests </p>

<p>1913-14 -- 19 </p>

<p>1914-15 -- 23 </p>

<p>1915-16 -- 65 </p>

<p>1916-17. -- 120 </p>

<p>This is a poor little colony, but has its possibilities. The
consumption of opium appears to be increasing steadily in a most
satisfactory manner. Congratulations all round. </p>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>XIII - BRITISH NORTH BORNEO</h2>

<hr>

<p>BRITISH North Borneo occupies the northern part of the island
of Borneo. Area, about 31,000 square miles, with a coast line of
over 800 miles. Population (1911 census), 208,000, consisting
mainly of Mohammedan settlers on the coast and aboriginal tribes
inland. The Europeans numbered 355; Chinese 26,000; Malays,
1,612; East Indians about 5,000 and Filipinos 5,700. The number
of natives cannot be more than approximately estimated, but is
placed at about 170,000. The territory is under the jurisdiction
of the British North Borneo Company, being held under grants from
the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu (Royal Charter in 1881). </p>

<p>Like many other British colonies, opium is depended upon for
part of the revenue. The Statesman's Year Book for 1916 observes
on page 107: &quot;Sources of revenue: Opium, birds' nests, court
fees, stamp duty, licenses, import and export duties, royalties,
land sales, etc. No public debt.&quot; </p>

<p>In this frank manner, our attention is called to opium, which
appears first on the list of sources o revenue. </p>

<p>Going over the files of the Government reports, we will begin
with the &quot;Supplement to the Official Gazette for British
North Borneo. Administration Report for the Year 1910.&quot;
Published June 1, 1911. On page 3 we read: Customs and Trade: The
import and export trade of the state shows a healthy expansion. .
. . It is interesting to note that imports show an increase at
every station. Out of the 47 headings of Tariff, there are only 7
which show decreases. . . . The largest increases appear under
cloth, $147,106; opium, $132,692, and iron ware, $218,620. . . .
The general all round increases . . . are of course due to the
demand for supplies of all kinds in connection with the opening
of rubber estates.&quot; </p>

<p>The Supplement to the Official Gazette, Report for 1912
(published in December, 1913) is also a report of general
prosperity. Page 4: &quot;Trade: The volume of trade for the year
1912 was $11,139,122, giving an increase over 1911 of 18 per
cent. . . . Imports: As in 1911, all stations show an increase of
imports. Out Of 47 headings, 33 show increases, 12 show
decreases, and 2 remain stationary. Increases: There was an
increase under rice, flour and grain . . . the increase under
other headings include sundries, opium, machinery, etc.&quot; </p>

<p>The next Government Report is not so happy. Opium imports show
no &quot;healthy expansion.&quot; Thus, the Supplement to the
Official Gazette, Report for 1913 (published 1 February, 1915)
says on page 4: &quot;Other decreases in imports were opium,
$108,18o. The decrease in opium was due to the abolition of the
Opium Farm, which also held the Labuan Farm, and opium was
therefore no longer imported from Labuan for use in the West
Coast and the Interior.&quot; </p>

<p>Still more bad news as to opium, in the report for 1914,
(published 1 February, 1916). All imports drop. Page 4 records
&quot;Decrease in imports. . . . Railway and telegraph material,
rice, flour, grain and opium.&quot; In this year the opium
imports only amount to $58,464. This general falling off in all
imports may have been due to the war. But the opium situation was
apparently growing serious. On page 17 of this same report we
read that &quot;Thirty-two ordinances were passed by the Council
and became laws during the year. Among them the Opium and
Chandu.&quot; </p>

<p>The brevity and meagerness of these official reports often
leave one puzzled as to their meaning. The Supplement to the
Official Gazette for 1915 (published October, 1916), shows still
more discouraging news as to opium. Imports that year amounted to
only $31,299. But, in spite of this discouragement, hope still
remains. The same report shows optimism under the head of Excise.
&quot;Excise: $627,225, against $467,078, an increase in the net
revenue of $160,147, due to Government taking over the sole
control of the sale of chandu (smoking opium) and the collection
of other Excise duties, formerly farmed.&quot; </p>

<p>This explains the Ordinance passed by the Council the
preceding year, regarding Opium and Chandu. Since the Government
has taken over 44 sole control of the sale of chandu &quot; and
will collect the excise duties systematically and thoroughly, we
may still hope for some future report which will show once more a
&quot;healthy expansion&quot; in the opium revenue. </p>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>XIV - BRITISH GUIANA</h2>

<hr>

<p>SITUATED in South America. Area, 89,480 square miles.
Population at census of 1911, excluding aborigines in the
unfrequented parts of the colony, 296,000. The Statesman's Year
Book, which gives us these brief facts, has very little to say
about this British colony in our Western Hemisphere, and gives no
dates or information as to how and when it was acquired. The
Government reports are also meager and unsatisfactory, and there
is no wealth of detail as to exports and imports. The country,
however, is rich in gold, mining having commenced in i886.
Diamonds have also been discovered. </p>

<p>The chief sources of revenue, however, are customs, excise and
licenses. With the word &quot;excise&quot; we have come to have
unpleasant associations. From &quot;The Statistical Abstract for
British Self-Governing Dominions, Colonies, Possessions and
Protectorates&quot; we find a table showing the imports of opium
into the various countries under British rule. The opium imports
into British Guiana are as follows: </p>

<p>1910 1,251 pounds sterling </p>

<p>1911 1,270 </p>

<p>1912 2,474 </p>

<p>1913 4,452 </p>

<p>1914 5,455 </p>

<p>1915 4,481 </p>

<p>These figures would seem to indicate that even on the Western
Hemisphere the taste for opium may be cultivated. It need not
necessarily be confined to the Oriental peoples. The population
of much of South America is a mixed lot, the result of mixed
breeding between Spanish settlers, Indians, native tribes of all
sorts. All this jumble, including the aborigines referred to,
might, with a little teaching become profitable customers of the
Opium Monopoly. Time and a little effort, given this fertile
field, ought to produce a &quot;healthy expansion&quot; in the
opium trade. </p>

<p>And that this insidious habit is indeed taking hold, in at
least one more country in South America, one may infer from the
following paragraph which appeared in the New York Times, 4
October, 1919: </p>

<p>DRUG EVIL IN ARGENTINA </p>

<p>Buenos Aires Opens Fight on Use of Narcotics </p>

<p>The city government of Buenos Aires, Argentina, has begun a
determined fight to wipe out the drug evil by the enactment of
stringent laws governing the sale of narcotics. This step was
taken after an investigation by the authorities had disclosed
that not only was the narcotic habit strong among the poor, but
that it was spreading throughout virtually every class in the
city. </p>

<p>Until the passage of the laws druggists were permitted to sell
cocaine, morphine and opium to any purchaser. The new laws forbid
the sale of these drugs except in filling prescriptions prepared
by registered physicians. The city also has established
dispensaries for the treatment of drug addicts.<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>XV -- HISTORY OF THE OPIUM TRADE IN CHINA</h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>IN a vague way, we are familiar with the &quot;opium
evil&quot; in China, and some of us have hazy ideas as to how it
came about. The China Year Book for 1916 has this to say on the
subject: &quot;The poppy has been known in China for 12
centuries, and its medicinal use for 9 centuries. . . . It was
not until the middle of the 17th century that the practice of
mixing opium with tobacco for smoking purposes was introduced
into China. This habit was indulged in by the Dutch in Java, and
by them taken to Formosa, whence it spread to Amoy and the
mainland generally. There is no record to show when opium was
first smoked by itself, but it is thought to have originated
about the end of the 18th century. Foreign opium was first
introduced by the Portuguese from Goa at the beginning of the
18th century. In 1729, when the foreign import was 200 chests,
the Emperor Yung Ching issued the first anti-opium edict,
enacting severe penalties on the sale of opium and the opening of
opium-smoking divans. The importation, however, continued to
increase, and by 1790 it amounted to over 4,000 chests annually.
In 1796 opium smoking was again prohibited, and in 1800 the
importation of foreign opium was again declared illegal. Opium
was now contraband, but the fact had no effect on the quantity
introduced into the country, which rose to 5,000 chests in 1820;
16,000 chests in 1830; 20,000 chests in 1838, and 70,000 chests
in 1858.&quot; </p>

<p>The China Year Book makes no mention of the traders who
carried these chests of opium into China. The opium came from
India, however, and the increase in importation corresponds with
the British occupation of India, and the golden days of the East
India Company. &quot;Opium was now contraband, but that fact had
no effect on the quantity introduced into the country,&quot;
smuggled in wholesale by the enterprising British traders. </p>

<p>China was powerless to protect herself from this menace,
either by protests or prohibition. And as more and more of the
drug was smuggled in, and more and more of the people became
victims of the habit, the Chinese finally had a tea-party, very
much like our Boston Tea Party, but less successful in outcome.
In 1839, in spite of the fact that opium smoking is an easy habit
to acquire and had been extensively encouraged, the British
traders found themselves with 20,000 chests of unsold opium on
their store-ships, just below Canton. The Chinese had repeatedly
appealed to the British Government to stop these imports, but the
British Government had turned a persistently deaf ear. Therefore
the Emperor determined to deal with the matter on his own
account. He sent a powerful official named Lin to attend to it,
and Lin had a sort of Boston Tea Party, as we have said, and
destroyed some twenty thousand chests of opium in a very drastic
way. Mr. H. Wells Williams describes it thus: &quot;The opium was
destroyed in the most thorough manner, by mixing it in parcels Of
200 chests, in trenches, with lime and salt water, and then
drawing off the contents into an adjacent creek at low
tide.&quot; </p>

<p>After this atrocity, followed the first Opium War, when
British ships sailed up the river, seized port after port, and
bombarded and took Canton. Her ships sailed up the Yangtsze, and
captured the tribute junks going up the Grand Canal with revenue
to Peking, thus stopping a great part of China's income. Peace
was concluded in 1843, and Great Britain came out well. She
recompensed herself by taking the island of Hongkong; an
indemnity Of 21 million dollars, and Canton, Amoy, Foochow,
Ningpo and Shanghai were opened up as &quot;treaty
ports&quot;-for the importation of opium and the
&quot;open-door&quot; in general. </p>

<p>Mr. Wells, in his &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot; describes the
origin of this first war with England: &quot;This war was
extraordinary in its origin as growing chiefly out of a
commercial misunderstanding; remarkable in its course as being
waged between strength and weakness, conscious superiority and
ignorant pride; melancholy in its end as forcing the weaker to
pay for opium within its borders against all its laws, thus
paralyzing the little moral power its feeble government could
exert to protect its subjects. . . . It was a turning point in
the national life of the Chinese race, but the compulsory payment
of six million dollars for the opium destroyed has left a stigma
upon the English name.&quot; </p>

<p>He also says, &quot;The conflict was now fairly begun; its
issue between the parties so unequally matched --one having
almost nothing but the right on its side, the other assisted by
every material and physical advantage-could easily be
foreseen&quot; and again, after speaking of it as being unjust
and immoral, he concludes &quot;Great Britain, the first
Christian power, really waged this war against the pagan monarch
who had only endeavored to put down a vice harmful to his people.
The war was looked upon in this light by the Chinese; it will
always be so looked upon by the candid historian, and known as
the Opium War.&quot; </p>

<p>Within fifteen years after this first war, there was another
one, and again Great Britain came off victorious. China had to
pay another indemnity, three million dollars, and five more
treaty ports were opened up. By the terms of the Treaty of
Tientsin, the sale of opium in China was legalized in 1858. </p>

<p>From a small pamphlet, &quot;Opium: England's Coercive Policy
and Its Disastrous Results in China and India&quot; by the Rev.
John Liggins, we find the following: &quot;As a specimen of how
both wars were carried on, we quote the following from an English
writer on the bombardment of Canton: 'Field pieces loaded with
grape were planted at the end of long, narrow streets crowded
with innocent men, women and children, to mow them down like
grass till the gutters flowed with their blood.' In one scene of
carnage, the Times correspondent recorded that half an army of
10,ooo men were in ten minutes destroyed by the sword, or forced
into the broad river. &quot; The Morning Herald &quot; asserted
that &quot;a more horrible or revolting crime than this
bombardment of Canton has never been committed in the worst ages
of barbaric darkness.&quot; </p>

<p>Naturally, therefore, after the termination of these two wars,
China gave up the struggle. She had fought valiantly to protect
her people from opium, but the resources of a Christian nation
were too much for her. Seeing therefore that the opium trade was
to be forced upon her, and that her people were doomed to
degradation, she decided to plant poppies herself. There should
be competition at least, and the money should not all be drained
out of the country. Thus it came about that after 1858 extensive
tracts of land were given over to poppy production. Whole
provinces or parts of provinces, ceased to grow grain and other
necessities, and diverted their rich river bottoms to the raising
of opium. Chinese opium, however, never supplanted Indian opium,
being inferior to that raised in the rich valley of the Ganges.
The country merely had double quantities of the drug, used
straight or blended, to suit the purse or taste of the consumer. </p>

<p>Then, in 1906, the incredible happened. After over a hundred
years of steady demoralization, with half her population opium
addicts, or worse still, making enormous profits out of the
trade, China determined to give up opium. In all history, no
nation has ever set itself such a gigantic task, with such a
gigantic handicap. China, a country of immense distances, with
scant means of communication; with no common language, a land
where only the scholars can read and write, suddenly decided to
free herself from this vice. The Emperor issued an edict saying
that in ten years' time all opium traffic must cease, and an
arrangement was made with Great Britain whereby this might be
accomplished. To the honor of America be it said that we assisted
China in this resolution. We agreed to see her through. </p>

<p>A bargain was then made between China and Great Britain, in
1907, China agreeing to diminish poppy cultivation year by year
for a period of ten years, and Great Britain agreeing to a
proportional decrease in the imports of Indian opium. A three
years' test was first agreed to, a trial of China's sincerity and
ability, for Great Britain feared that this was but a ruse to cut
off Indian opium, while leaving China's opium alone in the field.
At the end of three years, however, China had proved her ability
to cope with the situation. Thus, for a period of ten years, both
countries have lived up to their bargain, the amount of native
and foreign opium declining steadily in a decreasing scale. April
1, 1917, saw the end of the accomplishment. </p>

<p>China's part was most difficult. In the remote, interior
provinces, poppies were grown surreptitiously, connived at by
corrupt officials who made money from the crops. However, drastic
laws were enacted and severe penalties imposed upon those who
broke them. If poppy cultivation could not be stopped, England
would not hold to her end of the bargain. Not only was there a
nation of addicts to deal with, but these could obtain copious
supplies of opium from the foreign concessions, over which the
Chinese had no control. We shall show, in another article, to
what extent this was carried on. Yet somehow, in some manner, the
impossible happened. Year by year, little by little, one province
after another was freed from poppy cultivation, until in 1917,
China was practically free from the native-grown drug, and
foreign importation had practically ended. </p>

<p>In this manner, first by large smuggling, then by two opium
wars, was China drugged with opium. And in this manner, and to
this extent, has she succeeded in freeing herself from the curse.
But in one way, she is not free. She has no control over the
extra-territorial holdings of European powers, for in each treaty
port are the foreign concessions already mentioned-German,
Austrian, British, French, Russian. And in these concessions,
opium may be procured. Simply by crossing an imaginary line, in
such cities as Shanghai and Hongkong, can the Chinese buy as much
opium as they choose. China will never be rid of this menace till
she is rid of these extraterritorial holdings. Opium shops,
licensed by foreign governments, are always ready to supply her
people with the forbidden drug. </p>

<p>We say that the China market is closed. So it is, in one way.
But the British Opium Monopoly is not ended. The year 1917 saw a
tremendous blow dealt to the British opium dealers, but other
markets will be found. There are other countries than China whose
inhabitants can be taught this vice. The object of this
discussion is to consider these other countries, and to see to
what extent the world is menaced by this possibility. </p>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>XVI -- CONCLUSION</h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"

<p>THERE are many people who advocate the use of opium, and who
defend the policy of the Opium Monopoly. They argue that it is
not harmful-if taken in moderation. They even assert that it is
no more objectionable than alcohol or tobacco. Leaving out of
account, therefore, the consensus of opinion of the medical
profession as to the evils of habit-forming drugs, and accepting
the theory that opium is harmless, we should then like to ask why
the use of opium is so carefully restricted to the peoples of
subject states, who have no voice in their own affairs? Why
should the benefits of opium be confined to Oriental races, and
why should not the white race be given the same opportunities for
indulgence? Is there any reason for this discrimination? As a
source of revenue, it certainly has advantages. Yet curiously
enough, those European countries which derive much profit through
the sale of opium to their subject races, seem to have an
aversion to introducing it to their people at home. And there is
a further coincidence in the fact that none of the self-governing
colonies of European countries-Australia, New Zealand and
Canada-permit this traffic. It appears to be only the subject
peoples, whose well-being has become the White Man's Burden, who
receive the blessings of this peculiar form of altruism. Is it
because the white race is worth preserving, worth protecting, and
because subject nations are fair game for exploitation of any
kind? </p>

<p>Another argument advanced by advocates of Government opium is
that the Oriental peoples are &quot;different&quot;-that opium
does them no harm. Every writer on the subject of opium in China,
produces evidence to show the shocking results upon that country,
during the hey-dey of the deluge. The complete moral degradation,
and economic ruin of thousands of helpless individuals. Nor do we
think the medical profession would agree with this assumption
that opium is harmless to Orientals, because they are
&quot;different.&quot; Their only real difference lies in their
helplessness to protect themselves from foreign aggression. </p>

<p>Another argument advanced by the upholders of the Monopoly is
that the Orientals have always been users of opium, that they
like it, it suits them, it would be unfair to deprive them of it.
We have seen to what extent the Chinese liked it, and how it was
forced upon them by two wars. Not until they were completely
crushed, and had to accept the terms of the conquerer, did they
submit. It can hardly, therefore, be called a vice indigenous to
the Chinese. Japan is another Oriental nation that disproves this
argument. As we have said before, there are no opium shops in
Japan, and the sale of opium is not conducted by the Japanese
Government. On the contrary, the Japanese have the same fear of
this drug that a European nation has, and exercises the same
precautions to protect its people. But, as we have said before,
Japan is the only Oriental nation that has not been subjugated by
a European nation, and therefore has never had opium thrust upon
her. She is the only country in the Far East that has managed to
preserve her sovereignty, and has never been subject to certain
blighting influences of European culture. </p>

<p>Another exception to this assumption that the Orientals cannot
do without opium lies in the Philippines. When America acquired
those islands some twenty years ago, our first act was to
eliminate the opium traffic, which had been established there by
our predecessors. It had been in existence for decades, but we
immediately set about to abolish it. Root and branch we did away
with it, and shed no crocodile tears as to the &quot; hardship
&quot; this would be to the people who had come under our
protection. We wished no revenue coming from such a source as
this. Yet we might have cut in half the cost of our Philippine
budget had we followed the example set by other nations. We have
seen that certain British colonies, Hongkong and the Straits
Settlements, for example, derive from one-third to one-half of
their upkeep expenses from this traffic. But we refrained from
treating our Filipinos in this manner. We are called
sentimentalists out in the East-at such times as we are not
called money-getters. To-day, the Philippines are very nearly
ready for self government. Would they have been so nearly ready
had we continued to drug them as they had been drugged before we
took possession? Drugged peoples are usually docile and
submissive-perhaps that is the secret of much of the successful
colonizing, about which we hear so much. </p>

<p>But let us leave aside the question of the Orientals, and
whether or no opium is good for them. We recognize quite clearly
that it is not good for ourselves, for Americans. We recognize
that fact quite as clearly as England realizes that it is not
good for the inhabitants of the British Isles. Quite as clearly
as France, while setting up opium shops in her colony of
Indo-China, refuses to establish them in Paris or Marseilles.
America is unique in the fact that although we have colonial
possessions, we do not have a double standard of morality. We
attempt to throw around our colonies the same safeguards that we
throw around ourselves at home. But the question arises, how
successful are we in protecting ourselves at home? Not
particularly so, according to the daily press. </p>

<p>How great the danger to ourselves was recognized some
thirty-seven years ago by an Episcopal missionary to China, the
Rev. John Liggins. In 1882 he published a small book, already
referred to, entitled: &quot;England's Coercive Opium Policy and
Its Disastrous Results in China and India.&quot; The preface to
this unheeded warning runs thus. &quot;Our aim in this sketch is
to present, as briefly as possible, the most important facts and
testimonies concerning a traffic which is as disgraceful to
England as it is ruinous to China and hurtful to India. . . . It
is also of the highest importance that the people throughout our
wide domain should be aroused concerning the new, fascinating and
deadly foe which has entered our country through the Golden Gate,
and which already numbers its victims by the thousands, and will
soon do so by the tens of thousands.&quot; </p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Liggins saw it coming-that danger which is almost
ready to overwhelm us to-day. He recognized clearly that the
Opium Monopoly of that great nation which rules nearly one-third
of the world-the British Empire would in time reach further and
further afield for new victims. It is too lucrative a trade to be
confined to only a few countries. Markets must not only be
created and legalized in subject states, but new ones added in
outside countries, through smuggling. All too fatally easy of
accomplishment, and so profitable, financially, as to be worth
any risk and effort. The prediction as to our own danger, made in
i882, seems to be abundantly realized. </p>

<p>The number of drug addicts in America to-day are fairly
startling. The number is variously estimated in New York City
alone as from ten thousand to one hundred thousand. It is said
that there may be a million in the country. Yet these figures are
the merest guesswork, by no means substantiated. Certain it is
that the campaign of the New York Health Department has uncovered
thousands of them, and any other city that chose to do so, could
produce facts equally startling. </p>

<p>The laws on our statute books concerning the prescription of
narcotic drugs are powerless to deal with the situation. It is
shooting into the air to try to &quot;regulate&quot; this
condition. It is as thoroughly well &quot;regulated&quot; as it
can ever be by the Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act, a Federal Law
whose enforcement is in the hands of the Internal Revenue
Department. By the provisions of this Act, every pound of opium
or its derivatives that comes into this country, legitimately, is
accounted for, and its distribution, both wholesale and retail,
made a matter of record. Thus, the Board of Trade returns show
the amount imported by the big wholesale drug houses. These must
account for their sales to the retail drug stores, and the
amounts must tally. The drug stores can only sell narcotic drugs
on a physician's prescription, and the prescriptions are kept on
file, and the quantity sold must correspond to the quantity
called for by these prescriptions, as well as to the amount
obtained from the wholesale drug house. In prescribing narcotics,
the physician is obliged to write his prescription in
triplicate--one copy for his own protection, one copy for the
local druggist, and one copy to be filed with the health
department. Nor is he allowed to prescribe narcotics for an
addict without decreasing the dosage. His prescription cannot
call for thirty grains of morphia day after day, it must show, in
a chronic case of this kind, a daily diminution of the amount
prescribed, thus indicating a desire to get the patient off the
drug, eventually. All these records are kept on file, open to
inspection whenever an accounting is demanded, consequently any
leak can be instantly accounted for. This Harrison Act is as
comprehensive and as nearly perfect as possible, yet it does not
cover the situation. By this means, violations can be detected,
whether on the part of an unscrupulous physician or druggist, or
even the wholesale house, but these violations are only
occasional. The root of the evil remains untouched. </p>

<p>At one time, it was believed that carelessness on the part of
the physician was chiefly responsible for creating drug addicts,
but the recent campaign against violators of the Harrison Act
seems to have completely exonerated him of this charge. For one
patient who becomes a drug addict while under a doctor's care,
through the accidental misuse of morphia, there are a hundred who
form the habit through other ways. It is not the occasional,
accidental victim, given morphia for the relief of pain, which is
creating our thousands of drug users. It is not the occasional
unscrupulous physician who is responsible. If this was all, we
could easily cope with these unwitting abuses, or even deliberate
instances of misuse. But the question goes deeper than this. </p>

<p>The Opium Monopoly was not established for any humane or
altruistic purpose. It was not established to provide the medical
profession with a drug for the relief of pain, to ease the agony
of the injured and wounded, or to calm the last days of those
dying with an incurable disease. This, which may be called the
legitimate use of opium, is not the object of the Opium Monopoly.
Used only in this manner, there would be no money in it. It is
only when opium is produced in quantities far in excess of the
legitimate needs of the world that it becomes worth while-to the
Opium Monopoly. That Monopoly was established not to relieve pain
and suffering, but with the deliberate intention of creating pain
and suffering, by creating drug victims by the thousand. It is
these hundreds of thousands of customers that are profitable. The
menace to America lies in the large amounts of opium which are
smuggled into the country for this purpose. Boys and girls o
sixteen and seventeen first acquire this habit through curiosity,
through association with what they call &quot;bad company,&quot;
peddlers who first offer it free, as a gift, well knowing that
after a few doses the fatal habit will be formed. Where do these
vendors obtain their supplies? </p>

<p>The daily papers often contain suggestive paragraphs. Thus the
&quot; New York Times,&quot; under date of February 28, 1919:
&quot; Seize Opium in Schenectady. Opium, valued by Federal
officials at $10,000 was seized in Schenectady, and four Chinamen
were arrested in a raid on Chinese places of business on Centre
street today. The Federal officials expressed the belief that
opium had been smuggled, and that Schenectady is the distributing
point for this part of the State.&quot; </p>

<p>An item in the &quot;Seattle Union Record,&quot; of June 24,
1919, gives us cause for further consideration. </p>

<p>BRITISH DRUG SHIP HELD BY UNITED STATES </p>

<p>FINE OF $49,265 ASSESSED FOR BRINGING &quot;DOPE&quot; TO
AMERICA </p>

<p>LINER ALLOWED TO MOVE UNDER BOND </p>

<p>NO ARRESTS MADE, THOUGH BOOZE IS FOUND ABOARD </p>

<p>No arrests were made up to Tuesday noon in connection with the
enormous seizure of opium, cocaine and liquor on the Blue Funnel
liner Cyclops, although the investigation is being continued by
federal officials. </p>

<p>The ship has been seized and a fine of $49,265 has been
assessed against her for having drugs not listed in the ship's
manifest. </p>

<p>United States District Attorney Robert C. Saunders filed a
libel Monday night against the Cyclops, the boat being seized
later by the customs service. Bond was fixed at $100,00, or twice
the fine. The Fidelity Surety Company filed the bond Monday. The
ship was released Tuesday morning. </p>

<p>A civil libel suit may be filed against Capt. W. Duncan,
holding him responsible for the liquor found on the ship. Captain
Duncan, questioned Monday by customs officials, claimed to know
nothing about the contraband. </p>

<p>The result of Monday's checking of the opium and cocaine
showed that the seizure amounted to 778 tins of opium, 670 ounces
of cocaine and 16 ounces of morphine. </p>

<p>A small paragraph in a New York paper, dated June 12, 1919,
reads thus: &quot;Two New Yorkers jailed for smuggling opium.
Pleas of guilty to charges of opium smuggling were entered in the
Federal Court today by Albertus Schneitzer and Maxwell Auerbach,
of New York. They were fined $500 each, and sent to Atlanta
penitentiary, the former for two years, and the latter for one
year. The men were arrested in connection with the seizure of
opium on the Canadian border.&quot; </p>

<p>We cannot grapple with our problem unless we face the facts;
if we ignore the source of supply and distribution, and the
reasons for this immense overproduction of opium on the part of
the British Opium Monopoly. The anti-narcotic laws on our statute
books are powerless to protect us. With Canada, a British
province, to the north, and all Mexico on the south, what chance
have we against such exposure? Of what use to send two smugglers
to the penitentiary, when at the Calcutta opium sales, once a
month opium is auctioned off under the auspices of the British
Government, to be disposed of as the buyers may see fit? Much of
it, as we have seen, goes to those helpless states and colonies
which have no control over their own affairs, where the opium
traffic is conducted under the administration of the alien
government. Much of the rest of it goes out for smuggling
purposes, to be distributed in devious, roundabout, underhand
channels throughout the world. We are coming in for our share in
this distribution. </p>

<p>We feel that our country is in grave peril. Our politicians
and our diplomats have been too careful all these years, to speak
of this business, through fear of offending a powerful nation.
But we feel that the time has now come to speak. England has been
relying upon our silence to &quot;get away with it.&quot; Upon
our ignorance, and upon that silence which gives consent. But in
this new, changed world, reborn out of the blood and agony of the
great war, is it not time to practice some of the decencies which
we have proclaimed so loudly? </p>

<p>As we have said before, no stronger opponents of this policy
are to be found than among a section of the people of England
itself. We look to them to join us, in this great issue, and we
feel that we shall not look in vain. </p>

    <li>&quot;The American crack experience is fairly well known,
        having been reported, and perhaps overreported, in the
        media since early 1986&quot; (Inciardi, 1993, p. 1). </li>
    <li>&quot;As asset forfeiture provisions, RICO [Racketeering
        Influenced and Corrupt Organizations] and CCE [Continuing
        Criminal Enterprise statute] mandate forfeiture of the
        fruits of criminal activities&quot; (Inciardi, 1993, p.
        1). </li>
    <li>&quot;At state and local levels, zero tolerance gave
        birth to the many 'user accountability' statutes. User
        accountability was based on the notion that if there were
        no drug users there would be no drug problems and that
        casual users of drugs, like addicts, were responsible for
        creating the demand that made trafficking in drugs a
        lucrative criminal enterprise. As such, the new laws
        called for mandatory penalties for those found in
        possession of small quantities of drugs (Inciardi, 1993,
        p. 2). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;The Federal Corrections Institute in Lexington,
        Atwood Hall Drug Abuse Program [AHDAP] is a traditional
        12-step program in which drug abuse is viewed as a
        disease that leads to physical deterioration, emotional
        instability, and spiritual bankruptcy&quot; (Wellisch,
        Anglin, &amp; Prendergast, 1993, p. 11). </li>
    <li>Some of the requirements for admission to this program
        (AHDAP) are &quot;...no serious medical, psychiatric, or
        psychological problems; and no violent institutional
        infractions within the last 12 months&quot; (Wellisch,
        Anglin, &amp; Prendergast, 1993, p. 11). </li>
    <li>Re: enrollment in treatment programs while
        incarcerated--&quot;Most authorities agree that too early
        enrollment may erode the gains made in treatment because
        the prisoners will remain in an environment--the
        prison--that is conductive to relapse&quot; (Wellisch,
        Anglin, &amp; Prendergast, 1993, p. 21). </li>
    <li>&quot;Drug abuse treatment requires individuation and a
        degree of flexibility that is not consonant with most
        prison operations&quot; (Wellisch, Anglin, &amp;
        Prendergast, 1993, p. 21). </li>
    <li>&quot;Because dependence on drugs is a chronically
        relapsing condition, in most cases several cycles of
        treatment, aftercare, and relapse will occur&quot;
        (Wellisch, Anglin, &amp; Prendergast, 1993, p. 22). </li>
    <li>&quot;...since a large percentage of incarcerated women
        have been subjected to physical and sexual abuse, they
        require counseling and psychological support in addition
        to general health care&quot; (Wellisch, Anglin, &amp;

        that make rehabilitation difficult&quot; (Pan, Scarpitti,

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Federal, state, and local responses to the drug
        epidemic have focused on reducing the supply of drugs
        through enhanced law enforcement efforts, minimum
        mandatory sentences for drug offenses, and unprecedented
        construction of new jails and prisons. Efforts aimed at
        drug suppliers and users have not succeeded in reducing
        the availability of drugs in most communities (Peters,
        1993, p. 45). </li>
    <li>&quot;The role of jails has expanded in the past 20 years
        to address the needs of special inmate populations,
        including substance abusers, the mentally ill, and
        individuals with educational and vocational deficits.
        These changes have been affected in part by the
        recognition that jails frequently serve as the repository
        for socially disadvantaged populations (e.g., mentally
        ill, substance abusers, the homeless) that move somewhat
        fluidly from one community institution to another&quot;
        (Peters, 1993, p. 46). </li>
    <li>&quot;Survey findings indicate that a small fraction of
        jail inmates in need of substance abuse treatment were
        receiving services (Peters, 1993, p.49). </li>
    <li>&quot;The CD [Chemical Dependency] approach views the
        development of addictive disorders as a product of
        physiological, psychological, and social factors. Inmates
        are taught that drug dependence is a lifetime disorder.
        During periods of abstinence, the 'disease' is in
        remission, but the individual must always be concerned
        with reoccurrence of symptoms&quot; (Peters, 1993, p.
        50). </li>
    <li>&quot;...narcotic agonists such as methadone, which
        replace the physiological need for opiates,...have been
        found to be useful in the treatment of offenders who are
        addicted to opiates&quot; (Peters, 1993, p. 52). </li>
    <li>&quot;Methadone treatments have been researched
        extensively and have been shown to be effective in
        reducing withdrawal symptoms and drug cravings&quot;
        (Peters, 1993, p. 52). </li>
    <li>&quot;Use of this approach [methadone] is usually
        reserved for individuals who have not been able to
        achieve abstinence in drug-free programs. Use of
        methadone is governed by federal regulations that require
        narcotic dependency for at least 1 year prior to the
        onset of treatment and previous involvement in treatment.
        Other federal guidelines require drug testing,
        counseling, and development of individualized treatment
        plans (Office of Technology Assessment, 1990). Several
        states have also adopted regulations governing dosage
        levels and quality assurance monitoring&quot; (Peters,
        1993, (p. 52). </li>
    <li>&quot;Methadone has been used infrequently in jail
        settings, because, in part, of a reluctance by
        administrators to provide narcotics to inmates and
        related issues of medical supervision and concerns of
        compromising institutional security&quot; (Peters, 1993,
        p. 52). </li>

    <li>&quot;Research has repeatedly found that criminal
        behavior increases following addiction, and that arrests
        for drug offenses and property offenses decline with
        decreasing frequency of drug use&quot; (Dembo, Williams,
        &amp; Schmeidler, 1993, p. 113). </li>
    <li>&quot;Methadone maintained clients have better outcomes
        in terms of illicit drug use and other criminal behavior
        than when not treated or detoxified and released or when
        methadone is tapered down and terminated. Clients who
        stay in treatment longer have better outcomes than
        clients with shorter treatment courses&quot; (Dembo,
        Williams, &amp; Schmeidler, 1993, p. 116). </li>
    <li>&quot;It is counterproductive to treat youths in
        residential settings, only to return them unassisted to
        environments that supported their problem behavior in the

        119). </li>
    <li>&quot;In treating a person for dysfunctional drug use, it
        is important to appreciate that altering a drug-dependent
        existence is often a prolonged process involving periodic
        relapses to drug use&quot; (Dembo, Williams, &amp;
        Schmeidler, 1993, p. 121). </li>

    <li>&quot;...Anslinger's crusade appears to have been the
        ravings of a madman. Using the mass media as his forum,
        Anslinger described marijuana as a Frankenstein drug that
        was stalking American youth&quot; (Inciardi, 1986, p.
        22). </li>
    <li>In a magazine, he wrote: &quot;The sprawled body of a
        young girl lay crushed on the sidewalk the other day
        after a plunge from the fifth story of a Chicago
        apartment house. Everyone called it suicide, but actually
        it was murder. The killer was a narcotic known to America
        as marijuana, and to history as hashish. It is a narcotic
        used in the form of cigarettes, comparatively new to the
        United States and as dangerous as a coiled
        rattlesnake...(Inciardi, 1986, p. 22). </li>
    <li>The same magazine, <u>American Magazine</u>, ran this
        from Anslinger: &quot;An entire family was murdered by a
        youthful addict in Florida. When officers arrived at the
        home, they found the youth staggering about in a human
        slaughterhouse. With an ax he had killed his father,
        mother, two brothers, and a sister. He seemed to be in a
        daze....He had no recollection of having committed the
        multiple crime. <i>The officers knew him ordinarily as a
        sane, rather quiet young man; now he was pitifully
        crazed. </i>They sought the reason. The boy said that he
        had been in the habit of smoking something which youthful
        friends called &quot;muggles,&quot; a childish name for
        marihuana [sic]&quot; (Inciardi, 1986, p. 22). </li>
    <li>&quot;Colored students at the Univ. of Minn. partying
        with female students (white), smoking (marijuana) and
        getting their sympathy with stories of racial
        persecution. Result pregnancy. Two Negroes took a girl
        fourteen years old and kept her for two days under the
        influence of marihuana [sic]. Upon recovery she was found
        to be suffering from syphilis&quot; (Inciardi, 1986, p.
        22). </li>
    <li>&quot;During the early decades of the twentieth century,
        commentaries about cocaine took on racial overtones,
        precipitated by white fears of the blacks' sexual and
        criminal impulses. In 1910, for example, testimony before
        a committee of the House of Representatives referenced
        these fears and also included almost every white
        stereotype of blacks: The colored people seem to have a
        weakness for it [cocaine]. It is a very seductive drug,
        and it produces extreme exhilaration. Persons under the
        influences on it believe they are millionaires. They have
        an exaggerated ego. They imagine they can lift this
        building, if they want to, or can do anything they want
        to. They have no regard for right or wrong. It produces a
        kind of temporary insanity. They would just as leave rape
        a woman as anything else and a great many of the southern
        rape cases have been traced to cocaine&quot; (Inciardi,
        1986, p. 72). </li>
    <li>&quot;Indeed, heroin is a powerful narcotic. Several
        times more potent than morphine, it suppresses both
        respiratory and cardiovascular activity, has strong
        analgesic effects and a high-addiction potential. At
        overdose levels, heroin can produce coma, shock, and
        ultimately, respiratory arrest and death&quot; (Inciardi,
        1986, p. 52). </li>
    <li>&quot;As the result of Anslinger's crusade, on August 2,
        1937, the Marijuana Tax Act was signed into law,
        classifying the scraggly tramp of the vegetable world as
        a narcotic and placing it under essentially the same
        controls as the Harrison Act had done with opium and coca
        products&quot; (Inciardi, 1986, p. 23). </li>
    <li>Inciardi (1986, p. 204) criticizes psychiatrist Thomas
        Szasz's point that &quot;...the drug problem in America
        was created in great part by the very policies designed
        to control it&quot; by saying that in Szasz's book there
        were &quot;numerous errors of fact combined with his
        caustic abuse of the English language.&quot; Likewise,
        Inciardi (1986, p. 204) does not agree with Washington
        attorney Rufus King who takes a similar view and has
        described American drug-control policies as &quot;a
        50-year folly, a misguided and ineffective
        endeavor.&quot;<sup> </sup><b><i>make footnote: 50-year
        folly--Rufus King, </i></b><i><u>The Drug Hang-Up:
        America's Fifty-Year Folly</u></i><i> (New York: W. W.
        Norton, 1972). </i>Again disagreeing, Inciardi (1986,
        p.204) quotes Alfred R. Lindesmith from an article in <u>The
        Nation:</u> </li>
</ul>

<p>For 40 years the United States has tried in vain to control
the problem of drug addiction by prohibition and police
suppression. The disastrous consequences of turning over to the
police what is an essentially medical problem are steadily
becoming more apparent as narcotic arrests rise each year to new
records and the habit continues to spread, especially among young
persons. Control by prohibition has failed; but the proposed
remedies for this failure consist mainly of more of the same
measures which have already proved futile. </p>

<p>Inciardi (1986, pp.204-206) lumps these social scientists
together and dismisses them as &quot;armchair crusaders who had
little direct contact with life in the street worlds of heroin,
cocaine, and crime [who]....suggest that federal drug policies
are simply an outgrowth of the government's practiced benign
stupidity.&quot; </p>

<ul>
    <li>In contrast with those views, Inciardi (1986, pp.204-205)
        defines and disagrees with the Marxist perspective of
        Criminologists D. Stanley Eitzen and Doug A. Timmer
        &quot;that the American approach is deliberately
        structured to fail because the political economy of the
        United States needs the private accumulation of capital
        and profit that drug trafficking provides. For that
        reason, they state, the drug trades are not only
        tolerated, but condoned as well.&quot; Criminologists
        Eitzen and Timmer are dismissed by Inciardi (1986, p.
        205) because he believes they &quot;read far too much
        into an erroneously documented statement&quot; by William
        J. Chambliss in <u>On the Take</u>: </li>
</ul>

<p>...the heroin traffic from Southeast Asia, especially from the
Golden Triangle of northern Thailand, Burma, and Laos, expanded
production as a new source of heroin for the incredibly lucrative
American market....It is not known whether this new heroin source
was linked to Republican politicians, but the fact that the CIA
and the South Vietnamese governments under general Ky and Thieu
actively aided the development of this heroin source suggests
that such a link is not beyond the realm of possibility. </p>

<p>Inciardi (1986, p. 205) scoffs at the translation of
&quot;this into the 'private accumulation of capital and
profit'&quot; argument but does accept the conclusion of Alfred
W. McCoy in <u>The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia</u>
&quot;that the heroin trade in Southeast Asia grew to some extent
with the complicity of the U.S. government representatives in
that part of the world...[due to] American anticommunist
zeal.&quot; </p>

<ul>
    <li>Ask Dr. Brown about the Iran-Contra coverup movie we saw
        about Oliver North, Reagan, etc. Doesn't that give more
        credence to the Marxist perspective of Eitzen and Timmer?
    </li>
    <li>It is absolutely amazing to me how many of our rights we
        are willing to give up in the off chance that we can put
        a dent in the drug problem. &quot;Ignorant men don't know
        what good they hold in their hands until they've flung it
        away&quot; (Sophocles). </li>
    <li>&quot;Dr. William Pollin, former director of the National
        Institute on Drug Abuse:...If there were no law
        enforcement, then the number of cocaine users would be up
        there in the same numbers with smokers and drinkers&quot;
        (Inciardi, 1986, p. 211). Pray tell, how does he know? It
        is inconceivable that those who demand scientific studies
        and well-documented evidence insist on using these
        off-the-wall quotes regarding something that no one knows
        for certain is going to happen. </li>

    <li>&quot;...ambitious lawmakers and empire-building
        policemen appear to have created social attitudes instead
        of, as the system is supposed to work, merely reflecting
        and responding to them&quot; (King, 1974, p.18). </li>
    <li>&quot;During the Civil War opium and morphine were in
        such demand to control dysentery and ease the suffering
        of wounded soldiers that addiction among veterans was
        tolerantly known as 'the Army disease&quot; (King, 1974,
        p.18). </li>
    <li>In the early 1900s, the approximately 200,000
        &quot;victims [of addiction] were believed to be
        preponderantly female, middle-aged, white, Southern,
        rural, and from privileged or middle classes. No one then
        dreamed of associating drug abuse with criminality&quot;
        (King, 1974, pp. 18-19). </li>
    <li>The Food and Drug Act of 1906 &quot;...required drug
        manufacturers who made use of interstate commerce to
        disclose the ingredients in their products by appropriate
        labeling&quot; (King, 1974, p. 19). </li>
    <li>In the meantime, China lost the Opium Wars and
        &quot;...according to one estimate, 27 percent of the
        adult male population of the country was addicted in some
        degree&quot; (King, 1974, p. 19). </li>
    <li>&quot;On the other side of the world in Washington,
        Yankee lawmakers were being swept away by missionary and
        moralistic zeal...[and in 1908] President Theodore
        Roosevelt proposed that all powers concerned with the
        international opium traffic should meet to consider
        cooperative measures to put an end to it&quot; (King,
        1974, p. 20.) </li>
    <li>&quot;Out of this came the Shanghai Conference (1909) and
        the Hague Opium Convention, signed in 1912 by delegates
        from thirteen governments. Under this Convention...each
        High Contracting Party proposed to bind itself to
        restrain its nationals from trafficking in opium and coca
        products, and to impose domestic controls on its citizens
        to curb non-medicinal uses&quot; (King, 1974, p. 20). </li>
    <li>&quot;The first federal <i>control</i> enactment, the
        Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914...relied upon a then
        extraordinary extension of the federal tax power to
        require manufacturers, distributors, and dispensers of
        opiates and coca products to register with the Treasury
        Department and to keep records of transactions involving
        these substances&quot; (King, 1974, p. 19). This is how
        Congress intended to fulfill their obligation to the
        Hague Opium Convention. </li>
    <li>&quot;And it bears stressing again that in that day
        federal intervention into matters of local choice and
        personal concern was virtually unprecedented&quot; (King,
        1974, p. 21). </li>
    <li>&quot;...it was even possible for addicted persons of
        sufficient prominence and good connections to be
        'treated' with tacit Bureau protection. The payoff for
        this was what Commissioner Anslinger wanted in the way of
        appropriations for his forces, and new federal
        legislation he usually got virtually for the asking&quot;
        (King, 1974, p. 24). </li>
    <li>Re: Marijuana Tax Act of 1937--&quot;So the result was
        merely another nationwide enforcement empire and new
        categories of federal crime&quot; (King, 1974, p. 25). </li>
    <li>&quot;By 1937, when the Marijuana Tax Act was pushed
        through Congress, the T-men had begun to sound another
        note that would become their major theme for the ensuing
        decade: the charge that American drug problems were
        caused by too-light penalties for second and subsequent
        drug offenses&quot; (King, 1974, p. 25). </li>
    <li>At the same time the Senate Judiciary Committee held its
        hearing, the American Medical Association (AMA) and
        American Bar Association (ABA) made a study of the drug
        problem. The five recommendations which came out of this
        included </li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;a comparative study of federal and state laws&quot; and
&quot;an evaluation of the effectiveness of current enforcement
policies&quot;. The Bureau of Narcotics threw a fit and attacked
with 'comments' on the recommendations and interference with the
project's funding (King, 1974, 28). </p>

<ul>
    <li>Daniel Glaser (1974, p.39) described two types of drug
        use. The first is &quot;instrumental&quot;, and that
        means a drug is used &quot;for a specific physiological
        effect.&quot; An example of instrumental drug use would
        be to take an aspirin for a headache, a cold preparation
        to relieve symptoms of sneezing and runny nose, or the
        addict taking opiates to relieve withdrawal symptoms.
        &quot;Appreciative&quot; use of drugs is &quot;done to
        conform to socio-cultural expectations in particular
        situations where shared norms and values encourage
        it&quot;; it is expected that a person have a drink
        containing alcohol at a cocktail party. </li>
    <li>&quot;Continued heavy use of opiates will almost always
        acquire an instrumental aspect when physiological
        dependence occurs and the users discover that opiates
        relieve withdrawal symptoms; this instrumental aspect is
        superimposed on any appreciative basis for its use&quot;
        (Glaser, 1974, p. 41). In other words, no matter how a
        person starts using opiates--appreciatively, socializing
        with friends, or instrumentally, coping with pain,
        ultimately use always becomes instrumental in relieving
        withdrawal symptoms. </li>
    <li>&quot;The newer pattern of opiate use predominant in the
        United States since World War II is initially more
        appreciative than instrumental. It occurs mainly among
        youth in urban areas who have a background of
        delinquency, of other drug taking, and of failure or
        dissatisfaction in conventional educational and
        occupational pursuits. Minority group youth from poor
        families are over-represented in this newer pattern of
        opiate use&quot; (Glaser, 1974, p. 41). </li>
    <li>Government agencies use prohibition and regulation to
        control drug use. &quot;Prohibition is directed at
        suppressing all use of a drug, while regulation is
        concerned only with restricting the circumstances,
        procedures, and subjects of drug use&quot; (Glaser, 1974,
        p. 41-42). </li>
    <li>&quot;The 1914 Harrison Act of the United States and the
        1920 Dangerous Drug Act of Great Britain are very
        similar, both being based on a 1912 International
        Conference at the Hague to promote opiate regulation
        ....[but] the American system gradually became one of
        prohibition,...while the British system remained more
        limited to regulation. Since the post-World War II
        legislation, opiate use has become a far costlier problem
        for American society than it was prior to World War
        II&quot; (Glaser, 1974, p. 42). </li>
    <li>&quot;Regulation rather than prohibition prevails in most
        of Europe and many other parts of the world. A salient
        advantage of regulation is that it permits files of
        police and health authorities to be much more complete
        and current on the number and characteristics of drug
        users than files where prohibition prevails and drug
        users are motivated to keep their drug use hidden from
        authorities. Further consequences of a prohibition rather
        than a regulation approach to drug control become evident
        when one examines how problems of policing depend upon
        the behavior to be policed&quot; (Glaser, 1974, p. 43). </li>
    <li>&quot;<i>Prohibition of drugs in great demand is feasible
        only in a tightly regulated society or in an isolated
        community; it has never closed more than a minute
        percentage of the actual or potential channels of supply
        for any profitable illegal drug market in America&quot;</i>
        (Glaser, 1974, p. 44). </li>
    <li>&quot;An acute shortage of opiates for addicts developed
        in the United States during World War II because
        shipments from opium-producing countries were cut off or
        impaired by enemy military actions....Since money was
        plentiful and addicts were desperate, the price they
        would pay for illegal opiates increased, and the
        tremendous profits in narcotics selling attracted
        professional criminals (Glaser, 1974, p. 46). </li>
    <li>&quot;The entrance of organized crime into large-scale
        narcotic trafficking after World War II more than met the
        demand of the older instrumental addict; these
        organizations also developed a new and greater market of
        appreciative users in the drug peddlers' home
        neighborhoods, the slums&quot; (Glaser, 1974, p. 46). </li>
    <li>Two direct relationships between drugs and crime are
        mentioned in Daniel Glaser's (1974, pp. 47-48). <u>Interlocking
        Dualities</u>: The first is &quot;the fact that
        prohibition laws make drug use or possession a crime in
        itself [and] that the chemical action of a drug on the
        human body causes a person to commit crimes. This is the
        'dope fiend' mythology widely promulgated by proponents
        of prohibition laws, notably those against alcohol,
        opiate, and marijuana. They allege that many assaults,
        robberies, and rapes result from users being 'crazed' by
        these drugs.&quot; </li>
    <li>&quot;...three indirect relationships of drug use to
        crime are all, in fact, effects of prohibition policies
        much more than of drug use itself: ...persons who are
        addicted but cannot afford the price of drugs will commit
        crimes to get money to pay for drugs [so] <i>the first of
        the distinctly prohibition-engendered types of crime is
        addiction-supporting professional property crime&quot; </i>(Glaser,
        1974, p. 49). The involvement of large-scale criminal
        organizations in the sale of illegal drugs is a second
        effect of prohibition....Because these criminal
        entrepreneurs operate outside the law in their drug
        transactions, they are not bound by business etiquette in
        their competition with each other, in their collection of
        debts, or in their non-drug investments. Terror,
        violence, extortion, bribery, or any other expedient
        strategy is relied upon by these criminals not only in
        the sale of illegal goods or services, but also in their
        investments in legitimate businesses of all types, from
        taverns to savings and loan associations. <i>The most
        serious impact of prohibition of drug use on crime
        probably is that which is most indirect--its consequences
        for the total administration of justice in a
        society&quot; </i>(Glaser, 1974, pp. 49-50) vis-a-vis
        erosion of the Bill of Rights, disrespect for the law in
        general, and shady enforcement policies. </li>
    <li>&quot;Social movements to enact <i>prohibition</i> laws
        have been promoted by 'moral entrepreneurs' when they
        regarded a drug as dangerous and promulgated an
        interpretation of its use as morally reprehensible
        (Becker, 1963). When that which is to be prohibited is
        used only by small or low-status segments of the
        population...passage of the legislation reflects a
        combination of the prohibitionists' exaggerated accounts
        of the harmful effects of these substances and the
        ignorance or indifference on this matter of the rest of
        the population. Under these circumstances legislators
        have a highly vocal group against them if they oppose
        prohibition, but there is little objection if they
        support it, so they vote for drug prohibition as though
        they were voting for Motherhood, even when they have no
        direct awareness [of it] as a problem&quot; (Glaser,
        1974, p.51). THIS GOES DIRECTLY TO THE POLICY OF
        DISCRIMINATION OF POOR AND MINORITIES, THOSE WHO THE LAWS
        DEFILE. A PERSON WITH CLOUT IS ABLE TO DETOUR THE
        CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND OBTAIN HIS/HER <i>medicine </i>THROUGH
        PROPER CHANNELS. E.G. MCCARTHY. </li>
    <li>Glaser (1974, p. 50) predicted that &quot;the ultimate
        form of control for all non-medical drugs in the United
        States will greatly resemble the present controls for
        alcohol.&quot; UNFORTUNATELY, IN SPITE OF THE
        OVERWHELMING ARGUMENTS FOR DECRIMINALIZATION, WE CONTINUE
        TO PLUNGE HEADLONG INTO MORE REPRESSIVE LAWS, FURTHER
        BASTARDIZATION OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS, AND THE FURTHERANCE
        OF THE MYTHOLOGY OF THE &amp;QUOT;DRUG FIEND&amp;QUOT;. </li>
    <li>&quot;Probably in the future drugs will be available to
        those who crave them sufficiently, with no risk of
        criminal prosecution if they use authorized procurement
        procedures and only fines or other lesser penalties for
        illegal use....[and] the dispensation of more dangerous
        drugs will doubtless be under medical supervision&quot;
        (Glaser, 1974, p. 51). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Drug addiction is a major contributor to our
        nation's crime problem....Since possessing illegal drugs
        is itself a crime, and since addicts have to possess
        drugs in order to be addicts, addiction increases the
        total amount of crime&quot; (Gould, 1974, p. 57). </li>
    <li>&quot;Of the seven 'serious' crimes included in the FBI
        Index of Crimes (manslaughter, rape, assault, robbery,
        burglary, larceny, and auto theft) Americans are most
        fearful of the first four, crimes against the person
        (President's Crime Commission, 1967a: 87-89). But with
        the exception of robbery, these are not the crimes that
        drug addicts are most likely to commit&quot; (Gould,
        1974, pp. 58-59). </li>
    <li>&quot;To explain the epidemic qualities of drug use, one
        could turn to the works of Erikson (1966) and Durkheim
        (1958) who argue that crime becomes epidemic in form
        during periods of extreme social stress. Indeed,
        according to these sociologists, it is through the
        resolution of these epidemics that societies realign
        their normative boundaries and reaffirm the validity of
        their normative order&quot; (Gould, 1974, p. 72). </li>
    <li>The call for stiffer punishment is the
        'classical-utilitarian' theory which was &quot;the
        prevailing theory at the time our nation was
        founded&quot; (Glaser, 1974, p. 71) but has &quot;little
        currency among modern criminologists.&quot; </li>
    <li>&quot;Positivist criminological theory is the hypothesis
        that people commit crime because of psychological,
        biological, or social factors in their present makeup or
        personal backgrounds....When crime has been on the
        increase, all positivist criminologists have been able to
        do is recommend treatment and rehabilitation&quot;
        (Gould, 1974, p. 71). </li>

    <li>&quot;Methadone maintenance-1 (MM-1) is the type of
        program currently being offered in a number of clinics
        imposing strict control. Urines are closely monitored and
        patients are confronted with evidence of illicit drug
        use. Take-home methadone is only permitted when there is
        continuing evidence of abstinence from heroin and other
        drugs, plus social stability. Patients are strongly urged
        to seek employment and are dismissed from the program for
        repeated drug use, alcoholism, irregular participation,
        and illegal behavior&quot; (McGlothlin &amp; Tabbush,
        1974, p. 87). </li>
    <li>&quot;A review of current methadone programs indicates
        that some 25 to 50 percent of the patients are indeed
        motivated by this aspect. They do want out of the
        addiction routine and are attracted by the normal rewards
        afforded by working, family, etc. They make minimum
        demands on the program staff, do not attempt to
        circumvent the treatment via substitution of other drugs,
        and often demonstrate a dramatic change in life
        style&quot; (McGlothlin &amp; Tabbush, 1974, pp. 89-90). </li>
    <li>&quot;It is useful to point out the logical fallacies
        resulting from society's ambivalence in dealing
        with...[addiction]. It is perhaps best reflected in the
        Supreme Court's decision to invalidate the crime of being
        an addict, but continue the felony penalty for possessing
        the necessary material for addiction (Robinson
        decision)&quot; (McGlothlin &amp; Tabbush, 1974, p. 117).

<ul>
    <li>&quot;It is increasingly recognized today that criteria
        other than abstinence--such as improvement in
        interpersonal relationships, changes in self-image,
        employment, better use of leisure time, reduction in drug
        use and criminality, and general movement towards
        conventional behavior must be applied to assess treatment
        success&quot; (Meiselas &amp; Brill, 1974, p. 173). </li>
    <li>&quot;What must be stressed...is that there are all kinds
        of drug abusers, involved in varying degrees with drugs.
        Some may be 'deviant' only in the area of involvement
        with drugs and conventional in all other respects; while
        others are totally submerged in all aspects of living as
        subsumed under the term 'street addict'&quot; (Meiselas
        &amp; Brill, 1974, p.175). </li>
    <li>&quot;The question of civil rights and liberties has
        figured prominently in discussions about civil commitment
        as a device for compelling treatment. Psychiatrists and
        doctors such as Szasz (1963, 1970) and Well (1970) and
        sociologists like Schur (1965) hold that society has no
        right to define and control private behavior and see drug
        use as a personal affair. The natural corollary of this
        position is that treatment may not be indicated at all;
        or, if it is, it must be voluntary and not imposed since
        it then becomes punitive and valueless&quot; (Meiselas
        &amp; Brill, 1974, p. 179). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Imagine, if you will, that the drug abuse crisis in
        our country was the result of a conspiracy. A conspiracy
        so vast in its scope as to boggle the mind of a James
        Bond. The purpose of this conspiracy would be, of course,
        to so confound and confuse the United States of America
        that she consistently and mindlessly would pursue a
        course of absolute idiocy. That she would steadfastly
        perform acts that were antagonistic to her best
        interests--that would alienate her people, destroy her
        health, ruin her morale. Imagine the minds of her
        legislators befuddled, the souls of her judges and
        policemen hardened and twisted in hatred, the intellects
        of her educators confused, and her citizenry reduced to
        the level of a frenzied mob. Conjure up the picture of
        evil alien rules rubbing together their hands in glee
        over the sight of the most powerful nation in the world
        destroying itself from within, like a scorpion
        dispatching itself with its own stinger. </li>
</ul>

<p>And then ask yourself--if the truth is not too
painful--whether any evil aliens or sinister plots could have
succeeded in impairing our national welfare as totally as we have
done through our frenzied efforts to react to a phenomenon that
we never really attempted to understand. Try and recall the
period in our history when people first began to realize that
drugs were going to be a white middle-class problem in the United
States, and consequently decided to do something about it. Look
back on all the legislation, all the drug education programs, all
the legal and illegal police activities, and yes, even all the
National Football League public service announcements on drug
abuse. Are we any closer now to what we wanted to accomplish back
in 1964 in terms of keeping drug abuse within 'acceptable'
limits? If we could be magically transported back to those
fateful years of the 1960s and be given a chance to do the whole
thing over again, and then if we deliberately attempted to <i>create</i>
the drug problem, could we, even with the benefit of hindsight,
be more successful at throwing our country into crisis? </p>

<p>It is time to face the fact that after several frantic,
heartbreaking years of reaction and overreaction to drug usage,
we have accomplished virtually nothing--nothing except the
exposure of our legal system as an inept, sometimes oppressive
and corrupt instrument for the enforcement of public and private
morality. We have not curbed drug abuse...we haven't even slowed
it. What we have done is to further alienate an entire generation
of our children, already alienated by the reality they perceive
around them. </p>

<p>...Had the Vietnam war ended in 1965 or 1966, would the
'passive' 1950s have erupted into the massive disruptions and
violence of the 1960s? If the nation had reacted to the shame of
watching an overtly racist social system enforce its values by
utilizing firehoses, clubs, guns, bayonets, and vicious dogs to
subdue non-violent school children, and committed itself on a
long-term basis to establishing real equality for blacks, would
our children have turned away from their television sets in fear
and disgust and taken to the streets? An finally, if we had
reacted with acceptance, or even paternalistic amusement to long
hair, bare feet, unorthodox dress, and the conception of a new
type of brotherhood for our country, instead of with disgust,
envy, hatred, fear and violence--if we had taken the flower that
was offered instead of slapping the bearers' hands away--could we
not have kept our children, instead of driving them away?&quot;
(Greenberg, 1974, pp. 183-184). </p>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Americans are a peculiar people. More than any
        other country in modern times they have avowed their
        dedication to the highest principles of freedom. They
        have written and enforced a constitution emulated the
        world over for its protection of the major freedoms of
        the common man from the government which he has set above
        him. On the other hand, Americans have tolerated almost
        without qualms, restrictions on their rights of personal
        privacy...&quot; (Greenberg, 1974, p. 189). </li>
    <li>&quot;Virtually all laws which attempt to influence
        private morality suffer from the same
        defect--[they]...are generally passed to protect everyone
        else but the people who write them. Just as prohibition
        was initiated largely by non-drinkers, laws against the
        use of drugs were passed by those who hadn't the least
        idea of what drug usage was like&quot; (Greenberg, 1974,
        p. 189). </li>
    <li>&quot;<i>Many of the persons responsible for setting the
        moral and legal tone for our nation do not want to know
        the truth!</i> The truth is irrelevant to their reality.
        What <i>is </i>relevant to their reality is that, for
        political considerations, they do not want to be on
        record as being a political leader who presided over the
        legalization of drug usage--not in this era of the
        ascendancy of the silent majority. And if we have to
        throw a few thousand of our children into jail to
        preserve the purity of our politicians' voting
        records...so be it.&quot; (Greenberg, 1974, pp. 189-190).
    </li>
    <li>&quot;It is clear...that the majority of the drug abuse
        efforts in the middle and late 1960s was politically
        inspired. By this I mean that the rationale behind the
        legislation was not the control of drug abuse, but the
        deliberate harassment and suppression of an emerging
        minority group felt to be politically dangerous and
        morally disruptive. No other rationale can explain the
        severity of the sentences mandated for crimes which were
        basically passive in nature and consensual on the part of
        the 'victims'. Nothing else can explain the failure on
        the part of lawmakers to distinguish between users and
        pushers, between addicts and those who could control
        their usage. An finally, no theory other than political
        suppression can account for the concentration of emphasis
        on the small-time user and pusher and the massive
        disinterest in pursuing the major illegal suppliers of
        narcotics and other dangerous substances&quot;
        (Greenberg, 1974, p. 190). </li>
    <li>&quot;Tragically, legislators actually believe, in many
        instances, that stiffer penalties deter the commission of
        crimes [as noted in] the study made by the California
        State Assembly Committee on Criminal Procedure, 'Crime
        and Penalties in California', which found no evidence
        that severe penalties effectively deter crime&quot;
        (Greenberg, 1974, p. 191). </li>
    <li>&quot;Ironically, many observers have come to the
        conclusion that the vigorous enforcement of laws relating
        to drug abuse have actually led to an increase in
        drug-related crimes. This is because an increase in the
        harassment of pushers drives the price of drugs up.
        Consequently, the addict, who must steal from five to ten
        dollars of merchandise for every one dollar of drugs he
        needs, is forced to turn a greater number of tricks in
        order to acquire an ample supply&quot; (Greenberg, 1974,
        p. 191). </li>
    <li>&quot;The rules of the game in relation to the passing of
        legislation relating to the imposition of penalties for
        drug abuse...have been relatively simple...and
        simplistic: First, act quickly, before there is time to
        study the situation. Second, don't let scientific
        evidence corrupt your point of view...rely on your gut
        reaction and the inflamed passions of your constituency.
        Third, don't hesitate to sacrifice someone else's child
        for the cause (you can always use your influence to get
        your own child off). And finally, start from the
        bottom--you offend less important people by doing
        so&quot; (Greenberg, 1974, p. 191). </li>
    <li>&quot;There is a great disparity of opinion as to whether
        a narc should be classified as a law officer or as a
        criminal....Perhaps the most charitable thing I can say
        about narcotics agents is that they are a necessary part
        of a failing system. They are a reflection of the depths
        to which we will sink in our efforts to control men's
        lives and morals&quot; (Greenberg, 1974, pp. 194-195). </li>
    <li>&quot;Society and the policeman share an almost classic
        sado-masochistic relationship. Often, however, it is
        difficult to determine which party is the sadist, and
        which the masochist&quot; (Greenberg, 1974, p. 198). </li>
    <li>&quot;A significant minority of police officers
        consistently, deliberately, and ruthlessly violate the
        rights of the citizens with which they deal, and violate
        the Constitution and laws they are sworn to uphold.
        Police, acting in the line of duty, may be responsible
        for more violations of the law per capita than any other
        group. Probably in no other area is the police officer as
        abusive of his authority as in the area of drug arrests.
        Because of the nature of society's response to the drug
        abuse crisis, the controls that would ordinarily be
        placed upon the policeman has been removed or ignored by
        his superiors and by the general public&quot; (Greenberg,
        1974, p. 198). </li>

<ul>
    <li>The &quot;heroin epidemic was particularly bothersome to
        the Nixon administration for at least two reasons: (1)
        there was concern that an increasing level of heroin use
        at home was linked directly to Vietnam, and (2) an
        increasing number of heroin addicts, with their presumed
        reliance on crime to support their habits, was
        antithetical to the administration's stated goal of
        reducing crime in the streets&quot; (Clayton, 1981,
        p.20). </li>
    <li>&quot;In an election year it was wise from a political
        standpoint to be fighting heroin addicts and their
        criminality while implementing a rehabilitative treatment
        system to help those who might have become addicted in
        Vietnam&quot; (Clayton, 1981, p. 20). </li>
    <li>&quot;American drug control policy is based on the
        assumptions that a two-pronged simultaneous attack on
        drug abuse via supply-reduction and demand-reduction
        strategies will affect drug use, crime, and the
        drug-crime connection. The policy makers at NIDA
        [National Institute on Drug Abuse] were upset that the
        efficacy of this policy was not affirmed in the Report.
        Therefore, <i>they</i>, the policy makers, decided not to
        publish the PANEL Report as a NIDA document (Clayton,
        1981, p. 23). </li>
    <li>Weissman explained why &quot;...NIDA chose not to publish
        the PANEL Report...[because] it questioned the basic
        assumptions on which American drug-control policies are
        based. The policies to which he refers are those of
        supply reduction and demand reduction that are
        articulated in the Federal Strategy Report&quot;
        (Clayton, 1981, p.24). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Most of the early investigators found little
        criminality before the onset of opiate addiction (Kolb,
        1925; Terry and Pellens, 1928; Pescor, 1943). Later
        studies, however, have shown a high probability of
        criminality preceding heroin addiction (Robins and
        Murphy, 1967; Jacoby et al., 1973; Chamber, 1974). Thus,
        Jacoby reports that 71 percent of heroin users in
        Philadelphia had a delinquency record prior to onset of
        their opiate use, compared to 35 percent of all boys in
        the same citywide age cohort who also had such
        records&quot; (Ball, Rosen, Flueck, Nurco, 1981, p. 40).
        OF COURSE, THE VERY ACT OF POSSESSING IS ILLEGAL. IS THIS
        CONSIDERED WHEN FIGURING THE LABEL OF DELINQUENCY? WE
        CREATED THE BLACK MARKET IN DRUGS WHICH PUTS THOSE WHO
        WERE ADDICTED MEDICALLY INTO THE POSITION OF HAVING TO
        DEAL WITH 'CRIMINALS', AND THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED SOME
        DEVIANT ACT ARE MORE LIKELY TO MEET UP WITH THOSE
        INVOLVED IN DRUGS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE DRUG-CRIMINALITY
        CONNECTION. WE HAVE CREATED MOST OF OUR OWN PROBLEMS RE:
        DRUGS, AND THE ONES WE DID NOT CREATE, WE COMPLICATED. </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;For street opiate users, economic goal attainment
        focuses on meeting the demands of daily existence rather
        than on any long-term career development. Survival
        presents a daily challenge that is dealt with in whatever
        fashion appears most appropriate under variable and often
        difficult circumstances&quot; (Goldstein, 1981, p. 67) </li>
    <li>&quot;The economic successes achieved by street opiate
        users tend to be discrete and transitory. Subjects in
        this study perceived and recounted these successes using
        the processual term, <i>getting over....</i>The notion of
        'getting over' is similar to that of 'getting by'. Both
        phrases are most often used to describe an economic state
        of affairs. However, while 'getting by' implies a static
        state, a mere holding of one's own, 'getting over'
        implies a dynamic process in which some sort of success
        is achieved. For example, an addict who sells a less
        experienced user a $5 bag of heroin for $10 say, 'I got
        over on him'....Getting over usually involves a degree of
        scheming or conning&quot; (Goldstein, 1981, p. 68). </li>
    <li>Goldstein (1981, p. 71) states, &quot;Most subjects in
        methadone maintenance treatment programs sold some of
        their dosage at least once during the month they were
        under study. Ten individuals out of 13 MMTP clients who
        were observed sold treatment dosages...&quot; HOWEVER,
        THIS SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT MOST METHADONE
        MAINTENANCE PATIENTS SELL THEIR DOSAGES. ADDICTS IN
        GOLDSTEIN'S (1981) STUDY WERE REPORTING TO A STOREFRONT
        IN EAST HARLEM WHICH WAS &amp;QUOT;KNOWN TO BE A CENTER
        OF OPIATE ACTIVITY&amp;QUOT;, AND THOSE ATTRACTED TO THE
        STOREFRONT WHICH WAS USED AS A
        &amp;QUOT;HANGOUT&amp;QUOT; BY MANY SUBJECTS MAY HAVE
        BEEN THOSE NOT ACTIVELY SEEKING
        &amp;QUOT;TREATMENT&amp;QUOT; AND COUNSELING. THEY WERE
        MOSTLY MALE (92%). FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROGRAM I AM IN
        UTILIZES RANDOM URINES TO DETERMINE EXTRACURRICULAR DRUG
        USE, AND SANCTIONS ARE IMPOSED FOR THIS--LOSS OF
        TAKEHOMES IS A MAJOR &amp;QUOT;PUNISHMENT&amp;QUOT; OR
        SANCTION FOR &amp;QUOT;IMPROPER&amp;QUOT; DRUG USE. THOSE
        OF US WHO ARE WORKING AND/OR GOING TO SCHOOL DON'T HAVE
        TIME TO GO INTO THE CLINIC EVERY DAY TO DOSE, AND WE ARE
        NOT INVOLVED WITH THE &amp;QUOT;CRIMINAL&amp;QUOT;

    <li>&quot;Cop men may simply pocket all the money and never
        return with the drugs&quot; (Goldstein, 1981, p. 73).
        THIS IS COMMONLY KNOWN AS
        &amp;QUOT;BACKDOORING&amp;QUOT;, AND COMES FROM THE FACT
        THAT A CUSTOMER WILL GIVE A &amp;QUOT;COP&amp;QUOT; MAN
        MONEY TO BUY DRUGS, AND THE &amp;QUOT;COP&amp;QUOT; GOES
        IN ONE DOOR WHERE THE CUSTOMER HAS DROPPED HIM OFF. THE
        &amp;QUOT;COP&amp;QUOT; GOES OUT A DIFFERENT DOOR WHERE
        SOMEONE IS WAITING TO PICK HIM/HER UP AND LEAVES THE
        CUSTOMER SITTING MINUS MONEY AND DRUGS. THIS HAPPENS
        FREQUENTLY WHEN A CUSTOMER GOES TO HIS REGULAR
        &amp;QUOT;COPPER&amp;QUOT;, BUT THE COPPER'S CONNECTIONS
        ARE OUT OF DRUGS, AND THE ADDICT IS DESPERATE FOR A
        &amp;QUOT;FIX&amp;QUOT;. THE ADDICT WILL THEN USE ALL HIS
        POWERS OF RATIONALIZATION TO &amp;QUOT;TRUST&amp;QUOT;
        THIS NEW COPPER BECAUSE S/HE IS SO DESPERATE FOR THAT

    <li>&quot;Beginning with the Harrison Act in 1914, however, a
        series of events occurred that linked addiction with
        crime. As the addict population became typified by
        lower-class black males, moral hostility increased and
        'the image of the addict changed from a sick to a
        contemptible deviant' (Conrad and Schneider, 1980:128).
        Addiction had become a social problem&quot; (Datesman,

        &quot;turning into a werewolf-like creature after
        inhaling marijuana smoke&quot; (McBride, 1981, p. 106). </li>
    <li>&quot;Whenever a drug user engages in violence, the media
        are apt to describe the incident in such a manner as to
        imply the continued existence and danger of drug
        fiends&quot; (McBride, 1981, p. 106). </li>
    <li>In the early 1900s, &quot;the Federal Bureau of Narcotics
        was very active in describing the drug addict as behaving
        in a bizarre, unpredictable, often violent manner. The
        pre-World War II popular media influenced by the Bureau
        of Narcotics portrayed drug users quite literally as
        monsters and fiends&quot; (McBride, 1981, p. 105). </li>
    <li>&quot;It is suggested that any attempt to understand the
        relationship between drugs and crime must include a focus
        on the daily life and interaction of the
        user--particularly within the context of the drug
        deal--not just on the activities undertaken to obtain the
        money for drugs&quot; (McBride, 1981, p. 120). </li>

        PROHIBITION, MAKING IT ILLEGAL TO USE ALCOHOL, IT IS NO
        LONGER ILLEGAL TO USE OR POSSESS IT. WE DO, HOWEVER,
        DELEGATE RESPONSIBLITY TO THE USER FOR ANY CRIMES S/HE
        MAY COMMIT UNDER ITS INFLUENCE. NOT SO WITH CERTAIN
        DRUGS; WE DON'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE USER WILL DO, BUT
        THE VERY ACT OF POSSESSION OR USE IS A CRIME IN ITSELF.

    <li>Thomas Sowell (1989, October 2) stated &quot;...there is
        nothing so bad that politics cannot make it worse. Drug
        gang violence is not due to the chemical nature of drugs
        but to the illegality of drugs, which is what makes them
        costly and profitable. Ending Prohibition did not stop
        alcoholics from destroying their lives, but it did
        put...bootleggers out of business.&quot; </li>
    <li>&quot;Hard core cocaine addicts are increasing but they
        are still less than one-half of one percent of the
        American population. Are the other 99 percent of the
        people to see their country and its institutions and
        civil liberties jeopardized to try to keep one small
        group from destroying itself?&quot; (Sowell, 1989,

    <li>&quot;Like Vietnam, the war on drugs has been escalated
        with a contrived incident--the purchase of cocaine n
        Lafayette Park, across the street form (sic) the White
        House. Now it has come out that Lafayette Park is not a
        center for drug dealing after all, but that a drug dealer
        elsewhere was lured there for this transaction just so
        the president could go public with the cocaine purchased
        across the street&quot; (Sowell, 1989, October 2). </li>

<ul>
    <li>In Principles of Legislation (1802), by Jeremy Bentham
        (1990, p. 85), he deals with the law and his
        interpretation of political good and evil on the
        following basis: </li>
</ul>

<p>It is with government, as with medicine. They have both but a
choice of evils. Every law is an evil, for every law is an
infraction of liberty: And I repeat that government has but a
choice of evils: In making this choice, what ought to be the
object of the legislator? He ought to assure himself of two
things; 1st, that in every case, the incidents which he tries to
prevent are really evils; and 2ndly, that if evils, they are
greater than those which he employs to prevent them. There are
then two things to be regarded; the evil of the offense and the
evil of the law; the evil of the malady and the evil of the
remedy. </p>

<p>Eg: The operation was a success but the patient died. </p>

<ul>
    <li>General Rule: Leave to individuals the greatest possible
        latitude in every case where they can only injure
        themselves, for they are the best judges of their own
        interests. If they deceive themselves, the moment they
        perceive their error, it is to be presumed they will not
        persist. Do not suffer the power of the law to interfere,<b><i><u>
        unless to prevent their injuring each other</u></i></b>
        (emphasis mine). It is there that law is necessary; it is
        there that the application of punishment is truly useful,
        since the rigor shown toward one may ensure the safety of
        all...&quot; (Bentham, 1990, p.86). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;If our society ever becomes interested in actually
        managing 'the drug problem' instead of throwing an
        ideological temper tantrum, it will concentrate its
        efforts on the long-term process of designating
        community-based regulatory mechanisms, in the public and
        private sectors, to influence and moderate drug-taking
        behavior. It will fund research into these
        alternatives&quot; (Wisotsky, 1990, p. 213). </li>
    <li>&quot;The Reagan Administration sliced the prevention and
        treatment budget in half in order to funnel the money
        into law enforcement&quot; (Wisotsky, 1990, p.214). This
        is exactly the opposite of what should have been done. </li>
    <li>As Wisotsky states (1990, p. 214), The War on Drugs is so
        wrong, so ineffective, and so destructive that almost any
        alternative should be preferred by thinking people. It
        would be hard to do worse than the status quo.&quot; </li>
    <li>&quot;Experience in Oregon, California, and Maine
        following decriminalization of marijuana in the 1970's
        showed no significant percentage of new users or an
        increase in frequency of use&quot; (Wisotsky, 1990, p.
        215). </li>
    <li>&quot;The premises of the War on Drugs, in addition to
        being objectionable in principle, fail to offer any
        practical solution to the problem of drug abuse, which
        grows worse every year. The War on Drugs has no creative
        or constructive power whatever&quot; (Wisotsky, 1990, p.
        216). </li>
    <li>Wisotsky (1990, p. 216), concludes that &quot;the War on
        Drugs is beginning to collapse of its own weight.&quot;
        This would be wonderful if true; and if so, it better
        hurry. </li>
    <li>&quot;As the hegemonic, senior generation over age 45 or
        50 dies off, it will be replaced by one for whom the War
        on Drugs makes no cultural sense, quite apart from its
        operational failures and black market pathologies&quot;
        (Wisotsky, 1990, p. 218). AND WITH ALL THE SOCIAL
        PROBLEMS WE HAVE WAITING TO BE SOLVED, IT'S TOO BAD MONEY
        FROM TAXABLE, REGULATED DRUGS IS NOT BEING MADE
        AVAILABLE. IN FACT, ALL THE MONEY BEING PUMPED INTO LAW
        ENFORCEMENT IS TAKING AWAY FROM AND CAUSING MORE SOCIAL
        PROBLEMS. </li>
    <li>&quot;Many studies report that the more (accurate)
        information a person has about drugs, the less likely he
        is to regard them as dangerous&quot; (Wisotsky, 1990, p.
        219). </li>
    <li>&quot;The adoption of cocaine by the middle classes was
        evidently considered hot copy by the media, which
        reported on it incessantly and often sensationally&quot;
        (Wisotsky, 1990, p. 11). </li>
    <li>&quot;Viewing the entire cocaine industry as one
        corporation, it would rank seventh in sales among the
        Fortune 500&quot; (Wisotsky, 1990, p. 17). </li>
    <li>&quot;Another way of describing the rationalistic bias of
        this [objective] research method is to see it as
        anti-holistic, i.e., a captive of the Cartesian division
        between mind and body, analyzing the sum of the parts to
        learn about the whole without considering the interaction
        of the parts and possible synergistic effects. The bias
        against 'experiential' models of drug effects reflects a
        conceptual reductionism of human beings to mere
        components or parts (body or mind) reacting like machines
        to drug stimuli in standardized fashion&quot; (Wisotsky,
        1990, pp.19-20). </li>
    <li>&quot;The law thus neatly serves as prescription both for
        ignorance and for maintenance of the status quo&quot;
        (Wisotsky, 1990, p. 20). </li>

    <li>&quot;Perhaps because of our diversity as a people, it is
        difficult for us to find a stable basis for

    <li>&quot;The sacrificial principle of victimage (the

        have been caused by men determined to use coercion to
        stamp out a moral evil than by men intent on doing evil.'
        In my opinion, this is not just probable, it is quite

    <li>&quot;Quite frankly, it would have been impossible for a
        nonuser to have gained access to this group to gather the
        data presented here&quot; (Adler, 1993, p. 24). </li>
    <li>Many factors are involved in the pricing of illegal
        drugs: cost of the drug from the source; prevailing
        market price; location (logically, border towns provide a
        less expensive product since drugs are more plentiful
        there); risk of arrest associated with the number of
        borders crossed; how long the drugs have to be held
        before sale; distance of travel before sale; mode of
        transportation &quot;(especially if they have to transfer
        the drugs from one mode of transportation and/or storage
        to another)&quot;; credit considerations; quality
        (however, the quality of cocaine was &quot;fairly
        consistent [so] they thus let the dealers to whom they
        sold worry about testing and cutting the product&quot;;
        and situational conditions including &quot;need of
        money&quot; or personal relationships (Adler, 1993, pp.
        45-48). </li>
    <li>&quot;There were two basic forms of drug dealing:
        straight dealing and middling. Straight dealing involved
        purchasing drugs in one quantity and dividing them into
        smaller units to sell....[One type of midling involved
        selling the] drugs they purchased intact, without
        separating them into smaller units....The second type of
        midling was customer initiated. Dealers were often
        approached by people looking to buy a specific amount of
        drugs....[The dealer then] matched a source of supply
        with a cash purchaser,...boosted the price[,] and made
        money on the transfer&quot; Adler, 1993, pp. 49-53). </li>
    <li>&quot;In contrast to straight dealing, dealers who
        middled rarely adulterated the drug....'cause God forbid
        you have to give it back....A small quantity, however,
        was often removed for the middler's own personal
        consumption&quot; (Adler, 1993, p. 53). </li>
    <li>&quot;It's not really dealing--[midling] it's just
        putting together two connections, but the trick is to
        keep them apart so they don't know who each other are and
        they need you to complete the link&quot; (Adler, 1993, p.
        54). </li>
    <li>&quot;Money meant nothing to me. Like, if some guy gave
        me a $100 bill I'd go out and burn it or cut it in half
        for all I cared&quot; (Adler, 1993, p.86). MONEY MEANT
        NOTHING TO ME EITHER EXCEPT THAT I HAD TO HAVE IT TO GET
        MY DRUGS. I ONLY THOUGHT OF MONEY IN TERMS OF HOW MANY
        DILAUDIDS I COULD PURCHASE--OTHER THAN THAT, I DIDN'T
        CARE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. </li>
    <li>Describing the lows of freebasing, a user states,
        &quot;Lows? It's like when you can't get up to go to the
        bathroom and your mind goes by itself. When you're up
        pacing the floor--your mind, but your body's not. When
        you're so wired and exhausted and you just want to sleep
        but you can't . You lie there staring at the ceiling for
        about 14 hours straight. You're so fucked up you're
        embarrassed to go out of the house. Falling asleep in
        public bars&quot; (Adler, 1993, pp. 88-89). UNLIKE OPIATE
        ADDICTION, THERE IS DEBATE AS TO WHETHER COCAINE IS
        PHYSICALLY ADDICTING. THE LOWS FROM OPIATE ADDICTION
        INCLUDE DEFINITE PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES WHICH INCLUDE... </li>
    <li>Some &quot;children of the dealing crowd
        eventually...graduated to become 'tinydealers.' Moving
        into junior high and high school, 13- and 14-year-old
        dealers were capable of making large sums of money by
        selling ounces of marijuana and grams or half-grams of
        cocaine to their peers&quot; (Adler, 1993, p. 93). </li>
    <li>&quot;To make it in the drug world, dealers and smugglers
        had to generate trust and likability. The most important
        character trait in this regard was <i>integrity</i>.
        According to others, quality dealers were honest and fair
        in their business transactions, gave exact
        &quot;counts&quot; (full weight values), and made fairly
        accurate estimations of the quality of their
        product.&quot; (Adler, 1993, p. 100). </li>

        risky business. 'Let those who would use the political
        process to impose their preferences on the behavior of
        others be wary of the threat to their own liberties,' he
        writes. 'The liberties of some cannot readily be
        restricted without limiting the liberties of all&quot;
        (Scullum, 1991, p. 78). </li>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;In the 1930s, if a person accused of a crime could
        not afford to hire an attorney, he went to trial with no
        defense except his own efforts. It was not until 1942
        that the Supreme Court forced the states to appoint an
        attorney for an accused person, and then it was only for
        capital offenses. Twenty-one years later, in the famous
        case of <i>Gideon v. Wainwright</i>, the Supreme Court
        required the state to appoint an attorney to defend any
        indigent person accused of a felony&quot; (D'Amato, 1992,
        p. 49). </li>
    <li>&quot;By spring of 1968, &quot;resistance to the Vietnam
        War was so intense, so broad, and so angry that it had
        driven President Lyndon Johnson to announce that he would
        not run for reelection&quot; (D'Amato, 1992, p. 91). </li>
    <li>On April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr. was assasinated
        (D'Amato, 1992, p. 92). </li>
    <li>&quot;In Chicago [Martin Luther King, Jr.] recruited
        young men who were members of street gangs and converted
        their anger into energy for change. One of his early
        strategies was to appoint them marshals of the marches.
        It was their job to keep the peace. When glass bottles
        and bricks and rocks rained down from the rooftops at the
        marchers, the gang-members-turned-marshals caught them as
        a ballplayer would catch a pop fly, and then laid them
        gently on the ground&quot; (D'Amato, p. 73). </li>

Opposing viewpoints</u>, (pp. 30-37). San Diego: Greenhaven
Press, Inc. </p>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;We are starting to see how the gradual loss of the
        Self occurs in addiction, and how the addictive
        personality slowly gains more and more control. <i>The
        decrease in the Self causes an increase in the addictive
        personality.</i> </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there is an almost constant internal conflict
between the Self and the Addict. In this struggle, the Addict
wins. This is what is meant by &quot;loss of control.&quot; The
longer the struggle, the more control the addictive personality
gains and establishes. Each time the Self struggles against the
addiction, the Addict becomes stronger. To fight and struggle
against something that has more power than you drains your
energy. For each defeat there is some loss of self-esteem... </p>

<p>...In addiction, the Addict becomes the dominant personality. </p>

<p>People and family members often desperately ask themselves and
others, 'Why does he act like this? Doesn't he care about us
anymore?' The truth is that the Addict within doesn't care about
them. What it cares about is acting out, getting the mood change.
The Addict doesn't care about the Self either. A statement such
as, 'At least if you won't stop for me, stop for yourself!' falls
on deaf ears. The person who suffers from an addiction often asks
the same question long before anyone else: 'Why do I act this
way? Don't I care?' </p>

<p>It's often a great relief for people suffering from an
addiction to realize that they are not 'bad people', as they
believed, that their addictive personality is not all of them,
but only a part of them, having grown as a result of the
illness&quot; (Nakken, 1991, pp. 36-37).<br>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Cocaine came to be addictive among some inner-city
        users and among a very small percentage of middle-class
        users who tried the drug. </li>
</ul>

<p>Why didn't most of these people become cocaine addicts? The
answer is so simple that we are left wondering why scientists
can't figure it out: Most people have better things to do than to
become addicted to cocaine&quot; (Peele, 1991, p. 42). </p>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;A study of middle-class users of cocaine by the
        Addiction Research Foundation of Toronto found not only
        that most regular users do not become addicted, but also
        that most of those who develop a steady craving for
        cocaine eventually cut back or quit the drug on their
        own&quot; (Peele, 1991, p. 42). </li>
    <li>&quot;...we have reached a strange impasse in our
        civilization when we rely for information and moral
        guidance about habits on the most debilitated segments of
        our population--groups who attribute to addiction and
        drugs what are actually their personal problems. What,
        really, are we to learn from people who stand up and
        testify that they couldn't control their shopping spress,
        that they spent all their money and went bankrupt to get
        material possessions we were smart enough to resist, and
        that they now want us to forgive them and their
        debts?&quot; Who should we listen to regarding
        addiction--the moralists or the addict? (Peele, 1991, pp.
        42, 43). </li>

    <li>Toward the middle of the century, Harry Anslinger, the
        first Commissioner of the Bureau of Narcotics arranged
        for Senator McCarthy to have his narcotics supplied to
        him by a Washington pharmacy without the interference of
        narcotic officers (Oakley &amp; Ksir, 1987, p. 42).
        However, he was opposed to any treatment which supplied
        narcotics to addicts on the street and rigorously
        enforced laws against them. </li>
    <li>In the 1800's, drug use was thought of as
        &quot;laissez-faire&quot;. If a person wanted to use a
        substance and another wanted to sell it, what difference
        did it make? (Oakley, &amp; Ksir, 1987, p. 22). </li>

    <li>When one sees an article such as the one George Cantor
        (1989, October 2, p. 3B) wrote, one has to wonder who
        made him judge, jury, and moral superior. He states that
        most of those who drink are not doing it for the purpose
        of getting drunk, but those who take drugs are
        essentially moral degenerates because they take drugs to
        get high. He states, &quot;I know of no one who would
        argue that illegal drugs are harmless at any level of
        use&quot;. </li>

<ul>
    <li>However, in actuality &quot;...taking of narcotics
        results in no measurable organic damage&quot;, (Monson,
        1980, p. 51). </li>
    <li>&quot;The first two laws prohibiting opium smoking were
        passed in...1875 and 1876 in response to discrimination
        of the Chinese&quot; (Monson, 1980, p. 48) who were
        thought of as an inferior race. In 1910, legislation was
        requested regarding cocaine since it was
        &quot;...authoritatively stated that cocaine is often the
        direct incentive to the crime of rape by the Negroes of
        the South and other sections of the country&quot;
        (Monson, 1980, p. 48). </li>
    <li>In the 1920's, heroin was linked to &quot;promiscuous
        urban gangs [and] alcohol was associated with
        immigrants...&quot; (Monson, 1980, p. 48) who were not to
        be trusted. </li>
    <li>&quot;One hundred years ago the concept that the State
        could tell Americans what they could and could not ingest
        would have been ridiculed&quot; (Monson, 1980, p. 51). </li>
</ul>

<p>Hyde, M. O. (1990). <u>Drug wars</u>. New York: Walker and
Company. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Dr. Sydney Cohen, whose voice has been considered the
        most rational in an irrational world of drugs, writes in <u>Cocaine:
        The Bottom Line</u> that scare tactics are
        counterproductive and should be avoided...&quot; (Hyde,
        1990, p. 19). </li>
    <li>&quot;Officials in drug-producing and -processing
        countries are quick to point out that the tremendous
        demand for drugs in the United States drives the drug
        business&quot; (Hyde, 1990, pp. 90-91). </li>
    <li>&quot;Many of the dealers are shot, some by the police
        when they resist orders, some by drug dealers who are
        trying to protect their turf or intimidate
        competitors&quot; (Hyde, 1990, p. 26). </li>
    <li>&quot;Valerie...lives in a neighborhood where abandoned
        buildings house crack dealers, where vacant lots have
        become dumping grounds for trash, and where gun battles
        are common. When shooting is heard, she hides under her
        bed. More than a hundred people were killed in her
        neighborhood last year and most of the deaths were drug
        related. ....Valerie wishes the police would arrest the
        dealers on the corner, but if they do, other dealers will
        take their places&quot; (Hyde, 1990, p. 26). </li>
    <li>&quot;Some experts in the field of drug abuse note that
        the first laws aimed at controlling opiate use in the
        United States were aimed at controlling a racial minority
        that the public feared....Many news reporters blamed the
        'yellow devils,' the relatively small group of Chinese
        laborers, for the spreading addiction problem in America
        and especially for corrupting American youth.
        Emotionalism was rampant, and moral reform movements were
        common. Alcohol, opium, and other drugs were the targets
        of crusades that fought against the use of drugs that
        affect the mind&quot; (Hyde, 1990, p. 33). </li>
    <li>&quot;At first, heroin was considered benign and was used
        as a substitute for liquor. It was backed by the Bayer
        Company for a short time, before it was recognized as
        producing the same kind of addiction as morphine&quot;
        (Hyde, 1990, p. 33). </li>
    <li>&quot;Until more is learned, many doctors are willing to
        accept methadone as the best treatment in the war against
        heroin&quot; (Hyde, 1990, p. 40). </li>

<p>Berger, G. (1989). <u>Violence and drugs</u>. New York:
Franklin Watts. </p>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;In rapidly growing numbers, unskilled, poorly
        educated people in inner-city areas are finding drug
        dealing the most lucrative career option available to
        them. Many children enticed into the drug culture at an
        early age drop out of school and by their mid-teens enter
        the violent world of drug dealing and distribution&quot;
        (Berger, 1989, p. 34). </li>
    <li>&quot;Being a lookout is the entry-level position for
        nine- and ten-year-olds in the drug trade. It is the job
        of a lookout to warn dealers when police are in the area.
        For this, they can make ;up to $100 a day and be rewarded
        with a pair of fashionable sneakers, a bomber jacket, or
        a bicycle&quot; (Berger, 1989, p. 35). </li>
    <li>&quot;Being a runner is the next step up the ladder for
        ambitious young teenagers who want to succeed in the drug
        trade. The job can pay up to $300 a day. The runner
        transports the drugs to the dealers on the street. In the
        case of crack, the youngster takes the drug from the
        makeshift factories, where cocaine powder is cooked into
        rock-hard crack, to the dealers&quot; (Berger, 1989, p.
        36). </li>
    <li>&quot;Youngsters in the drug culture are often completely
        on their own. Family members may be living apart or may
        be dead....Seventy-two percent of the boys and girls in a
        correctional institute study said they had grown up
        without one or both parents&quot; (Berger, 1989, p. 37). </li>
    <li>&quot;As a source of income, dealing is especially
        attractive to low-income, disadvantaged youth. With few
        other possibilities for employment and troubling family
        situations, many embark on a career of drug dealing&quot;
        (Berger, 1989, p. 45). </li>

<p>Dear Clifford: </p>

<p>Of course I remember you... </p>

<p>I deeply regret that your mother is still in such excruciating
pain, and I can only hope you have a friendly doctor who will do
whatever is possible to control that pain. </p>

<p>I received much criticism (and some applause, however) for my
stand on legalizing drugs. </p>

<p>You may add my name to the list of those who are with you all
the way on H.R. 3100, the National-Drug Control Policy Act of
1993. </p>

<p>Please keep me informed, Clifford... and convey my very best
to your mother. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>OFFICE OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER </p>

<p>WASHINGTON, DC 20510-7020 </p>

<p>November 30, 1994 </p>

<p>Mr. Clifford A. Schaffer </p>

<p>P.O. Box 1430 </p>

<p>Canyon Country, California 91386-1430 </p>

<p>Dear Mr. Schaffer, </p>

<p>My apologies for the very long delay in responding to your
letter to my wife Elizabeth. Let me assure you, she passed along
your comments to me some time ago, so the tardiness is entirely
the fault of my office. </p>

<p>Having reviewed the text of your resolution, I can assure you
that I am not opposed to a legitimate review of our nation's drug
policies. There is no doubt that there are both medical and
social problems that must be addressed when discussing drug
abuse. I believe there is also a role for the criminal justice
system, but it should not overshadow the need to assist many
individuals. As you suggest, we need to find the truth to find
the right balance. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>BOB DOLE </p>

<p>Republican Leader <br>

<h2>The Drug Legalization Debate: What's the Real Issue? </h2>

<p><b>By Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p>This document attempts to define the real areas of agreement
and disagreement between those who support the war on drugs, and
those who do not. The statements I make below about the beliefs
of the respective sides are based on my personal experience with
talking and debating with literally thousands of people over the
last several years. While the opinions I give below will vary
from person to person, they hold true for the vast majority of
people I have encountered on each side. </p>

<hr>

<h3>Why I wrote this. </h3>

<p>Debates about drug policy can get to be pretty complicated
pretty quickly. Some of the reasons for this are obvious - drug
abuse is a problem with many causes and effects throughout
society. It would be perfectly easy to get involved in discussing
the details of one aspect of the drug problem and to lose sight
of the problem as a whole. </p>

<p>Also, I have noticed a consistent tendency among supporters of
the drug war to be confused about the real issues. For example,
they often tend to assume that anyone who supports drug policy
reform must be a drug user, or someone who favors or wants to
promote the use of drugs. This, of course, is not the case at
all. Many of the supporters of reform are people who have never
used illegal drugs and have no intention of using them. Or they
tend to ask things like &quot;Why do you want to make more crack
babies?&quot; The truth is that no one in their right mind wants
to see more crack babies and those who support reform do so
because they believe that better policies could reduce the number
of crack babies. </p>

<p>In this document I will attempt to summarize the various
facets of our approach to drug policy and define where there
seems to be agreement or disagreement between those who support
reform, and those who support the drug war. </p>

<h3>Is drug use immoral? </h3>

<p>Opinion varies on both sides, although drug war supporters are
clearly more likely to feel that drug use is intrinsically
immoral. But there are also people on the side of reform who have
essentially the same feelings about drug use. </p>

<p>That is, many supporters of reform (&quot;legalization&quot;)
do not approve of drug use or abuse in any way and even feel that
it is &quot;immoral&quot;. </p>

<h3>Are drugs dangerous? </h3>

<p>Both sides agree that drugs can be dangerous to some people.
Supporters of reform will point out that the legal drugs are more
dangerous than the illegal drugs, so the laws don't relate to
this argument anyway. </p>

<p>Supporters of the drug war seem to make the illogical leap
that because drugs are dangerous or immoral, therefore the best
approach to the problem is to throw people in prison. This, of
course, is illogical. There are lots of problems in society which
are either dangerous and/or immoral, but that doesn't mean that
prison is the best solution to all of them. </p>

<h3>Should we have more treatment? </h3>

<p>Both sides seem to agree that there should be more and better
drug treatment. </p>

<h3>Should we have more education? </h3>

<p>Both sides seem to agree that there should be more and better
education on drugs. </p>

<h3>Should we have better prevention efforts? </h3>

<p>Both sides seem to agree that we should have more and better
efforts to prevent people from becoming involved with drugs in
the first place. (As long as &quot;prevention&quot; does not
include criminal punishment.) </p>

<h3>What about the medical uses? </h3>

<p>For recognized medicines, such as morphine, both sides agree
that doctors should be free to prescribe it where necessary. The
supporters of the drug war generally don't seem to recognize or
understand why it is not being prescribed where necessary. </p>

<p>For marijuana, the supporters of the drug war are of mixed
opinion. Some support the medical use of marijuana, or at least
see the futility in persecuting people who are sick, even if it
wasn't good for them. Others, the more extreme drug warriors,
maintain that marijuana has no medical uses at all, or that other
drugs would do better. </p>

<h3>Criminal Punishment </h3>

<p>This is the only area where there is clear and consistent
disagreement between the two sides. </p>

<p>Supporters of the drug war tend to feel that some drugs ought
to be illegal (people ought to be put in jail), in order to
discourage use, or to express society's disapproval. </p>

<p>Supporters of reform say that criminal penalties for private
drug possession and use are senseless and destructive. </p>

<h2>Dispatch From the Drug War</h2>

<p>by Peter H. King</p>

<p>Here's how it works in the never-ending War on Drugs: In
August a federal<br>
agency reports that 32 of 4,500 teenagers surveyed respond that
they took<br>
heroin in 1995. The year before, the same survey had found 14
teenagers<br>
who copped to heroin usage. Other categories show upticks as
well, but the<br>
increase in teen heroin usage is what grabs the headlines.<br>
Now put aside, as the surveyors must, whether the teenagers were
telling<br>
the truth. Also disregard the warning from polling experts that
the size<br>
of the sample is statistically insignificant, that-as one told
the Wall<br>
Street Journal-&quot;we should be careful not to overinterpret
the findings or<br>
jump to policy conclusions.&quot;<br>
This is the War on Drugs, and patriotic Americans must follow the
example<br>
of their political leaders. They must suspend reality. Let the
numbers<br>
speak for themselves: Heroin use-no, the shorthand is better,
drug use-has<br>
&quot;doubled&quot; among American teenagers. This cannot be
tolerated. This<br>
demands action. In this case, action translates into a new Bob
Dole<br>
television commercial suggesting President Clinton is &quot; soft
on drugs.&quot;<br>
Clinton counters by hurling more tough words and weapons into the
war.<br>
On Tuesday, to provide just the latest example, the White House
announced<br>
it would give $112 million in materiel to Colombia, Peru and
other Latin<br>
American countries. For Mexico alone, the 18 additional teen
heroin users<br>
will translate into 53 UH- 1H helicopters. All this equipment,
states the<br>
White House, &quot;will assist our allies in stopping the flow of
drugs at the<br>
source, before they reach our shores.&quot;<br>
Can anyone out there spell &quot;hallucinate?&quot;<br>
We break now from this Drug War dispatch for a few words from the
home<br>
front. The speaker is James P. Gray, a conservative Superior
Court judge<br>
in conservative Orange County. For the past four years, Gray has
been<br>
engaged in a grass-roots effort to spark a national discussion
over a<br>
provocative alternative to the War on Drugs. Yes, brace yourself,
Gray is<br>
talking &quot;decriminalization.&quot;<br>
From the bench, he has seen the war's downside, the steady steam
of<br>
nickel-and-dime users and dealers who-to satisfy take-the-hill
political<br>
rhetoric-are treated as the worst of criminals rather than as
sick people. <br>
He has weighed the cost of the trials and incarceration as
compared to<br>
treatment. He has seen how hardened criminals must be released to
make<br>
cell space for the prisoners of the War on Drugs. He has seen the
&quot;utter<br>
hopelessness of what we are doing: spending hundreds of millions
of dollars<br>
in an effort that accomplishes virtually nothing.&quot;<br>
Gray speaks frequently on the issue,' and he always begins by
testing the<br>
audience: &quot;The first question out of my mouth is, 'Who here
feels our<br>
country is in better shape today in regard to drug use and abuse
and all<br>
the crime and misery that goes with it than it was five years
ago?' And<br>
nobody raises a hand. Ever.<br>
&quot;And so my follow-up to that is this: 'OK. We all realize we
are not in<br>
better shape. We also have no legitimate expectation of being in
better<br>
shape next year than today-unless we change our approach.'
&quot;And that's when<br>
people start to listen.&quot;<br>
Simply getting people to listen is no small accomplishment for
advocates of<br>
decriminalization, so thoroughly has the politicians wartime
propaganda<br>
been pounded home. Gray must remind his audiences he is not for
drugs. <br>
Indeed, he, calls them &quot;garbage.&quot; What he is for is a
rethinking of the War<br>
on Drugs mentality &quot;We are willing to spend all this money
to put people in<br>
prison, but not on things that would do some good, namely
education, drug<br>
treatment and holding people accountable for their actions. The
War on<br>
<br>
Drugs increases street crime on the one, hand, and it takes away
sources<br>
for its prosecution on the other. Every dollar we spend on
undercover drug<br>
operations is a dollar we take away from going after murder,
rape,<br>
burglary, driving-under-the-influence and everything else.&quot;<br>
There also is collateral damage to consider. The war mode jacks
up the<br>
street value of narcotics, creating a drug economy that, absent
of<br>
alternatives, many people simply find too lucrative to resist. It
has<br>
created a whole stable of Capones, a line of profiteers that runs
from<br>
South Los Angeles to the Caribbean cocaine countries, while
corrupting<br>
narcotics officers from Los Angeles County to New York City.
Worse, has<br>
bloodied the streets of American cities-the trenches of the drug
war.<br>
It also has created a political environment where candidates dare
not<br>
mention decriminalization, inhalation or anything that might be
taken as<br>
backing away from the War on Drugs. In such a climate, the safest
course<br>
is to toss money down the rat hole and hide behind catchy
slogans.<br>
&quot;Just Don't Do It,&quot; chants Candidate Dole. Now that
ought to fix things,<br>
right?<br>

<h1>Why we should legalize drugs </h1>

<p><b>by Benson B. Roe, MD</b> </p>

<p><b>Benson Roe is Professor Emeritus and former Chair of
Cardiothoracic Surgery at the University of California at San
Francisco.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>And &quot;poison&quot; is also a misleading shibboleth. The
widespread propaganda that illegal drugs are &quot;deadly
poisons&quot; is a hoax. There is little or no medical evidence
of long term ill effects from sustained, moderate consumption of
uncontaminated marijuana, cocaine or heroin. If these substances
- most of them have been consumed in large quantities for
centuries - were responsible for any chronic, progressive or
disabling diseases, they certainly would have shown up in
clinical practice and/or on the autopsy table. But they simply
have not!</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>More than 20 years ago when I was removing destroyed heart
valves from infected intravenous drug abusers I assumed that
these seriously ill patients represented just the tip of the
iceberg of narcotic abuse. In an effort to ascertain what
proportion of serious or fatal drug-related disease this group
represented, I sought information from the San Francisco Coroner.
To my surprise he reported that infections from contaminated
intravenous injections were the only cause of drug-related deaths
he saw except for occasional deaths from overdoses. He confirmed
the inference that clean, reasonable dosages of heroin, cocaine
and marijuana are pathologically harmless. He asserted he had
never seen a heroin user over the age of 50. My obvious
conclusion was that they had died from their. habit but he was
confident that they had simply tired of the drug and just quit.
When asked if the same were basically true of marijuana and
cocaine, he responded affirmatively. That caused me to wonder why
these substances had been made illegal. </p>

<p>It is frequently stated that illicit drugs are &quot;bad,
dangerous, destructive&quot; or &quot;addictive,&quot; and that
society has an obligation to keep them from the public. But
nowhere can be found reliable, objective scientific evidence that
they are any more harmful than other substances and activities
that are legal. In view of the enormous expense, the carnage and
the obvious futility of the &quot;drug war,&quot; resulting in
massive criminalization of society, it is high time to examine
the supposed justification for keeping certain substances
illegal. Those who initiated those prohibitions and those who now
so vigorously seek to enforce them have not made their objectives
clear. Are they to protect us from evil, from addiction, or from
poison? </p>

<p>The concept of evil is derived from subjective values and is
difficult to define. just why certain (illegal) substances are
singularly more evil than legal substances like alcohol has not
been explained. This complex subject of &quot;right&quot; and
&quot;wrong&quot; has never been successfully addressed by
legislation and is best left to the pulpit. </p>

<p>Addiction is also a relative and ubiquitous phenomenon. It
certainly cannot be applied only to a short arbitrary list of
addictive substances while ignoring. a plethora of human cravings
- from chocolate to coffee, from gum to gambling, from tea, to
tobacco, from snuggling to sex. Compulsive urges to fulfill a
perceived need are ubiquitous. Some people are more susceptible
to addiction than others and some &quot;needs&quot; are more
addictive than others. Probably the most addictive substance in
our civilization is tobacco - yet no one has suggested making it
illegal. </p>

<p>As for prohibition, it has been clearly demonstrated that when
an addictive desire becomes inaccessible it provokes
irresponsible behavior to fulfill that desire. Education and
support at least have a chance of controlling addiction.
Deprivation only sharpens the craving and never works. Even in
prison addicts are able to get their `fix.' </p>

<p>And &quot;poison&quot; is also a misleading shibboleth. The
widespread propaganda that illegal drugs are &quot;deadly
poisons&quot; is a hoax. There is little or no medical evidence
of long term ill effects from sustained, moderate consumption of
uncontaminated marijuana, cocaine or heroin. If these substances
- most of them have been consumed in large quantities for
centuries - were responsible for any chronic, progressive or
disabling diseases, they certainly would have shown up in
clinical practice and/or on the autopsy table. But they simply
have not! </p>

<p>Media focus on the &quot;junkie&quot; has generated a mistaken
impression that all uses of illegal drugs are devastated by their
habit. Simple arithmetic demonstrates that the small population
of visible addicts must constitute only a fraction of the $150
billion per year illegal drug market. This industry is so huge
that it necessarily encompasses a very large portion of the
ordinary population who are typically employed, productive,
responsible and not significantly impaired from leading
conventional lives. These drug users are not &quot;addicts&quot;
just as the vast majority of alcohol users are not
&quot;alcoholics.&quot; </p>

<p>Is it not a ridiculous paradox to have laws to protect us from
relatively harmless substances and not from the devastating
effects of other substances that happen to be legal? It is well
known that tobacco causes nearly a million deaths annually (in
the US alone) from cancer, cardiovascular disease and emphysema;
more than 350,000 die from alcohol-related cirrhosis and its
complications and caffeine is the cause of cardiac and nervous
system disturbances. These facts suggest that the rubric is being
fraudulently misled into fearing the wrong substances and into
complacency about hazardous substances by allowing their sale and
even subsidization. </p>

<p>Our environment contains a plethora of hazards, of which
recreational substances are much less important than many others.
Recognizing the reality of consumer demand and the perspective of
relative harm should make a strong case for alternatives to
prohibition. Should we not have teamed from the failure of the
Volstead Act of the 1920s and the current ubiquitous availability
of illegal drugs that prohibition is the height of futility? </p>

<p>Is it not time to recognize that the &quot; problem&quot; is
not the drugs but the enormous amounts of untaxed money diverted
from the economy to criminals? The economic incentive for drug
dealers to merchandise their product aggressively is a
multi-billion dollar return which has a far more powerful effect
to increase substance abuse than any enforcement program can
possibly do to, constrain that usage. The hopeless challenge of
drug crime is compounded by the parallel expansion of theft,
crime, which is the principal economic resource to finance the
drug industry. How can this be anything but a lose-lose situation
for society? </p>

<p>We should look at the fact that a relatively low budget public
education campaign has resulted in a significant decline in US
consumption of both alcohol and tobacco during a period when a
costly and intensive campaign to curtail illegal drugs only
resulted in their increased usage. Is there a lesson to be
heeded? </p>

<p>Of course there is. Scrap the nonsense of trying to obliterate
drugs and acknowledge their presence in our society as we have
with alcohol and tobacco. Legalization would result in: </p>

<ol>
    <li>purity assurance under Food and Drug Administration
        regulation; </li>
    <li>labeled concentration of the product (to avoid overdose);
    </li>
    <li>obliteration of vigorous marketing (&quot;pushers&quot;);
    </li>
    <li>obliteration of drug crime and reduction of theft crime </li>
    <li>savings in expensive enforcement and </li>
    <li>significant tax revenues. </li>
</ol>

<p>Effort and funds can then be directed to educating the public
about the hazards of all drugs. </p>

<p>Can such a change of attitude happen? Probably not, because
the huge illegal drug industry has mountains of money for a media
blitz and for buying politicians to sing the songs of
&quot;evil&quot; and &quot;danger&quot; which is certain to kill
any legislative attempt at legalization. Perhaps it will take
some time before reality can prevail, but meanwhile we should at
least do more to expose deception and to disseminate the truth. <br>

<h2>The Effects of Drug Legalization </h2>

<p>The following is an excerpt form &quot;Ain't Nobody's Business
If You Do&quot;, by Peter McWilliams. It is a discussion between
William F. Buckley, Jr. and Professor Gazzaniga (the Andrew W.
Thompson Jr. Professor of Psychiatry [Neuroscience] at Dartmouth
Medical School) which was originally published in the February 5,
1990, issue of the National Review. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Buckley:</b> It is said that the drug crack is
substantively different from its parent drug, cocaine, in that it
is, to use the term of Professor van den Haag,
&quot;crimogenic.&quot; In other words a certain (unspecified)
percentage of those who take crack are prompted to--well, to go
out and commit mayhem of some kind. Is that correct? </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> No, not in the way you put it. What you are
asking is: Is there something about how crack acts on the brain
that makes people who take it likelier to commit crime? </p>

<p>Let's begin by making it clear what crack is. It is simply
cocaine that has been mixed with baking soda, water, and then
boiled. What this procedure does is to permit cocaine to be
smoked. Now any drug ingested in that way-- i.e., absorbed by the
lungs--goes more efficiently to the brain, and the result is a
quicker, more intense experience. That is what crack gives the
consumer. But its impact on the brain is the same as with plain
cocaine and, as a matter of fact, amphetamines. No one has ever
maintained that these drugs are &quot;crimogenic.' </p>

<p>The only study I know about that inquires into the question of
crack breeding crime reports that most homicides involving crack
were the result NOT of the use of crack, but of dealer disputes.
Crack did not induce users to commit crimes. Do some crack users
commit crimes? Of course. After all, involvement in proscribed
drug traffic is dangerous. Moreover, people who commit crimes
tend to use drugs at a high rate, though which drug they prefer
varies from one year to the next. </p>

<p><b>Buckley:</b> You are telling us that an increase in the use
of crack would not mean an increase in crime? </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> I am saying that what increase there would
be in crime would not be simply the result of the pharmacology of
that drug. Look, let's say there are 200,000 users/abusers of
crack in New York City--a number that reflects one of the current
estimates. If so, and if the drug produced violent tendencies in
all crack users, the health-care system would have to come to a
screeching halt. It hasn't. In fact, in 1988 the hospitals in New
York City (the crack capital of the world) averaged only seven
crack- related admissions, city-wide, a day. The perception of
crack-based misbehavior is exaggerated because it is the cases
that show up in the emergency rooms that receive public notice,
and the whole picture begins to look very bleak. All of this is
to say: when considering any aspect of the drug problem, keep in
mind the matter of selection of evidence. </p>

<p>It is prudent to recall that, in the past, dangerous and
criminal behavior has been said to have been generated by other
drugs, for instance marijuana (you remember &quot;Reefer
Madness&quot;?). And bear it in mind that since cocaine is
available everywhere, so is crack available everywhere, since the
means of converting the one into the other are easy, and easily
learned. It is important to note that only a small percentage of
cocaine users actually convert their stuff to crack. Roughly one
in six. </p>

<p><b>Buckley:</b> Then would it follow that even if there were
an increase in the use of crack, the legalization of it would
actually result in a decrease in crime? </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> That is correct. </p>

<p><b>Buckley:</b> Isn't crack a drug whose addictive power
exceeds that of many other drugs? If that is the case, one
assumes that people who opt to take crack do so because it yields
the faster and more exhilarating satisfactions to which you make
reference. </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> That is certainly the current understanding,
but there are no solid data on the question. Current observations
are confounded by certain economic variables. Crack is cheap-- </p>

<p><b>Buckley:</b> Why? If cocaine is expensive, how can crack be
cheap? </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> Cocaine costs $1,000 per ounce if bought in
quantity. Once ounce can produce one thousand vials of crack,
each of which sells for $5. The drug abuser is able to experience
more drug episodes. Crack being cheap, the next high can come a
lot more quickly and since there is a down to every up, or high,
the cycle can become intense. </p>

<p>So yes, crack is addictive. So is cocaine. So are
amphetamines. The special punch of crack, as the result of going
quickly via the lungs to the brain, may prompt some abusers to
want more. By the way, it is the public knowledge that crack acts
in this way that, as several studies document, causes most
regular cocaine users to be cautious about crack. The casual-
to-moderate user very clearly wants to stay in that category. So,
all you can say is that there is a *perception*, widely shared,
that crack is more addictive. Whether it is, isn't really known.
One thing we do know is that crack does not begin to approach
tobacco as a nationwide health hazard. For every crack-related
death, there are three-hundred tobacco-related deaths. Another
example of hyperbole is the recent claim that there were 375,000
&quot;crack babies&quot; born last year; how could that possibly
be, when the government (the National Institutes on Drug Abuse)
informs us that there were only 500,000 crack &quot;users&quot;
last year? Exaggeration and misinformation run rampant on this
subject. </p>

<p><b>Buckley:</b> Well, if crack were legally available
alongside cocaine and, say, marijuana, what would be the reason
for a consumer to take crack? </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> You need to keep your drug classifications
straight. if your goal were, pure and simple, to get high, you
might try crack or cocaine, or some amphetamine. You wouldn't go
for marijuana, which is a mild hallucinogen and tranquilizer. So,
if you wanted to be up and you didn't have much time, you might
go to crack. But then if it were absolutely established that
there was a higher addiction rate with crack, legalization could,
paradoxically, diminish its use. This is so because if cocaine
were reduced to the same price as crack, the abuser,
acknowledging the higher rate of addiction, might forgo the more
intensive high of crack, opting for the slower high of cocaine.
Crack was introduced years ago as offering an alluring new
psychoactive experience. But its special hold on the ghetto is
the result of its price. Remember that--on another front--we know
that 120- proof alcohol doesn't sell as readily as 86 proof, not
by a long shot, even though the higher the proof, the faster the
psychological effect that alcohol users are seeking. </p>

<p><b>Buckley:</b> Is there evidence that the current consumption
of drugs is restrained by their illegality? We have read that
ninety million Americans have experimented, at one time or
another, with illegal drugs. Would more than ninety million have
experimented with them if drugs had been legal? </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> I think illegality has little if anything to
do with drug consumption--and, incidentally, I am certain that
far more than ninety million Americans have at some point or
other experimented with an illegal drug. </p>

<p>This gets to the issue of actual availability. Drugs are
everywhere, simply everywhere. In terms of availability, drugs
might just as well be legal as illegal. Now it has been argued
that legalization will create a different social climate, a more
permissive, more indulgent climate. It is certainly conceivable,
primarily for that reason, that there would be greater initial
use--the result of curiosity. But the central point is that human
beings in all cultures tend to seek out means of altering their
mental state, and that although some will shop around and lose
the powers of self-discipline, most will settle down to a base
rate of use, and a much smaller rate of abuse, and those rates
are pretty much what we have in the U.S. right now. </p>

<p><b>Buckley:</b> Then the factor of illegality, in your
opinion, does not weigh heavily? But, we come to the critical
question, if ninety million (or more) Americans have experimented
with the use of drugs, why is drug abuse at such a (relatively)
low level? </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> If you exclude tobacco, in the whole nation
less than 10 per cent of the adult population &quot;abuses&quot;
drugs. That is, 9 to 12 million adult Americans abuse drugs. That
figure includes alcohol, by the way, and the figure remains
fairly constant. </p>

<p>Consider alcohol. In our culture alone, 70 to 80 percent of us
use alcohol, and the abuse rate is now estimated at 5 to 6 per
cent. We see at work here a major feature of the human response
to drug availability, namely, the inclination to moderation. Most
people are adjusted and are intent on living productive lives.
While most of us, pursuing that goal, enjoy the sensations of
euphoria, or anxiety reduction, or (at times) social dis-
inhibition or even anesthesia, we don't let the desire for these
sensations dominate our behavior. Alcohol fills these needs for
many people and its use is managed intelligently. </p>

<p>It is worth nothing that the largest proportion of this drug
is sold to the social drinker, not the drunk, just as most
cocaine is sold to the casual user, not the addict. Now, early
exposure to alcohol is common and inevitable, and youthful
drinking can be extreme. Yet studies have shown that it is
difficult to determine which drunk at the college party will
evolve into a serious alcoholic. What is shown is that the vast
majority of early drinkers stop excessive drinking all by
themselves. In fact, drug use of all types drops off radically
with age. </p>

<p><b>Buckley:</b> Wait a minute. Are you telling us that there
is only a 10 per cent chance that any user will become addicted
to a drug, having experimented with it? </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> The 10 per cent figure includes all drugs
except tobacco. The actual risk for abuse for some drugs is much
lower. Consider last year's national Household Survey (NHS) which
was carried out by the National Institutes on Drug Abuse. </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> It is estimated that some 21 million people
tried cocaine in 1988. But according to the NHS only three
million defined themselves as having used the drug at least once
during each month preceding their interview. Most of the three
million were casual users. Now think about it. All the cocaine
users make up 2 per cent of the adult population, and the addicts
make up less than one quarter of 1 per cent of the total popu-
lation. These are the government's own figures. Does that sound
like an epidemic to you? </p>

<p><b>Buckley:</b> But surely an epidemic has to do with the rate
at which an undesirable occurrence is increasing. How many more
cocaine users were there than the year before? Or the year before
that? </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> The real question is whether or not more and
more Americans are becoming addicted to something. Is the rate of
addiction to psycho- active substances going up? The answer to
that is a flat no. Are fads during which one drug becomes more
popular than another as the drug of abuse? Sure. But, when one
drug goes up in consumption, others go down. Heroin use is down,
and so is marijuana use. That is why the opiate and marijuana
pushers are trying to prove their purity--so they can grab back
some of their market share, which apparently they have done for
heroin in New York City. </p>

<p>But having said that, you should know that the actual use of
cocaine and all other illicit drugs is on the decline, according
to the NHS. The just- published National High School Survey
carried out by the University of Michigan reports that the same
is true among high-school students. Crack is used at such a low
rate throughout the country that its use can hardly be measured
in most areas. </p>

<p><b>Buckley:</b> Well, if low addiction rate is the rule, how
do we come to terms with the assertion, which has been made in
reputable circles, that over 40 per cent of Americans fighting in
Vietnam were using heroin and 80 per cent marijuana? </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> Stressful situations provoke a greater use
of drugs. Vietnam was one of them. But what happens when the
soldiers come home? That point was examined in a large study by
Dr. Lee Robbins at Washington University. During the Vietnam War,
President Nixon ordered a study on the returning vets who seemed
to have a drug problem. (Nixon didn't know what he was looking
for, but he was getting a lot of flak on the point that the was
producing a generation of drug addicts.) Dr. Robbins chose to
study those soldiers returning to the U.S. in 1971. Of the 13,760
Army enlisted men who returned and were included in her sample,
1,400 had a positive urine test for drugs (narcotics,
amphetamines, or barbiturates). She was able to re- test 495 men
from this sample a few months later. The results were crystal
clear: Only 8 per cent of the men who had been drug positive in
their first urine test remained so. In short, over 90 per cent of
them, now that they were back home, walked away from drug use.
And all of them knew how to get hold of drugs, if they had wanted
them. Incidentally, Dr. Robbins did a follow-up study a couple of
years later on the same soldiers. She reported that there had not
been an increase in drug use. </p>

<p><b>Buckley:</b> Aha! You are saying that under special
circumstances, the use of drugs increases. Well, granted there
was stress in Vietnam. Isn't there also stress in American
ghettos? </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> If you live in poverty and frustration, and
see few rewards available to you, you are likelier than your
better-satisfied counterpart to seek the escape of drugs,
although the higher rate of consumption does not result in a
higher rate of addiction. Virtually every study finds this to be
the case with one possibly interesting twist. A recent Department
of Defense study showed that drug use in the military was lower
for blacks than for whites, the reverse of civilian life. (It is
generally agreed that the military is the only institution in our
country that is successfully integrated.) In short, environmental
factors play an important role in the incidence of drug use. </p>

<p><b>Buckley:</b> So you are saying that there are social
circumstances that will raise the rate of consumption, but that
raising the rate of consumption doesn't in fact raise the rate of
addiction. In other words, if 50 per cent of the troops in
Vietnam had been using crack, this would not have affected the
rate at which, on returning to the U.S., they became addicted.
They would have kicked the habit on reaching home. </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> That's the idea. Drug consumption can go up
in a particular population, fueled by stress, but the rate of
addiction doesn't go up no matter what the degree of stress. Most
people can walk away from high drug use if their lives become
more normal. Of course, the stress of the ghetto isn't the only
situation that fuels high drug consumption. Plenty of affluent
people who for some reason or another do not find their lives
rewarding also escape into drugs. </p>

<p><b>Buckley:</b> If it is true, then, that only a small
percentage of those who take crack will end up addicted, and that
that is no different from the small percentage who, taking one
beer every Saturday night, will become alcoholics, what is the
correct way in which to describe the relative intensity of the
addictive element in a particular drug? </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> That is an interesting question and one that
can't satisfactorily be answered until much more research is
done. There are conundrums. Again, it is estimated that 21
million people tried cocaine in 1988. Yet, of those, only 3
million currently use it, and only a small per- centage are
addicted. As for crack, it is estimated that 2.5 million have
used it, while only a half million say they still do, and that
figure includes the addicted and the casual user. Some reports
claim that as many as one half of crack users are addicted. As I
have said, crack is cheap, and for that reason may be especially
attractive to the poor. That is a non- pharmacological,
non-biological factor, the weight of which we have not come to
any conclusions about. We don't even have reliable data to tell
us that crack creates a greater rate of addiction than, say,
cocaine. My own guess is it doesn't. Remember that the drug acts
on the same brain systems that cocaine and amphetamines do. </p>

<p><b>Buckley:</b> To what extent is the addictive factor
affected by education? Here is what I mean by this: Taking a
drug, say heroin or cocaine or crack- -or, for that matter,
alcohol--is a form of Russian roulette, using a ten- cartridge
revolver. Now, presumably, an educated person, concerned for his
livelihood, wouldn't take a revolver with nine empty cartridges
and one full cartridge, aim it at his head, and pull the trigger.
But granted, decisions of that kind are based on ratiocinative
skills. And we have to assume these skills don't exist even among
college students. If they did, there would be no drinking in
college, let alone drug taking. Comments? </p>

<p><b>Gazzaniga:</b> Most people perceive themselves as in
control of their destiny. They do not think the initial exposure
will ruin their lives, because of their perceived self-control,
and they are right. Take the most difficult case, tobacco--the
most highly addictive substance around. In a now classic study,
Stanley Schachter of Columbia University formally surveyed his
highly educated colleagues at Columbia. At the same time, he
polled the working residents of Amagansett, a community on Long
Island where he summered. He first determined who were ongoing
smokers, and who had been smokers. He took into account how long
they had smoked, what they had smoked, and all other variables he
could think of. </p>

<p>It wasn't long before the picture began to crystallize. Inform
a normally intelligent group of people about the tangible hazards
of using a particular substance and the vast majority of them
simply stop. It wasn't easy for some, but in general they
stopped, and they didn't need treatment programs, support
programs, and all the rest. Dr. Schachter concluded, after this
study, that it is only the thorny cases that show up at the
treatment centers, people who have developed a true addiction.
For those people, psychological prophylactics, including
education, are of little or no value. Yet it is these people that
are held up as examples of what happens when one uses drugs. This
is misleading. It creates an unworkable framework for thinking
about the problem. Most people can voluntarily stop using a
psychoactive substance, and those people who do continue to use
it can moderate their intake to reduce the possibility of health
hazards. This is true, as I say, for most substances, but I
repeat, less true for tobacco because of its distinctively
addictive nature. The people who unwisely continue to use tobacco
tend to smoke themselves into major illness even though they are
amply warned that this is likely to happen. <br>

<h2 align="center">PERSPECTIVE ON DRUGS</h2>

<h4 align="center">How Legalization Would Cut Crime<br>
</h4>

<p>The no-win 'drug war' keeps driving up the price.<br>
Users commit crimes to cover the cost.<br>
The public is the loser.<br>
By STEVEN B. DUKE</p>

<p><br>
The following article appeared Dec. 21, 1993 in the Los Angeles
Times and is reprinted with the permission of the author.<br>
<br>
In her assertion that legalizing drugs would markedly reduce
crime, Dr. Joycelyn Elders was clearly correct. Given the
enormity of the nation's crime problem, her suggestion that
legalization should be &quot;studied&quot; was also plainly
right. In asserting that the matter should not even be thought
about, the Administration behaved like religious rulers decrying
heresy. What should be embarrassing to an Administration elected
on a promise of &quot;change&quot; is not what its surgeon
general said, but her White House colleagues' contemptuous
dismissal of what she said.<br>
<br>
That drug prohibition is responsible for much of the crime in
this country is beyond dispute. In terms of crime rates, the most
serious mistake America ever made was to limit its repeal of
Prohibition to a single drug -- alcohol, the only drug that
commonly triggers violent propensities in its users. Had wefully
repealed drug prohibition in 1933, our crime rates today would be
no more than half what they now are.<br>
<br>
Property crime rates have tripled and violent crime rates have
doubled since President Richard M. Nixon created the Drug
Enforcement Agency in 1973 and declared an &quot;all-out global
war&quot;to end the &quot;drug menace.&quot; The connection is
not coincidental. </p>

<p>The more effective are law-enforcement efforts against drug
distribution, the more costly the drugs become to their
consumers. After a generation of escalating drug war efforts, the
costs of marijuana, cocaine and heroin are about 100 times what
they would be in a free market. The inevitable effect of jacking
up the cost of drugs is the commission of crime by drug users to
obtain money to buy drugs.<br>
<br>
In a recent survey of persons in prison for robbery or burglary,
one out of three said that they committed their crimes in order
to buy drugs. In a survey of adolescents, those who admitted
using cocaine, 1.3%, accounted for 49% of the admitted crimes. In
several studies of prisoners, 65% to 80% have admitted regular or
lifetime illicit drug use. About 75% of our robberies, thefts,
burglaries and related assaults are committed by drug abusers.
Numerous studies show that drug users commit far fewer crimes
when undergoing outpatient drug therapy or even when the price of
drugs drops.<br>
<br>
Creating incentives to steal and rob to buy drugs is not the only
crime-inducing effect of prohibition, perhaps not even the main
one. Murder and assault are employed to protect or acquire
drug-selling turf, to settle disputes among drug merchants and
their customers, to steal drugs or drug money from dealers. In
major cities, at least one-fourth of the killings are systemic to
the drug trade. The victims of internecine drug warfare are often
innocent bystanders, even infants and school-children.<br>
<br>
Drug prohibition also accounts for much of the proliferation of
handguns. Drug dealers must enforce their own contracts and
provide their own protection from predators, even
&quot;mules&quot; who<br>
deliver drugs need weapons. Packing a gun, like fancy clothing or
gold jewelry, has become a status symbol among many adolescents.
In such an atmosphere, other youngsters carry guns for--they
hope--protection. A decade ago, only 15% of teenagers who got
into serious trouble in New York City were carrying guns, now the
rate is 60%-65%.<br>
<br>
The drug trade and the crime and violence attached to it take
place mainly in our cities, rendering whole neighborhoods unfit
for human habitation. As the rot spreads, even more crime is
generated by the climate of disorder and ennui it produces.<br>
<br>
Drug prohibition also fosters crime by producing
officialcorruption. The news media are full of accounts of cops
caught stealing money or drugs from dealers or simply taking
money to look the other way. Even judges and prosecutors are
sometimes implicated. Such pervasive corruption denigrates and
demoralizes all law enforcers and causes disrespect for law among
citizens.<br>
<br>
The distractive effects of the drug war on law enforcement
indirectly but profoundly encourage crime. In many cities, half
or more of arrests are for drugs or related crimes, expending
police resources and energy that might otherwise be available for
domestic violence, fraud and other serious offenses. As a
consequence, all criminals have a much better chance of escaping
detection and punishment than if drugs were legal.<br>
<br>
The drug war also deeply undercuts the role of incarceration in
dealing with people convicted of such serious crimes as child
molesting, rape, kidnaping and homicide. There is no room in our
prisons: 40 states are under court orders for overcrowding. Funds
are not available to build prisons fast enough to provide the
needed space. Violent criminals are being paroled early or are
having their sentences chopped to make space for drug users and
dealers.<br>
<br>
The drug war (excluding treatment and preventive education
expenditures) costs about $9 billion at the federal level and
about twice that on the state and local levels. These estimates
do not count the law-enforcement cost chargeable to crimes that
are prohibition-caused but not technically drug-related
--probably another $15 billion at all levels of government. Thus,
law-enforcement costs attributable to the drug war are at least
$40 billion per year. The losses to crime victims in property
alone (not counting lives lost or bodies maimed) are probably
another $10 billion. In addition, the drug war imposes a premium
of at least $50 billion on the price of drugs and the cost to
drug consumers. The total annual costs of the drug war,
therefore, are about $100 billion. If drugs were legalized, most
of this money could be spent on long-term crime prevention.<br>
<br>
Legalizing drugs would not be cost free. We could expect somewhat
more use of presently illicit drugs and, all other things
remaining the same, more drug abuse. But things would not remain
the same. Vast sums would be freed for prevention and treatment
of drug abuse and for reducing its root causes. Among the many
other benefits of legalization would be the reduction of AIDS and
other diseases transmitted by drug abusers, less risk of drug
overdose or poisoning, better prenatal care for pregnant women
with drug problems and restoration of our civil liberties, to
name a few.<br>
<br>
How the law should treat the distribution and consumption of
psychoactive drugs is an issue on which reasonable people can
differ. There is, however, no room to doubt that legalizing such
drugs would greatly reduce our crime rates. Everyone familiar
with the crime problem knows that no bill pending in Congress and
no other anti-crime measure proposed by anyone has the slightest
chance of substantially reducing the ravages of crime.<br>
<br>
A society that regards crime as one of its greatest problems yet
allows its leaders to refuse to consider the only known solution,
deserves the leaders -- and crime -- it gets. </p>

<h2>DETHRONE THE DRUG CZAR </h2>

<p><b>by Whitman Knapp</b> </p>

<p><b>This is from the Sunday, May 9, New York Times OP-ED page.</b>
</p>

<p><b>Whitman Knapp is a Senior United States District Judge for
the</b> </p>

<p><b>Southern District of New York.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>The nation was fortunate in President Clinton's selection of
Lee Brown as Director of the Office of National Drug Control. </p>

<p>Having been police commissioner in Atlanta, Houston and New
York, Mr. Brown has been in key positions to observe that a
half-century of the Federal war against drugs has had a simple
result: Each year, the Government has spent more on enforcing
drug laws than it did the year before. Each year, more people
have gone to jail for drug offenses. </p>

<p>Yet each year there have been more drugs on the streets. </p>

<p>Surely, Mr. Brown can have no interest in simply spending more
money and filling more prisons. Indeed, he might well conclude
that his mission is to find out how to eliminate his new job. </p>

<p>Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate economist, has a simple
explanation of the upward spiral with which Mr. Brown must
contend. Law enforcement temporarily reduces the drug supply and
thus causes prices to rise. Higher prices draw new sources of
supply and even new drugs into the market, resulting in more
drugs on the street. The increased availability of drugs creates
more addicts. The Government reacts with more vigorous
enforcement, and the cycle starts anew. </p>

<p>Mr. Friedman and those who share his views propose a
straightforward way out of this discouraging spiral:
Decriminalize drugs, thus eliminating the pressure on supply that
creates an ever-bigger market. </p>

<p>This, they contend, will reduce demand and reverse the cycle,
much as a similar approach has cut into alcohol addiction. </p>

<p>I do not claim competence to evaluate this theory. But after
20 years on the bench, I have concluded that Federal drug laws
are a disaster. It is time to get the Government out of drug
enforcement. As long as we indulged the fantasy that the problem
could be solved by making America drug free, it was appropriate
that the Government assume the burden. But that ambition has been
shown to be absurd. </p>

<p>Attorney General Janet Reno's statement on Friday that she
hopes to refocus the drug war on treatment show's admirable
determination that the drug problem is primarily a local issue,
more properly the concern and responsibility of state and city
governments. </p>

<p>If the possession or distribution of drugs were no longer a
Federal crime, other levels of government would face the choice
of enforcement or trying out Milton Friedman's theory and
decriminalizing. If they chose the second route, they would have
to decide whether to license drug retailers, distribute drugs
through state agencies or perhaps allow drugs only to be
purchased with a physician's prescription. </p>

<p>The variety, complexity and importance of these questions make
it exceedingly clear that the Federal Government has no business
being involved in any of them. What might be a hopeful solution
in New York could be a disaster in Idaho, and only state
legislatures and city governments, not Congress, can pass laws
tailored to local needs. </p>

<p>What did the nation do when it decided to rid itself of the
catastrophes spawned by Prohibition? It adopted the 21st
Amendment, which excluded the Government from any role in
regulation of alcoholic beverages and strengthened the powers of
the states to deal with such matters. </p>

<p>That is precisely what the Congress should do with respect to
drugs. It should repeal all Federal laws that prohibit or
regulate their distribution or use and devise methods for helping
the states to exercise their respective powers in those areas. </p>

<p>But having created the problem by decades of ill-considered
legislation, congress can't just throw it back to the states
without helping finance the efforts. That raises a host of
complex problems, including apportionment of Federal monies among
the states, restrictions on how the monies may be used, the ratio
of Federal dollars for enforcement to those spent on treatment
and the role of nongovernmental organizations that treat addicts.
</p>

<p>Such problems will not lend themselves to easy resolution.
After all, Prohibition was allowed to wreak havoc for a mere 14
years, while the drug warriors have been at it for many decades.
Under Lee Brown's leadership, we may hope for a return to sanity.

<p>These three &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; appeared in the
May 24 NYT. </p>

<p>comments follow each one. </p>

<p>DECRIMINALIZATION WOULD JUST BOOST DRUG USE </p>

<p>To the Editor: </p>

<p>&quot;Dethrone the Drug Czar&quot; (Op-Ed May 9), in which
Whitman Knapp calls for decriminalizing drugs, proved poignant
for me. I read it soon after coming off an emergency room shift
where I saw two cocaine-induced abortions and got to resuscitate
a 15-year-old who suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage due to
cocaine use. &quot;Resuscitate&quot; may be too strong a word.
What I actually did was hook up a brain-dead boy to life support,
drill a hole in his head and try to comfort his hysterical mom
while I negotiated him into our last remaining intensive care
unit bed. </p>

<p>Judge Knapp doesn't seem to understand that the consumption of
illegal drugs, not the commerce surrounding them, causes most of
the drug-related misery and death. This tragedy is visited not
only upon the drug users, but also upon those who get in the way
of their fists, knives, guns and cars. Justice Department studies
have shown that a majority of violent crimes are committed by
people already intoxicated -- not by those seeking drugs. </p>

<p>Those who learn their history from historians, rather than
from old re-runs of the &quot;Untouchables&quot;,&quot; know that
Prohibition resulted in a major reduction in child abuse,
domestic violence, murders, disease and absenteeism. The
subsequent decriminalization of alcohol did not &quot;cut into
alcohol addiction&quot; -- it facilitated and encouraged it. </p>

<p>For many people and for society as a whole, alcohol and
illicit drugs are agents of disease. Decriminalizing illegal
drugs will remove yet another barrier to their consumption and
end up increasing their use. This may put the drug czar out of
business, but it's sure to keep me spending more of your health
care dollars for years to come. </p>

</p>

<p>MANY GOOD RESULTS </p>

<p>To the Editor: </p>

<p>We can no longer ignore calls like Judge Whitman Knapp's in
&quot;Dethrone the Drug Czar&quot; to decriminalize drugs. When
most of our jails are filled with drug-related convicted
criminals; when the criminal justice system is crippled by
drug-related cases; when drugs cost us billions of dollars in
police, judges, prosecutors and lawyers; when our streets,
schools, subways, parks, homes and we are not safe from
drug-related shootings, burglaries and muggings, our politicians
can at least debate decriminalization honestly. </p>

<p>What are we afraid of? That it would become too easy to obtain
drugs? How difficult is it now? Are we afraid that more
youngsters will use drugs? Do we really believe that the fear of
criminal punishment deters drug use? If so, where is the proof of
such deterrence? These questions should be debated. </p>

<p>If drugs were decriminalized and made available without the
fear of long-term jail terms for sellers and user,s it stands to
reason that prices would be reduced drastically. The drug user
who now steals, mugs and burglarizes to support his habit may not
commit such crimes if he could obtain the drugs at a lower price.
The billions of dollars now spent to enforce drug laws could be
spent to educate youngsters against the use of drugs and to treat
drug users. Decriminalizing drugs does not mean encouragement of
their use. </p>

<p>On the positive side, decriminalizing drugs could reduce
crime, unclog our judicial system and free billions of dollars
for other purposes, including drug treatment facilities. What is
the negative side of decriminalizing drugs? Can we afford more of
the same? </p>

<p>Third letter: </p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>

<p>CALI CARTEL'S THREAT </p>

<p>To the Editor: </p>

<p>Over the last few years we have lost our focus on illegal
drugs as a national security threat. Editorials increasingly
demand a United States counternarcotics policy that attempts to
solve the drug problem solely through domestic actions. Increased
resources for drug prevention and treatment can pay big
dividends, and should be pursued. </p>

<p>But we also need a focused foreign policy. The news that
Gilberto Rodriguez-Orjuela, the Cali cartel drug kingpin, ordered
the killing in New York City of Manuel de Dios Unanue to silence
his writings about the cartel (front page, May 11) should serve
as a wake-up call to all Americans that an isolationist
counternarcotics strategy would be a tragic mistake. </p>

<p>Although the Medellin cartel has been badly damaged, the
Colombian cocaine cartel headquartered in Cali is more powerful
than ever. Through corruption, intimidation and murder, it exerts
a powerful influence over Colombian Government institutions. Its
influence has spread. </p>

<p>In Bolivia, trafficking networks of native Colombians have
replaced native Bolivians, while in Guatemala Cali traffickers
have bought up ranches to use as staging locations for aerial
smuggling. Wherever they go, the curruption of democratic
institutions follows. And now the first murder by the Cali cartel
of an American journalist on American soil has been charged. </p>

<p>So long as the Cali cartel is allowed to flourish unchecked,
it will export death and violence to America. It has the most
effective clandestine distribution system in America for
contraband and weapons. When American weans itself away from
widespread cocaine addiction, the cartel will have shifted to
heroin. The cartel is financing a massive opium cultivation
program in Colombia that has in less than two years catapulted
Columbia to the world's No. 3 heroin producer. </p>

<p>A global drug cartel like Cali can only be weakened and
incapacitated by global-law enforcement action. If we leave these
global mafias for our children to deal with, it may be too late. </p>

<p>Testimony of New York State Corrections Commissioner Thomas A.
Coughlin, III: </p>

<p>&quot;Rockefeller Drug Laws -- 20 Years Later&quot; </p>

<p>Before a hearing convened by the Assembly Committee on Codes </p>

<p>Tuesday, June 8, 1993 </p>

<p>Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to appear before this panel
to formalize . . . for the record . . . my position on what has
become known as the Rockefeller drug laws. </p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, I was not the prison commissioner
when they were enacted. But this month, as I close in on 14 years
as Corrections Commissioner, I believe that I offer a unique
perspective on the subject before us today. </p>

<p>Because . . . more than anyone else in State government today.
. . I have seen the effects - both good and bad - of these laws.
I've seen them used to lock up the right people for very, very
long periods of time. But I have also seen them lock up the wrong
people. . . for the wrong reasons. </p>

<p>Let me summarize the impact of the Rockefeller drug laws. . .
upon the prison population . . . and why I think we desperately
need to modify our approach to the drug epidemic plaguing New
York State. </p>

<p>As of May 25, the prison house 64,000 inmates -- 2,000 of them
living in double bunks that were added as an emergency response
to a bed shortage. Because of fiscal constraints and policy
differences, no new prison construction has been authorized by
the Legislature for several years. Nevertheless, the prison
population continues to grow . . . as does the backlog of 1,700
offenders . . . waiting out in the counties, to be received into
the Department's custody. </p>

<p>If each of the 64,000 people actually belonged in prison, I
would have no problem in simply asking the legislature to pay
$100,000 each for all the new cells that I need. But that is not
the case. And we are putting untold pressures on prison employees
by crowding our prisons. And, quite frankly, we unnecessarily
invite trouble when crowding forces met to put more inmates out
on the streets. . . in work release . . . than I feel comfortable
with. </p>

<p>My position has long been that prison space is a finite
resource. We should be filling them with the people we built them
for -- the violent predator and repeat offenders. Not the guy who
got caught with a few bucks worth of crack. The time is long
overdue for the Legislature to recognize this distinction and
enact some basic reforms to our sentencing structure. </p>

<p>I firmly believe that drug addiction affecting the street
level addict can be far more successfully treated in community
settings, instead of the prison environment. It used to be that
offenders came to prison and got the high school diploma they
never earned on the outside. Now, street addicts are coming to
$100,000 prison cells that cost $27,000 a year to operate . . .
to get the same drug treatment that could be available at $5,000
to $10,000 per person on the street. </p>

<p>It would make far more sense -- logistically and economically
-- to provide initial diversion from the prison system to
community-based treatment provideers in the first instance for
the street level addict. Treatment, not punishment, should be our
first line of defense for non-violent addicts . . . in our
so-called war against drugs. We can't do that. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the punitive effect of the Rockefeller drug laws,
as well as the rigidity of the second felony offender laws, do
not deter, they do not lessen, nor do they cure drug addiction.
Instead, as far as prisons are being filled with low-level drug
offenders, more street level sellers and abusers appear to take
the place of those individuals who get caught up in the criminal
justice system. </p>

<p>Thus, as a simple matter of common sense, if not pure
economics, we are wasting valuable and limited prison space on
low-level, non-violent offenders. Space that could be more
appropriately utilized keeping violent felony offenders
incarcerated for longer periods of time. There is no question
that forcing drug offenders into the State prison system at the
current rate of incarceration detracts from our ability to
incarcerate violent offenders, which, in turn, only weakens our
overall ability to promote public protection. And the public
isn't fooled, just look ad the newspaper or watching the evening
news. </p>

<p>In the early eighties, drug offenders accounted for roughly 10
percent of all new court commitments to the Department. The
prison population was, instaed, dominated by those committing
violent felony offenses. </p>

<p>Since 1989, commitments for violent felonies and other
coercive crimes consistently totaled just under 40 percent of the
total number of new court commitments. But drug offenses
consistently comprised 45 percent of commitments. </p>

<p>If ought to be obvious, we are locking up people for their
addiction, at higher rates than for those who commit violence
against us. </p>

<p>Despite the obvious, there is a near insurmountable political
paralysis in relation to sentencing reform. Some of our elected
officials are so obsessed with the possibility of being labeled
soft on crime, that the sweep away all rational discussion of the
futility of our present approach. The end result is that we all
come up big losers -- the public at large, the taxpayer, and the
prison employees who labor all day in crowded prisons. </p>

<p>I am well aware of the fact that the public response to the
prevalence of crime is to treat all offenders with singularity of
purpose, regardless of crime. In effect, &quot;lock them up and
throw away the key.&quot; But that is the same public which voted
down the Prison Construction Bond Act in 1981. I believe that
common sense can prevail -- if we only take the time to
communicate to the general public . . . calmly and clearly . . .
what is really going on. </p>

<p>For example, if you explain to the public that the law
currently has the identical 8 to 25 year maximum sentencing
range, for a person who commits a forcible rape and for a person
who sells a dollar's worth of cocaine. . . I believe it would
tell you that our legal sense of priorities is totally out of
whack. Yet, that is exactly what the current law provides. </p>

<p>The identical treatment of these two offenses, which have such
a disproportionate impact upon their victims, borders on the
ridiculous. It is for this and other reasons that the Rockefeller
drug laws need to be reexamined and reevaluated in their
entirety. </p>

<p>In 1974, the year after the Rockefeller drug laws were
enacted, there was a total of 713 new prison commitments for drug
felonies. IN 1992, there were more than 11,000 drug felony
commitments. Cumulatively through 1992, nearly 75,000 individuals
have been committed under the Rockefeller drug laws. Yet, the
extremely punitive aspects of the Rockefeller drug laws do not
appear to have had any deterrent effect whatsoever on the drug
problem. </p>

<p>Because of widespread availability, the prices for both heroin
and cocaine have recently fallen, according to media reports.
Crack is reportedly sold for as low as 75 cents a hit. Heroin is
down to $5 a bag, with levels of purity higher than five years
ago. It appears there are so many dealers that they are cutting
prices to stay in business at all. So the Rockefeller drug laws
have lost any deterrent effect they might once have had. </p>

<p>But the impact of these laws upon the Department has been
staggering. A snapshot of the May 22, under-custody population
reveals the following statistics: </p>

<p>Out of a total under-custody population of nearly 64,000
inmates, 22,000 of them are doing time for drug offenses. </p>

<p>1,600 were convicted of a Class C, D, or E felony . . . which
means they could have been sentenced to local time or probation
instead of state prison. </p>

<p>2,000 of these inmates were convicted of Class B sale or
possession, while another 2,100 were convicted of an A-II drug
felony and 800 of an A-I drug felony. </p>

<p>But of 22,000 drug offenders, more that 15,000 are second
felony offenders -- which means there was no judicial discretion
to impose a sentence other than state prison. </p>

<p>I could bore you with numbers, but I won't. Suffice it to say
I have them. . . and am more than willing to share them with your
staffs at any time. But let me get to the heart of what these
numbers mean: </p>

<p>The totality of overall drug commitments has increased at an
astronomical rate and now significantly surpasses commitments for
violent felonies and other coercive crimes; </p>

<p>Convictions for the sale of drugs predominate, particularly
low-level predicate convictions, and </p>

<p>A sizable number of first felony offenders who could have
received alternative sentences instead received state prison
sentences. </p>

<p>That's where we are today. But the Rockefeller drug laws were
the product of another era. They were a straight-forward
representation of Legislative intent: Namely, that the severity
of the punishments involved would serve as a monumental deterrent
to drug trade participants and &quot;wannabe's&quot;. These
sanctions, it was thought, would keep the drug trade within
manageable proportions, by imposing nightmarish penalties upon
the drug lords who controlled the trade. </p>

<p>In their worst nightmares, the writers of that legislation
never envisioned cheap &quot;crack cocaine&quot;, and they never
conceived of a society where drug trafficking would occur in
private residences. . . with the family in the next room. They
could never have foreseen the level of violence that would occur
and the massive firepower that would be employed. In short, they
never imagined the drug trade as a cottage industry. . . where
tens of thousands of street addicts would finance their own
habits by becoming low-level drug dealers themselves. </p>

<p>Filling the state's prisons with those low-level drug
offenders has not diminished drug trafficking in the slightest
degree. In continuing to allow this scenario to play out, we are
squandering limited resources that could be more appropriately
utilized for violent felony offenders. At the same time,
resources for providing drug treatment services within the
community go under-funded . . . even while we know they could, in
some cases, be more effective than incarceration. </p>

<p>The Governor's Executive Budget for 1993-94 contained several
important proposals that would have amended either the
Rockefeller drug laws themselves, or their effect when combined
with the second felony offender law. For example, the current A-1
felony weights for possession and sale, which are set at four and
two ounces respectively, would have been increased to eight and
four ounces respectively. Since an A-1 felony conviction is
punishable by a minimum term ranging between 15 and 25 years,
such a change would have better aligned our drug laws with the
current nature of the drug trade. It would recognize the
difference between a dealer and an addict. </p>

<p>Another proposed change would have amended the second felony
offender law to grant discretion to the sentencing judge . . .
discretion to impose probation, local jail, an alternative
sentence. They could continue to impose the same incarceration,
or a shorter minimum term State prison sentence in the case of
Class C, D, and E nonviolent predicate felony offenders whose
predicate crime was also a nonviolent offense. </p>

<p>Regrettably, both houses of the Legislature agreed between
themselves to not even consider negotiating these changes. And
they have offered nothing in their place. Besides have rejected
the Governor's proposal, the Legislature is telling the public
that it has no coordinated approach to criminal justice. </p>

<p>It isn't enough to tell the public, &quot;We can prove we're
tough on crime because we won't enact alternatives.&quot; And it
is equally insufficient to say, &quot;We won't build any more
prisons.&quot; </p>

<p>Instead of repeating and echoing the courses that you won't
follow, the public is waiting to see in what direction you will
lead. The Governor has made proposals that deserve more than the
deafening silence of the Legislature. </p>

<p>This hearing today builds upon those Executive proposals, by
trying to focus public attention on the Rockefeller drug laws.
They may have been the right statutes for the 1970's, but we are
addressing the realities of the 1990's. </p>

<p>I believe those realities require as dramatic and intelligent
a change in our sentencing structures, as the Rockefeller drug
laws were in their era. For the public to have faith in the
criminal justice system, it must be seen as swift, as firm, and
as equitable. </p>

<p>When you have thousands of offenders waiting trail and
hundreds backed up in country jails, justice is not swift. </p>

<p>When the courts are so crowded with low-level cases that 95
percent of all cases are pleaded, justice is not firm. </p>

<p>And when the violent rapist gets the same sentence as the
seller of a buck's worth of drugs, justice is not equitable. </p>

<p>Reform of the Rockefeller drug laws is only one part of the
medicine needed to cure our criminal justice system. I look
forward to working with each of you to restoring the public's
slipping faith and skepticism about our criminal justice system. <br>

<p>The Libertarian Party asks: </p>

<p>SHOULD WE RE-LEGALIZE DRUGS? </p>

<p>* Should We Re-Legalize Drugs? </p>

<p>Libertarians, like most Americans, demand to be safe at home
and on the streets. Libertarians would like all Americans to be
healthy and free of drug dependence. But drug laws don't help,
they make things worse. </p>

<p>The professional politicians scramble to make names for
themselves as tough anti-drug warriors, while the experts agree
that the &quot;war on drugs&quot; has been lost, and could never
be won. The tragic victims of that war are your personal liberty
and its companion, responsibility. </p>

<p>It's time to consider the re-legalization of drugs. </p>

<p>* The Lessons of Prohibition </p>

<p>In the 1920's, alcohol was made illegal by Prohibition. The
result: Organized Crime. Criminals jumped at the chance to supply
the demand for liquor. The streets became battlegrounds. The
criminals bought off law enforcement and judges. Adulterated
booze blinded and killed people. Civil rights were trampled in
the hopeless attempt to keep people from drinking. </p>

<p>When the American people saw what Prohibition was doing to
them, they supported its repeal. When they succeeded, most states
legalized liquor and the criminal gangs were out of the liquor
business. Today's war on drugs is a re-run of Prohibition.
Approximately 40 million Americans are occasional, peaceful users
of some illegal drug who are no threat to anyone. They are not
going to stop. The laws don't, and can't, stop drug use. </p>

<p>* Organized Crime Profits </p>

<p>Whenever there is a great demand for a product and government
makes it illegal, a black market always appears to supply the
demand. The price of the product rises dramatically and the
opportunity for huge profits is obvious. The criminal gangs love
the situation, making millions. They kill other drug dealers,
along with innocent people caught in the crossfire, to protect
their territory. They corrupt police and courts. Pushers sell
adulterated dope and experimental drugs, causing injury and
death. And because drugs are illegal, their victims have no
recourse. </p>

<p>* Crime Increases </p>

<p>Half the cost of law enforcement and prisons is squandered on
drug related crime. Of all drug users, a relative few are addicts
who commit crimes daily to supply artificially expensive habits.
They are the robbers, car thieves and burglars who make our homes
and streets unsafe. </p>

<p>* An American Police State </p>

<p>Civil liberties suffer. We are all &quot;suspects&quot;,
subject to random urine tests, highway check points and spying
into our personal finances. Your property can be seized without
trial, if the police merely claim you got it with drug profits.
Doing business with cash makes you a suspect. America is becoming
a police state because of the war on drugs. </p>

<p>* America Can Handle Legal Drugs </p>

<p>Today's illegal drugs were legal before 1914. Cocaine was even
found in the original Coca-Cola recipe. Americans had few
problems with cocaine, opium, heroin or marijuana. Drugs were
inexpensive; crime was low. Most users handled their drug of
choice and lived normal, productive lives. Addicts out of control
were a tiny minority. </p>

<p>The first laws prohibiting drugs were racist in origin -- to
prevent Chinese laborers from using opium and to prevent blacks
and Hispanics from using cocaine and marijuana. That was unjust
and unfair, just as it is unjust and unfair to make criminals of
peaceful drug users today. </p>

<p>Some Americans will always use alcohol, tobacco, marijuana or
other drugs. Most are not addicts, they are social drinkers or
occasional users. Legal drugs would be inexpensive, so even
addicts could support their habits with honest work, rather than
by crime. Organized crime would be deprived of its profits. The
police could return to protecting us from real criminals; and
there would be room enough in existing prisons for them. </p>

<p>* Try Personal Responsibility </p>

<p>It's time to re-legalize drugs and let people take
responsibility for themselves. Drug abuse is a tragedy and a
sickness. Criminal laws only drive the problem underground and
put money in the pockets of the criminal class. With drugs legal,
compassionate people could do more to educate and rehabilitate
drug users who seek help. Drugs should be legal. Individuals have
the right to decide for themselves what to put in their bodies,
so long as they take responsibility for their actions. </p>

<p>From the Mayor of Baltimore, Kurt Schmoke, to conservative
writer and TV personality, William F. Buckley, Jr., leading
Americans are now calling for repeal of America's repressive and
ineffective drug laws. The Libertarian Party urges you to join in
this effort to make our streets safer and our liberties more
secure. </p>

<h1>WHY DO WE MAKE MAJOR PROBLEMS OUT OF MINOR DRUGS OF ABUSE? </h1>

<p><b>Frederick H. Meyers, M.D.</b> </p>

<p>Professor of Pharmacology </p>

<p>School of Medicine University of California, San Francisco, CA
94143 </p>

<p>Presented at the 7th International Conference on </p>

<p>MAKING CITIES LIVABLE </p>

<p>Carmel, CA March 1, 1990 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Note from Cliff Schaffer: </p>

<p>Dr. Meyers was the head of the Research Advisory Panel for the
state of California. In essence, he was the man picked by the
state of California to head up their long-term evaluation of the
drug problem. As such, he probably knows as much about the
subject as anyone on earth. I always find his comments
interesting and enlightening. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>What is your reaction to my appearance today? Possibly you are
thinking, &quot;Oh my God, here is another drug expert who has
imposed on his long association and, friendship with the Lennards
to get on the program at this prestigious meeting to intrude on <u>our</u>
interests. He is going to tell us how terrible <u>the</u> drug
problem is, how it is the factor making <u>all</u> neighborhoods
unlivable and how impossible it will be for us to improve the
livability of our cities until we eliminate drug use. The steps
to be taken will involve inflating his personal status and
providing more money for damaging treatment, irrelevant research,
dehumanizing enforcement or wherever else his entrenched interest
lies. And he will get everything wrong including failing to
recognize that the factors that depreciate the livability of our
cities also cause drug abuse and not the other way around. </p>

<p>Now actually that is what I think that your reaction <u>should</u>
be. If you agree, I might be well advised to simply stop<b>.</b> </p>

<p>However, you should, I believe, hear me further to protect
your plans for change. An hysterical, ineffectual &quot;War on
Drugs&quot;, which is what we are currently experiencing, will
absorb funds and energy, provide excuses for inaction and
deviousness and criminalize large groups within our society. Our
present ineffective course will not change until: </p>

<p>I ) The public is taught the difference between drug effects
and societal reaction to the presence of those drugs; the
difference between drug effects and the associated criminal
activity of the marketplace for an expensive, illegal commodity. </p>

<p>2) We consider that the unlivability of some of our
neighborhoods and the factors that have led to that unlivability
may be causes of drug abuse. The use of a given drug by a
specific route of administration (e.g., smoking crack) is not
uniformly distributed throughout our cities. </p>

<p>We do not have <u>a</u> drug problem. Different agents are
used and by different routes of administration. Different drugs
have differing inherent dangers and elicit different emotional
reactions from the citizenry. </p>

<p>Let's contrast two specific drugs, alcohol and heroin. </p>

<p>Alcohol, like all sedatives, gives a pharmacologic reward. It
relieves anxiety but also impairs judgment and psychomotor
performance and causes excitement. Alcohol as a direct drug
effect, that is because it is a disinhibitory agent, leads
directly to crime and antisocial behavior. Quantitatively, it is
by far the most important drug of abuse, being involved in half
of the homicides, half of the fatal auto accidents, etc. </p>

<p>Heroin, in contrast, is inherently not very dangerous. The
direct effect is to quiet the individual. Henry and I have long
enjoyed Baldwin's statement that for many years what kept the
peace in Harlem was Jesus and junk. You as citizens agree that
narcotics are not very dangerous by providing people with a daily
huge dose of methadone, a potent narcotic, as treatment for their
use of a potent narcotic, heroin. </p>

<p>However, the societal reaction to the two drugs is not
consistent with their danger. No one is ever more than a few
steps from a drink or a bottle, The U.S. briefly tried the
&quot;noble experiment&quot; of prohibition but abandoned it
because the criminal activity associated with illegal booze was
judged to be intolerable. </p>

<p>Yet our reaction to heroin use is to assign heavy penalties
for its mere possession and to harass and isolate the user. I
understand punishing an overt criminal act but do not understand
the moralizing that underlies the terribly vindictive attitude
toward heroin. Injecting heroin is fairly described as chemical
masturbation, not inherently a heinous act however distasteful. I
think that the citizenry is deliberately misinformed by people
with an interest in maintaining the size of the drug problem and
the current hysterical reaction. </p>

<p>Prohibition does not work; nothing we have done in the past 40
years has worked. It is time for the political and intellectual
leaders of this country to openly criticize our present efforts,
resist the current panic reaction by citizens and elected
officials and help us redirect our efforts toward our youth, our
economy and our cities. </p>

<p>There are some individuals and groups who plan to suggest
legislation to decriminalize (not legalize) some areas of drug
use. When you hear of the proposed legislation, I hope that you
listen to argument <u>pro</u> as well as <u>con</u>. </p>

<p>If we can cease destroying each other over quantitatively
unimportant drugs, we can close some prisons and get on with the
primary problems -- humanizing the urban environment and working
on the important public health problems presented by alcohol,
poverty and mental illness. </p>

<h1>Drug wars: Menace to America </h1>

<p><b>Tod Mikuriya, M.D.<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p>The escalating increasingly desperate authoritarian efforts to
stem the rising tide of lawlessness caused by drug prohibition
are held in check only by the limitations of shrinking budgets.
These measures have failed by any standards. </p>

<p>Worse, the side effects harm the community through the
overloading of the enforcement/corrections, social, and health
services resources. </p>

<p>Individuals and society are victimized directly and indirectly
by this harmful social policy. </p>

<p>At the core are ignorance and denial that afflict policy
makers at all levels of government and society. </p>

<p>Denial takes many forms... from the economic- the usual free
market mercantilists who fail to include these commodities in
their spreadsheets and ignore these market forces... to the
fundamentalist religious who shut out the facts with moralistic
homilies. Authoritarian public officials facilitate these
policies. </p>

<p>In this tricentennial of the Salem witch trials we are in the
grips of another attack of the &quot;American disease&quot;:
Prohibition. The War on Drugs. </p>

<p>This collective moralistic delusion is seemingly unique in
western civilization. Over a century ago America went through a
painful civil war on drugs that culminated in prohibition of
alcohol from 1919 to 1933. </p>

<p>The agitprop contemporary &quot;War on Drugs&quot; is even
nastier and more intrusive than Prohibition. Added evils include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>International piracy </li>
    <li>International kidnapping </li>
    <li>Mining of harbors </li>
    <li>Poisoning of forests with herbicides </li>
    <li>De stabilization of Columbia, Peru, Panama, and Nicaragua
    </li>
    <li>Funding anti-government terrorism </li>
    <li>Iran-Contra Scandal </li>
    <li>BCCI Scandal </li>
    <li>Punishment of the user </li>
    <li>Uropharmacomancy- divination of status and freedom by
        urine tests </li>
    <li>Confiscation of property- civil forfeiture criminal abuse
        of civil law </li>
    <li>Default vigilantism of neighbors forced into using small
        claims court </li>
    <li>Funding of police operations with proceeds from seized
        property </li>
    <li>Entrapment with police offering to buy drugs </li>
    <li>Entrapment with police offering to sell drugs </li>
    <li>Entrapment with police manufacturing drugs. </li>
    <li>Encouraging children to turn parents in to police for
        drug involvement </li>
    <li>Taking babies away from mothers who test positive for
        drugs </li>
    <li>No-knock entry and other civil rights attenuation </li>
    <li>Driver's license suspension for unrelated drug crimes </li>
    <li>Warrantless systematic searches on public transportation </li>
    <li>Mandatory minimum sentences derived from irrational
        formulae </li>
    <li>Overcrowding jails, prisons, and probation </li>
    <li>Surveillance of chemical and laboratory apparatus
        transactions </li>
    <li>Reporting of cash transactions over $9,999 </li>
    <li>Confiscation of growing lights </li>
    <li>Seizure of mailing lists from growing supplies stores </li>
    <li>Setting up growing supplies stores to solicit and entrap
        cannabis growers. </li>
    <li>Obtaining public utility records to target potential
        cannabis growers. </li>
    <li>Militarization at state and federal levels- &quot;Posse
        Comitatus&quot; </li>
    <li>Downgrading evidence requirements to &quot;good
        faith&quot; from probable cause. </li>
    <li>Depriving students of federal loans and grants.<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The corruption, violence, and divisive consequences appear to
be lessons that we have forgotten today as social policy mistakes
are repeated.. </p>

<p>The bribing of police, prosecutors, attorneys, and judges </p>

<p>Capitalization of crime by a black marketplace: drugs for
guns. </p>

<p>Subversion of International Law </p>

<p>Funding firearms for the young </p>

<p>Murder and mayhem facilitated </p>

<p>Materialism and alienation </p>

<p>Destruction of families </p>

<p>Abuse of children- robbed of childhood and trust<br>
</p>

<p>At the local level there is little more that can be done that
can be paid for by the public. Vigilante activities while
commendable in their initiative have great potential for abuse.
All pretext to due process and civil liberties are then
hopelessly abandoned to the mob. </p>

<p>Structural emblematic efforts like school uniforms, anti drug
rallies, and exhortations by public figures are feel good
exercises- Like inveighing against Satan. All the while we do
battle with the enemy- us. </p>

<p>The exercises in group think are not unlike the two minutes of
hate rallies depicted in Orwell's 1984. Unlike the centrally
controlled hermetic authoritarian state such efforts are
ineffectual. In the torrent of advertisements to self medicate
anti-drug appeals are ineffectual or ironically humorous. </p>

<p>The ignoring of the reasons and etiologies of the reasons for
the involvement in illicit drugs will delay the solving the
problems attached to a situation is bad and getting worse.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><b>Poisoning of the font of knowledge: </b></p>

<p align="center"><b>&quot;He who pays the piper calls the
tune&quot;<br>
</b></p>

<p>A significant component is the special interest control of
information. Until this problem is acknowledged and solved there
can be no progress. </p>

<p>A drug craving and drug dependent society is facilitated and
exploited by the drug industries. </p>

<p>Sales of over the counter and prescription drugs are
stimulated by intensive advertising campaigns that
&quot;educate&quot; the public starting at a young age. </p>

<p>Spuds MacKenzie and Joe Camel don't make it into the Partners
for a Drug Free America ads as scapegoats. </p>

<p>Most drug prevention education is ineffectual propaganda. </p>

<p>Send them a signal rather than tell the truth. </p>

<p>Beer advertisements encourage dangerous behavior. </p>

<p>Some wine advertisements do not depict wine as a foodstuff. </p>

<p>Over the counter drugs promotions set up a drug-craving
public. </p>

<p>No self-regulation skills are taught to children.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Solutions </h2>

<p>Development of legalized drugs available through non-profit
pharmacy-based drug users' cooperatives eliminates &quot;crack
houses&quot; or &quot;shooting galleries&quot;. Drug dealers
would disappear from the streets. Criminal enterprise zones are
obsolete. </p>

<p>Restoration of the infrastructure of sports, arts, and music
needs to be top priority. </p>

<p>Jobs and educational opportunity are required to fulfill
dreams instead of the need to distract from or suppress
frustrated, angry, and hopeless feelings. </p>

<p>Drug abusers are unhappy. They suffer from waking perpetual
nightmares of disempowerment. </p>

<p>It is high irony that the illicit free market has brought
money into the minority communities where the federal programs
have failed. It is blind stupidity to ignore the connection
between illicit drugs and guns. If drugs were legalized their
meaning are redefined from expensive forbidden fruit to
affordable commodity. Coca derivatives are then like the other
stimulant, caffeine. There would undoubtedly be some abusive use,
but of a more treatable nature. </p>

<p>The side effects of the imposition of the moralistic model of
the &quot;War on Drugs have been far worse than the drugs
themselves. This illicit mercantile enterprise creates nightmares
that primarily affects the poor. The failure of leaders at all
levels to address this economic reality must be blamed for this
growing social problem. </p>

<p>Treatment for drug abuse would be available upon demand if it
were supported by transaction fees from the sale of drugs. A
harmfulness tax (Grinspoon) or pricing structure commensurate
with potential toxicity would provide additional income for
treatment and abuse prevention. </p>

<p>Advertising of drugs rather than censored by government should
be from self-discipline by the industry. Removal of the exemption
from product liability laws for alcohol and tobacco would insure
self discipline in advertising. </p>

<p>Institutionalized or socialized use behavior will minimize
abusive use. The concept of the &quot;designated driver&quot; is
exemplary of the kind of custom that facilitates alcohol risk
management. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Foreign policy</b> </p>

<p>The economically irrational prohibitionist policy suborns the
Monroe Doctrine with the inadvertent empowerment of authoritarian
regimes that are hostile to the United States. Their hostility is
beyond economic control of the OAS or the World Bank since they
are now funded by the illicit drugs. Good-bye United Fruit. Hello
unnamed successors to Medellin and Cali cartels. </p>

<p>The Sendero Luminosa despite the capture of their leader and
the corrupt military in Peru has set back the emergence of
democracy. The Drug Enforcement Administration and their
&quot;advisors&quot; continue to aggravate the situation.
throughout Latin America. </p>

<p>Columbia continues to suffer terrorism and destruction of
their judiciary. the economy hammered by undercutting the coffee
market. </p>

<p>Panama escalates the money laundering and transshipment.
Business as usual even though president George Bush captured
General Manuel Noriega, former friend and CIA and Drug
Enforcement Administration employee. Operation &quot;Just
Cause&quot; perpetrated urban undevelopment and
&quot;installation&quot; (like a new motor in an old car) of a
&quot;new&quot; government. </p>

<p>The Iran-Contra guns for drugs scandal continues to attenuate
the legitimacy and efficacy in both foreign and domestic policy.
Besides the embargo and mining of the tiny poor country of
Nicaragua with illegal support of the guerrilla army, Lt. Colonel
Oliver North lied to Congress to support former president Ronald
Reagan and his vice president George Bush, commander designate of
the War Against Drugs. </p>

<p>Mexico continues to suffer U.S. raids and interference with
their government by the DEA. Border traffic continues to suffer
disruption and human rights abuses from the drug law enforcement.
</p>

<p>American drug prohibition dims the future of democracy in the
hemisphere. </p>

<p>America exports criminal mercantile opportunity. </p>

<p><b>Prohibitionism, the American Disease </b></p>

<p>American recurrent Prohibitionism is a peculiar majoritarian
auto immune social disease regarded with perplexity by the rest
of the world. With all the exemplary features of America, this
anachronistic problem sadly detracts from world leadership. </p>

<p>American drug prohibition darkens the prospects for the
country's future. Demagogues facilitated by profit-driven special
interest groups create policy and laws that erodes evermore
rights of their citizens. Gradually, and by small increments what
protections were once taken for granted have disappeared. </p>

<p>Lulled into a narcotism induced by television and materialism,
the Trojan horse of authoritarianism has breached the gates of
the city, its moralistic armed clergy busily snuffing out pockets
of critical thinking- ever striving to make the world safe for
profitable hypocrisy. </p>

<p>Alexis de Toqueville's warning of an all pervasive tutelary
power ruling through the manipulation of a distracted
materialistic populace becomes an approaching reality. </p>

<h2>Medicalization of Drug Abuse Control:</h2>

<p><b>Pharmacy Based Voluntary Drug Users Co-operatives</b> </p>

<p><b>A Proposal</b> </p>

<p>Tod H. Mikuriya. M.D. </p>

<hr>

<p>Reinvolve Medicine in Drug Policy<br>
</p>

<p>To bring medicine back to involvement with issues of drug
dependence, the laws need revision to make the treatment of
addicts a medical matter. </p>

<p>Redefine an addict as ill rather than criminal in substantive
terms. </p>

<p>The doctrine of prohibiting physicians from maintaining opiate
and cocaine addicts must be eliminated. Transfer control of
treatment protocols and standards from the Department of Justice
to the Department of Health Services. Mandate development of
maintenance or drug hygiene standards with participation of the
California Medical Association.<br>
</p>

<p>A joint California Medical Association and California Bar
Association committee to draft legislation to revise laws to
optimize freedom to appropriately treat substance abuse,
safeguard patient's rights, and protect the public health.
Safeguards must be included to discourage excessive consumption
or abuse.<br>
</p>

<p>Pharmacy Based Voluntary Drug Users' Co-operatives </p>

<p>A new category of legal non-therapeutic users of controlled
substances is created. Include all drugs listed in the Controlled
Substances Act of 1970 et seq. for actual controlled use. Users
would obtain these drugs at participating pharmacies utilizing
special ID. Entry to the program at the age of majority would be
by written test. No intervention by the program unless there is a
problem. Supported by transaction fees, community treatment
resources would be paid for by the program. <br>
</p>

<p>Success of the program is based on the premise that the rate
of morbidity will be acceptably low in an informed group of
users. Chronic users learn to develop functional stable use
patterns that may continue for long periods without disruption.
Dysfunctional behavior associated with use would result in being
dropped from the program. </p>

<p>Reacting to some adversity a chronic user will increase
his/her dose in an effort to suppress adverse emotions through
distracting analgesia. The consequent psychosocial dysfunction,
health problems, or financial crisis motivates seeking of
treatment or results in external intervention. </p>

<p>Upon entering a detoxification program the habitual user
typically forswears the habit, vowing to stay &quot;clean&quot;
from now on. The rare dependent will truthfully admit to an
authentic treatment goal of reducing a habit to manageable
levels. </p>

<p>Even with success in completing detoxification and maintaining
a period of abstinence, drug dependence is a chronic relapsing
illness. </p>

<p>The mission of VDUC is to control, treat, and prevent drug
abuse in a flexible and appropriate fashion. The dispensing of
controlled substances through participating pharmacies to
registered users is included. </p>

<p>Price structure based upon abuse/use ratio of a substance
would encourage the use of less toxic or dangerous products. A
harmfulness tax is an idea that has been recently proposed by
Grinspoon. </p>

<p>The VDUC would be somewhat more controlled than differential
toxicity tax rates because written and physical tests would be
required for entry into a pharmacy-based program using an
identification card. </p>

<p>Another VDUC goal is to institutionalize connections between
cost/benefit or actuarial facts with social policy and the
marketplace. These connections only dimly exist for alcohol and
tobacco industries and their users. Unlike these hazardous
substances, drugs sold through VDUC would not be granted
exemption from product liability laws. </p>

<p>Transaction fees and all taxes would be earmarked to support
the administration of the co-operative and contracting community
treatment providers for users needing services. <br>
</p>

<p>Different from the British &quot;System&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>The contemporary British &quot;system&quot; derives from their
national health service that is represented by local health
councils which manage medical resources. The availability of
physicians who are addiction specialists and priorities of local
councils determines whether the addict will obtain appropriate
treatment. </p>

<p>The rapid increase of heroin addicts and small numbers of
addiction specialists has overwhelmed that system. The illicit
free market filled the drug needs of the users the National
Health Service could not meet. </p>

<p>Substance abuse treatment services in Great Britain are just
as fragmented as that in the United States but with differences
in dynamics of control, economics, and influences of special
interest groups. Both are ill-equipped and overwhelmed by the
impact of problems connected with substance abuse. </p>

<p>But at least they don't turn the addicts into criminals as we
do in the United States.<br>
</p>

<p>Unlike prescriptive medical clinic models the proposed
Voluntary Drug Users Co-operative is not vulnerable to
oversubscription with waiting lists. </p>

<p>Users are dispersed to pharmacies and only come to a treatment
program if there is a problem. </p>

<p>Since the scheme is transaction fee supported, the larger the
number of users, the more money becomes available for treatment,
prevention, and education. </p>

<p>Since there would be no intervention unless there was evidence
of dysfunction, costs would be lower than a clinic or physician
visit type of maintenance program. This lower level of control
and services for problem-free users would support a spectrum of
services for those suffering drug-related illness or dysfunction.
Flexibility and range of response is based on the principle that
control is exerted from within or imposed from without. </p>

<p>More importantly, the program would provide an ongoing source
of reliable data on which to refine policies and develop products
that would optimize use/morbidity patterns.<br>
</p>

<p>Eligibility<br>
</p>

<p>The age of majority would permit the taking of a written test
on drug effects, side effects as well as the conditions of the
VDUC program including consequences of misuse or violation of
conditions. Passing of these tests would constitute informed
consent. </p>

<p>An entry medical evaluation including physical examination and
laboratory tests would be required to screen for conditions that
would preclude or restrict access such as mental illness,
epilepsy, or substance abuse. </p>

<p>These high risk individuals if allowed access would be more
closely supervised by health providers.<br>
</p>

<p>Non-profit community board </p>

<p>A non-profit community board would be mandated to protect the
users from exploitation as well as the public from health and
safety risks. Users, pharmacists, public Health, legal and the
general community should be represented. </p>

<p>Abusers referred to treatment or enforcement </p>

<p>All transactions are reported to the executive office of the
VDUC and any patterns of unusual or exceptional use are
investigated in addition to any reports of medical, surgical, or
antisocial incidents. </p>

<p>Privileges are suspended and the abuser is referred to police
or district attorney if the drugs are furnished to a minor, used
to poison, incapacitate, or impair someone else. Driving while
intoxicated, endangering others, fighting, or being a danger to
others would be generally handled by enforcement.<br>
</p>

<p>If the user exhibits dysfunctional behavior or impaired health
that does not directly harm someone else, then he/she is referred
to an appropriate substance abuse program. Reports from
hospitals, emergency rooms, physicians offices, health
facilities, workplace, family, dispensing pharmacy, or other
source would initiate intervention. The program identification
card would be suspended and the abuser referred to the assessment
team. </p>

<p>Evaluation </p>

<p>Experienced substance abuse specialists would be utilized for
&quot;triage&quot; to determine the type of intervention
appropriate to the individual problem. Intervention would be the
least intrusive or restrictive possible. </p>

<p>Referral for specialized treatment </p>

<p>A spectrum of outpatient and in-patient service would be
available as contractors to the program for intervention in cases
of drug abuse. </p>

<p>Continuing research and education </p>

<p>The continuing study at Framingham, Massachusetts provided us
with definitive information concerning the connection between
smoking, lung cancer, heart, and other circulatory diseases.
Unbiased and extensive morbidity information would be collected
from participating health resources for policy refinement. </p>

<p>In order to restore a source of legitimate and undistorted
medical information as to the connections between drugs and their
hazards, treatments, and prevention, ongoing study is required on
a large scale.<br>
</p>

<p>Funding for Treatment and Prevention </p>

<p>Treatment would be available if needed since the current
salient problem is the lack of money for treatment. Nine out of
ten substance abusers voluntarily asking for treatment are turned
away for lack of a way to pay for treatment. The earmarking of
taxes combined with transaction fees would provide an ongoing
source for funding that has been heretofore lacking.<br>

<h1>Why is There a 'War on Drugs'?</h1>

<hr>

<p>INTRODUCTION </p>

<p>To ask the question &quot;why is there a 'War on Drugs'?' must
seem to some to be a bit like asking 'why are there laws against
murder?' Such a large amount of popular wisdom exists to support
an effort to stop the use, trafficking and production of illicit
drugs that such a question must be at best facetious. </p>

<p>Images of the drug war, pouring forth across media from the
radio to popular movies, convey a sense of evil and brutality
that beckons for immediate, and brutal, retaliation. Once the
question is asked, however, the onus is immediately on the one
asking the question to provide evidence that is contrary to the
accepted norm. This person who dares ask the question, even if
s/he is sincere and honest, may quickly find that they are
clearly outside of the 'norm' in society, and that few people
will bother to help them in answering their own question. The
question, then, carries with it a great weight, and often times
remains unasked, both at the public and governmental levels.</p>

<p>It is the question 'why', however, that will be the purpose of
this paper, with regards to the War on Drugs. Answering this
question will of course necessitate using all of the tools
currently used to define, describe and evaluate the War on Drugs.
For example, it will have to be shown that there actually is a
War on Drugs; that legislation has been enacted that makes the
War on Drugs a reality; that the War on Drugs is not a necessary
fact of legal or social life in this country; and that plausible
alternatives have been largely ignored. What will be of ultimate
interest, however, is why, given the realities of its social
uselessness, there is a War on Drugs. </p>

<p>IS THERE A 'WAR ON DRUGS'? </p>

<p>The American Experience </p>

<p>Most of our Canadian conceptions of the War on Drugs are the
result of the American War on Drugs. Ronald and Nancy Reagan's
1986 'declaration' of the War on Drugs mixed metaphors of war,
illness, crusades and religious righteousness in order to
galvanize a nation into action against illicit drugs. George
Bush, carrying the same theme, further made the issue both a
domestic and international one (Elwood, 1994). While this
reaction to the perceived problem of drugs typifies the most
recent reaction to illicit drug use, it is certainly not the
product of the 1980's. In early 20th Century America,
international concern over opium trading was reflected by the
Unites States legislating the Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914,
which put in place a taxation on the trade of opium into the U.S.
(Brecher, 1972). Aside from its rather benign face, the Harrison
Act contained a clause that law enforcement officials viewed as
being justification for the arrest and imprisonment of physicians
who prescribed opiates to their patients. This led to the almost
overnight creation of a black market, and caused those addicted
to opiates to reduce their quality of life substantially in order
to maintain their addiction. It is this affiliation with a
criminal element which allowed for more punitive laws to be put
in place, in the mistaken belief that drug use led to crime. By
many accounts, even of the time, the laws and not the drugs
themselves, forced many addicted individuals to turn to crime to
maintain their addictions (Brecher, 1972). </p>

<p>The Canadian Experience </p>

<p>In Canada, a similar scenario had unfolded parallel (and
previous) to the American experience. Concern over the
international trade of opium had made necessary the first of the
anti-opium legislation that sought to criminalize its use and
movement outright. The result was the Opium Act of 1908, and the
Opium and Drug Act of 1911 (Giffen, Endicott and Lambert, 1991).
These acts sought to at first reduce, then eliminate opium
traffic inside Canada, in order to complement efforts to stop
international trading in this substance. As Giffen, et al (1991)
describe, the 1911 Act was influenced by far more than simply a
wish to help China with its opium problem -- at the time, a
strong moralistic tide was washing over the country, and opium
and a host of other drugs were blamed for crime, immorality and
the like. More importantly, hostility towards the Chinese which
manifested itself in the 1907 anti-Asiatic demonstration, and
further publicity about Chinese opium use, led to the creation of
the beliefs of extreme negative effects of opium (p. 53). </p>

<p>In 1986, just two days after President and Mrs. Reagan's
declaration of war on drugs, Prime Minister Mulroney deviated
from a prepared speech to announce that &quot;drug abuse has
become an epidemic that undermines our economic as well as our
social fabric&quot; (Erickson, 1992, p. 248). However, Prime
Minister Mulroney neither said this in a dramatic address to
Canada's public, nor further elaborated on his remark. While his
remark resulted in the creation of &quot;Canada's Drug
Strategy&quot;, by most accounts very little has changed with
respect to the Federal Government's treatment illicit drugs
(Fischer, 1994; Erickson, 1992). </p>

<p>Does This Constitute a 'Drug War'? </p>

<p>In early United States and Canada, then, the factors which
brought about prohibition of illicit drugs were a concern with
international opium trade to China (and, seemingly, how that
trade could be replaced with trade in U.S. and Canadian
products), an increasingly racist (and very public) attitude
toward immigrants from the Pacific Rim, and a new moralistic tide
sweeping both countries. The effects of these factors was
prohibition of most psychoactive drugs (save for alcohol and
tobacco), and almost immediate police involvement in the control
of the newly-illicit drugs. </p>

<p>Whether this constitutes a &quot;drug war&quot; is debatable.
On one hand, there seems to be no explicit declaration of war
against drugs to be found at the turn of the century. On the
other hand, there are many facets of what Bruce Alexander (1990)
calls &quot;warlike aspects of current drug-control policy&quot;
(p. 50). For example, Alexander writes that a War on Drugs may be
defined by its war language, violent imagery, legal violence,
illegal police violence, spying, and its casualties. A closer
look at the evidence available from the era of early illicit drug
prohibition satisfies some of these requirements. For example,
public action against drugs such as cocaine in 1910-11 was
defined as a &quot;fight&quot; against cocaine, and cocaine users
were typified as &quot;fiends in human guise&quot; (Giffen et al,
1991, p. 83). </p>

<p>As well, the Opium and Drug Act of 1911 set down several
measures that were very much war-like. First, the police were
given extensive powers which allowed them to seize, confiscate,
and destroy drugs (Giffen, et al, 1991, p. 80). The 1911 Act also
shifted the burden of proof from the police to the defendant,
forcing the charged to prove that any illicit drugs seized were
for scientific or medical purposes. Finally, the 1911 Act closed
off the chance for any appeal on the grounds of technicalities
(Giffen, et al, 1991). </p>

<p>The casualties in the early War on Drugs were mainly Chinese
labourers who had legally entered the country to peaceably work
for wages that could not have been earned in their own country.
The actual use of the 1911 act was to imprison, and later (after
a 1922 amendment) deport Chinese opium users, until a diminishing
number of Chinese targets for the illicit drug laws caused a
newer focus on Caucasian drug users (Giffen, et al, 1991, p. 97).
</p>

<p>Back to the Present </p>

<p>Alexander (1990) argues that the whole of the illicit drug
laws set the stage for an all-out war on drugs, even if the
Canadian public is not as aware of the situation as the American
public is. Even though no dramatic pronouncement of a drug war in
Canada was ever made, Canadian drug laws reflect a War Measures
mentality which reduces the legal rights of the accused, and
strengthens the power, scope and role of the police forces. For
example, police have almost unrestricted powers of search and
seizure in drug cases (Alexander, 1990, p. 36). Police also have
the right to break into premises, destroy any property therein,
&quot;manhandle and beat the occupants, and to punch and choke
people who are suspected of trying to swallow drugs&quot;
(Alexander, 1990, p. 36). These rights of the police, which
clearly come at the expense of the rights of the individual, are
effected only when illicit drugs are, or are suspected of being,
involved. </p>

<p>A drug war also contains language that clearly sets the stage
for the public's acceptance of these types of power. This is
certainly not a new turn of events -- since the very beginning of
drug prohibition, drugs were associated with words and phrases
that were meant to elicit visions of the public combating
&quot;evil imported from the Orient&quot;, the &quot;curse of
cocaine&quot; (Giffen et al, p. 82, p. 84) and even &quot;the
downfall of the white race [by the Chinese]&quot; (Alexander, p.
31). President Reagan's drug war declaration conveyed an image of
illicit drugs &quot;menacing our society&quot; and
&quot;threatening our values and undercutting our
institutions&quot; and &quot;threat[ening] ... our national
security&quot; (Reagan, 1986, pp. 1184-1186). These statements
elicit images of an all-out attack on the United States by a
foreign power. Prime Minister Mulroney echoed very much these
same sentiments with regard to Canada two days later. </p>

<p>Even today, utterances such as cocaine being &quot;a
substantial evil in our society ... It ruins lives and destroys
families and is directly responsible for the commission of other
crimes,&quot; (Oakes, 1994a, p. A8) and &quot;cocaine is
undoubtedly an insidious and dangerous drug which undermines the
very fabric of our society&quot; (Oakes, 1994b, p. A11) can be
found in the daily newspaper. </p>

<p>Obviously, with these images firmly implanted in the psyche of
a nation, any steps taken to eradicate the 'enemy' will be met
with little resistance. Any resistance that is proffered is bound
to be met with a uninformed retort such as this: &quot;I think
half the children born are put to death by the sale of these
cordials and yet some gentlemen say the law is too strict&quot;
(Senate Debates, Canada, 1910-1911, italics mine). </p>

<p>Yes, Virginia, There is a 'War on Drugs' This discussion
presented in the previous section did not touch upon images in
the modern media of an inner-city battleground, movie images of
evil organized drug rings or the tendency of the media to report
the government's, rather than researchers' views on the drugs,
both licit and illicit. However, the intent in the previous
section was to show that the governments in both Canada and the
United States have waged a war on drugs that has existed, largely
unabated, for over 80 years. The next two sections will focus on
whether or not that war is justified, and whether alternatives
could be used. </p>

<p>IS THE 'WAR ON DRUGS' JUSTIFIED? </p>

<p>In the Persian Gulf War that pitted a number of countries
against Iraq, President Bush went to lengths to ensure that
people believed that a war against Iraq was indeed a 'just' war.
However, many researchers, asking whether the war on drugs is
justified, have come to the conclusion that this particular war
is not (see Alexander, 1990, pp. xi-xii for a list of dissenters
from the government's position). Further, there seems to be no
effort on the part of the Canadian Government to evaluate whether
the War on Drugs is necessary. The recent tabling of Bill C-7,
which seeks harsher penalties for illicit drug users and sellers,
overshadows any effort on the part of the Government to seek a
re-evaluation of the effects of the laws on those affected by
them. Even though a large number of groups have voiced their
concerns regarding Bill C-7 (Erickson and Smart, 1994), the Bill
is presently in its third reading, and stands a fair chance of
being passed. The Bill also largely goes against Canada's Drug
Strategy, a program that was initiated after Prime Minister
Mulroney's off-hand comment on the 'problem' of illicit drugs in
Canada. Canada's Drug Strategy has an explicit 'harm reduction'
emphasis (see the section entitled &quot;Harm Reduction as an
Alternative to the War on Drugs&quot;, below) that was to guide
Canada's drug policy (Fischer, 1994). </p>

<p>This being the case, it is now the task of this paper to
explore the drug problem, and to ascertain whether there really
needs to be a drug war. This question is important because one of
the main assumptions of a War on Drugs is that illicit drugs do
so much harm that they must be outlawed. As we shall see, this is
largely a fallacy, and the presence of a War on Drugs in the face
of the facts of the consequences of illicit drugs is made even
more ironic by the Government's long-standing commitment to its
prohibitionary policies. </p>

<p>Back to the Beginning </p>

<p>The previous section of this paper showed that the early drug
laws in Canada formed the basis for a long-standing
prohibitionary approach to the use and trafficking of opium. Not
discussed at length however, were the social conditions that
preceded these laws. It is useful to describe these social
conditions, and in doing so the gulf between drug laws and the
reality of the effects of the drugs in question can be
illuminated. </p>

<p>In the latter half of the 19th Century, Canadian
industrialists on the West Coast encouraged immigration of
Chinese labourers, mainly because they were willing to work for
less than their Caucasian counterparts (Alexander, 1990, p. 30),
and they were seen as being &quot;conscientious, thrifty, and
law-abiding&quot; (Solomon and Green, 1988, p. 89). The Chinese
also brought with them the habit of smoking opium (Boyd, 1982).
This remained a non-issue with most people, until Chinese
immigration was seen to be threatening the livelihood of white
workers (Boyd, 1982), who were feeling the effects of decline in
railway employment and the gold rush in British Columbia (Solomon
and Green, 1988). </p>

<p>This sentiment came to a peak in September of 1907, when
anti-Asian feeling resulted in the Anti-Asiatic riot in
Vancouver's Chinatown (Alexander, 1990, p. 30). After being sent
to British Columbia to investigate claims for damage incurred by
several Asians in the riot, then Deputy Minister of Labour
Mackenzie King was 'shocked' to find that a Chinese opium
industry was in place. He recommended in his official report that
this trade, which was not subject to taxes, be immediately halted
(Solomon and Green, 1988, p. 91). In 1908, the Opium Act was made
into law, and for the first time the sale, importation and
manufacture of opium was prohibited (Alexander, 1990). </p>

<p>The social backdrop of this period was increasing anti-Asiatic
sentiment, and the fear that Asians were likely to influence
Caucasians to use opium. At this time, a mythology was being
created which helped to set the tone for further legislation. </p>

<p>Opium itself seemed not to be the problem, but opium smoking
was seen to &quot;exemplify the alien, inferior and unassimilable
nature of the Chinese&quot; (Giffen et al, 1991, p. 57). The
prevailing fear was not of opium itself, but of whites being
encouraged by the Chinese to use opium. Solomon and Green add
that the success of this law, and the failure of other laws that
sought to suppress alcohol, tobacco and other substances at the
time, was due to the fact that (p. 88): it was directed against
Chinese opium smokers and Chinese opium factories, but at the
same time posed no threat to the larger number of predominantly
middle-class and middle-aged Caucasian users who were addicted to
the products of the established pharmaceutical industry With an
emphasis on racial factors, and a complete mythology regarding
the social effects of opium, the stage was set for newer and more
punitive laws regarding opium and other drugs, such as morphine,
heroin and cocaine. </p>

<p>In the next number of years, culminating in the 1929 Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act, Canada saw a shift in its policies. Solomon
and Green (1988) write of how the newly created Department of
Health was given responsibility for the supervision of Canada's
Federal drug laws, through the creation of the Narcotics Division
(p. 97). At the same time, the RCMP was founded, and charged with
the execution of Federal laws. The RCMP's 'raison d'etre' soon
became the enforcement of drug laws, and was a great influence on
the Narcotics Division, which found little resistance when
requesting special powers be given to the RCMP to penalize drug
users and traffickers. These special powers included police
officers being able to search dwellings without a warrant, the
onus on the defendant to prove s/he had no knowledge, consent, or
authority in possession cases, and the police being able to
prosecute doctors who were prescribing maintenance doses to
addicts. Penalties were stiffened to include whipping, and
deportation of immigrants who had been charged and had served
their sentences. </p>

<p>During this time, warnings about the perils of drug use
abounded. The anti-Asiatic campaign was also on an up-swing. In
1922, a highly influential and inflammatory book was published.
It was written by Emily Murphy, an early feminist and jurist.
Through it, Mrs. Murphy gave &quot;a thorough introduction to the
War on Drugs mentality in its modern form&quot; (Alexander, 1990.
p. 31). Included were racist epithets, and an image of the drug
'addict' (all illicit drug users were addicts, in Mrs. Murphy's
opinion) that was so evil and depraved that s/he begged for swift
and harsh discipline. </p>

<p>In the 1920s then, the RCMP and the courts were given enormous
powers to stop the 'menace' of drugs. However, by the end of the
decade, convictions had fallen rapidly, mainly due to the fact
that the majority of Chinese drug offenders had either died out
or been deported (Solomon and Green, 1988, p. 99). The image of
the drug user had changed from a morally weak individual to that
of a &quot;fiendish criminal, obsessed with the need to addict
others and motivated by lust and greed&quot; (Solomon and Green,
1988, p. 100). This set the stage for continued criminal
sanctions for the rest of the century. </p>

<p>Rather than a focus on race, which typified early anti-drug
measures, the focus today is on moral, social, economic and
health concerns (Alexander, 1990, p. 33). However, this change in
emphasis does not make the War on Drugs more justifiable by any
means. Rather, it simply reflects a change in who is to be
charged with drug offences. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Effects of Illicit Drugs </p>

<p>The personae of the War on Drugs is a frantic one. With images
of the drug user as criminal, the police being given massive
powers, a huge criminal network in place to supply illicit drugs
to an unwitting populace, and 'crack babies' being born at the
mercy of their delinquent mothers, one is hard pressed to find
evidence in the popular media that would suggest that the War on
Drugs doesn't need to exist. At the very base of the drug war is
the assumption that illicit drugs do social and medical harm, and
they must be stopped at any cost. It is this assumption which
will be examined next. </p>

<p>Opium and Related Drugs </p>

<p>Opium was the first drug to be made illicit in Canada, largely
due to anti-Asian sentiment. However, even at the time, there
were questions as to the medical effects of the drug. During
Senate debate on the 1908 Opium Act, Dr. Joseph Sullivan was the
only person to question its alleged effects. In part, he stated: </p>

<p>I fail to find in statistics anything about the injurious
effect of Opium on the Chinese. Above all things, the Chinese
having this habit ought to be treated with a great deal of
consideration (quoted in Giffen, et al, 1990, p. 72) </p>

<p>Dr. Sullivan's remark is borne out by the fact that, aside
from physical addiction often present in continual users of
opiates, there are no serious side effects of the continued use
of them. Health and Welfare Canada's (1989) &quot;Licit and
Illicit Drugs in Canada&quot; reveals that (p. 11): </p>

<p>Despite media dramatizations of heroin withdrawal, cessation
is rarely fatal and is similar to a bad case of influenza.
Observations of heroin-addicted individuals who have been
maintained on daily doses under medical supervision show no
significant psychological or physical negative effects from the
drug. However, many adverse effects of heroin use are related to
the addiction lifestyle and methods of drug administration. </p>

<p>Marijuana </p>

<p>Popular reports of the effects of other drugs also do not hold
up when examined more closely. Marijuana was thought by Mrs.
Murphy to drive its users insane, make them become &quot;raving
maniacs&quot;, and lead them to a premature death (Solomon,
Single and Erickson, 1988, p. 370). However, if this were true,
adverse psychological effects would be well known by now. </p>

<p>Instead, there have been few cases of patients reporting to
treatment facilities with these kinds of effects. Health and
Welfare Canada seems to indicate that this is surprising, given
the high rates of usage in some populations (1989, p. 10). </p>

<p>Cocaine </p>

<p>Cocaine is another drug that was (and is) widely reported to
have severe effects on the individual. While lethal in very high
doses, cocaine actually is reasonably safe in moderate doses
(Alexander, 1990, p. 202-203). Similarly, crack cocaine's label
as &quot;the most highly addictive form of all drugs ever known
in history&quot; has been countered with research reports that
more or less simply report that &quot;cocaine does not produce
physical dependence&quot; (Akers, 1991, pp. 783-784). </p>

<p>This list could be extended, but the point can be summed up by
stating that (as Alexander (1990) does) &quot;a large body of
careful research shows that recreational use of illicit drugs,
including marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, does not lead to
addiction or other harm for the majority of users&quot; (p. 64).
But what of the other popular edict of the anti-drug
organizations and police and Presidents Reagan and Bush and Prime
Minister Mulroney, etc., which states that there is nothing less
than an epidemic of illicit drug use, which tears at the very
fabric of society? </p>

<p>The final section of this consideration of whether or not a
war on drugs is justified will focus on the proportion of people
in our society which actually use drugs, and what the effects of
this use actually are. </p>

<p>Use of Illicit Drugs </p>

<p>Some of the best trend data on drug use come from the
Addiction Research Foundation, which has surveyed self-reported
drug use among Ontario students since 1968, and Ontario adults
since 1977. These surveys have been conducted once very two years
in the case of students, and once every three years in the case
of adults (Smart and Adlaf, 1990). In general, the use of drugs
has dramatically declined among both students and adults. With
respect to cannabis, the percentage of students who reported
using the drug at least once in the previous year peaked in 1979
at a rate of 31.7%, and then fell gradually to a low of 11.7% in
1991. Students' use of heroin in the previous year had peaked in
1979 at 2.3%, then fell to 1% in 1991. Following the same trend,
use of cocaine for students peaked at 5.1% in 1979, then
gradually fell to 1.6% in 1991 (Smart, Adlaf and Walsh, 1991, p.
13). </p>

<p>For adults, the trends have been somewhat similar, however the
peak years for use in the previous year come somewhat later
(possibly because the students who continued using were now
classified as 'adults', in other words, a cohort effect was
observed). The peak year for cannabis use in the previous year
for Ontario adults was 1984, with a percentage of 11.2% adults
reporting the use of cannabis at least once. This percentage fell
to 6.8% in 1991. With respect to cocaine, use rates remained
relatively constant, with between 1.7 (1984) and 2.1% (1989) of
adults reporting having used cocaine in the previous year (Adlaf,
Smart and Canale, 1991, p. 7). </p>

<p>Although self-reported rates are not always the most reliable
indicator of drug use (and with respect to the above studies, do
not include teenagers outside of the education system), these
data show that at least in Ontario, the vast majority of students
and adults are non-users of marijuana, cocaine and heroin. </p>

<p>Taking a national perspective, we find that the percentage of
those individuals in Canada fifteen years of age or older that
have never used marijuana or hashish is 80%. For cocaine, the
percentage of people who have never used is 97% (Single, Williams
and McKenzie, 1994, p. 113). </p>

<p>These data do not support in any way the claims made by Prime
Minister Mulroney two days after President Reagan declared the
American War on Drugs. If drugs had become an
&quot;epidemic&quot; in Canada in 1986, use rates certainly do
not reflect this. As for Prime Minister Mulroney's comment that
drug use was eroding the social and economic fabric of the
country also bears closer scrutiny, although it should be noted
that it is impossible to define what, exactly, Prime Minister
Mulroney meant by this comment. The focus of the next section of
this paper, however, will be a discussion of the effects of drugs
on people who use them. This focus will not be a pharmacological
one, but a social one, taking into account a more important
effect of drug use--the social sanctions that accompany those who
decide to use illicit drugs. </p>

<p>The Effects of the War on Drugs </p>

<p>Anti-drug sentiment comes complete with a whole selection of
'facts' and 'figures' which support the 'fact' that drug use
causes severe social upheaval. This is evidenced by many of the
previously quoted remarks of even well-intentioned groups and
individuals who fear that the use of drugs has severe social,
economic and psychological effects on the individual, those
around the individual, and society in general. While this may be
the popular response to the problems of drug use, there is much
more evidence to support the view that anti-drug legislation
itself is the cause of the plight of drug users, and not the
other way around. Brecher (1972) is certainly one of the first
documenters of the history of drug legislation to espouse this
view, and may in fact have been one of the creators of a paradigm
shift in drug research that has carried through to this day. In
Licit &amp; Illicit Drugs, Brecher illustrates the history of all
types of licit and illicit drugs, and documents anti-drug
legislation in the United States and Canada. The first effects of
the early narcotic legislation were almost immediate; Brecher
writes that the result of these laws was that &quot;the door was
opened wide to adulterated, contaminated and misbranded narcotics
of all kinds&quot; (p. 47). Previously law-abiding addicts were
forced to turn to the black market in order to secure their
maintenance doses of these drugs. Just six weeks after the
passage of the 1914 Harrison Act in the United States, Brecher
quotes an editor in the New York Medical Journal as writing that
the immediate effect was seen in the flocking of drug users to
hospitals and sanitoriums, an increase in violence due to addicts
looking to obtain drugs (some in a delirious state due to
withdrawal), and that time would show further effects, in the
failure of promising careers, the disruption of families, the
commission of crimes, and the influx into hospitals of those who
would have otherwise led normal lives (p. 50). </p>

<p>In Canada, predictably, anti-opium legislation also resulted
in the creation of covert smuggling operations, which resulted in
the price of opium rising dramatically. In a society founded upon
capitalist principles, drug traffickers sprang up to reap the
monetary rewards of the early opium legislation. As a result,
enforcement of the opium laws became more zealous, which
increased the profitability of the black market trade, which then
increased the likelihood that the trade would continue (Giffen,
et al, 1991, p. 117). In later years, morphine and heroin were to
replace opium, mainly because they were easier to conceal due to
the fact that they are more powerful, and take up less space. The
opium users, in order to maintain their addictions, had to
intermingle with and develop contacts with the criminal world
(Giffen, et al, 1991, p. 118). </p>

<p>Before opium legislation, users could carry on useful,
prosperous lives (as many Chinese did at the turn of the
century), while addicted to opium. After anti-opium legislation,
however, irresistible profits were to be made on the black
market, causing users to be involved in the same violence, crime
and corruption that typifies accounts of the illegal drug trade
today. Persistent calls for harsher legislation were made because
often, the defenders of these laws mistook &quot;the violent
side-effects of prohibition for the effects of the drugs
themselves&quot; (Alexander, 1990, p. 60). </p>

<p>This pattern of anti-drug laws and sustained attainability of
drugs through the black market typifies the 20th century
experience with drug prohibition. These laws also have other
consequences that are directly related to the criminalization of
drug use in modern times. These consequences form the main part
of the public image of the drug user, and are used to further
support the notion that tougher laws and police powers are
needed. Erickson (1993) summarizes several finding of researchers
who have studied this problem in relation to opiates (p. 1169): </p>

<p>Forced to obtain opiates illegally and at a much inflated
price, addicts/users formed a deviant and sometimes criminal
subculture; money went to purchase drugs rather than to food and
personal hygiene; sharing and using dirty needles led to high
rates of infection with diseases such as hepatitis; contaminated
drugs and unknown potency contributed to high morbidity and
mortality; criminalization further reduced legitimate economic
opportunities. </p>

<p>Of course, not all illicit drug use in our society is of
opiates, nor of an addictive nature. Even with illicit drugs
commonly thought of as being non-addictive, however, the law has
effects on the user that seem to overshadow the relatively
harmless direct consequences of the actual use. The consequences
of the law regarding marijuana (which in Canada today can be as
severe as those applied in cases of opiates and cocaine) manifest
themselves in reduced opportunities for employment (Erickson and
Goodstadt, 1979), the offender wishing to remain more secretive
to both his or her family, and disrespect for cannabis laws
(Erickson and Murray, 1986). The stigmatizing effect of even the
lightest of punishments on the 'cannabis criminal' have
implications, therefore, on the user's self-image and the user's
place in society, and are largely an unintended effect of the
law. </p>

<p>An Answer to The Question </p>

<p>The genesis of anti-drug legislation, as presented above, was
racist attitudes towards the Chinese labourers who were seen to
be a threat to the Caucasian work force. The focus in those times
was not on the effects of the drugs themselves, as there was, and
is, ample evidence to support the theory that illicit drugs are
not generally harmful in and of themselves. Nor, as is frequently
argued, are there expansive social consequences arising from the
use of these drugs. If anything, the market in illicit drugs
benefits the police by keeping them busy, and allowing an easy
outlet for their influence in anti-drug laws. </p>

<p>As for an epidemic in drug use, there seems to be few
statistics to substantiate even a minor threat to the health of
Canadians based upon the numbers of Canadians who do use illicit
drugs. </p>

<p>Finally, the major negative impact of drugs on their users is
the result of the drug laws themselves, and not drugs per se. </p>

<p>In short, the War on Drugs is in no way justified by any
evidence gathered to date. </p>

<p>As will be discussed below, there are alternatives to the War
on Drugs. In particular, a model of 'harm reduction' will be
examined closely, and the evidence which would support an effort
of this type presented. As well, 'Canada's Drug Strategy', a
program based on harm reduction principles and announced in 1987,
will be critiqued. </p>

<p>HARM REDUCTION AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE WAR ON DRUGS </p>

<p>Harm reduction is a broad classification of proposals which
shift the focus from prohibiting the use of drugs to dealing with
the problems associated with drug use. As discussed earlier, the
War on Drugs has brought about its own set of problems associated
with drug use. Therefore, a successful program of harm reduction
would also have to deal with the problems of the War on Drugs as
well (Nadelmann, 1994, p. 35). </p>

<p>True harm reduction approaches were developed fairly recently
through programs in the Netherlands, the U.K. and Australia (Des
Jarlais and Friedman, 1994). The focus of harm reduction is on
reducing the problems associated with drug use on a community and
individual level, rather than an effort to prohibit drug use at a
societal level. Harm reduction also focuses on the realistically
attainable goals of reducing the negative consequences of drug
use, such as the supplying of clean equipment to injection drug
users (IDUs) in order to reduce the prevalence of AIDS and HIV
infection in the IDU population. It is these immediately
'treatable' aspects of drug use which are targeted first, so that
the use of drugs can be as risk-free as possible. A further
consideration is the reduction of drug use, although abstinence
is only an option when it would be clearly appropriate (Riley,
1994, p. 1). </p>

<p>Clearly then, there is a stark contrast between harm reduction
and prohibition as models of dealing with drug use. Harm
reduction assumes that there are effects of drug use that can
benefit the user (as in the case of life-saving medication), and
that there are also harmful and even neutral effects. Harm
reduction offers a pragmatic means for the analysis of whether
these effects are harmful or not (Riley, 1994, p. 1), a far cry
from prohibitionist models, which assume that all illicit drug
use is inherently harmful. Also, the emphasis is not on drug use
per se (as in the prohibitionist model), but solely on the
negative consequences of such use. </p>

<p>The concept of harm reduction is not entirely new, however. It
can be traced back to the 'British System', which emerged in
answer to a set of recommendations by the Rolleston Committee
which was formed in the 1920s in the U.K. (Riley, 1994, p. 1). </p>

<p>The committee argued that in certain cases &quot;maintenance
on drugs may be necessary to help drug abusers lead useful
lives&quot; (Riley, 1994, p. 1). The modern-day model for the
harm reduction approach is located in Merseyside, near Liverpool.
In response to the rising use of drugs such as heroin in the
early 1980s, the Merseyside clinics, along with doctors,
pharmacists and the police worked together to establish a
harm-reduction model. </p>

<p>Their efforts concentrate on treating users on an individual
basis, supplying them with either the drugs they needed or
effective substitutes, and exchanging syringes, all of which may
help the user to lead more healthy, productive and fulfilling
life (Riley, 1994). </p>

<p>The effects on the social problems in Merseyside as a result
of the harm reduction program there have been encouraging. Riley
(1994) writes that of all the English Regions, Merseyside had the
lowest rate of HIV-positive IDUs, and the Merseyside police were
the only force in 1990 and 1991 to register a decrease in crime
rates (p. 5). The success of Merseyside is partly due to the fact
that it is a collaborative effort between clinicians, police,
pharmacists and doctors. Another factor which sets Merseyside's
harm reduction strategy apart from other prohibitionary models is
the fact that it is community based, and not a set of rules
imposed from the government at the Federal level (as
prohibitionary models are). Reducing harm in one's own community
gives immediate and tangible benefits that can be appreciated by
all concerned. This helps to ensure the continuation of the
program which gives those benefits, and encourages the
participation of people who enjoy its benefits. </p>

<p>Several examples of a harm reduction approach exist in Canada
as well, especially with reference to alcohol. Single (1994)
writes that the Alberta Liquor Control Board allowed for the
special early opening of a downtown Edmonton liquor store, in
order to allow for a supply of potable alcohol to Skid-row
inebriates who were previously using other substances, such as
shoe polish, which were easily attainable in the morning (pp.
2-3). Other programmes informed by the harm reduction model are
available, and include such things as special training to owners
and employees of bars and taverns that allow them to encourage
moderation, designated driver programs, the promotion of 'light'
beers and wines (Single, 1994), and making available information
regarding the alcohol content of different beverages (Riley,
1994). Also, more than 30 needle exchange programs have been run
in several major Canadian cities, which help to reduce the spread
of AIDS through the use of dirty needles and works (Riley, 1994).
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is the spread of AIDS that is the driving
force behind many harm reduction programs, such as needle
exchanges. In the United States, over one-third of all AIDS cases
are related to injection drug use (Des Jarlais and Friedman,
1994, p. 82). IDU is strongly associated with AIDS because the
relatively easy transmission path from one user to another when
needles and other injecting equipment (such as cotton, and the
water used to clean the equipment) are shared. </p>

<p>Also at risk are the partners of injection drug users, even
when the partner is a non-user. </p>

<p>The problem exists because many injection drug users find
obtaining clean needles and other 'works' impossible, difficult
or inconvenient. In New York, where needle exchange programs are
illegal, the incidence of HIV (the retrovirus thought to cause
AIDS) among injection drug users is approximately 60 per cent
(Riley, 1994). Although it is presently difficult to find strong
evidence that needle exchange programs help to prevent AIDS and
HIV because of the time lag between infection and detection,
researchers point to percentage of IDU related AIDS in cities
such as New York, which have not instituted such programs (Riley,
1994). As well, those cities that responded early to the spread
of AIDS and HIV show IDU related cases to be much lower than
those that didn't (Des Jarlais and Friedman, 1994). </p>

<p>The harm reduction model, then, is an effective answer to
controlling the problems associated with drug use. The emphasis
on getting many different members of the community involved helps
to give those people the feeling that they are helping to solve a
serious problem, which benefits them and the community. </p>

<p>The objective standpoint offered by the harm reduction model
is helpful in getting beyond the rhetoric of the War on Drugs as
well, since harm reduction focuses on objective (and
non-judgmental) information about drugs and their effects (Riley,
1994, p. 11). The harm reduction model reduces the conflict
between the drug user and the community, by trying to erase the
boundaries between these two groups, and by getting the drug user
to be more a part of the community. </p>

<p>Canada's Drug Strategy -- Kinder, Gentler Repression </p>

<p>The examples of harm reduction shown above are primarily
community based. As a result of Prime Minister Mulroney's
aforementioned comment, a national strategy was announced in
1987, which was termed &quot;Canada's Drug Strategy&quot;
(Erickson, 1992). Canada's Drug Strategy has an explicit harm
reduction emphasis, and an emphasis on reducing drug-related harm
to individuals and communities (Fischer, 1994, p. 71). The
Strategy allocated the sum of $210 million in its first five
years (and an additional $270 million in 1992) mainly to the
prevention and treatment of drug use, while 30 per cent of this
money was intended for the traditional area of law enforcement
(Fischer, 1994). </p>

<p>This national effort would seem to indicate a shift in
Canada's policy on illicit drugs, but seemingly little evidence
of that shift is apparent. Soon after the announcement of
Canada's Drug Strategy, laws were enacted (in 1988 and 1989
respectively), which prohibited the sale of drug paraphernalia
and increased the power of police to seize the assets of arrested
drug offenders (Erickson, 1992, p. 249). </p>

<p>Bill C-85, introduced at the end of the Conservative
Government's reign (in 1992), clearly sought to strengthen the
prohibition of drugs in Canada, at the expense of the drug user. </p>

<p>The proposed law, coming under attack by opposition members
and from the drug policy research and practice community, was
dropped (Fischer, 1994). (Also, while several external drug
policy and research agencies were present during the debate of
the Bill, one group, the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, was
not invited. This was quite surprising, because of the fact that
this centre had been created solely out of Canada's Drug Strategy
itself to serve as an 'arm's length' agency to the Federal
Government for drug research and policy development (Fischer,
1994, p. 77).) </p>

<p>As a further shock to those in drug policy and research
agencies, the new Liberal government (which had criticized
Bill-85 extensively during Parliamentary debates) tabled Bill
C-7, which was almost a word-for-word simulation of Bill C-85. </p>

<p>This Bill continues the repressive prohibition policies, and
is currently in its third reading in Parliament. </p>

<p>Further, no shift was to be observed with respect to drug
related offences since the Strategy's inception. The number of
drug-related offences reported by police hovered around 60,000
for the first three years of the Strategy's implementation
(Jensen and Gerber, 1993, p. 457). </p>

<p>Finally, money allocated to the provinces by the Federal
Government for the creation and/or continuation of prevention and
treatment programs has not been utilized -- due mainly to the
structure of the program. Provinces have had to put up 100 per
cent of the cost of these types of programs before receiving half
of these funds from the Federal government. As a result, over 50
per cent of the allocated money has not been used by the
provinces (Fischer, 1994). </p>

<p>Despite being based on a harm reduction approach then,
Canada's Drug Strategy seems to be more like prohibition in harm
reduction's clothing. Rather than focus solely on reducing the
harmful consequences of drug use, and the even more harmful
aspects of the effects of drug prohibition, Canada's Drug
Strategy neither balances enforcement and prevention / treatment,
nor effects a new outlook on drug policy in Canada. </p>

<p>WHY IS THERE A 'WAR ON DRUGS'? </p>

<p>Having explained that Canadian policy with respect to the use
of illicit drugs constitutes a War on Drugs, that the initial
impetus for prohibitionary policies were borne out of
misinformation, mistrust and sensationalism both out and inside
of Parliament, and that there are well-known and effective
alternatives to the War on Drugs, this paper will now explore its
main question. There are numerous explanations for the reason
that a War on Drugs exists. These explanations will be discussed
in turn, in the hope that a more comprehensive view (one that
covers both psychological and sociological explanations) will be
attained. </p>

<p>Psychological Explanations </p>

<p>Ethan Nadelmann (1994), writes (p. 43): </p>

<p>Indeed, the only way to explain and justify many current
policies is by reference to the fears, prejudices and primitive
moralisms of those who have transformed drug control policy into
a modern version of an authoritarian crusade. </p>

<p>This quote is taken somewhat out of context (as Nadelmann was
writing about harm reduction), but serves as a good introduction
to a psychological explanation of why there is a War on Drugs.
This quote is correct to a point, as illustrated in previous
sections of this paper. Many aspects of the current policies came
out of the fear of the effects of these drugs, prejudice towards
the Chinese at the turn of the century, and the moralistic tide
that was sweeping our country. However, this quote simplifies the
problem somewhat, and doesn't allow for an explanation of why
people continue to use illicit drugs in the face of prohibition,
why prejudices were rarely explicitly stated in the course of the
making of (even the early) Canadian laws regarding drugs. Nor
does it explain the active role of Federal and local law agencies
almost consistently being a part of drug legislation (in short,
if they were afraid, why would they want to be so closely
involved in the War on Drugs?). And why does the prohibition
model continue to dominate Canada's agenda with respect to drugs
in our increasingly secular and liberal society? </p>

<p>Alexander (1990) offers a psychological explanation of his
own, drawn from years of research and interviews with people from
both sides of the issue. The two main groups, he argues, are the
'drug warriors', who spearhead the War on Drugs, and the
'resisters' who defy the War on Drugs by using illicit drugs, or
are simply appalled by it, although they may have little interest
in the War on Drugs itself (p. 327-328). Other groups are also
involved in the War on Drugs. A small group, whom Alexander calls
the 'villains', go to extremes to either carry out or resist the
War on Drugs, and in doing so promote the kinds of violence that
typify the worst consequences of drugs and the war against them.
There are also 'double-standard bearers', who both promote the
War on Drugs, and yet are resisters as well. Finally, the largest
group Alexander calls the 'neutrals', who fund the War on Drugs
and have their opinions swayed to varying degrees by both
warriors and resisters (pp. 328-329). </p>

<p>In Alexander's eyes, the drug war is not being fought over the
drugs themselves, but centres itself around the need to blame
others for societal ills, and a power conflict regarding personal
freedom and social control (p. 329). </p>

<p>Blaming Others </p>

<p>Throughout history, people have pointed their finger at
different groups, in order to fulfil three psychological needs
that blaming serves. The first is that blaming helps one to feel
that one is doing something in the face of a bad situation. </p>

<p>Second, blaming helps one to escape blame themselves. Finally,
blaming helps to rally other members of society around that
person. Societal ills become more tolerable when one group can be
blamed for these ills (Alexander, 1990, p. 330-331). For the
resisters, blaming the Government for repressive policies can
help one to feel that s/he is doing something about the problem,
and isn't implicated in the creation and continuance of other
societal ills. Drug warriors perhaps get more of a benefit for
blaming, however, as they also have been successful throughout
the 20th Century in rallying the public around their cause. </p>

<p>Conflict Over Power </p>

<p>The drug warriors, Alexander (1990) argues, &quot;embrace the
need to reinforce societal power and suppress personal
autonomy&quot; (p. 336). Their concern over illicit drugs, then
is that these substances may reduce the individual's compliance
with social conventions. Drug warriors, interestingly, are not
concerned with drugs which enhance the social order (p. 337).
They have no objection to caffeine, little objection to nicotine
and alcohol, and little concern for those in hospitals being
given any sort of pharmaceutical agent. Resisters, on the other
hand, place individual autonomy well above societal control. They
believe they should be free to consume illicit drugs as long as
that consumption does not hurt other people. Resisters are very
much concerned with legal drugs that are used to control people
in mental hospitals and in military applications (p. 339). </p>

<p>The Psychological Explanations -- A Summary </p>

<p>Alexander (1990) fills in many of the blanks left by
Nadelmann's succinct comment on the reasons for the War on Drugs.
For example, a reason why resisters continue to defy the War on
Drugs is put forth, as is the reason why a War on Drugs continues
to this day. Alexander admits that his explanation is a
psychological, and not a political one (p. 326). Alexander's
explanation is perhaps made more valid by the fact that he chose
to conscientiously interview drug warriors and try to place
himself in their shoes, so to speak. Alexander's explanation also
elicits elements of a major sociological perspective that has
been applied to the laws which are the expression of the War on
Drugs. This perspective, called 'conflict theory' will be
discussed next. </p>

<p>Sociological Explanations </p>

<p>Conflict Theory </p>

<p>Conflict theory arose out of a concern that structural
functionalism neglected conflict in society, was politically
conservative, and failed to account for change in society
(Ritzer, 1992, p. 61). This theory has evolved to include
elements of structural functionalism (for example, the functions
that conflict serves) and a traditional Marxist focus on dominant
and subordinate groups. In the sociology of law, conflict theory
often depicts a: </p>

<p>polarization of the forces of 'law and order' on the one hand
and left wing political activists and minority group members
reacting to what they saw as excessive police repression of
political protests and urban riots on the other (Giffen, et al.,
1991, pp. 8-9) </p>

<p>This aspect of conflict theory assumes, however, that the
dominant and subordinate groups are more or less homogenous in
nature. Most research in the field of drug policy recently,
however, deals with power being located in &quot;institutional
structures in society (economic, governmental, religious,
etc.)&quot; (Giffen, et al., 1991, p. 10), which does not
presuppose homogenous groups. Both views have problems (Giffen,
et al., 1991), however for the purposes of this paper both views
will be considered, and discussion will focus on what may be
termed a 'naive' view of conflict theory, one which allows for
some oscillation between the two different views of conflict
theory. This view is one that presupposes that the powerful in
society may selectively criminalize actions of those who are
subordinate to them. </p>

<p>Given this bracketing, conflict theory has quite a bit of
explanatory value. It also is supported (albeit sometimes more
implicitly than explicitly) by a number of people involved in
drug policy research (for a strong example, see Johns, 1991,
below), although it seems to be clear that this theory is being
explored more in the United States than here in Canada. A
rational reason for this is that the United States has a much
bigger problem with lines being drawn between races and cultures
than we do in Canada. After attending a conference on drug issues
in the United States, Riley (1994b) remarked that many
researchers felt the real reason for the war on drugs in that
country was that it helped to suppress blacks and minorities. </p>

<p>Of course, conflict theory then allows for a certain amount of
speculation on the motives of those in power. For example, it is
thought by some that rhetoric in the U.S. war on drugs helps
presidents construct policies which are: </p>

<p>... targeted toward blacks and minorities without reference to
race [and] polariz[e] the electorate among racial lines and ...
weaken the traditional economic divisions between Democrats and
Republicans ... without communicating overt bigotry or anti-black
effect to whites. (Edsall and Edsall, 1991, pp. 138-139) </p>

<p>Johns (1991) under the heading &quot;Race: The Creation of an
Enemy Class,&quot; writes bluntly: &quot;The enforcement tactics
of the War on Drugs are focused on minority populations&quot; (p.
155). In her paper, Johns (1991) posits that the War on Drugs
takes attention away from the factors which underlie the problems
of drugs and trafficking, partly because the &quot;more powerful
segments in society&quot; (p. 150) do not want attention focused
the poor job they are doing to cure the ills of society. Johns
also expands the group being oppressed include the poor, who have
been hit with massive housing and health care cuts under the
Republican Presidencies. The dichotomy between those in power and
minorities and the poor is self-perpetuating, in that these
groups have a limited upward mobility (and, therefore crimes like
trafficking in illicit drugs becomes appealing), and when they do
try to increase their wealth through illicit means, those in
power see that as justification for minorities and the poor being
in the position they are in. </p>

<p>Canadians have quite a bit of historical experience with
racism as being one of the factors which precipitated much of the
early prohibition laws. However, one of the failings of conflict
theory becomes apparent when researchers in the history of this
legislation find little in the actual discussion of the laws that
pertains to race. Giffen, et al. (1991) write that the early
legislation's principle proponents had the &quot;altruistic aims
of supporting the international anti-opium movement&quot; despite
the anti-Chinese sentiment of the times (p. 525). The fact that
the laws were used solely against the Chinese at first is
indicative of this anti-Chinese sentiment, and not the creation
of the laws themselves. Later legislation was driven mainly by
enforcement officials, as there was little in the way of public
outcry for more rigorous anti-opium legislation (p. 525). </p>

<p>In the United States as well, early marijuana legislation came
as a result of increased crime in the jurisdiction of enforcement
officials, who found marijuana to be an easy scapegoat in their
explanation of the problems. It was only during a campaign to
have anti-marijuana laws established that anti-Mexican sentiment
was used to create an ominous mythology surrounding marijuana
use. This complicates a simple conflict theory explanation,
because the real focus was initially on marijuana, and not on a
minority group. </p>

<p>Thus, conflict theory is problematic in describing why there
is a war on drugs. It may help to explain (as Johns (1991)
successfully does) why a War on Drugs continues in the U.S., but
leaves unanswered questions when applied to the Canadian
situation. In the United States, perhaps, there is a stronger
mythology of a racial link with drugs, and if that is so, it
could be that those with power in the U.S. have bought wholly
into the mythology created by their predecessors. It is the
creation of mythology and the social construction of drug
problems and threats that will be discussed next. </p>

<p>Social Construction of a Drug Problem </p>

<p>In the above discussions of the effects of drugs on the user,
it becomes clear that there are two arguments to be made. The
first is that drugs pose a threat that is almost unlimited in its
scope. This group elicits images of 'crack babies', evil, crime,
death and insanity to describe the problem with drugs. </p>

<p>The other group (usually more calmly) sees this as a case of
the Emperor's New Clothes, and points to low self-reported use,
and documented evidence that the 'problem' is created mainly from
the effects of the repressive drug laws themselves. Some in this
second group illustrate how members of the first group may
benefit from their calls of alarm. By doing so, they point out
that the gains to be made from alarming the public are such that
the alarmists actually go out of their way in order to largely
create a social perception of a problem when there is actually no
problem to begin with. This is often referred to as the
construction of a social problem, and will be discussed in this
section. </p>

<p>Jensen and Gerber (1993) write about Prime Minister Mulroney's
statement that &quot;drug abuse has become an epidemic that
undermines our economic as well as our social fabric&quot; (p.
455) as a failed attempt at the social construction of a drug
problem, in order to increase support for his leadership at the
polls. They cite statistics (similar to the one cited above) that
suggest that no epidemic was actually taking place. In their
words, &quot;neither self-reports, official statistics, nor
health-related statistics provide consistent evidence that there
was an epidemic in illicit drug use during the 1980s&quot; (p.
458). </p>

<p>In short, Prime Minister Mulroney had no objective
justification to call Canadians' use of drugs, or the
consequences thereof, an epidemic that suddenly manifested itself
in 1986. What makes this effort a failed one, according to the
authors, was that the drug issue was not high on the agenda of
many Canadians (previous to the PM's speech), and widespread
scepticism of the claims made by the Prime Minister prohibited
any significant social problem to be effectively constructed. </p>

<p>In the United States, however, President Reagan's call for a
War on Drugs seemed to be wildly successful. By 1989, drugs were
seen by 64 per cent of the U.S. population as the leading problem
in the country (Goode, 1990, p. 1088). In periodical literature,
however, a peculiar trend in emphasis on drugs occurred. Articles
on drugs rose almost exponentially in the few years leading up to
President Reagan's announcement, and subsided in the years
following (pp. 1088-1089). Newspapers reflected public concern in
that the number of articles in The New York Times concerning
drugs and drug trafficking increased in 1986, fell slightly in
1987, and then rose dramatically in 1988 and 1989 (p. 1089). It
was clear to Goode that the U.S. was experiencing a moral panic
over the use of drugs. Several researchers, himself included,
asked 'why?, and why now?' and answered that America's problem
with drugs was indeed a social construction (Goode, 1990, p.
1090). This answer was often based on the fact that self-reported
drug use declined in nearly every drug and age category, and was
&quot;strikingly lower than was true for the late 1970s and early
1908s&quot; (P. 1091). </p>

<p>However, Goode also noted that every other objective measure
of the drug problem in the U.S. did rise during the 1980s. These
included personal use of cocaine (and crack) once a week or more,
larger numbers of overdoses, multiple illicit drug use problems
of a medical nature, larger number of arrests where drugs were
concern, and increase in the number of police officers killed in
drug-related incidents, and increase in drug-related homicides,
and a higher number of babies born to cocaine addicted mothers
(pp. 1091-1093). Goode uses this data to argue that social
problems are constructed, but that they can be constructed of
both objective and subjective factors. </p>

<p>Goode's argument that the construction of social problems are
not created out of whole cloth points out the trouble with social
construction theory in certain instances. In the case of Jensen
and Gerber's (1993) study described above, little evidence is
given for the assumption that the PM specifically sought to
increase his standings in the polls, other than reporting that
the public did not support him enough to win an election at that
time. However, two years later, he was re-elected on a
single-issue platform, but that platform was not the drug war.
Perhaps his statement reflects more his reaction to President
Reagan's call for the War on Drugs two days earlier, and a feeble
attempt to test the waters of the opinion of Canadians on the
subject. Also, it seems to be clear (from Goode's data on
periodical publications and newspapers) that Americans were far
more concerned with the problem of drugs shortly before President
Reagan called for a War on Drugs, while Canadians did not share
this concern before PM Mulroney made his remark. </p>

<p>One last point that needs to be discussed is the fact that
deaths and illness resulting from licit drug use are far more
numerous than they are for illicit drug use (Goode, 1991, p.
1094). This points to a question regarding the overwhelming
concern with illicit drugs, especially when that concern is
brought about so dramatically, as was the case with President
Reagan, and somewhat so in the case of PM Mulroney. Johns (1991)
explains this as an effort to keep the mind of the public off the
damage that licit drugs (including alcohol, tobacco and
pharmaceuticals) are doing, by constantly calling for a
continuation of the War on Drugs. </p>

<p>Moral Entrepreneurs and Status Politics </p>

<p>The concepts of moral entrepreneurs and status politics are
closely linked, and are themselves closely linked with the
construction of social problems. Each of these two concepts
requires that one person (in the case of the moral entrepreneur)
or any segment of society (in the case of status politics)
attempts to create rules that others must follow. In doing so,
the rules define who is deviant in a society and who is not. </p>

<p>Boyd (1983) writes that Becker (1963) argued that a study of
deviance should not only study those labelled as deviant, but
also study those who create the label of deviance. The societal
creation of rules can be attributed to the work of a moral
entrepreneur (Boyd, 1983, p. 260). Again, this sometimes requires
a certain amount of speculation on the interests and motives of
the moral entrepreneur. For example, was Mackenzie King a moral
entrepreneur? He certainly thought that he had a great deal of
influence on the early anti-opium legislation, and he depicted
himself as a lone force in getting this legislation passed
(Giffen, et al., 1991, p. 74). Whether this was entirely true
seems, for the most part, to be debatable. Also, his motives seem
to be more in line with legislating a form of social control,
rather than specifically creating a definition of deviance. There
seems to be more data on other groups' attempts to create a
definition of deviance, however. Boyd (1983) points out that
individuals, and not groups or social institutions can be thought
of as moral entrepreneurs (p. 260). </p>

<p>The concept of status politics accommodates groups as well as
individuals. Status politics also merges smoothly with conflict
theory. Status politics deals well in cases where there are few
tangible gains to be made by the dominant group. The gain,
rather, is a symbolic one, in which a particular life style (the
one of the dominant group) is embodied in legislation, whether it
is enforceable or not (Giffen, et al., 1991, p. 17). An example
of this is the legislation which added marijuana to the list of
banned drugs in 1923, even though little, if any, marijuana was
currently in the country. In effect, banning marijuana legislated
a culture and a life style that was free from the crime that had
been associated with marijuana use in the United States at the
time. </p>

<p>CONCLUSION </p>

<p>The politics of drug legislation is a complex web of class,
power, race, fears, social conditions and law. In asking 'why is
there a War on Drugs?', we are also asking a question that begs
for psychological and sociological answers. However, these
answers become more complex the deeper one travels into the
literature, and uncovers more factors which seem to vary over
both time and space. </p>

<p>Alexander's (1990) psychological explanation attempts to
uncover the universal 'truths' that guide the impulses and
emotions of both the drug warriors and the resisters. Here, the
battle is over social control and individual freedom, a problem
J.S. Mill (1859/1978) wrote as having &quot;divided mankind
almost from the remotest ages&quot; (p. 1). Alexander's theory
can help explain that a certain segment of the population wants
very much to curtail individual freedom, by in effect legislating
their morality and fears onto the rest of society. This has much
in common with several of the sociological theories (for example,
conflict theory), but where conflict theory in particular offers
no explanation for (and indeed, neglects) drug use among those in
the dominant group, Alexander's theory allows both for
hypocritical actors, and for the changing roles of the groups
over time. Alexander, in this sense, is quite aware of the fact
that people's motives are independent of their actions, and that
their actions have over time been focused against different
groups, while their motives remain consistent. As well, since the
psychology of the situation is considered, actions can easily be
irrational, and because of this account for actions which have
little material benefit for the drug warrior or the resister. </p>

<p>Conflict theory, on the other hand, has much in common with
Alexander's theory, at least in that there are opposing sides. We
see the same pattern of us-against-them, except that the sides
are more stringently defined. Conflict theory also fills in what
Alexander leaves out, and that is the political and sociological
environment in which these actions take place. </p>

<p>Within conflict theory, the reasons for the drug war are that
the dominant group in society wants to legislate their life style
and culture on others, in order to maintain their hegemony. In
much of the American research, this hegemony comes at the expense
of the minority groups, and the poor. In Canadian research, these
lines of power are much harder to define, and in it there is
little explicit feeling that drug legislation is specifically
directed towards one race or another. The effects of the
legislation were certainly felt by early immigrants to this
country, but the emphasis changed as that members of that group
were no longer available to be persecuted. There is a feeling,
however, that a class distinction is made, in that (as in the
United States) these laws penalize the poor more than they do the
rich. </p>

<p>Also, if the War on Drugs is a social construction, one must
have to consider that it is a superbly constructed one, and one
that has resisted all attempts to disarm it. The temptation to
say that the War on Drugs is simply a social construction,
brought about by status politics is a strong one, however the
motivations of those who successfully created it are sometimes
misinterpreted or misreported. Other times they are simply not
known. Social construction also neglects the way in which a
society can be moved to support even the most preposterous
measures of the War on Drugs. Societal opinions are seen to be
tied by a string of unknown size to the person, or persons doing
the constructing. Again, it is a psychological explanation that
may help to shed light on this process, by examining the ways in
which people's fears and prejudices are manipulated. </p>

<p>At the heart of it all, though, is the intense amount of
morality that is present in any questioning of the reasons that a
War on Drugs is taking place. Even though the War on Drugs takes
place in a largely secular, liberal society such as ours, there
is never a dearth of people who seem to want to fight to the end
to keep prohibitionist laws in place. The statements made by the
drug warriors, or the dominant group (or even the hypocrites who
both decry the use of drugs in others, yet use drugs themselves),
are the only consistent factor that pervades the history of the
War on Drugs. This takes the form of the rhetoric that has been
written and spoken from the earliest times, and it takes many
forms, including drug 'education', flyers, tracts, sermons,
public service announcements, posters... even arcade games flash
out the same messages to arcade-addicted youth. The rhetoric is
the result of the dogma of the War on Drugs, and need not be
associated with any religion in order to prove effective. </p>

<p>Of course, early prohibition laws were not based entirely (or
in some cases, at all) on an explicitly moral basis. But it is
interesting to note that in every case, the morality of drug use
sprang up as justification for the early laws, and the laws that
followed. Conflict theorist have tried to explain at times that
morality, whether in the form of racist attitudes or religious
influence, have caused legislation to be enacted, which is not
always the correct interpretation of the situation. However,
their focus on the legislation as validating the life style and
culture of the dominant group is not without cause, because
imposing the life style and culture on another group is
essentially a moral decision. Indeed, even when the early
legislation focused on suppressing the international trade of
opium, it was a moral decision to curtail one form of economic
activity to benefit another. </p>

<p>Conflict theory also helps to identify the groups that benefit
from anti-drug legislation, whether it be the economic gains made
by multi-national pharmaceutical companies (as Johns (1991)
argues), or symbolic gains made by the dominant group in society,
or even just the satisfaction of seeing some of these laws affect
only a certain, despised group in society. When these gains are
made, unintended effects of the laws (which may be much more
punitive than the laws themselves) are justified through a
feeling of moral superiority that often comes entirely at the
expense of those who suffer as a result. </p>

<p>In sum, morality takes on many faces. It can take the shape of
cultural or economic superiority, and often manifests itself in
the rhetoric of the War on Drugs. It serves many purposes, as
well. It justifies authority and power of those making the laws,
it justifies the economic superiority of those corporations which
make money through the sale of licit drugs, and it justifies
prejudice against subordinates in society. The most interesting
aspect of this morality, though, is that drugs themselves aren't
the focus. The focus is on a large-scale battle between real
people and their core beliefs, and not on evidence, rationality,
or humanity. The War on Drugs, therefore, is at its heart a
battle over a morality that is pervasive on a societal level,
very well-entrenched, and deflects arguments of evidence,
rationality and humanity at the societal level. What may be
needed to defuse the War on Drugs, then, is a grass roots
approach that calls for a re-defined culture and morality
regarding drug use based on the Canadian tradition of a peaceable
society. </p>

<p>Interview with Milton Friedman on the Drug War </p>

<p>The following is an excerpt from &quot;Friedman &amp; Szasz On
Liberty and Drugs.&quot; It is from a 1991 interview on
&quot;America's Drug Forum,&quot; a national public affairs talk
show that appears on public television stations. Randy Paige is
an Emmy Award-winning drug reporter from Baltimore, Maryland;
Professor Milton Friedman has been a Senior Research Fellow at
the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace at Stanford
since 1977, and is considered the leader of the Chicago School of
monetary economics. Professor Friedman won the Nobel Memorial
Prize in Economic Science in 1976, and is also the recipient of
the National Medal of Science and the Presidential Medal of
Freedom by the U.S. government in 1988. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Let us deal first with the issue of legalization
of drugs. How do you see America changing for the better under
that system? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> I see America with half the number of
prisons, half the number of prisoners, ten thousand fewer
homicides a year, inner cities in which there's a chance for
these poor people to live without being afraid for their lives,
citizens who might be respectable who are now addicts not being
subject to becoming criminals in order to get their drug, being
able to get drugs for which they're sure of the quality. You
know, the same thing happened under prohibition of alcohol as is
happening now. </p>

<p>Under prohibition of alcohol, deaths from alcohol poisoning,
from poisoning by things that were mixed in with the bootleg
alcohol, went up sharply. Similarly, under drug prohibition,
deaths from overdose, from adulterations, from adulterated
substances have gone up. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> How would legalization adversely affect America,
in your view? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> The one adverse effect that legalization
might have is that there very likely would be more people taking
drugs. That's not by any means clear. But, if you legalized, you
destroy the black market, the price of drugs would go down
drastically. And as an economist, lower prices tend to generate
more demand. However, there are some very strong qualifications
to be made to that. </p>

<p>The effect of criminalization, of making drugs criminal, is to
drive people from mild drugs to strong drugs. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> In what way? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Marijuana is a very heavy, bulky substance
and, therefore, it's relatively easy to interdict. The warriors
on drugs have been more successful interdicting marijuana than,
let's say, cocaine. So, marijuana prices have gone up, they've
become harder to get. There's been an incentive to grow more
potent marijuana and people have been driven from marijuana to
heroin, or cocaine, or crack. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Let us consider another drug then, and that is
the drug crack. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Crack would never have existed, in my
opinion, if you had not had drug prohibition. Why was crack
created? The preferred method of taking cocaine, which I
understand was by sniffing it, snorting it, became very expensive
and they were desperate to find a way of packaging cocaine... </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> The entrepreneurs? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Of course, they're entrepreneurs. The people
who are running the drug traffic are no different from the rest
of us, except that they have more entrepreneurial ability and
less concern about not hurting other people. They're more
irresponsible in that way. But they're in business and they're
trying to make as much as they can. And they discovered a good
way to make money was to dilute this crack with baking soda or
whatever else--I mean, cocaine, whatever else they do--I don't
know the procedure--so that they could bring it out in five
dollar and ten dollar doses. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Let's talk about that more in a minute. But with
regard to crack, considering the fact that it's very addictive
and considering the fact that... </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> That's very dubious. It is addictive, but I
understand from all the medical evidence that it's no more
addictive than other drugs. In fact, the most addictive drug
everybody acknowledges is tobacco. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Well, let me rephrase that then. All of the
information I've seen on it suggests that it is a drug which is
very pleasurable. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Absolutely, no doubt. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> And the effect of it is also very short. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Yes. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> And it is very expensive because multiple doses
cost a lot of money. My question is: If drugs were legalized and
if crack cocaine were available at a low cost, could it not be
devastating in that it is so pleasurable, I am told, that more
people could get it and stay on it for longer periods of time? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Well, maybe. Nobody can say with certainty
what will happen along those lines. But I think it's very
dubious, because all of the exper- ience with legal drugs is that
there's a tendency for people to go from the stronger to the
weaker and not the other way around, just as you go from regular
beer to light beer. That's the tendency that there is: from
cigar- ettes without filters to low-tar, filtered cigarettes, and
so on. But I can't rule out that what you're saying might happen,
but, and this is a very important but, the harm that would result
from that would be much less than it is now, for several reasons.
The really main thing that bothers me about the crack is not what
you're talking about, it's the crack babies, because that's the
real tragedy. They are innocent victims. They didn't choose to be
crack babies any more than the people who are born with the fetal
alcohol syndrome. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> As you now, we are already experiencing epidemic
proportions of that. One out of every four babies going into one
hospital, I can tell you, in Maryland is addicted. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> But I'll tell you, it isn't that crack babies
are necessarily addicted, but they tend to come in at low birth
weight, they tend to come in mentally impaired, and so on. But
you know that the number who do that from alcohol is much
greater. So, the same problem arises there. That's what bothers
me. </p>

<p>Now suppose you legalized. Under current circumstances, a
mother who is a crack addict and is carrying a baby is afraid to
go the prenatal treatment because she turned herself into a
criminal, she's subject to being thrown in jail. Under legalized
drugs, that inhibition would be off. And, you know, even crack
addicts, mothers, have a feeling of responsi- bility to their
children. </p>

<p>And I have no doubt that under those circumstances, it would
be possible to have a much more effective system of prenatal
care, a much more effective system of trying to persuade people
who are on drugs not to have children or to go off drugs while
they have children. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Let us turn to the early genesis of your belief
that the drug laws may not be working the way the nation would
hope them to. Tell me about the elements that you saw early on
that changed your mind or changed your way of thinking. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Well, I'm not saying &quot;changed.&quot; I
would rather say &quot;formed&quot; my way of thinking, because I
do not recall at any time that I was ever in favor of prohibition
of either alcohol or drugs. I grew up--I'm old enough to have
lived through some part of the Prohibition era. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> And you remember it? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> I remember the occasion when a fellow
graduate student at Columbia from Sweden wanted to take me
downtown to a restaurant for a Swedish meal and introduced me to
the Swedish drink aquavit. This was a restaurant at which this
Swedish fellow had been getting aquavit all during Prohibition;
they had been selling it to him. And this was just after the
repeal of Prohibition. We went there and he asked them for some
aquavit. They said, &quot;Oh, no, we haven't gotten our licence
yet.&quot; And finally, he talked to them in Swedish and
persuaded them to take us into the back where they gave us a
glass of aquavit apiece. Now that shows the absurdity of it. </p>

<p>Prohibition was repealed in 1933 when I was 21 years old, so
was a teenager during most of Prohibition. Alcohol was readily
available. Bootlegging was common. Any idea that alcohol
prohibition was keeping people from drinking was absurd. There
were speakeasies all over the place. But more than that. We had
this spectacle of Al Capone, of the hijackings, of the gang
wars... </p>

<p>Anybody with two eyes could see that this was a bad deal, that
you were doing more harm than good. In addition, I became an
economist. And as an economist, I came to recognize the
importance of markets and of free choice and of consumer
sovereignty and came to discover the harm that was done when you
interfered with them. The laws against drugs were passed in 1914,
but there was no very great enforcement of it. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> That was the Harrison Act? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> The Harrison Act. There was no very great
enforcement of it until after World War II, by which time I had
been able to see the harmful effects of price control, of rent
control, of other attempts for government to interfere with
market things. So, it never occurred to me to be in favor of it. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Was there any single event, anything you
happened to witness that made an impression upon you or was it...
</p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> No, there was no single event. It was a
cumulative effect. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Of course, you know that there are those who say
that when Prohibition was over with, consumption dramatically
increased and that it would be a... </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> I beg your pardon, that's simply not true.
That's not a fact. What is true... </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> It has been argued. That has been argued. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> You have statistically reported figures in
the books on the amount of alcohol consumed. That went up sharply
right after Prohibition, but that was &quot;illegal&quot; alcohol
consumption. If you take, as I have done, the chart of alcohol
consumption before and after Prohibition, alcohol consumption
after Prohibition came back roughly to where it was before, and,
over the course of the period since then, if anything, alcohol
con- sumption has been going down not in absolute terms, but
relative to the population and relative to the growth of income. </p>

<p>For a time, it went up rather slowly, along with income, with
one except- ion. During WW II, it shot way up. But that's what
happened during WW I. Of course, you never would have gotten
Prohibition if you hadn't had all the young men away in France
when the vote was taken, so that the women had an extraordinary
influence on it. But the same thing happened during WW II. And
then after WW II, it settled down again. And more recently, the
con- sumption of alcohol has been going down on a per capita
basis. So, it simply is not true that there was a tremendous
increase. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> So far as drugs itself is concerned, some
years ago, Alaska legalized marijuana. Consumption of marijuana
among high school students in Alaska went DOWN. The Dutch, in
Holland, do not prosecute soft drugs, like marijuana, and they
would prefer not to prosecute hard drugs, but they feel impelled
by the international obligations they've entered into, and
consumption of marijuana by young people has gone down. And,
equally more interesting, the average age of the users of hard
drugs has gone up, which means they're not getting any more new
recruits. </p>

<p>So, the evidence is very mixed. But I have to admit that the
one negative feature of legalizing drugs is that there might be
some additional drug habbits. However, I want to qualify that in
still another way. </p>

<p>The Child who's shot in a slum in a pass-by-shooting, in a
random shooting, is an innocent victim in every respect of the
term. The person who decides to take drugs for himself is not an
innocent victim. He has chosen himself to be a victim. And I must
say I have very much less sympathy for him. I do not think it is
moral to impose such heavy costs on other people to protect
people from their own choices. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> For us to understand the real root of those
beliefs, how about if we just talk a minute about free market
economic perspective, and how you see the proper role of
government in its dealings with the individual. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> The proper role of government is exactly what
John Stuart Mill Said in the middle of the 19th century in
&quot;On Liberty.&quot; The proper role of government is to
prevent other people from harming an individual. Govern- ment, he
said, never has any right to interfere with an individual for
that individual's own good. </p>

<p>The case for prohibiting drugs is exactly as strong and as
weak as the case for prohibiting people from overeating. We all
know that overeating causes more deaths than drugs do. If it's in
principle OK for the government to say you must not consume drugs
because they'll do you harm, why isn't it all right to say you
must not eat too much because you'll do harm? Why isn't it all
right to say you must not try to go in for skydiving because
you're likely to die? Why isn't it all right to say, &quot;Oh,
skiing, that's no good, that's a very dangerous sport, you'll
hurt yourself&quot;? Where do you draw the line? </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Well, I would bet that former drug czar William
Bennet, some other folks along those lines, would probably
suggest that the present sale and distribution of illegal drugs
is, in fact, an enterprise which harms another person and the
government has to step in... </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> [Simultaneously] It does harm a great many...
</p>

<p><b>Paige:</b>...to protect the vulnerable. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> It does harm a great many other people, but
primarily because it's prohibited. There are an enormous number
of innocent victims now. You've got the people whose purses are
stolen, who are bashed over the head by people trying to get
enough money for their next fix. You've got the people killed in
the random drug wars. You've got the corruption of the legal
establishment. You've got the innocent victims who are taxpayers
who have to pay for more and more prisons, and more and more
prisoners, and more and more police. You've got the rest of us
who don't get decent law enforcement because all the law
enforcement officials are busy trying to do the impossible. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> And, last, but not least, you've got the
people of Colombia and Peru and so on. What business do we have
destroying and leading to the killing of thousands of people in
Colombia because we cannot enforce our own laws? If we could
enforce our laws against drugs, there would be no market for
these drugs. You wouldn't have Colombia in the state it's in. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Is it not true that the entire discussion here,
the entire drug problem is an economic problem to... </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> No, it's not an economic problem at all, it's
a moral problem. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> In what way? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> I'm an economist, but the economics problem
is strictly tertiary. It's a moral problem. It's a problem of the
harm which the government is doing. </p>

<p>I have estimated statistically that the prohibition of drugs
produces, on the average, ten thousand homicides a year. It's a
moral problem that the government is going around killing ten
thousand people. It's a moral problem that the government is
making into criminals people, who may be doing something you and
I don't approve of, but who are doing something that hurts nobody
else. Most of the arrests for drugs are for possession by casual
users. </p>

<p>Now here's somebody who wants to smoke a marijuana cigarette.
If he's caught, he goes to jail. Now is that moral? Is that
proper? I think it's absolutely disgraceful that our government,
supposed to be our government, should be in the position of
converting people who are not harming others into criminals, of
destroying their lives, putting them in jail. That's the issue to
me. The economic issue comes in only for explaining why it has
those effects. But the economic reasons are not the reasons. </p>

<p>Of course, we're wasting money on it. Ten, twenty, thirty
billion dollars a year, but that's trivial. We're wasting that
much money in many other ways, such as buying crops that ought
never to be produced. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> There are many who would look at the
economics--how the eco- nomics of the drug business is affecting
America's major inner cities, for example. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Of course it is, and it is because it's
prohibited. See, if you look at the drug war from a purely
economic point of view, the role of the government is to protect
the drug cartel. That's literally true. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Is it doing a good job of it? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Excellent. What do I mean by that? In an
ordinary free market--let's take potatoes, beef, anything you
want--there are thousands of importers and exporters. Anybody can
go into the business. But it's very hard for a small person to go
into the drug importing business because our interdiction efforts
essentially make it enormously costly. So, the only people who
can survive in that business are these large Medellin cartel kind
of people who have enough money so they can have fleets of
airplanes, so they can have sophisticated methods, and so on. </p>

<p>In addition to which, by keeping goods out and by arresting,
let's say, local marijuana growers, the government keeps the
price of these products high. What more could a monopolist want?
He's got a government who makes it very hard for all his
competitors and who keeps the price of his products high. It's
absolutely heaven. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Of course, you know that there are conspiracy
theorists who suggest it's there for a reason, and that's because
governments are in cahoots with the drug runners; you wouldn't
say that. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> No, it's not. I don't say that at all. You
know, over and over again in government policy, good intentions
go awry. And the reason good intentions go awry is because you're
spending somebody else's money. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Many would say that a lot of your theories are
grounded in the notion of personal interest; if it is in an
individual's personal interest to do something, he or she will do
that. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> That's not a theory, and there's nobody who
will deny it. Is there anybody who will deny that you can expect
every person to pursue his own personal interests? Now those
personal interests don't have to be narrow. Mother Theresa is
pursuing her own personal interest just as much as Donald Trump
is pursuing his. But they're both pursuing the personal interest.
</p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Some would say that that notion--that personal
interest is what propels societies as well as people--is a
heartless philosophy and that the underclass would not fare well
under that kind of a notion. You've heard that before. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Yes, of course. But the evidence is so
overwhelming. The only countries in the world in which low income
people have managed to get a halfway decent level of living are
those which rely on capitalist markets. Just compare the quality
of life, the level of living of the ordinary people in Russia and
ordinary people in, I won't say the U.S., but in France, in
Italy, in Germany, in England, or in Hong Kong. Compare Hong Kong
with mainland China. </p>

<p>Every society is driven by personal interest. Mainland China
is driven by personal interest. The question is: How is personal
interest disciplined? If the only way you can satisfy your
personal interest is by getting something that other people want
to pay for. You've got to... </p>

<p>Page: Or by forcing down other people's throats at the point
of a gun, I suppose. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> If you can do it. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> At the extreme. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> At the extreme. But that won't get their
cooperation. You may be able to kill them. You may be able to
take their wealth. But it won't create any more wealth. So, the
only societies which have been able to create broadly based
relative prosperity have been those societies which have relied
primarily on capitalist markets. That's true whether you take
Hong Kong versus mainland China, East Germany versus West
Germany, Czechoslovakia before WW II and current. You cannot find
a single exception to that proposition. </p>

<p>Adam Smith put it best over two hundred years ago, when he
said people who intend only to pursue their self-interest are led
by an invisible hand to promote the public interest even though
that was no part of their intention. Mr. Ford did not develop the
Ford car for the public interest. He did it for his private
interest. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> But Adam Smith also saw a role for government,
for example, in the administration of justice, didn't he? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> So do I. I am not a zero government person. I
think there is a real role of government. And one of the reasons
I object to so many of the things that government has gotten into
is that it prevents government from performing its proper role. A
basic role of government is to keep you from having our house
burgled, to keep you from being hit over the head. And because
the larger fraction of our law enforcement machinery is devoted
to the war on drugs, you haven't got that kind of safety. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> But, of course, there is clearly the argument
that if the police come and pick up a person who is addicted to a
drug and does not have the money to buy those drugs, then they're
also taking a potential burglar off the street who's going to
come and get my house, right? <b>Friedman:</b> They are, but
they'll be more of them coming on, as we know, and besides what
are you going to do with them. Are you going to house them? A
majority of those people who are arrested are simply arrested for
possession, they're casual users. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> However, the sixty-five, seventy-five-year-old
woman who looks out her window and sees drug dealers out in the
street and she sees them carrying guns and selling drugs thirty
feet from her front door has a right to call police and say,
&quot;I want these people off the street.&quot; </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Absolutely. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> And police should take them off the street.
Correct? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Absolutely. But it's a mistake to have a law
which makes that the main function of the police. I don't blame
the police. I don't blame that woman. I don't blame the drug
dealers. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> In what way? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> We put them in a position where that's the
thing to do. When we say to a young man in the ghetto,
&quot;Look, you get a reasonable job at McDonald's or anyplace
else, you'll make five, six, seven dollars an hour. But on the
other hand, here's this opportunity to peddle drugs in the
street.&quot; Why does the juvenile have the opportunity? Because
the law is easier on juveniles than it is on adults. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> But how would you see legalization affecting
poor in this country? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> The poor? It depends on which poor. But in
the main, legalization as such would not have a major effect on
the poor. It would provide better opportunities for the poor by
rendering the inner cities safe and a place where you might have
some decent, proper business. It would provide an opportunity to
do more to improve schooling. The deterior- ation of the
schooling, which is another case of ineffective socialism, has as
much to do with the problems in the inner city as drugs do. Drugs
aren't the only thing at work. </p>

<p>But I don't believe that legalization should be viewed
primarily as a way to help the poor. Legalization is a way to
stop--in our forum as citizens-- a government from using our
power to engage in the immoral behavior of killing people, taking
lives away from people in the U.S., in Colombia and elsewhere,
which we have no business doing. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> So, you see the role of government right now as
being just as deadly as if Uncle Sam were to take a gun to
somebody's head. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> That's what he's doing, of course. Right now
Uncle Sam is not only taking a gun to somebody's head, he's
taking his property without due process of law. The drug
enforcers are expropriating property, in many cases of innocent
people on whom they don't have a real warrant. We're making
citizens into spies and informers. We tell people to call up, you
don't have to give your name, just give your suspicions. That's a
terrible way to run what's supposed to be a free country. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Let us turn in the final few minutes then to
specifically what your vision is then. Under your system, if you
could make a wish and have it come true, what system would that
be? How would you legalize drugs? How would you go about doing
that? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> I would legalize drugs by subjecting them to
exactly the same rules that alcohol and cigarettes are subjected
to now. Alcohol and cigar- ettes cause more deaths than drugs do,
by far, from use, but many fewer innocent victims. And the major
innocent victims, in that case, are the people who are killed by
drunk drivers. And we ought to enforce the law against drunk
driving, just as we ought to enforce the law against driving
under the influence of marijuana, or cocaine, or anything else. </p>

<p>But I would, as a first step at least, treat the drugs exactly
the same way we now treat alcohol and tobacco, no different. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> You know what Representative Charles Rangel
(D-New York) would say. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> I have heard Charles Rangel. He's a
demagogue, who has had no relationship between what he says and
the interests of his own constitu- ents. His own constituents,
the people he serves, are among the people who would be benefited
the most by legalization of drugs. Charles Rangel is pursuing his
own self-interest. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Forgive me for throwing out a name, but I just
wanted to mention a typical response to that would be if you
treat it like alcohol, you're talking about full-page ads in
magazines with cocaine. You're talking about TV advertisers.
You're talking about buying cocaine... </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> I beg your pardon. TV advertising is
forbidden today for alcohol. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> For hard liquor, that's all. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> For hard liquor. And I say treat this the
same way as you would treat Alcohol. So, presumably such ads
would be forbidden for this. </p>

<p>But, of course, in any event I'm not prohibiting anybody from
reading Mr. Rangel, and his ideas are at least as dangerous as
those full-page ads you're talking about. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> What scares you the most about the notion of
drugs being legal? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Nothing scares me about the notion of drugs
being legal. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Nothing. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> What scares me is the notion of continuing on
the path we're on now, which will destroy our free society,
making it an uncivilized place. There's only one way you can
really enforce the drug laws currently. The only way to do that
is to adopt the policies of Saudi Arabia, Singa- pore, which some
other countries adopt, in which a drug addict is subject to
capital punishment or, at the very least, having his hand chopped
off. If we were willing to have penalties like that--but would
that be a society you'd want to live in? </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Do these notions seem obvious to you? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Yes. I have thought about them for a long
time. I have observed behavior in this country and in other
countries for a long time. And I find it almost incredible how
people can support the present system of drug prohibition. It
does so much more harm than good. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> If it is obvious, why is it that you're in such
a minority, particularly among...? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Of course. Very good question. And the answer
is because there are so many vested interests that have been
built up behind the present drug war. Who are the people who are
listened to about drugs? The people who have the obligation to
enforce drug laws. They think they're doing the right thing.
They're good human beings. Everybody thinks what he's doing is
worth doing. Nobody is doing it for evil motives. But it's the
same thing all over the government. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Wouldn't you agree that fear is one of the
strongest supports for the existing drug laws? Fear that, without
them, the bottom would fall out. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Yes, but it's a fake fear and it's a fear
that is promoted. Listen to what the former drug czar, Mr.
Bennet, said. First of all, he stated that consumption of alcohol
after Prohibition has gone up three or fourfold or something. He
was wrong, just factually wrong. He's made all sorts of scare
talk about how many new addicts there would be. He's never
provided a single bit of evidence, never provided any examples of
any other place or anything. But why? Because he's got a job to
do. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Vested interests, you're saying. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Vested interests, self-interest, the same
self-interest that people object to in the market. But in the
market, if you start a project and it goes wrong, you have to
finance it out of your own pocket. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Last question. You have grandchildren. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Absolutely. </p>

<p>You have a two-year-old granddaughter. </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Yes. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> And her name is? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> Her name is Becca. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> When you look at Becca, what do you see for her
and for her future? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> That depends entirely upon what you and your
fellow citizens do to our country. If you and your fellow
citizens continue on moving more and more in the direction of
socialism, not only inspired through your drug prohibition, but
through your socialization of schools, the socialization of
medicine, the regulation of industry, I see for my granddaughter
the equivalent of Soviet communism three years ago. </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> Do you worry about drugs affecting your
granddaughter somehow? </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> I don't worry about drugs, but I worry about
government doing something about drugs. I do not worry about her
getting addicted to drugs. She has good parents. Her parents will
provide her with good role models... </p>

<p><b>Paige:</b> I just mean the violence surrounding the drug
trade, just the... </p>

<p><b>Friedman:</b> The violence is due to prohibition and
nothing else. How much violence is there surrounding the alcohol
trade. There's some, only because we prohibit the sale of alcohol
to children, which we should do, and there's some because we
impose very high taxes on alcohol and, as a result, there's some
incentive for bootlegging. But there's no other violence around
it.<br>

<h1>The Drug War and the Constitution </h1>

<p> <b>by Paul Hager</b> </p>

<p> Following is a transcript of the speech I gave at the ICLU
Conference. I am appending the companion notes to the end. Text
between brackets [] is description or commentary and not part of
the actual transcript. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> I'd like to draw your attention to companion notes that I put
together for this talk. They're located on the tables out back
there, and I think that those of you who are doing CLE have them
in your manuals. </p>

<p> Well, I'm going to attempt to descend into the murky depths
of political philosophy and Constitutional analysis. At the
outset, I do have a caveat: the arguments I am going to be
presenting have never been endorsed by Congress or the courts and
I hope that during the question and answer session we can get
into this in a little bit more detail. </p>

<p> The thesis that I want to advance today is that the drug war
and the laws that prohibit the private consumption of certain
drugs are un-Constitutional. Prohibition laws, themselves,
violate every tenet of limited government that is embodied in our
Constitution. </p>

<p> To begin, let me pose a question: why was it necessary to
amend the Constitution in order to prohibit the drug alcohol?
And, while you are cogitating on that: how is it possible to
prohibit other drugs without going through the formal amendment
process? Well, I think, in order to answer these questions, it's
necessary to take a look at what the Constitution is supposed to
be. </p>

<p> At the recent confirmation hearings of Judge Clarence Thomas
(uh, Clarence Thomas, by the way, -- he and I have at least two
things in common: we're both ex marijuana users [chuckles from
the audience], and we're both married to attorneys) -- in any
case, there was a lot of discussion at the hearings about natural
law and natural rights. Just about all of the participants seemed
to agree that our system recognizes the existence of
&quot;inalienable&quot; natural rights and that government exists
to &quot;secure&quot; those rights for its citizens. It's just as
well that they agreed on that -- the architects of our system of
government, in fact, had that principle in mind, and they viewed
the Constitution as being a blueprint for a limited government in
which those powers that were to be made available to the federal
government would be listed. If a power is not listed in the
Constitution, it is not supposed to be available to the Federal
government. Two hundred odd years ago, when the Bill of Rights --
which we're here to celebrate -- was being debated, there were
those who opposed the Bill of Rights on the grounds that, uh,
they're completely unnecessary. It's redundant -- the rights
already exist and therefore they don't have a place in the
Constitution. In fact, they made the argument that a Bill of
Rights is dangerous because at some future point in time, people
would get the idea that if a right wasn't to be found in the
Constitution -- like privacy -- it did not exist. Perhaps the
best articulation I've ever seen of this principle is to be found
in _The Federalist Papers_. [I hold up a paperback of _The </p>

<p> Federalist Papers_.] Alexander Hamilton writing in Federalist
number 84 -- and I'll just read some of this out to you. He says:
</p>

<p> &quot;... bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in
which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the
proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous.&quot; </p>

<p> And then his argument is: </p>

<p> &quot;For why declare that things shall not be done which
there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said,
that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no
power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not
contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power;
but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to
usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power. They might
urge with a semblance of reason, that the constitution ought not
to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse
of an authority, which was not given, and that the provision
against restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear
implication, that a power to prescribe proper regulations
concerning it, was intended to be vested in the national
government. This&quot;, he concluded, &quot;may serve as a
specimen of the numerous handles which would be given to the
doctrine of constructive powers, by the indulgence of an
injudicious zeal for bills of rights.&quot; </p>

<p> Good writer, Mr. Hamilton. [I gestured with the book and put
it aside.] Well, anyway, as we know, Hamilton's view did not
prevail and 10 of the 12 Amendments that were proposed as a Bill
of Rights were ratified in December of 1791. </p>

<p> In order to mollify critics and meet the arguments of people
like Hamilton, language was added to the Bill of Rights to
address this idea of limited government and natural rights. </p>

<p> I just happen to have a copy of the Constitution here --
don't leave home without it [I hold up my pocket copy of the
Constitution]-- and I'll read the language that bears on this. </p>

<p> &quot;The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights
shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by
the people.&quot; </p>

<p> That's the 9th Amendment, this lays out that whole idea of
rights existing apart from the Constitution. </p>

<p> And then we have: </p>

<p> &quot;The powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to
the States respectively, or to the people.&quot; </p>

<p> That's the 10th Amendment and that has to do with delegation
of powers and the idea of limited government. </p>

<p> Well, let's go back to those questions. I think the answer to
the first question is fairly straightforward -- this idea of
alcohol prohibition. We were talking about a new power that was
being acquired -- surrendered by the people and the states - and
so the 18th Amendment was passed to give that power to the
Federal government. In the case of our second question --
prohibiting other drugs -- I would argue that we are talking
about new powers being granted to the Federal government that
have never been surrendered by the people and the states. Ergo,
the drug war, prohibition laws, the DEA, the whole ball of wax,
are all unconstitutional. I think what we have here is a prime
example of the illegal acquisition of powers by a central
government through a process of slow accretion. And this was
exactly the sort of thing Hamilton was warning against back in
1787. </p>

<p> If it is the case the federal government can't get involved
in the prohibition business, what about the state governments?
Uh, I think one answer to this is to look at the right of privacy
which is protected by the 9th Amendment and extended to the
states by the 14th. The right has been invoked to protect privacy
in such areas as family planning -- birth control -- and, at
least so far, the right of privacy seems to be protecting a
woman's choice whether or not to have an abortion. Furthermore,
this same right should apply in matters involving an individual's
decision to consume, privately, a recreational drug in his or her
home. </p>

<p> One argument that might militate against this idea of a right
of privacy taking precedence might be -- uh, well, what if the
people who use drugs are infringing on the rights of other
people. For example, users of cocaine and opiates. Is there a
compelling state interest -- is there some kind of balancing test
that we can apply that gives the state the right to intervene? </p>

<p> I'd like to pose a hypothetical here that we can use for the
purposes of analysis. Let's posit the existence of a drug that is
100% addicting and potentiates violence in its users 100% of the
time. I think we'd have a very clear case of there being a
compelling state interest to get itself involved in prohibiting
this drug on the grounds that the state is protecting the rights
of the non-users. Well, suppose we begin reducing those
percentages. Let's suppose that we're talking about a drug that
is 15% addictive and potentiates violence in some lesser
percentage of its users. We have an empirical answer for that: </p>

<p> I've just described alcohol. And, just for another for
instance, let's suppose that we have a drug that is 90% addictive
but doesn't seem to correlate with violence at all. Again,
empirically we have an answer: I've just described cigarettes. </p>

<p> I would argue that pharmacological and population data can be
adduced to compare alcohol and tobacco with other drugs like
opiates and cocaine derivatives. And, if we do this, we find that
alcohol is, in fact, more addictive than many forms of opiates
and many forms of cocaine although less addictive than crack
cocaine. Furthermore, smoked tobacco is generally recognized as
being the most addictive drug around. That other area, having to
do with violence and anti-social behavior, once again we find
that the drug that is the greatest potentiator of violent
behavior is alcohol. And if we look at the other drugs like
opiates and cocaine, we find that most of the violence that is
associated with these drugs is associated with the black
market/organized crime component of the drug trade and is not a
pharmacological feature of the drug itself. </p>

<p> Well, I'm the political coordinator of the Hoosier Cannabis
Re-legalization Coalition, and I haven't said a word about
marijuana yet and I probably should -- uh -- marijuana, which is
the Nation's number one illegal drug, which is estimated to have
been used by over 60 million people, is recognized as being
relatively non-addictive. For a point of comparison, if we look
at the common drug caffeine -- which I was dosing myself with
earlier today -- caffeine, which is in coffee and soft drinks, is
generally recognized as being more addictive than marijuana. </p>

<p> Furthermore, no scientific evidence has ever been brought
forth that would support the idea that marijuana leads to
violent, anti-social behavior. Thus, by no stretch of the
imagination is there a rational or scientific justification for
marijuana prohibition and, perforce, there is no marijuana
prohibition law that passes Constitutional muster. Moreover,
using alcohol and tobacco as our metrics, even heroin and crack
prohibition cannot be justified. </p>

<p> At this point, it's probably time to boldly go where no
Constitutional interpreter has gone before and so I'm going to
move into more speculative areas. The 1st Amendment, which
protects religion and speech, I think also by extension protects
thought and belief. Well, what is the seat of religion, thought
and belief? [A pregnant pause.] The brain, right? [Tapping my
cranium.] In fact, speech and belief are manifestations of the
internal state of a person's brain. Science is beginning to
inform us as to how chemicals and neurotransmitters, indeed the
physical &quot;wiring&quot; of our brain defines who we are and
how we think. Unless we get involved in metaphysics I think we
have to recognize that there is physical basis for belief. Where
I'm heading with this is that, if it is the case that your
physical brain state determines whether you are a Methodist, an
agnostic, or a Nazi then clearly the state of your brain is
protected in some sense. The question I'd like to put to you is:
if it is the case that the 1st Amendment allows a person to alter
his or her cognitive system by reading &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; --
which might well alter it permanently, you might become a Nazi
for the rest of your life -- then how is it possible for the
government to step in and say that a person may not temporarily
alter his or her cognitive system for two or three hours by
smoking a marijuana joint? [Scattered applause.] Also, another
way of looking at this same thing is, what is the rationale for
saying that programming your brain across the visual or aural
pathways is OK but programming your brain _chemically_ across the
blood-brain barrier is not? </p>

<p> And finally -- uh, and I think that this is the most
frightening prospect in this whole thing -- consider this: if a
state government can come up to you and can say, you may not pass
delta-9-THC -- the principal intoxicant in marijuana - you cannot
pass that across your blood-brain barrier, what is to prevent a
state from saying at some point in the future, you _must_ pass
drug X -- let's call it soma like in _Brave New World_ -- you
must pass soma across your blood-brain barrier? I guess what I'm
arguing is that the government has intruded into your biochemical
and physiological brain and in principle, once the government can
do this, then in principle the government can control any part of
your body. </p>

<p> I think I've just about wrapped up the general comments I
wanted to make. One thing I might suggest: we might also talk
about some specific areas where government has been in violation
of Constitutional rights all at the behest of this drug war. </p>

<p> Thank you. </p>

<p> The Drug War and the Constitution </p>

<p> by Paul Hager </p>

<p> Companion Notes </p>

<p> By focusing on the Constitutional dimension of drug
prohibition, I've attempted to approach the issue from a
different perspective. In claiming that the drug war and drug
prohibition violate the U.S. Constitution and fundamental
principles of civil liberty I am aware that there is a dearth of
present day case law to support my arguments. Instead, I have
relied on the writings of Hamilton, Madison, and Jay in The
Federalist Papers and, to a lesser extent, selected writings of
Thomas Jefferson that appear in Jefferson: Writings (Merrill D.
Peterson wrote the notes and selected text, ISBN 0-940450-16-X). </p>

<p> I assert that current prohibitionist policy entails a grant
of power to government that was never contemplated and was, in
fact, explicitly rejected by the framers of the Constitution. </p>

<p> The Harrison Act of 1914 was the first major step by the
Federal government in the direction of drug prohibition. The 18th
Amendment and the enabling legislation of the Volsted Act were to
come later, in 1919 and 1920 respectively. An excellent analysis
of the case law interpreting the Harrison Act is to be found in
Arnold S. Trebach's book, The Heroin Solution (Yale University
Press, 1982, ISBN 0-300-02773-7), chapter 6. For a short overview
of drug prohibition &quot;cycles&quot; in U.S. History, and the
place of the Harrison Act in them, see &quot;Opium, Cocaine, and
Marijuana in American History&quot;, by David F. Musto,
Scientific American, July 1991, volume 265, number 1. </p>

<p> An excellent source on the &quot;heroin problem&quot; and
possible solutions is The Hardest Drug: Heroin and Public Policy
, by John Kaplan (University of Chicago Press, 1983, ISBN
0-226-42427-8). Professor Kaplan devotes the first two chapters
of the book to exploding the myths about heroin's addictiveness
and dangers that have been used to justify its prohibition.
Kaplan also argues that the Harrison Act was in large part
responsible for the development of many of the social problems
that we now associate with heroin use and considers the Act to
have been a mistake. Unaccountably (given the foundation he
lays), Kaplan shies away from legalization strategies completely
and offers heroin maintenance programs with possible coercive
treatment as his alternative to the present approach. Arnold
Trebach, on the other hand, argues in his book that doctors
should be allowed to prescribe heroin to addicts as needed and to
include heroin in their pharmacopoeia. Trebach's legal analysis
of the Harrison Act (mentioned above) is used to buttress his
argument in favor of a liberal interpretion of the Act.
Interestingly, Kaplan, who considers the Act to have been a
mistake, favors a much more restrictive solution than does
Trebach who considers the Harrison Act to have been an
appropriate piece of social engineering. </p>

<p> On the subject of marijuana, John Kaplan is also the author
of a book entitled Marijuana -- the New Prohibition (1970).
Kaplan argued convincingly for marijuana decriminalization in
this book. Arnold Trebach is currently the head of the Drug
Policy Foundation, an organization that seeks alternatives to the
drug war. The organization generally favors full legalization of
marijuana but embraces a variety of opinion regarding changes in
the legal status of other drugs. </p>

<p> The issue of &quot;addictiveness&quot; of drugs is
complicated. The term itself has fallen into disfavor among the
scientific establishment and &quot;drug dependence&quot; is
generally preferred. I will stick with the more common term for
simplicity. It turns out that the picture of addiction that is a
favorite with police departments and drug czars is far from
accurate. In &quot;The Tragedy of Needless Pain&quot;, (by Ronald
Melzack, February 1990, Scientific American), scientific evidence
is presented that morphine used for pain relief is not addictive.
Trebach notes statistics that gave a rate of 500,000 heroin
addicts and 3,500,000 &quot;chippers&quot; or non-addicted
occasional users in the late 1970's which would mean a 12.5%
addiction rate. Laboratory studies show a higher rate but these
studies use medical grade, pure heroin. In Health Consequences of
Smoking: Nicotine Addiction (Surgeon General's Report, 1988), a
comparison is made of the relative addictiveness of smoked
tobacco and several other drugs (the 15% figure for alcohol comes
from this source). The Surgeon General's Report observes that of
service men who became addicted to heroin in Vietnam,
aproximatedly 90% were able to avoid readdiction upon return to
the U.S. The report also mentions the frequency of
&quot;chipping&quot; in heroin use but notes that nonaddicted
cigarette users are exceedingly rare. The addiction rate of 90%
for cigarette smokers also derives from the Surgeon General's
Report. </p>

<p> Other sources that give some picture of comparative addiction
include &quot;Drug Prohibition in the United States: Costs,
Consequences, and Alternatives&quot; by Ethan Nadelmann (Science,
September 1, 1989). In building his case for drug legalization,
Nadelmann cites National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) research
that gives a surprisingly low value for cocaine addiction rates. </p>

<p> A more complete comparision of addictive potentional is to be
found in the magazine, In Health, in an article entitled
&quot;Hooked, not Hooked&quot; by Deborah Franklin (Nov/Dec
1990). Franklin cites addiction experts' rankings of various
legal and illegal drugs as follows (p. 41): </p>

<p> 1) Nicotine </p>

<p> 2) &quot;Ice&quot; (smoked methamphetamine) </p>

<p> 3) Crack </p>

<p> 4) Crystal Meth (injected methamphetamine) </p>

<p> 5) Valium (diazepam) </p>

<p> 6-8) Quaalude </p>

<p> 6-8) Seconal (secobarbital) </p>

<p> 6-8) Alcohol </p>

<p> 9-10) Crank (snorted methamphetamine) </p>

<p> 9-10) Heroin </p>

<p> 11) Cocaine </p>

<p> 12) Caffeine </p>

<p> 13) PCP </p>

<p> 14) Marijuana </p>

<p> 15) Ecstasy (MDMA) </p>

<p> 16-18) Psilocybin Mushrooms </p>

<p> 16-18) LSD </p>

<p> 16-18) Mescaline </p>

<p> (The rankings as they appear in the magazine are in the form
of a bar graph -- I've converted them to a rank ordering. Note
also that, although amphetamine is broken down according to the
method of administration, other drugs with multiple modes of
administration are not. I.V. injection will, for a number of
reasons, be more addicting than oral ingestion. Concentration is
also an important factor as well. Although the
&quot;potency&quot; of heroin is considered to be 3 to 4 times
that of morphine, heroin is actually diacetylmorphine -- morphine
reacted with acetic anhydride. In the body, heroin breaks down to
morphine in order to produce its effect. Apparently, the
&quot;potency&quot; of heroin is the result of the ease with
which heroin crosses the blood-brain barrier before it breaks
down to morphine.) </p>

<p> The Drug Policy Letter, Vol II, number 2, Mar/Apr 1990 (a
newsletter published by the Drug Policy Foundation) uses a back-
of-the-envelope calculation to expose the myth that &quot;crack
is the most addictive drug known to man.&quot; It is often said
that if one uses crack just once, a person is addicted. According
to the NIDA-sponsored National Household Survey, 2.5 million
people have tried crack, and 480,000 used it in the month prior
to the survey. Even if one assumed that anyone who used the drug
in the past month was an addict, that would still give an
addiction rate of only 19%. Using this same method for alcohol
would give a 62% rate and, for powdered cocaine a 13% addiction
rate. Though this is not the sort of analysis that should be used
to gauge addiction rates, it does give the lie to the &quot;one
puff and you're hooked&quot; claim. </p>

<p> A number of the sources cited above present evidence that
violent criminal activity associated with heroin and cocaine use
is actually the result of the high cost of the drugs coupled with
the low socio-economic status of inner-city addicts. In other
words, violent crime is not a pharmacological feature of the drug
itself but a reflection of black market economics. The same Drug
Policy Letter cited above also reports on research done by
Goldstein, Brownstein, Ryan, and Bellucci on the drug component
of violence in New York City. They found that only a very small
proportion of drug-related murders were a function of the drug
itself and most of those were caused by alcohol. Heroin and other
opiates, in particular, are well known to not provoke aggressive
or violent behavior in people under the influence. </p>

<p> Two monographs by Professor Bruce L. Benson and Professor
David W. Rasmussen of the Policy Sciences Program of Florida
State University in Tallahassee give another view of drug use and
violent crime from the perspective of incarceration rates in
Florida. Benson and Rasmussen find that the overwhelming number
of people who have been arrested for a drug offense have no
arrest history for a violent or property crime. (See &quot;Drug
Offenders in Florida&quot;, July 1990, and &quot;Drug Crime and
Florida's Criminal Justice Problem&quot;, December 1990.) This is
not the result one would expect if the drug-violent crime
connection were as intertwined as apologists for the drug war
would have us believe. </p>

<p> Notes on Additional Materials </p>

<p> Along with these notes, I'm including two additional items.
The first is &quot;Marijuana Myths&quot;, a collection of some
typical anti-marijuana and D.A.R.E. Program falsehoods and their
refutation. Each of the numbered refutation sections has an
associated reference section which will allow readers to check my
sources. The second item is Report #126 of the ABA Law Student
Division which recommended that the ABA reverse its 18 year
position favoring marijuana decriminalization. Report #126 offers
no references of any kind, scientific or otherwise. This is
understandable because most of its assertions are without
scientific foundation. If this represents the sort of evidence
that is considered acceptable for a major policy reversal of the
ABA, I believe it reflects badly on the level of scholarship
practiced by the national organization. </p>

<p> One item that appears in #126 deserves a comment. Much is
made of the increased potency of marijuana. In the Journal of
Psychoactive Drugs, Vol. 20(1), Jan-Mar 1988, Tod Mikuriya, M.D.
and Michael Aldrich, Ph.D. address this matter in &quot;Cannabis
1988 Old Drug, New Dangers The Potency Question.&quot; In a
careful piece of research, Mikuriya and Aldrich demonstrate that
a review of independent, contemporary assays of imported
marijuana from the early 70's show it was every bit as potent as
modern domestic sensimilla varieties. (Anyone who has personal
experience with Thai Sticks, Panama Red, and Oaxacan in the
period from the late 60's to early 70's can attest to the potency
of the imports.) They also reveal that improper DEA and police
evidence handling techniques (e.g., no refrigeration of seized
marijuana) led to an underestimate of street potency in the 1970s
because samples degraded rather quickly in evidence warehouses.
Besides the country's illicit experience with marijuana, Mikurya
and Aldrich point to the extremely potent forms of cannabis
(i.e., marijuana) tonics that were in common use in the United
States prior to marijuana prohibition in the 1930's. Such tonics
were frequently given to children with no reported ill effects.
Eli-Lilly and Parke, Davis, &amp; Co. entered into a
&quot;joint&quot; venture to produce a potent strain of domestic
cannabis sativa for their cannabis pharmaceuticals which they
called cannabis americana (note: a picture of the 1929
Parke-Davis catalogue for &quot;Cannabis U.S.P.&quot; can be
found on page 113 of Dr. Andrew Weil's book, Chocolate to
Morphine: Understanding Mind-Active Drugs, written with Winifred
Rosen, 1983, ISBN 0-395 -33108-0). Parke-Davis claimed uniform
effectiveness for their cannabis extract at a 10 milligram dose
level (the effective dose of pure delta-9-THC, the main
cannabinoid, is between 25 and 50 micrograms per kilogram). For
those who appreciate irony, take note that Parke-Davis, which
used to make a profit from selling legal cannabis, now makes
money from marketing drug testing kits which primarily detect
marijuana use. <br>

<h1 align="center">Crime and the Drug War</h1>

<h2 align="center"><i>by </i><a
href="http://www.students.uiuc.edu/~cundiff/"><i>Kirby R. Cundiff</i></a><i>,
Ph.D.</i></h2>

<hr size="5">

<p align="center">Appeared in: <b>Claustrophobia</b>, August 1994
</p>

<hr size="5">

<p>In 1907, when Georgia and Oklahoma made the manufacture, sale,
or transportation of intoxicating liquors illegal state wide, the
homicide rate in the United States was 1 person per 100,000 per
year.<i>[2]</i> Before the end of the decade, 13 states plus
Alaska, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia had gone dry.<i>[6]</i>
By 1919--when the 18th amendment was passed, making alcohol use
illegal nationwide--the homicide rate had grown to 8 per 100,000.
The murder rate climbed steadily until it peaked at 10 per
100,000 around 1933, when our nation admitted its mistake, and
repealed the 18th amendment. By 1943 the homicide rate had
drastically shrunk to 5 per 100,000 and stayed near that level
until 1964 when the United States made the same mistake all over
again (<a href="http://www.students.uiuc.edu/~cundiff/homic.gif">
see graphic</a>).<i>[2]</i></p>

<p>In December of 1964, having been ratified by 40 countries, the
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 went into effect
restricting narcotic drug use to medical and scientific purposes.
It also internationally banned narcotic drug trade outside of
government monopolies.<i>[8]</i> History was about to repeat
itself. From 1964 to 1970 in the United States, the number of
state prisoners incarcerated for drug offenses more than doubled
from 3,079 to 6,596 (it was 90,000 in 1989)<i>[9]</i>, and the
new concentration on enforcing victimless crimes caused the
homicide rate to skyrocket. Between 1964 and 1970 the homicide
rate doubled from 5 per 100,000 to 10 per 100,000, where it has
remained, with minor fluctuations, until today.<i>[2]</i> Lyndon
Johnson had declared war on drugs, to be followed by Richard
Nixon declaring War on Drugs in 1969, Ronald Reagan declaring War
on Drugs in 1982, and George Bush declaring War on Drugs in 1989.<i>[4]</i></p>

<p>At the turn of the century, both heroin and aspirin were
legally available and sold for approximately the same amount.
Today aspirin can be purchased at the corner drug store for 20
cents per gram; heroin costs $50 per gram. <i>[p. 33, 3]</i> The
price of heroin rose drastically after it was made illegal due to
the dangers involved in its sale. Dealers are willing to kill
each other for profits obtained from such a lucrative market;
junkies are willing to rob and kill for money to support their
habit--money, if drugs were legal and cheap, that they could
easily obtain by working at McDonald's. You and I, through high
crime rates caused by the War on Drugs and high tax rates used to
support the War on Drugs, pay the price. During prohibition
&quot;liquor store&quot; owners murdered each other to protect
their turf just as drug dealers do today. Today, liquor store
owners are generally peaceful. Eliminating the enormous profits
involved in black-market businesses eliminates the motive for
violent crime, and therefore the violent crime.</p>

<p>More law enforcement is commonly touted as the answer to
America's violent crime problem. Since 1970 the percentage of the
American population in prison has tripled with no noticeable
effect on the homicide rate.<i>[2]</i> More than 1.3 million
citizens are now in jail.<i>[p. 24, 3]</i> The United States has
a larger percentage of its population in prison than any other
nation<i>[2]</i>, and still maintains the highest homicide rate
in the industralized world. [1] We have even thrown away parts of
our constitution in the name of fighting crime. Asset forfeiture
laws allow law enforcement officers to seize the property of
American citizens without even charging them with a crime, even
though the 5th amendment to the constitution clearly states
&quot;No person shall be...deprived of life, liberty, or
property, without due process of law...&quot; Of course if you
want your property back you do have the right to post a bond and
try to prove yourself innocent, of a crime you have not even been
charged with, in a court of law. No attorney will be provided for
you if you cannot afford one. Over $2.4 billion worth of assets
have been seized since 1985, $664 million in 1991 alone--and in
80% of the cases no charges were ever filed.<i>[7]</i></p>

<p>Disparities between the poor and the rich are often considered
causes of our high crime rate, but the United States has not only
one of the world's highest crime rates, but also one of the
world's largest middle classes. The religious right claims
America's huge crime rate is caused by a break-down of family
values. This would require family values breaking down suddenly
in 1907, returning in 1933, and suddenly breaking down again in
1964. Many liberals believe that America's large crime rate is
due to our lack of gun-control laws, but America's gun-control
policy has changed little throughout this century. There is no
way gun control can explain the enormous fluctuations in
America's homicide rate. The United States government's substance
control policies are the only answer. The only way to lower
America's violent crime rate, short of turning the United States
into a totalitarian state, is through ending the War on Drugs.</p>

drugs in America include: <a

<h2>It's Time for New Battle Plan in the Losing War on Drugs</h2>

<p>by Judge James P. Gray<br>
<br>
Our great country is reeling from self inflicted wounds resulting
from our<br>
current failed &quot;war on drugs.&quot; It is clear that we are
not in better shape<br>
today than we were five years ago regarding drug use and abuse
and all of<br>
the crime and misery that accompany them. Unless we change our
approach,<br>
we can have no legitimate expectation that we will be in better
shape next<br>
year than we are today.<br>
However, we will not pursue change until we realize, as a
country, that it<br>
is all right to talk about this issue-and that just because we
talk about<br>
the possibility of changing our drug policy does not mean that we
condone<br>
drug use or abuse.<br>
During the election season, let us as voters challenge all
candidates for<br>
all offices to take a fresh and objective look at our most basic
drug<br>
policy assumptions and recommend changes based upon the evidence.
Let us<br>
tell all candidates in the clearest of terms that it is not only
all right,<br>
but it is essential to discuss this critical issue openly fully.<br>
In the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; victory is now literally being
viewed as slowing<br>
down the pace of defeat. Our present policy has made cocaine the
most<br>
lucrative crop in the history of mankind. It has made marijuana
the most<br>
lucrative crop in California, easily outdistancing the
second-leading crop,<br>
which is corn.<br>
Our present policy is directly funneling tens of billions of
dollars per<br>
year into organized crime, with all of its accompanying violence
and<br>
corruption both in our country and around the world. Our present
policy is<br>
directly causing our children in the inner cities and virtually
everywhere<br>
else to have drug dealers as their role models, instead of people
who have<br>
gotten their education and worked hard to be successful.<br>
Our present policy has at the same time both increased street
crime and<br>
diverted scarce resources away from its prosecution. Our present
policy<br>
has directly spawned a cycle of hostility by the incarceration of
vastly<br>
disproportionate numbers of minority groups. And our present
policy is<br>
directly responsible for medical doctors being unable to
prescribe<br>
appropriate medications for their patients who are either in pain
or are<br>
suffering from a number of devastating diseases.<br>
If there is any universal agreement in any area of drug policy,
it is that<br>
the education of our young and our not so young people is
critically<br>
important in combating drug abuse, and that to an appreciable
degree for<br>
non-addicted users, it works. Social pressure is another
effective<br>
deterrent to drug abuse, as is drug treatment, which has been
determined by<br>
the Rand Corp. in a 1994 study to be seven times more effective
than drug<br>
prosecution, even for addicted drug users.<br>
Similarly, education. social pressure and treatment have been
effective in<br>
decreasing the use of other dangerous and sometimes addictive
drugs, such<br>
as alcohol and tobacco-even though these drugs are not illegal
for adults. <br>
It may be that the recently documented increased use of marijuana
by<br>
teenagers, and the frustration and resignation shown by their
parents, has<br>
resulted from less emphasis upon drug education. If so, maybe we
should at<br>
least consider investing our increasingly scarce resources where
they will<br>
be most productive, instead of routinely continuing to spend
enormous and<br>
never-ending tax dollars on the incarceration of nonviolent drug
users.<br>
All responsible citizens understand the necessity of holding
people<br>
accountable for their actions. However, our citizens are becoming<br>
increasingly aware that the criminal justice system is simply not
able to<br>
make meaningful progress in this area because of the obscene
profits to be<br>
made in selling illegal drugs.<br>
As a result, thousands of Americans such as Dr. Milton Friedman,
former<br>
Secretary of State George Shultz, Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore
and<br>
former San Jose Chief of Police Joseph McNamara have signed a
resolution<br>
calling for the investigation of change by a neutral commission.<br>
This resolution actually was passed by Congress and signed into
law by<br>
President Clinton as a part of the recent crime bill; however, it
has been<br>
widely ignored since that time. The signatories of the resolution
include<br>
large numbers of judges; civic, business and religious leaders;
probation<br>
officers and prison officials, medical doctors, teachers and
counselors. <br>
There is wide support for the investigation of change-our present
policy<br>
simply will not stand scrutiny.<br>
We are the ones who elect our governmental officers, so the
responsibility<br>
for their silence and inaction is ours to bear. However, this can
be<br>
changed. Let all candidates know that we voters understand that
the honest<br>
exchange of information is the only way we will begin to reduce
the<br>
continuing harm wrought by these dangerous drugs in our country.
Tell them<br>
we demand that the law be followed and the neutral commission be
appointed.<br>
If we the voters demand that these important issues be discussed,
our<br>
leaders will follow.<br>

<p>An open letter to the nation's drug czar<br>
<br>
General Barry McCaffrey<br>
Director, Office of Drug Policy<br>
The White House<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear Gen. McCaffrey:<br>
Our great country is reeling from wounds which we have been
inflicting upon<br>
ourselves because of our current failed drug policy. It is clear
that we<br>
are not in better shape today than we were five years ago
regarding drug<br>
use and abuse and all of the crime and misery which accompany
them, and,<br>
unless we change our approach, we can have no legitimate
expectation that<br>
we will be in better shape next year than we are today. However,
we will<br>
not pursue change until we realize, as a country, that it is all
right to<br>
talk about this issue - and that just because we talk about the
possibility<br>
of changing our drug policy does not mean that we condone drug
use or<br>
abuse.<br>
Change for the better starts with a leader who has a proven
record of<br>
honesty, dedication, experience, and results - one who will be
able to<br>
discuss realities without effectively being labeled as
&quot;soft&quot; on crime or<br>
criminals. Our country desperately needs a person in authority
who will<br>
not be afraid to take a fresh and objective look at our most
basic<br>
assumptions and recommend changes based upon the evidence. Our
country<br>
needs you.<br>
You are known to be an intelligent, non-political, dedicated
public servant<br>
who is in that position of authority and respect.<br>
If you would speak about our country's futile efforts to
eradicate the<br>
growing of these dangerous drugs in, and the shipping of them
from, various<br>
foreign countries, people in and out of our government will
listen.<br>
<br>
If you would quote the Rand Corporation study of June, 1994,
which<br>
concluded that drug treatment is seven times more effective than
drug<br>
prosecution even for heavy drug users and 11 times more effective
than<br>
interdiction at our country's borders, people will begin to
realize why we<br>
are going broke trying to incarcerate our way out of this
pervasive and<br>
multi-faceted problem.<br>
<br>
If you would acknowledge that no one in law enforcement will even
tell us<br>
with a straight face that we seize more than 10 percent of the
illegal<br>
drugs in our society and that the more candid estimate is that we
seize<br>
only about five percent, our people will begin to understand that
each<br>
seizure of a ton of cocaine is not a victory, but is instead
merely a<br>
symptom of the depth of the problem.<br>
Our citizens and taxpayers will then realize that for every ton
of cocaine<br>
we seize, we easily fail to seize between nine and 19 tons.<br>
In the War on Drugs, victory is now literally being viewed as
slowing down<br>
the pace of defeat.<br>
Our present policy has made cocaine the most lucrative crop in
the history<br>
,of mankind. It has made marijuana the most lucrative crop in my
home<br>
state of California, easily outdistancing the second leading
crop, which is<br>
corn.<br>
Our present policy is directly responsible for the material and<br>
demonstrable reduction of our cherished liberties under the Bill
of Rights.<br>
Our present policy is directly funneling tens of billions of
dollars per<br>
year into organized crime, with all of its accompanying violence
and<br>
corruption, both in our country and around the world.<br>
Our present policy is directly causing our children in the inner
cities and<br>
virtually everywhere else to have drug dealers as their role
models,<br>
instead of people like you who have gotten their education and
who have<br>
worked hard to be successful.<br>
Our present policy has directly spawned a cycle of hostility by
the<br>
incarceration of vastly disproportionate numbers of our minority
groups.<br>
<br>
And our present policy is directly responsible for medical
doctors being<br>
unable to prescribe appropriate medications for their patients
who are<br>
either in pain or are suffering from a number of devastating
diseases.<br>
We all understand the necessity of holding people accountable for
their<br>
actions. However, our citizens recognize that what we are doing
in the<br>
critical area of drug policy is not working. They are frustrated
because<br>
their ostensible leaders are afraid to discuss the subject
openly.<br>
As a result, thousands of Americans such as Dr. Milton Friedman,
former<br>
Secretary of State George Shultz, Mayor Kurt Schmoke of
Baltimore, and<br>
former San Jose Chief of Police Joseph McNamara have signed a
resolution<br>
calling for the investigation of change by a neutral commission.<br>
This resolution actually was passed by Congress and signed into
law by<br>
President Clinton as a part of the recent crime bill; however, it
has been<br>
widely ignored since that time. The signatories include a
formidable list<br>
of judges; civic, business, and religious leaders; probation
officers and<br>
prison officials; medical doctors; teachers; and counselors.
There is wide<br>
support for the investigation of change - our present policy
simply will<br>
not stand scrutiny. However, our country needs a credible person
in<br>
government like you to step forward and legitimize the
discussion.<br>
We do not ask you to support any particular method or approach
for<br>
addressing the drug problem. We simply ask you to agree that
there are<br>
fundamental problems with our current policy and that both our
government<br>
and our citizens need better to understand the history and social
forces<br>
which drive this problem, and our options for the future.<br>
We need to investigate the possibility of change. Education and
the honest<br>
exchange of information are the only ways we will begin to reduce
the<br>
continuing harm wrought by these dangerous drugs in our country.<br>
Accordingly, we ask you publicly to join us in a non-partisan and<br>
non-political search for the truth. If you would do this, you
simply could<br>
not provide our country and all of its people with a greater or
more<br>
lasting service. </p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Judge James P. Gray<br>
Judge Gray is a judge in the Superior Court of California in
Orange County.<br>

<p>From: Opinion Section, Orange County Register<br>
September 10, 1996<br>
<br>
A view from the front lines of the drug war<br>
<br>
by Volney V. Brown Jr.<br>
<br>
Mr. Brown, who lives in Dana Point, was a US Magistrate in Los
Angeles from<br>
1982 to 1995.<br>
<br>
In his open letter to the Register of Aug. 12, Superior Court
Judge James<br>
Gray observed that drug law enforcement has been unable to stop
the flow of<br>
street drugs.<br>
He called for us to reason together to have dialogue on the
subject of<br>
illicit drug use - before again mindless ly escalating the war on
drugs,<br>
which diverts tax money from other programs, arguably promotes
general<br>
crime, and has a tendency to impair the civil liberties of every
American.<br>
The published response of Register readers was quite negative.
Despite the<br>
evidence, they &quot;feel&quot; that the drug war can still be
won by more arrests<br>
and ever-longer sentences.<br>
Well, I have fought the drug wars, and I am coming out of
retirement to say<br>
that Judge Gray is right. What is wrong with drug law enforcement
is that<br>
it has never worked, and it never will.<br>
In his first term, President Richard Nixon declared war on
illicit drugs,<br>
particularly heroin, and sharply increased drug law enforcement.<br>
He directed Attorney General Richard Kleindeinst to create a new
entity,<br>
patterned on the Organized Crime Strike Forces, named Office for
Drug Abuse<br>
Law Enforcement. The president designated Myles Ambrose, the
heavy-hitter<br>
then in charge of the Bureau of Customs, as ODALE director, with
the twin<br>
titles of special assistant attorney general and special
assistant to the<br>
president. Ambrose thus became the nation's first &quot;drug
czar.&quot;<br>
ODALE greatly supplemented the efforts of existing federal,
state, and<br>
local drug law enforcement agencies so that illicit drug sales
could be<br>
ended once and for all.<br>
Because of my earlier experience as a federal prosecutor, I was
recruited<br>
out of private law practice is ODALE regional director for
California,<br>
Arizona, and Nevada. I established offices at San Francisco, Los
Angeles,<br>
San Diego, and Phoenix (each headed by a tough drug prosecutor),
with a<br>
combined staff of some 150 attorneys, drug agents, and support
personnel.<br>
We decided to test the effectiveness of simultaneously arresting
every drug<br>
seller on the streets of an isolated city, and picked Phoenix for
the<br>
exercise.<br>
Using more &quot;buy money&quot; than Arizona had ever seen
before, we bought into<br>
each street dealer we could find, two or three times each. It
turned out<br>
that Phoenix had 76 drug pushers. In the middle of a week night,
with the<br>
help of state and local police, we arrested all 76 at the same
time.<br>
For a week it was impossible to buy drugs on the streets of
Phoenix. The<br>
single local drug treatment program was swamped. Addicts who
could not get<br>
treatment left town to score elsewhere.<br>
But on the eighth day, new street pushers began to appear in the
city, and<br>
before a month had elapsed, it was business-as-usual. We had
spent tens of<br>
thousands of federal tax dollars, and sent scores of pushers to
prison, but<br>
there was no lasting effect on the availability or price of
illicit drugs.<br>
So, in San Diego, we tried another trick. We in ODALE learned
that<br>
virtually all of the heroin there was being sold by a known gang.
State<br>
and local police had been unable to bust the gang because the
only really<br>
effective investigative tool - a court-ordered wire tap - was
prohibited by<br>
California law.<br>
Because our federal program was not inhibited by state law, our
in-house<br>
lawyers applied for and obtained a federal wire tap order. After
thousands<br>
of employee hours at a command center manned around the clock, we
arrested<br>
all 39 members of the drug gang.<br>
For a week it was impossible to buy heroin on the streets of San
Diego. <br>
But on the eighth day new street pushers began to appear in the
city, and<br>
before a month had elapsed it was business-as-usual.<br>
We had spent hundreds of thousands of federal tax dollars, and we
sent<br>
every one of the 39 pushers to federal prison, but there was no
lasting<br>
effect on the availability of heroin or its price. In one respect
we were<br>
worse off for our success. Before, we knew who was selling, but
afterwards<br>
we had no idea.<br>
The ODALE program did not survive the resignation of its
presidential<br>
creator and patron. But in the 18 months permitted us, my 150
people<br>
identified, investigated, indicted, prosecuted, convicted, and
sent off to<br>
the penitentiary more than 1,100 drug dealers. We led all other
ODALE<br>
regions. We were, as we remain, proud of ourselves.<br>
But in the end, in our territory it was not more difficult or
more<br>
expensive to obtain illegal drugs than it was in the beginning.
We had<br>
failed to solve, or even affect, the &quot;drug problem&quot;
with law enforcement. <br>
If we had been given 10 or 20 times the resources, we still would
have<br>
failed.<br>
I have learned from experience that there is no practical level
of law<br>
enforcement that will prevent people from using the narcotics and
dangerous<br>
drugs they wish to use.<br>
Judge Gray is right. We need to consider alternatives to the
mindless<br>
repetition of useless and expensive drug law enforcement efforts.<br>
I know because I have been there.<br>
<br>

<h1>DARKENING SHADES OF THE DRUG WAR: BROWN VS. GRAY </h1>

<p><b>Address of The Honorable James P. Gray</b> </p>

<p>Orange County Superior Court Judge, State of California, at
the Crime, Drugs, Health &amp; Prohibition II Conference </p>

<p>Harvard Law School, May 21, 1994 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>I don't always get such a nice introduction. Actually, it
reminds me of one I received a little while ago -- which was a
lot shorter -- and basically was along the lines of: &quot;I know
you all want to hear the latest dope from the courthouse, so
here's Judge Gray&quot;. [Laughter.] </p>

<p>But I am here speaking from my own personal standpoint with
much appreciation of what has happened so far today as well as, I
confess, a great deal of sorrow and some invigoration. I am
appreciative of the Clinton Administration allowing Dr. Brown to
come and share some thoughts with us. And I think that is very
important and it's certainly clearly important to get and
maintain a dialogue from all facets of this very multifaceted,
difficult and complex problem. </p>

<p>I am truly filled with sorrow, however, that we were not able
to engage in a dialogue with Dr. Brown. [applause.] He left -- he
came here and spoke with us and he listed his thoughts -- which I
would like to address in a moment -- and then regretfully was not
able to stay and respond to, I think, some very legitimate
questions. Because he listed eight myths, as he called them, and
I believe that all eight are...easily rebutted. [Applause.] And
so I am invigorated feeling the way I do -- a person who is in an
elected position in Orange County -- again a fairly conservative
area -- I'm up for election in 1996 and I'm ready for it. But I
have heard lots of arguments. I have heard people say we should
have debates and actually now, in my county, I'm having a great
deal of difficulty finding anyone to come and take the
alternative position. And in the last two years, I have not --
myself -- heard the alternative position expressed as eloquently
as I heard it today. And so I am invigorated to believe that
we're going to be successful, because that's the best they can do
and there simply is a response to everything they bring up.
[Applause.] </p>

<p>What is it? What is it that are these eight myths? Well, the
first is, as you recall: Nothing is getting better -- and he says
that is a myth. The problem with that is it's just the focus on
the wrong area. He is right if he's talking about education,
because we are making progress with regard to education. So it is
a myth that nothing is getting better. The problem is the
education is not married to [our] present system...which is, in
effect, prisons. Whichever option we choose, everyone agrees we
will continue to utilize education as a part of it. </p>

<p>He did not, however, ask the real question and that is: How
many people here feel that we, in our beloved country, are in
better shape today, with regard to this critical issue of drug
use and abuse and all of the crime and misery that goes with it,
than we were five years ago? How many people feel that way? I
never get anybody raising their hands. We all know that we are
not in better shape today. And if that's true -- and I fully
believe that you will agree with me, that it's true -- we have no
legitimate expectation of being in better shape next year than we
are in today, unless we change our approach. So the correct
question is: Are we in better shape today than we were five years
ago? And had he asked that question, I think that we could have
been on our way to a legitimate discussion. </p>

<p>Number two. He said [it was a myth] that current drug policy
is making things worse...He then said we have to address violence
and HIV areas, but he went on to talk about, very generally,
families, less productivity, the community issues and the rest of
that. Let's address those and talk about, for example, who the
role models in today's society -- in our inner cities and
probably everywhere else. And this can be addressed because the
role models -- as I'm sure we all know -- are not people who work
all day, go to school at night in order to attempt to better him
or herself. The role models for our inner city youth, and
probably everywhere else, are who? Are sellers of drugs. And that
is something that is truly challenging and damaging our very
fabric: our families, our employment, communities. </p>

<p>And if we are telling our people -- which we are, today -- you
probably can do nothing in your life that will bring you as much
money as you can get, by selling drugs, that is corruptive. It is
simply undercutting our work ethic. It is undercutting our
communities. These are the questions that we need to ask and not
just the mundane, quickly once-over: &quot;Let's talk about our
families and crack babies&quot;. Because every crack baby that is
born in the country today -- and there are lots of them -- are
born under our present system. And we need to look at that as
well. In fact, let's really look at prisons -- which is the issue
in our society today. And what are we doing? The San Francisco
Chronicle published an article on May 4, saying that we have 286
percent greater numbers of women in the California state prison
system today than we did ten years ago. I am in the juvenile
court now, in Orange County. I deal, on a daily basis, with
children that are abused and neglected. About a quarter to 30
percent of these babies are there because their mothers are in
prison. Every time we arrest a woman, 80 percent of those are
either pregnant or have small children. So we are taking the
children to the state. We are paying the money for that and we
are disrupting the family. These are issues that we must address,
and I don't hear people talking about that. It's time that we
focus attention upon it. </p>

<p>Number three. The myth, supposedly, is that enforcement adds
to the problem. Does enforcement add to the problem? Without a
doubt. We are slitting our wrists. [Dr. Brown] says that
enforcement is reducing the supply and drives up the price -- and
he's absolutely right, and that is part of the problem. The
problem here is not the drugs: It is the money. The problem is
the gangsters that are caused by the fact that these drugs bring
in such a great amount of money. So it's time to address that.
And instead of issuing a decree, supposedly to repeal the law of
supply and demand, have we focused upon the fact that the very
worst thing that could happen in the United States of America is
to have us all of a sudden successful in closing off our borders?
</p>

<p>The very worst thing that could happen to our country would be
to close off our borders and keep all of this opium out of our
country. Why? The law of supply and demand. The demand will
remain the same and if the demand is there it will be met. How
will it be met? Anybody that has a high school chemistry
education can, in his garage or bathroom, manufacturer illicit
chemical drugs, Ice and all of these other synthetic drugs that
go along with it. And then we have no quality control whatsoever
and will really be in trouble. </p>

<p>Has anybody ever seen a person who took one dose of a bad
batch of synthetic drugs? It does enormous damage. The lucky ones
die. These are the problems that we will visit upon ourselves.
Every time we're successful in seizing another ton of cocaine, we
raise the price and directly result in more burglaries, more
purse snatchings, more damage to our society. And so, yes, in my
view, the problem is not the police. The problem is the system.
The system is not working, it's time to recognize it and look at
our options. </p>

<p>Number four was: There was not massive support for change. It
depends how you ask the question. He says that the Gallup Poll
says -- and I'll take it at face value -- 80 percent of the
people are not in favor of the legalization of drugs. There is a
group in Orange County, they're called the Drug Use is Life Abuse
-- very overstated, by the way. There's a lot of caffeine on this
table here and that's being used -- I don't believe I am abusing
my life to drink iced tea. But this group is out there, passing
out polls. And two years ago, they came out with a poll asking
just that: How many of you people feel that legalizing drugs is a
good or not a good idea? 80 percent of the people said: No,
legalizing drugs is not a good idea. We in Orange County,
however, are discussing this issue. I'm speaking with Kiwanis
clubs and all of the rest; and so are lots of other people
discussing the area. One year after [the first poll], 63 percent
of the people said: No, legalization of drugs is not a good idea.
We made a 17 percent gain in public opinion in one year. If we
were to pass that poll now, we'd be in the majority, with the
same type of gain. </p>

<p>It's time that we address this and discuss it. And endemic in
that, critically and fundamentally important -- is that we get
across to our fellow citizens: It's OK to talk about this issue.
Just because we discuss our options does not mean that we condone
drug usage. If we can get that message alone across, we will have
been successful, because everything else will fall. If we can
only convince our people that just because we're discussing this
issue, just because we would even employ a different option, does
not mean that we condone drug abuse -- we will be successful.
That's all we need to do. </p>

<p>Number five. Legalizing or decriminalizing drugs will
eliminate violence -- and he says this is a myth. Of course it's
a myth. It is a straw man. We will never be able to get rid of
violence in our society. We have always had it, we always will.
We will always have crime, certainly. We will always have drug
abuse, certainly. But [Prohibition] contributes mightily to
violence in our society. Are you aware, as Ethan Nadelmann will
tell us: After the repeal of alcohol prohibition, what happened
to violent crime in our society? It went down 65 percent in the
next year and continued to go down for every year thereafter
until the beginning of the Second World War. I am convinced the
same thing will happen in our country, once we come to our senses
and employ a different system. [Applause.] </p>

<p>Then, another straw man myth. Legalizing is free of costs. Of
course not. Any system that we employ will have its problems. Any
system that I can come up with -- you, we as a country can come
up with -- will have some problems. Holland has realized that,
and other harm reduction countries. They realize these drugs are
harmful. I certainly believe that heroin, cocaine and marijuana
are dangerous drugs. I believe that very strongly. I don't take
them and I never will, regardless of what we do. But let's try to
recognize that and reduce, minimize the harm that will
necessarily flow from this. But let's not stand quiet when
someone presents a straw man saying: &quot;Aw, you're still going
to have problems under your system&quot;. Because of course we
are -- let's try to minimize those problems instead of simply
setting up straw men. </p>

<p>Number seven? There are excellent foreign models -- and he
called that a myth. Well, he mentions in Holland a problem with
foreigners -- and he's right. At the last Drug Policy Foundation
conference, a year ago last November, there were two men from the
[Dutch] Ministry of Health who I cornered -- because I wanted to
educate myself about the system that Holland is using -- and I
said, after they explained to me their system -- which I was
enormously impressed with -- I asked them: &quot;What are the two
biggest problems you have in Holland today?&quot; They looked at
me and said: &quot;Number one is we are a small country, [and]
about a third of the people that use drugs in Holland are
foreigners. They come here to have a good time and we don't know
what to do about it&quot;. [H]owever, to equate that with our
country -- so much larger -- is simply silly. We will not have
that problem if we were to go to a system like Holland's. By the
way, the second largest problem they had really embarrassed me
deeply. They'll embarrass you too. He looked me in the eye and
said: &quot;The second biggest problem we have is the government
of the United States of America -- they will not leave us
alone!&quot; What difference does it make to us how Holland
addresses this enormous problem domestically in their own
internal affairs? We are heavy handed and we ought to behave
ourselves. [Applause.] To be honest with you, I don't know what
is happening in Italy today. And if anyone does, maybe we can all
help each other. I do know that Italy changes -- it depends what
time it is as to which system they have. But it's difficult to
get statistics. But I think that that is something that we should
educate ourselves about and try to help each other... </p>

<p>The eighth personal myth is that this is just a personal
matter. Do I need to respond? Yes, it is a personal matter and if
the government is going to eliminate everything that is wrong and
harmful in our society, as we heard this morning, they will
eliminate power tools, they certainly should eliminate donuts --
a very, very harmful substance -- and we can continue going on.
Obviously, mother's milk is a gateway drug and there we go.
[Laughter.] </p>

<p>So what we need to ask is: Are prisons a myth? We in the State
of California have indeed added 13 new state prisons to our state
prison system in the last ten years, reaching now to the number
of 28. We have 13 more on the drawing boards, ten of [will have]
their doors open by the turn of the century. Today one out of
every six people that work today for the state of California,
work for the Department of Corrections. It is a growing industry.
An accountant came up to me a little while ago and said:
&quot;You know, if we continue going forward in the future -- as
we have in the last twenty years in the state of California -- by
the year 2020, literally everybody in the state of California
will literally be in prison or running one.&quot; And he is
absolutely right. </p>

<p>Finally, as we say, it is time to investigate the possibility
of change. Mike mentioned the Hoover Resolution, which was
founded back in February of last year by such flaming radicals as
Milton Friedman, George Schultz, Joe McNamara -- the former
police chief of San Jose -- numbers of medical doctors, an
Oakland high school principal and others. The resolution says
what I believe is irrefutable. Namely, what we're doing today
under the criminal justice system is not working. We have
substantial medical and social problems presented by the drug
abuse in our society. It is time to address them with medical and
social solutions. We beseech our president and congress to have,
to empower one final neutral commission to investigate this from
all aspects. Law enforcement, of course. From a religious
standpoint, from a community standpoint, social, medical or
anywhere else. We ask that you also sign the resolution, not
necessarily today. If you want copies, this beautiful lady here
in the green has some copies. Take them home with you, circulate
them. If you don't have one, you can look in the present Drug
Policy Foundation newsletter. It simply recommends that we
investigate the possibility of change. If what we're doing is not
working, it's time to look into change. There is a slogan that I
believe is instructive, and that slogan is not: &quot;Just say
no&quot; -- although I really buy into that, because
&quot;no&quot; should be spelled K-N-O-W. [Laughter/applause.] </p>

<p>What I would do instead is utilize the following slogan: If
you want to keep getting what you're getting, keep doing what
you're doing. And what we're doing now isn't working and we're
getting a whole lot of grief, and it's time to look into the
possibility of change. If people are not interested in
investigating our options -- be it legalization,
decriminalization, medicalization, regulated distribution -- OK,
fine and well. Then let's at least investigate what we are doing
now, which is prohibition. Let's at least investigate
prohibition. And if people do not even agree to investigate what
we're doing now, I'm afraid I must ask: Why not? What do you have
to be afraid of? It's time to look into this, to better ourselves
and our beloved country. We can't do any worse. Thank you very
much. [Applause.] <br>

<h2><a name="DDE_LINK7">KEEP DOIN' WHAT WERE DOIN'?</a> </h2>

<p>No, We Must Reassess Our Drug Policy </p>

<p>By Judge James P. Gray </p>

<hr>

<p>James P. Gray is a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles
and criminal defense attorney in the United States Navy, and is
now a trial judge In the Orange County Superior Court. </p>

<hr>

<p>On April 8,1992, 1 did something unusual for a trial judge: I
held a news conference in the plaza behind the Santa Ana
Courthouse. At that time, I publicly set forth my conclusions
that what we are doing through the Criminal Justice System with
regard to our attempts to combat drug use and abuse in our
society, and all of the crime and misery that accompany them, is
not working. </p>

<p>Since that time, I have discussed this subject with many
different groups of people, and when I do, I always ask for a
show of hands as to how many people feel that our country Is In a
better condition today with regard to this critical problem then
we were five years ago. Almost never do any people raise their
hands. Then I remind them that if this is true, and if we
continue to pursue the same approach. no one can reasonably
expect that we will be in a better condition next year than we
are in today. </p>

<p>Fortunately, however, we have options. So now we must simply
investigate our options and <i>come up </i>with a more workable
and effective approach. </p>

<p>Before I begin my general discussion of this matter, however,
I would like to address nine threshold points so that we can
better understand each other </p>

<p>1. All of us are on the same side on this issue, we all are
trying to reduce drug use and abuse, and all of the crime and
misery that accompany them. We may simply disagree upon the best
option to accomplish that goal. </p>

<p>2. We must have more responsibility and accountability in our
society, not less; and the courts, the police and-the prison
system have an important part to play in bringing these back to
our society. </p>

<p>3. Without a doubt, heroin and cocaine are dangerous and
sometimes addicting drugs. But so also are alcohol and tobacco
dangerous and sometimes addicting drugs, and virtually everyone
agrees that we would only compound their haffn by making them
illegal. </p>

<p>4. Just because people discuss various options about how best
to combat drug use and abuse, or even because they believe that
we should employ a different option, does not mean that these
people condone drug use or abuse. </p>

<p>5. Education in this area is critically important and has
definitely had some positive results; however, it will continue
to be used effectively no matter which option we employ, </p>

<p>6. Law Enforcement has been doing a magnificent job in
attempting to enforce our current approach. However, the problem
is with the approach - not the police, the courts and the rest of
the Criminal Justice System. </p>

<p>7. We have never had a drug-free society, and we never will.
Recognizing this fact, we should try to employ an approach which
will reduce the overall harm that flows from drug use and abuse. </p>

<p>8. No matter which option we employ, there will always be an
important role to be played in it by the Criminal Justice System.
</p>

<p>9. This is a complex and multifaceted problem area, and does
not beneficially lend itself to little sound bites and slogans.
However, If we adopt a slogan, we should use something like:
&quot;if you want to keep gettin'what you're gettin', keep doin'
what you're doin'. </p>

<p>Well, what have we been doin' in our country with regard to
drug use and abuse? For the past decades, we have been attempting
to combat this critical problem with a program of massive
incarceration of our people. However, it is becoming increasingly
clear to everyone that this program has been and is a massive
failure. And we have gone broke in the process. We have built 12
new state prisons in the State of California in the past 10
years, at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. Yet even
so, today our jails and prisons are well beyond being
overcrowded. Now, an additional 12 new state prisons are on the
drawing board, with many of them scheduled to be completed by the
turn of the century. This has already been shown not to work.
Some people say that we can just as effectively address crime by
building new prisons as we can effectively address a fatal
disease by building new graveyards. In so many ways they are
right. </p>

<p>Today, almost one in every five people who work for the State
of California works for the Department of Corrections. We are
cutting back upon our education, closing many of our libraries,
and denying medical treatment for drug addiction to large numbers
of our people who desire and need it. At the same time we are
using our scarce resources to incarcerate people who use and sell
drugs at the cost of about $25,000 per year per person. One
accountant recently calculated that if we continue on the same
course in the future as we have for the last twenty years, by the
year 2020, literally everyone in the State of California will
either be in prison, or running one. </p>

<p>In addition, by pursuing this approach, we have made cocaine
the most lucrative product in the history of the world. We have
also made marijuana the most lucrative crop in the State of
California, easily outdistancing the number two crop, which is
corn. Make no mistake, any people who traffic In human misery by
selling these drugs for their own profit should be sent to
prison. However, would it not be better to have a system that did
not so strongly encourage this activfty? </p>

<p>On February 26, 1993, 1 was one of a group of nineteen
concerned cftlzens that met at the Hoover Institution on the
campus of Stanford University and unanimously passed a resolution
which recommends that our country investigate the possibility of
change In the way we choose to combat our drug problems. The
Resolution, which recommends that these medical and social
problems be treated with medical and social solutions, is printed
separately herein. It further recommends that one final blue
ribbon commission be immediately empowered by the President and
Congress to conduct this investigation as publicly and fully as
possible, and then to recommend revisions of the drug laws of
these United States in order to reduce the harm being caused by
out current policies. </p>

<p>The original signers of the Resolution include Dr. Milton
Friedman, the Nobel laureate professor of economics; Dr. Joseph
K. McNamara, author and former Chief of Police of San Jose;
George Shultz, former Secretary of State; Kurt L. Schmoke, Mayor
of the City of Baltimore; Reverends Leonard B. Jackson and J. D.
Moore of the First A.M.E. Church of South Central Los Angeles; a
former high school principal from the Oakland area, and several
medical doctors. </p>

<p>Since that meeting, the Resolution has been signed by numbers
of judges and justices in California as well as other state and
federal judges around the country; the Mayors of San Francisco,
Oakland, Upland and San Jose; the Chiefs of Police of San
Francisco, Oakland and San Jose; State Senators Marion Berguson
and Robert Presley; Orange County Supervisors Harriet Wieder and
Thomas Riley; the Sheriff of San Francisco; the Board of
Supervisors of Mendocino County; the Central Conference of
American Rabbis; Stanley Marcus, co-founder of Neiman-Marcus
Stores; the Board of Directors of the California Academy of
Family Physicians; Abigail Van Buren (&quot;Dear AW; all 23
chaplains at RlkeFs Island Prison in Now York City; and thousands
of other members of the legal, medical, law enforcement,
entertainment, business and education communities and concerned
citizens and taxpayers. </p>

<p>The credibility of this neutral Commission is a matter of
considerable importance. Its members should include
representatives from law enforcement, medical and drug treatment
professionals, former addicts, members of the clergy, university
scholars, etc. Hopefully the Commission would be chaired by
someone like General Colin Powell, former Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop, or someone of similar stature. </p>

<p>This is obviously a large area of inquiry, and many of the
issues are interrelated. However, the Commission should address
historically how our country chose to employ our present
approach. Professors Charles H. Whitebread and Richard J. Bonnie
published an extensive Inquiry into the legal history of American
marijuana prohibition in the October 1970 Issue of the Virginia
Law Review. As a judge, I am embarrassed to read of citations to
the Congressional Record that show that issues of public health
and public safety were not even considered by Congress in making
this substance illegal. Instead, the motivation appears to have
been racism and fear of economic competition. The Commission
should consider and publish these facts. </p>

<p>The Commission should also investigate what we have done in
our country that has been successful and not successful - and
what other countries around the world have done as well. It
should inquire into what has caused the upsurge in drug usage,
crime, and court and prison overcrowding in our country that has
not been present to such a degree in other countries. It should
Investigate the fact that between 1980 and 1993, the number of
women imprisoned in California increased 450%, from 1316 to 7232,
with a large majority being non-violent drug offenders, and 80%
of whom have children under the age of six years old. Then it
should consider the effect this incarceration has had upon the
upbringing of these children. </p>

<p>There are so many other areas in which our present approach
has impacted upon all of our people which we have not focused
upon. By following our present policies, we have funneled about
70 billion dollars per year of untaxed revenue Into organized
crime. We have undermined the work ethic in our society by making
the trafficking of these drugs the most lucrative activity in
which most of our people can engage. This has directly resulted
in our youths, both in our inner cities and everywhere else,
having drug sellers as their role models instead of people who
work hard and pursue an education. Our approach has also directly
resulted in the continual deterioration of the relationship
between the police and the communities they are attempting to
serve. </p>

<p>The 'War on Drugs' in our country in many ways has become a
war upon our own people, especially our minorities, who have been
incarcerated in vastly disproportionate numbers. Our present
approach has directly resulted in the exportation of mom money
from our shores than any other single cause, except for oil.
Indeed, as a result of this drug money, we have actually exported
narco-terrorism to the rest of the world. Our approach has also
resulted in a crime being committed upon our people by depriving
clean needles to those who are drug addicted - thus exacerbating
the AIDS epidemic. And our approach has materially and
demonstrably resulted In the erosion of our civil liberties set
forth in the Bill of Rights. </p>

<p>By our history over the last several decades, we have proved
that there is a sheer impossibility of preventing consenting
adults in a free society from selling small amounts of drugs for
large amounts of money. The Criminal Justice System simply cannot
prevail against this reality. Even though these street drugs are
today as illegal as we can make them under our statutes and our
Constitution, they are fully available in any quantity, governed
only by price. It truly Is time for us to investigate the
possibility of changing away from this failed approach. </p>

<p>Some people raise a legitimate concern that if we were to go
to a different system then large numbers of additional people <i>would
become </i>addicted to them drugs. This very Issue has been
researched before by numerous neutral Investigative groups, such
as New York Mayor La Guardia Committee in 1944; President Nixon's
National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse in 1973;
California Attorney General Van de Kamp's Research Advisory Panel
in 1989; as well as an in-depth book entitled <u>Licit and
Illicit Drugs</u> which was published by the editors of Consumer
Reports Magazine in 1972. None of these neutral bodies felt that
there would be a material increase In usage, and they further
went on to say that even if there might be, we still should go
away from the Criminal Justice System approach because of the
enormous benefits that our society would receive. </p>

<p>In addition, on June 13, 1994. the RAND Corporation released a
study about the most effective way to reduce cocaine use in the
nation. According to this highly-regarded think tank, drug
treatment programs are seven times more cost effective in
reducing cocaine use than law enforcement efforts. It also stated
that drug treatment is 11 times more effective than attempting to
interdict the drug at our borders, and 23 times more effective
than attempting to control the drug supply overseas. The evidence
is all around us. The only real question remaining is, is anybody
reading it? </p>

<p>So where do we go from here? Today the political reality still
is that our &quot;leaders&quot; do not believe there are enough
votes for the investigation of possible change. However, this
political reality is changing. Several years ago, the San
Francisco Chronicle aptly editorialized that with regard to our
nation's drug problem, &quot;the cure is worse than the
disease&quot;. On April 26, 1993, U.S. News and World Report
published an editorial by Its editor-in-chief, entitled
&quot;Fighting the Right Drug War. It concludes with the
following statement: </p>

<p>&quot;If President Clinton lacks the political courage to
change the old failed program and needs protective cover, let him
at least appoint an independent commission charged with
investigating prevention and treatment and instituting a sweeping
new program. Dr. Kildare, rather than Eliot Ness, is the role
model for banishing our deepest sickness.&quot; </p>

<p>On May 11, 1993, the Los Angeles Times editorialized that
&quot;Perhaps the political climate is becoming more receptive to
a now approach. Certainly the new Administration in <i>Washington
should </i>seize the moment for a fresh and comprehensive look at
the drug laws.&quot; Similarly, in the July/August 1993 issue of <u>American
Jails</u>. which is the magazine of the American Jail
Association, San Francisco Sheriff Michael Hennessey wrote a
feature article which decries the fact that our nation has, for
no beneficial purpose, become &quot;hopelessly addicted&quot; to
the ever-increasing incarceration of drug offenders. He made
comparisons to alcohol prohibition and to the war in Vietnam, and
then said that &quot;We have once again committed ourselves to a
costly, unwinnable war which is tearing the fabric of society to
shreds.&quot; </p>

<p>Even Dear Abby has stated publicly in her column on May 3,
1994 that &quot;Just as bootleggers were forced out of business
In 1933 when Prohibition was repealed, making the sale of liquor
legal (thus eliminating racketeering), the legalization of drugs
would put drug dealers out of business. It also would guarantee
government approved quality, and the tax on drugs would provide
an ongoing source of revenue for drug-education programs. An
added plus, There would be far less crowding in our prisons due
to drug-related crimes. It's something to consider.&quot; </p>

<p>Attomey General Janet Reno was quoted awhile ago as
acknowledging that the Government would have to seize 70% of the
illegal drugs in this country before a program of drug
interdiction would be successful. However, no one seriously
suggests that we actually interdict more than 10% of these drugs,
and a more realistic assessment tells us that the number is
closer to about 5%. Accordingly, for every ton on cocaine we
seize, we easily fail to seize somewhere between 9 and 19 other
tons - and the seizure rate for drug monies is even lower. As a
result. all of our efforts merely represent an acceptable
&quot;cost of doing business for organized crime. Food markets
accept higher rates of spoilage for fruits and vegetables. </p>

<p>What we are doing is not working. As judges, we are at the
helm of a sinking ship, and out citizens are really still not
aware of the hopelessness of the situation. Our group requests
our leaders and citizens who are aware of the magnitude of the
problem to sign the Resolution and go on record as recommending
the investigation of viable altematives to the failed &quot;W<i>ar
</i>on Drugs&quot;. There must be and is a better way. This fact
is so clear, that I make two promises without hesitation. The
first is that our country will adopt a materially different
approach in order to combat this critical problem, because what
we are doing now is so clearly not working. It is only a question
of when this important change will be made. The second promise is
that five years after we have adopted this different approach, we
will<i> </i>all look back with shock and dismay that we could
have stayed with our present failed system for so long. It is
time we get started. <br>

<h2>California Courts Commentary: Drugs and the Law </h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>by James P. Gray </b></p>

<p><b>Orange County Superior Court</b> </p>

<p>November, 1993 </p>

<p>On April 8, 1992, I did something unusual for a trial judge: I
held a news conference in the plaza behind the Santa Ana

that what we are doing through the Criminal Justice System to

however, we have options. </p>

around the country; the Mayors of San Francisco, Oakland and San
Jose: Orange County Supervisor Harriet M. Wieder; the Sheriff of
San Francisco; the Central Conference of American Rabbis; the

Physicians; all 23 chaplains at Riker's Island Prison in New York
City; and more than two thousand other members of the legal,
medical, law enforcement, entertainment, business and education
communities and concerned citizens and taxpayers. </p>

<p>By pursuing our present course, we have made cocaine the most
lucrative crop in the history of the world. We have funneled

<h1 align="center">THE CASE FOR DRUG LEGALIZATION AND DECONTROL
IN THE UNITED STATES </h1>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Thomas L. Wayburn, Ph.D. </font></p>

<h1 align="center">Introduction </h1>

<h2>Prohibition is Immoral </h2>

<p><font size="2">It is easy to prove that the laws against drugs
are unconstitutional. The Declaration of Independence states that
the rights to &quot;Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of
Happiness&quot; are &quot;unalienable&quot; rights, i.e., rights
that are incapable of being sold or transferred. The preamble to
the Constitution states that one of the purposes of the
Constitution is to &quot;secure the blessings of liberty to
ourselves and our posterity&quot;. The Ninth Amendment states,
&quot;The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall
not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the
people.&quot; Clearly, the rights to liberty and to the pursuit
of happiness, specifically mentioned in the Declaration of
Independence, are retained by the people. Many people take drugs
to pursue happiness. Thus, any law that denies them the liberty
to take drugs is unconstitutional. Q.E.D.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some people pursue and attain happiness in no
other way than by taking drugs; they work all day so that they
can pay for and enjoy drugs after work and on weekends. The
Constitution, which views people not as statistical averages but
as individuals, should protect each drug user until such time as
he or she actually harms another person. Of course, as we all
know, the Supreme Court does not base its decisions on logic,
therefore it would be very difficult to have the laws against
drugs declared unconstitutional even though an irrefutable case
can be made in ten seconds.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It might be argued that the need to
&quot;promote the general welfare&quot; overrides the need to
&quot;secure the blessings of liberty&quot;, but that argument is
specious. The prohibition of alcohol caused social chaos; and,
although reliable statistics are difficult to obtain because of
the illegality, it is probably safe to say that prohibition
resulted in more people drinking than ever before, including many
children and many who were poisoned by bad booze. Also,
prohibition consolidated the position of organized crime in
America. The prohibition of drugs is having a similar, and worse,
effect. This is only natural. Not much good can result from
legislation that is inherently immoral. (As Brent [1] points out,
one possible &quot;good&quot; result of prohibition is that,
after some members of the Afro-American race or the Hispanic
races consolidate their positions as drug bosses, they can ally
themselves with the establishment and become part of the ruling
class, start legitimate businesses, send their children to the
&quot;best&quot; schools, etc., as did some members of other
undervalued races before them, e.g., the Kennedys.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Many Americans may be willing to repeal (drug)
prohibition because it is impractical; but, some of them may be
offended when they are told that they must repeal prohibition
because it is immoral. Moreover, it is bound to be difficult to
get the average American to recognize that the drug problem is
merely a symptom of a corrupt and inefficient social and economic
system. Nevertheless, I must reveal the whole truth as I perceive
it no matter how unpopular it may be. I cannot imagine that
anything positive will be achieved by discussing only what is
&quot;politically acceptable&quot; and inoffensive. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Even if every single American were in favor of
a law that would violate the Constitution, it would be improper
to enact such a law so long as we wished to retain the semblance
of a civilization. What we have in America today is not a war on
drugs, but a war against people, based on our need for
scapegoats. Indeed, many people take drugs because of the misery
in their lives, but drugs are not the fundamental cause of the
misery. The majority of the people, frustrated by our many social
problems, have been whipped into a state of mass hysteria by the
media and by politicians who wish to divert attention from the
true causes of the problems. This is reminiscent of the McCarthy
era and the Massachusetts witch hunts, which, presumably, were
conducted by people who thought they were doing the right thing.
&quot;The more things change, the more they stay the same.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">In order to provide a perspective different
from my own and to corroborate some of my points, I have included
the preface to the book Ceremonial Chemistry [2], by permission
of its author, Thomas Szasz, the well-known social observer and
professor of psychiatry. This clear, concise, and insightful
analysis of the &quot;drug problem&quot;, written over sixteen
years ago, appears in its entirety in Appendix A. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Fundamental Axiom. [Note (3-24-92): In my
philosophical system, three moral axioms and a number of other
fundamental assumptions are based on aesthetics, reasonableness,
and utility. The first moral axiom is the fundamental axiom
stated below except it is stated without reference to rights.
Rights, then, are based on morals. Also, the terms materialism
and dematerialism have been dropped in favor of competitionism
and decompetitionism and the word decompetitionism is no more
than a writer's convenience. Basically, we don't like Isms! My
basic theorem is that the abandonment of competition for wealth
(or money), power, and fame is a necessary and sufficient
condition for sustainable human happiness. I mean the sustainable
happiness of all of humanity.] </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Nearly everyone agrees that our right to
personal liberty does not extend beyond the point where it begins
to interfere with the personal liberty of others. The personal
choice of individuals to take drugs in the privacy of their own
homes or in other places set aside for that purpose does not, in
and of itself, interfere with the personal liberty of anyone.
Certainly, there are many cases where the use of drugs leads to
excesses and social disorder including pain and misery for the
families of the user, accidents in the workplace, and serious
crimes that affect innocent people. This social disorder is what
sincere proponents of tough laws against drugs wish to prevent,
but it is not an inevitable result of taking drugs and the
noninevitability is crucial. Thus, it is improper and immoral to
condemn all users of drugs and to deprive them of their civil
rights because of the action of a few (or even of many). This is
precisely the punishment of an individual for a crime that he or
she has not committed. Moreover, it is not difficult to see that
the laws against drugs cause more social disorder than they
prevent. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Fundamental Axiom of this paper is that
adult American citizens living in the United States have a right
to do whatever they please provided they do not interfere with
the rights of others. Probably this principle can be extended to
a larger class of people, which might include children under
certain circumstances, but, for this paper, the above statement
is sufficient. </font></p>

<h2>Morals, Ethics, and Laws </h2>

<p><font size="2">Inevitably, this essay must concern itself with
what is moral. I choose to distinguish two categories of morals.
The first category consists of personal or arbitrary morals the
violation of which does not interfere with the rights or freedoms
of any other person. Examples from this category are the
requirement to do no work on the Sabbath, the proscription of
eating meat on Friday (no longer in fashion), the prohibition of
certain sexual acts, and, most important for this discussion, the
taking or nontaking of drugs. Some of these lower morals are
similar to the taboos of primitive tribes. The second category
consists of higher morals the violation of which does interfere
with the rights of others. Examples from this category are
&quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot;, &quot;Thou shalt not bear false
witness against thy neighbor&quot;, and thou shalt not impose thy
religious beliefs on others. By definition, it is a violation of
a higher moral to interfere with the rights or freedom of others.
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">We would like to have a system of absolute
morals, morals that are independent of culture or point of view.
Of course, some religious people believe that we already have a
system of absolute morals given, for example, by the Bible, but
most of these people are not aware of the epistemological
difficulties that would have to be overcome to establish such a
system. Probably absolute morals are impossible and, eventually,
it might be discovered that some sort of uncertainty principle or
undecidability principle prevents the establishment of a system
of absolute morals.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We do not need a system of morals that can be
applied to the entire world though. We need a system of morals
that can be applied to the United States and is consistent with
our Constitution. A system of morals may fall short of the
absolute and still be good enough to gain universal acceptance
within a nation whose members are finite in number. Suffice it to
say that the Fundamental Axiom of this paper should be the
cornerstone of such a system of morals. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Whether a self-consistent and complete system
of morals can be constructed or not, a subset of a system of
morals or a superstructure built upon it has been chosen to be
the law of the land, or at least that part of the law that deals
with human and institutional behavior, as opposed to governmental
procedures. I submit that the law should be congruent with our
system of morals and easily derivable from it. We are far from
that advanced state where legislators would be almost unnecessary
inasmuch as anyone with an inference engine (computer and
appropriate computer program) could test automatically whether a
given proposition was a &quot;law&quot; (or not) by deriving it
(or its contradiction) from fundamental axioms or first
principles. The American legal system is in such shambles that we
can hardly be considered a society governed by laws at all.
Although this begs the question, prohibition would not even be
considered if laws were derived from first principles rather than
willy-nilly to consolidate the power of the ruling class and to
appease the superstitions of the people. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Simply stated, we are probably going to have
laws into the foreseeable future. The laws should be derived from
and congruent with a system of morals with which we can all
agree, but the Fundamental Axiom of this paper is nonnegotiable.
In any case, there is no possibility of a nation living in
America in peace under a constitution unless we can agree to
embrace higher morals and to recognize that some morals are a
matter of personal preference. Since the religious right has
given the word &quot;morals&quot; a bad name, I will use the word
&quot;ethics&quot; to refer to higher morals, even though I do
not believe the religious right should have a monopoly on the
word &quot;morals&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It is a corollary of the Fundamental Axiom,
then, that no one has a right to impose an arbitrary system of
morals on others. The correctness of this position is
corroborated by the failure of every attempt by church or state
to enforce an arbitrary system of morals. Prohibition, which, by
the way, required a constitutional amendment, was a dismal
failure and had to be repealed. The repression of drugs and the
persecution of drug users and dealers still continues, but the
effects are catastrophic and the drug trade thrives. (One
arbitrary aspect of the current laws against drugs is the
illegality of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin and the legality of
nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol, all of which can be just as
dangerous depending, of course, on the dosage.) </font></p>

<h2>Materialism and Dematerialism </h2>

<p><font size="2">[Note (7-19-93): I now employ the terms <i>competitionism</i>
and <i>decompetitionism</i>.] For the purposes of the discussion
that follows I must say what I mean by materialism and
dematerialism. Materialism can be defined as the use of material
wealth as a measure of success, a reward for achievement or
effort, or as an inducement to behave in a certain way.
Materialism leads to unequal distribution of wealth, which, in
turn, results in economic and social strife. Only a (usually
undeserving) minority, whose particular talents and inclinations
correspond to making (or preserving) money, can depend on
enjoying a comfortable old age. In order to have a flexible
supply of human resources, in order to cope with the business
cycles, inevitable in a quasi-laissez-faire economy, and to keep
the price of human resources low, according to the laws of supply
and demand, it is necessary that there be a pool of unemployed
persons. These people are susceptible to both sides of the drug
market, because of boredom and despair on the one side and
because of the lack of any other opportunity on the other. Of
course, many people who are not reduced to such circumstances
elect to deal drugs, partly, at least, because materialism
teaches that only those who acquire large amounts of wealth are
&quot;winners&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Many people are upset (and frustrated) because
materialism, as it manifests itself in a quasi-laissez-faire,
free-enterprise, capitalistic society, has created a large number
of social ills, many attributable to poverty itself, one of the
least desirable consequences of materialism. They see reduced
standards of living, senseless crime, bizarre behavior (and
dress), dishonesty in business and government, the decay of
family values, hopelessness, and cynicism marked by a new
hedonism among the youth as signs of the decay of everything they
value. These people are easy prey to mass hysteria and crowd
madness. They are looking for scapegoats. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">An alternative to materialism is dematerialism.
By dematerialism, I mean libertarian wealth-sharing, not the
socialism of Russia or China. Dematerialism requires the equal
distribution of wealth, modified slightly to account for
differences in needs, and the production of wealth in a
cooperative setting according to the abilities of the individual,
allowing for the need for abundant leisure. An education that is
consistent with the aims of dematerialism provides people with
the ability to enhance the material wealth and prosperity of
society, viewed as a collection of private individuals; but, more
important, it teaches people how to enjoy leisure in a manner
consistent with their development as human beings, through the
arts and sciences, sports, and other recreation, which might
include the use of drugs. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Materialism feeds on itself and leads to a
large authoritarian government to control a society that is
essentially unstable because of large differences in wealth. A
properly-constituted, democratic, privatized, libertarian,
wealth-sharing society, such as might exist under our
Constitution, would require only a small government because a
nonmaterialistic society is essentially stable. The successes or
failures of experiments in Capitalism, Socialism, Communism, and
all of their &quot;practical&quot; implementations
notwithstanding, the truth of the above assertions can be proved
in the context of an appropriate system of ethics, modulo
undecidability; that is, the above statements can be proved at
least as rigorously as social propositions are ever proved. That
is the subject of another paper. For now, the above statements
must be regarded as the author's point of view, a point of view
that is entitled to as much respect as any other. Although the
postulate that materialism is unethical is not needed to advance
the thesis of this paper, namely, that drugs should be legal, it
is useful to recognize that materialism may be the root cause of
most of the drug problem including the laws against drugs
themselves.</font> </p>

<h2>The Drug Problem </h2>

<p><font size="2">Most of us agree that too many people are
taking excessive doses of too many drugs on too many occasions.
The drug problem can be defined as these excesses coupled with
the misery and social disorder surrounding the illegal drug
trade. But, it is materialism and the laws against drugs, not the
drugs themselves, that are the cause of the problem. There is a
growing number of people, in addition to the dealers, who profit
from the multibillion-dollar drug industry created by the laws
against drugs. The drug problem is not likely to disappear until
the profit motive is removed. </font></p>

<h2>The Solution </h2>

<p><font size="2">The reasonable solution, in a free society, is
complete legalization and decontrol accompanied by unbiased
education. By &quot;decontrol&quot; I mean decontrol of the
purchase and consumption of drugs. Prescriptions should continue
to be used, but they would not be required for the purchase of
pharmaceuticals. Manufacturers should continue to be regulated,
but the government should not control which drugs are produced or
in what quantity. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Employers have a right, sometimes a duty, to
demand sobriety on the job, but people should be allowed to do as
they please elsewhere, provided they do not interfere with the
rights of others. Taking drugs, in and of itself, does not
interfere with the rights of anyone. The legalization of drugs
will remove the thrill of breaking the law and the incentive to
get people &quot;hooked&quot;; it will end the suffering caused
by unmetered doses, impurities, substitutes, and substandard
paraphernalia; legalization will move a huge segment of the
underground and extralegal economy into the legitimate economy,
taking money away from criminals, eliminating crime and violence,
and restoring many talented people to useful endeavor.</font> </p>

<h2>Outline of This Paper </h2>

<p><font size="2">The purpose of this paper is to show that
legalization and decontrol is a practical solution to the drug
problem and that it is the ethical solution that should be
advocated by all right-thinking people of good will. A number of
additional points that are made in this paper can be listed here:
1) it is not the proper role of government to decide what is good
for the people or what is not; 2) the war against drugs is
essentially an attack on freedom of religion; 3) &quot;drug
addiction&quot; may not be a disease that requires treatment; 4)
many people who advocate prohibition do not have respectable
motives; 5) the laws against drugs lead to numerous catastrophes
and absurdities; 6) much of the misery experienced by many
consumers of drugs is caused by the laws against drugs; 7) the
social, political, and economic disorder on the supply side of
drugs is caused by the enforcement of the laws against drugs; 8)
in many cases the use of drugs is natural, proper, necessary, or
otherwise justified; 9) the aggressors in the unwinnable war
against drugs are guilty of the oppression of innocent people;
moreover, the oppressors themselves are victims of crowd madness.
No matter which aspect of the case one considers, no matter what
line of reasoning one pursues, rigorous logic always leads to the
same conclusion, namely, that the laws against the manufacture,
sale, possession, and consumption of drugs must be repealed. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I begin by pointing out the failure of methods
currently being employed to end the drug problem and mention some
of the absurdities and tragedies that are caused by these
methods. The next section contains a short discussion of the
important topics of addiction and treatment. There is some
confusion as to what people are talking about when they use the
term &quot;drug addiction&quot;. It is not at all clear that drug
addiction is a disease; moreover, the question of whether there
is such a thing as an efficacious treatment for drug addiction is
still open. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Next I give twelve reasons for legalizing drugs
and I repeat a very important point that is usually ignored,
namely, that the laws against drugs are essentially
unconstitutional. I have pointed out that the taking of drugs in
and of itself does not interfere with the rights of anyone. One
wonders then, with so many good reasons for legalizing drugs, why
many people still oppose the idea. In the next section, I attempt
to answer that question, at least partially.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Antidrug propaganda rarely has anything good to
say about drugs, particularly recreational drugs, i.e., drugs
taken for the fun of it. In the next part of this paper, I list a
few uses of drugs that are not abuses. I include here some of the
responses I have obtained in discussions with drug users who
demand repeal. Next, a few of the anticipated bad effects of
legalization are addressed and, finally, after summing up what
the government should do, I suggest some possibilities for action
by individuals. </font></p>

<h1 align="center">Failure of the Current Approach </h1>

<h2>Disaster, Absurdity, and Irony </h2>

<p><font size="2">Nearly every day the newspapers carry an
account of a disaster, the threat of disaster, or an absurdity
created by our government's &quot;war on drugs&quot;. A U.S.
agent is murdered; criminals seize control of a city, perhaps an
entire nation; the government prepares to employ the military in
a manner contrary to law. Suspects are beaten; their civil rights
are violated; the Constitution is trampled as law-enforcement
agents spy on American citizens. Millions, perhaps billions, of
taxpayers' money is squandered by a government that has already
spent far beyond its means in a cause that is absolutely
guaranteed to fail. People who are reasonable in ordinary matters
advocate cruel and inhumane policies. Police officers fall to the
temptation of huge profits; entire squads of narcotics agents
conspire with drug dealers; confiscated drugs return to the
&quot;free&quot; market. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Recently, in our town, two crack houses were
destroyed by bulldozers. The houses were punished for the
behavior of the people who occupied them! More recently still
laws against attempting to buy drugs have been enacted. Can you
imagine someone being arrested for saying, &quot;Gee, I'm so
tired; I wish I had something to pep me up for a few hours&quot;!
The Kiplinger Newsletter warns that imports from Central America
will be delayed by exhaustive searches; so, now, the war on drugs
interferes with business itself, in an ironic twist of fate. </font></p>

<h2>The Beneficiaries </h2>

<p><font size="2">Dealers, money launderers, law-enforcement
agents, social workers, psychiatrists, physicians, lawyers,
bureaucrats, drug testers, and dealers in drug-free urine are in
on the action. Recently I saw a sign by the side of the road
advertising cut-rate prices on beepers. (Beepers are widely used
by drug dealers, even to summon children in school.) Convenience
store operators place items used to prepare and smoke crack in
prominent places in the store. Only the dealers and the money
launderers are on the illegal side of the law and the money
launderers just barely. The others will fight legalization
roughly in proportion to the loss in income they will experience
if drugs are legalized. This is an important point. It is clear
that, in a market economy, the current approach to solving the
drug problem is not likely to succeed for this reason if for no
other, namely, that there are too many people who have too much
to lose if the problem goes away.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Thomas Szasz, the well-known social observer
and professor of psychiatry, points out that the biggest gainers
in the war on drugs are the politicians themselves [3]. When
things are going badly, there is nothing like a popular war to
divert the attention of the people.</font> </p>

<h2>Physicians </h2>

<p><font size="2">After the politicians themselves, physicians
probably have the most to lose since many physicians earn their
living by writing prescriptions for people who have already
decided on their own course of treatment including which drugs
are indicated. In addition, an informed population will recognize
that the non-use, use, and abuse of drugs and the withdrawal from
drugs is not the province of the medical profession alone. Most
physicians know about prescription drugs only what they read in
the Physicians' Desk Reference and in manufacturers' brochures
and they know about drugs not in the pharmacopoeia such as heroin
and hashish next to nothing unless they or their patients are
using them. (Probably most patients are not discussing their use
of illegal drugs with their physicians.) Thus, physicians are not
entitled to a monopoly on the distribution of drugs and the
treatment of drug abuse.</font> </p>

<h2>The Rehabilitation and Prevention Rackets </h2>

<p><font size="2">Quacks and do-gooders are setting up clinics
and earning their living practicing half-baked and unproven
techniques to stop, from using drugs, people who, for all we
know, have been enjoying drugs and are trying to stop only
because of outside coercion. (The insects who prey on human
weakness are coming out of the woodwork.) Educators lie to their
students and &quot;public-service&quot; groups buy television
time to lie to the public or to get well-known ex-addicts to lie
to the public either because they (the ex-addicts) have been
brainwashed or because they are afraid of what will happen to
them if they don't cooperate. &quot;Drugs are all bad,&quot; they
tell us. But, most people, including the children, know that that
can't be quite true and so they reject the entire message even
though some of it may have merit.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">For example, The Partnership for a Drug-Free
America sponsors a television ad contrasting &quot;brain
waves&quot; from a fourteen-year-old before and after taking
marijuana. First of all, the ad implies that the significance of
the signals is well-known, which is false. Epileptics sometimes
exhibit quiescent brain waves, but epileptic seizures are often
preceded by moments of extreme mental clarity. The punch line is
that, if you are using pot, you are not using your brain. Now,
that is patently false. Anyone who has experimented with pot
knows that, far from the absence of cerebral activity, there are
often valid insights, the obvious again becomes obvious (perhaps
a little slowing down of the brain is useful, assuming, for the
moment, that the quiescent brain waves do in fact reflect less
mental activity; a lot of mental garbage is cleared out), and the
beauty of music becomes more apparent (unfortunately, the
listener may be hearing music with little merit, but, at least,
he's hearing all of it). Moreover, the liars behind The
Partnership don't have the guts to reveal who they are; no
address or phone number is given in the ad. [Note in proof:
Lately I have heard that the ad is faked, which certainly makes
sense. Where would they get a fourteen-year-old boy on
&quot;pot&quot; without breaking the law themselves?]</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">People wonder why American students do so
poorly. Part of the reason is, of course, TV. But, how can
students develop self-reliance when their educators don't respect
them sufficiently to tell them the truth about drugs! Students
descend to the expectations people have of them. Also, young
people must be confused, at best, when they try to reconcile the
standard party line on the American economic and social system
with what they can actually observe at home and in the streets,
but that, perhaps, is another matter. </font></p>

<h2>Sports </h2>

<p><font size="2">No discussion of drugs would be complete
without some mention of drugs in sports. We find here that
rigorous logic leads to surprising conclusions. The drugs used by
athletes are of two types: (i) the usual recreational drugs
(drugs that are taken for the fun of it) and (ii) steroids and
other substances taken to increase muscle bulk or strength or in
some other way to enhance performance. The banning or suspension
of athletes who are caught using illegal recreational drugs could
lead to the following absurdity: Some year, perhaps decades from
now, a given National Basketball Association team wins the
national championship, after which it receives a formal challenge
from a team formed from among professional basketball players who
have been banned from the league for using drugs. To make it
really interesting the members of the outcast team could be
allowed to use any substances they choose administered by the
most skillful sports doctors or &quot;dopers&quot;. In one case,
the national champions are defeated decisively in a challenge
they are honor-bound to accept. In another case, they decline the
challenge or are forbidden to accept it. In either case, do they
have a right to consider themselves national champions? The very
existence of a class of people who might be able to form a team
and defeat them compromises their championship. Farfetched? Not
according to rigorous logic. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The situation with steroids is more disturbing
still. The policing of athletes is nearly impossible as
substances that mask the use of other substances already exist.
World records that are broken by athletes using banned substances
are compromised if not invalidated. Athlete A holds the world
record for the 100 meter race, but everyone, including A himself,
knows that athlete B actually ran the race faster, not with a
machine but with his own body. It appears, then, that the banning
of steroids is as hopeless as the banning of other drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">But, competitions that encourage or require
participants, if they want to be the world's best, to risk their
health and their lives are unethical. It is even worse to force
someone to take something he really doesn't want to take than it
is to forbid someone to take something he wants to take. So, the
realities of professional sports and world-class amateur sports
are even more unfair than the laws against drugs. Thus, the
olympic games, professional and college football, even
high-school football, and many other activities that have grown
to be national and international institutions should not be
encouraged. (I do not favor the passing of even more laws;
boycotts and nonparticipation by governments should be
sufficient.) There is no doubt that the seriousness with which
athletes and the general public treat athletic competition has
reached the point where all types of absurdities are commonplace.
One wonders whether friendly competition of a local nature, the
results of which are not reported by the media, might someday
supplant the current madness. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">On the subject of sports, what about the
&quot;runner's high&quot;? Suppose the chemical substance that
gives the runner his high could be isolated and synthesized. Then
people could enjoy it without going to the trouble (and danger)
of running. Naturally it would be banned. People would have to be
tested for it just as they are tested for other illegal drugs, in
which case runners would test positive. When one starts with an
absurdity like drug prohibition, it is easy to derive another
absurdity. </font></p>

<h2>The Enforcers </h2>

<p><font size="2">On the day following the completion of the
previous version of this paper a news story broke that
illustrates dramatically the failure of the government's current
approach to the drug problem. It appears that the Drug
Enforcement Agency (DEA) has been staging phony drug busts that
are reported by the media as real. Also, the DEA has been
furnishing drug chemists with equipment and chemicals to make
drugs. The DEA claims that the staged arrests are designed to
gain the confidence of big-time dealers abroad, at least one of
whom has been arrested subsequently. The agency claims that
assisting drug chemists makes it easier to keep tabs on them,
that it is not entrapment, and that the drugs never reach the
public. The Justice Department investigated the staged drug
arrests and the concomitant deception of the media and, in turn,
the people. In a matter of two or three days, it found no
evidence of wrongdoing and closed the case.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">First of all, why would a dealer have
confidence in a smuggler who loses the goods? In the second
place, how does the DEA arrest a subject of a foreign power if
the subject does not enter the United States? By what right does
it have jurisdiction? It would appear, at least to this observer,
that the DEA is attempting to bolster its image and to
manufacture some success in the &quot;war against drugs&quot;.
But wait! There's more. One of the people involved in the
smuggling operation claims that seventeen duffle bags of cocaine
were seized, whereas the DEA can account for only fifteen. Could
it be that someone in the DEA is involved in drug trafficking and
that the missing cocaine will find its way back to the market?
For that matter, when was the last time you saw with your own
eyes the destruction of confiscated cocaine? We have seen
marijuana burned from time to time, but cocaine destroyed?</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Concerning the DEA-supplied drug labs, one of
the chemists alleged that DEA-sponsored chemists have given the
DEA the slip and DEA-sponsored drugs have indeed been sold to the
public. Also, it is not clear that this is not entrapment. Also,
the drug chemist claims that, at one point, it was so obvious
that he was making drugs that he asked his supplier if he knew of
a better procedure to produce the drug. The DEA agent supplied
the procedure for $2000. Are we supposed to believe that the
$2000 ended up in the U.S. Treasury?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">You will draw your own conclusions about these
events or withhold judgment, but it is clear to me that there is
something rotten in the DEA. Also, I suspect the Justice
Department of a cover-up. Sadly, if I am asked to choose to trust
the word of a drug-smuggler/drug-chemist or the word of a DEA
agent, I'll take the smuggler/chemist every time.</font> </p>

<h2>Attacking the Constitution </h2>

<p><font size="2">Lately, the United States has asked for the
extradition of &quot;known&quot; drug kingpins from Colombia.
Does not the Constitution guarantee a fair trial by a jury of
peers? How are these people, who played no role in the passage of
the laws they are accused of breaking, ever going to get a fair
trial in the United States? Are we going to import Colombians for
jurors!</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In addition, the United States government has
begun seizing the assets of suspected traffickers without due
process, possibly depriving them of the resources they will need
to defend themselves in a legal battle against a powerful enemy.
Also, the United States, while interfering in the internal
affairs of a sovereign state, is aiding and abetting the seizure
of assets without due process, which would be unconstitutional if
it happened here.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Addiction and Treatment </h1>

<h2>Addictions </h2>

<p><font size="2">Most people are against drug addiction and so
is this author, if drug addiction, indeed, exists, and, for the
sake of argument, I am willing to agree that it does. But, I am
also against all the other forms of addiction that plague
society. While we are eliminating addiction to drugs, let us
eliminate addiction to TV, which is lowering the IQ of a nation
and filling its collective mind with nonsense. Is there an
addiction to popular music, some of which is not really music at
all? Some children and even some adults cannot leave it behind
for a minute. They wear earphones everywhere, even while driving
a car, &quot;studying&quot;, or attending a lecture. That sounds
more like an addiction than a form of recreation or culture. Some
women seem to be addicted to cosmetics. Some people are addicted
to getting something for nothing! They easily fall prey to state
lotteries, the coupon industry, sweepstakes, rebates on
automobiles, and the numerous forms of gambling. Incidentally,
how can states prohibit the use of drugs, on one hand, and
encourage, by expensive and insidious advertising, gambling, on
the other! Recently I read about the addiction of some people to,
of all things, surgery! How are these addictions, all of which
can be traced to materialism, going to be treated?</font> </p>

<h2>The Meaning of the Term &quot;Drug Addiction&quot; </h2>

<p><font size="2">With respect to the existence or nonexistence
of drug addiction it should be noted that at least five different
phenomena are referred to as &quot;drug addiction&quot;. In one
class of cases the &quot;addict&quot; is attempting to treat him-
or herself for chronic depression. A drug has worked at least
once and the victim hopes that it will work again and sometimes
it does. In a second and completely different set of
circumstances the use of a drug has caused, usually as a side
effect, a symptom that can be relieved only by taking more of the
drug. After a good night's sleep the craving is gone. I believe
this is the case with the ordinary use of cocaine and, for some
people, with alcohol. It could be referred to as short-term
addiction. In other cases the victims experience acute withdrawal
symptoms that last several days or longer. This third class of
cases could be referred to as long-term addiction. Apparently,
this is what heroin addicts and caffeine addicts experience. (I
am aware of the fact that some alcoholics seem to experience both
short-term and long-term addiction.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is this third meaning of the word that lays
the best claim to the term &quot;addiction&quot;. However, many
people are addicted to drugs in this &quot;true&quot; sense of
the word if and only if they believe they are addicted. (Perhaps
the headaches I experience when I try to give up coffee occur
only because I expect them.) Perhaps all such addictions are
psychosomatic.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A fourth behavior pattern that is often called
addiction occurs when the user derives a great deal of pleasure
from using drugs and therefore repeats the experience as often as
possible with or without consideration of the long-range
consequences. (After all, if you tell a twenty-year-old man that
drugs will kill him in forty years, he is not likely to be too
concerned, especially if he's having a good time.) And finally,
many people take drugs repeatedly in order to perform a specific
task that cannot be performed as well or at all without drugs.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">It has occurred to me lately as I reread <i>Ceremonial
Chemistry</i> by Thomas Szasz, who views the war against drugs as
the persecution of drugs, drug addicts, and drug pushers, that
many people relish the idea of being persecuted. After all, Jesus
himself in the Sermon on the Mount suggested that it might be a
blessing to be persecuted under certain circumstances. I believe
that many people believe that living the drug life satisfies the
conditions alluded to by Jesus, namely, a pursuit of spiritual
things rather than material things.</font> </p>

<h2>The Treatment of Drug Addiction </h2>

<p><font size="2">I am very suspicious of counselors,
psychoanalysts, ministers, priests, lecturers, gurus and other
&quot;professionals&quot; who make their living by treating the
spiritual problems of man. It is easy for a charlatan to pose as
a spiritual healer. I don't believe anyone knows enough about the
human mind and the spiritual nature of man to be certain he is
not doing more harm than good. In particular, it is not clear
that drug users should be subjected to professional treatment at
all. Normalization of drug use, i.e., legalization, decontrol,
and public tolerance, should make most problems disappear; but,
when a problem persists even in a normalized society, undoubtedly
the best way to treat it is with ordinary human kindness and
compassion. Friends or family members are the ones who can help
the most.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In a normalized society, drug users who cannot
cope and have no family or friends who can provide sufficient
help fall into a special class, as do drug users who require
restraint. Probably the state will have to intervene, but it
should do so in as nonauthoritarian and nonpatronizing a manner
as possible. Of course, prisons will continue to exist as long as
materialism exists, but not many drug users belong in prison. The
state should supply help, i.e., food, clothing, shelter,
information (not propaganda), job training (if needed), and
considerate people (who might be fellow sufferers) to talk to,
rather than treatment. In any case, treatment must be voluntary,
particularly if the patient's freedom is to be surrendered.
(Probably most treatments diminish the humanity of the patient by
the use of tranquilizers, by brainwashing, or by tactics similar
to those employed by cults.) Remember, the term &quot;mental
illness&quot; is a metaphor! But, if &quot;professionals&quot;
insist on treating &quot;drug addiction&quot;, they damn well
better know what it is they are treating!</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Practical, Humanitarian, and Ethical Benefits
of Legalization </h1>

<h2>Disclaimer </h2>

<p><font size="2">The following is a list of the main practical
and humanitarian benefits that will result from the legalization
of drugs. The proof of each of these points is taken to be
obvious. If it should happen that reasonable doubts arise as to
the truth of these assertions, it will be necessary to provide
more detailed arguments. I have avoided purposely the recitation
of statistics of indeterminate accuracy. I believe it is
sufficient to accept the fact that, for example, some people have
died because they bought impure drugs; it should not be necessary
to know the exact statistics. Perhaps a more ambitious author is
willing to make the effort to supply the numbers.</font> </p>

<h2>Practical and Humanitarian Benefits </h2>

<p><font size="2">1) Legalization would remove the economic
incentive to get people &quot;hooked&quot; and, as discussed
below, prevent some people from changing from nonaddictive or
mildly addictive drugs to more addictive drugs. (Some people
believe that drug addiction is a myth manufactured by society and
caused by mass delusion and hysteria. People become addicted to
drugs because they believe in drug addiction.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2">2) Legalization would make it unnecessary for
&quot;addicts&quot; to steal. Of course, some people were thieves
first and addicts second. Whether or not they will continue to be
thieves is another matter. Others have gotten into the habit of
stealing and the habit of stealing may be more difficult to break
than the habit of taking drugs. But, in any case, there will be
fewer people stealing to pay for drugs and they won't have to
steal as much as they do now unless the government levies heavy
taxes. A punitive tax on drugs would be unfair and unwise since,
under heavy taxation, only the rich could afford legal drugs and
the black market would return. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">3) Drug legalization would eliminate the
violence surrounding the drug business. This is a very important
point. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">4) It would move a huge segment of the
underground economy into the legitimate economy, taking profits
away from criminals, keeping drug money, unless it were spent on
other imports, in the country, allowing reasonable, but not
punitive, taxation of the legal trade, providing alternate crops
for tobacco growers, etc. As everyone now knows, some dealers are
becoming so rich that they can take control of sovereign states.
The laws against drugs are the source of their wealth.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The above four points are the ones usually made
by people who favor legalization on practical grounds alone. Many
writers and speakers have discussed these points and I shall not
elaborate on them further. The next eight items have received
less attention.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">5) Legalization would remove the thrill of
breaking the law. This is especially important if children are
going to forget about taking drugs. On the other hand, if enemas
were made illegal, some children somewhere would dedicate
themselves to taking enemas. Naturally, it would be preferable if
children could be taught respect for the law, but there are two
important reasons why this cannot be done in general. The first
is that children see that many important people break the law
without losing the respect of society. In fact, in many important
cases, the prestige of the criminal is enhanced. At the very
least the criminal becomes famous and children are encouraged by
the media to believe that only famous people count. The second
reason is that children know that many laws are unjust and are
designed either to enhance the wealth, power, and privileges of
the ruling class or to satisfy the biases and superstitions of
the masses. (Yes! Many children know this.) It is crucial, then,
that children, acting on their own, stop taking drugs because
drugs no longer interest them, not because drugs are forbidden by
their parents or the rest of society.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">6) Legalization would end the suffering and
death caused by unmetered doses, impurities, dirty paraphernalia,
substitutes, and substances that have only a short history of
use, e.g., designer drugs. In particular, it would end the deaths
caused by AIDS for which the laws against drug paraphernalia, and
the sponsors of such laws, are directly responsible. Those who
oppose legalization seem to be singularly lacking in compassion.
It is not unreasonable to assign responsibility for a great deal
of the misery surrounding the use of drugs to the people who
advocate and enforce the laws against drugs and drug
paraphernalia. Opponents of drugs like to say, &quot;Drugs
kill.&quot; Yes, sometimes they do, but most of the deaths can be
traced to unmetered doses, poorly prepared drugs (impurities),
and &quot;drugs&quot; that turn out to be something other than
drugs (poison) sold by unscrupulous or incompetent dealers. It
makes sense to license dealers and manufacturers, but to require
users to register is, again, an infringement of personal liberty
and it won't work. Content and strength of all drugs, including
coffee, should be labeled clearly.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">7) Many users of &quot;hard&quot; drugs began
by using &quot;soft&quot; drugs; but, due to the laws against
drugs, there came a time when their drug of choice was not
available. This is what led them from marijuana, say, to heroin.
There are many similar instances of harm resulting from the
unavailability of the drug user's favorite and familiar drug.
Conversely, many troubled people choose to drink, and have
problems associated with drinking, mainly because alcohol is
legal and readily available. These people might have been able to
select a drug from a larger menu, marijuana say, that would
provide the same relief with fewer problems or no problems at
all. (Sometimes I find it difficult to believe that there has not
been a conspiracy to suppress the use of marijuana, amphetamines,
and heroin so that the cocaine business could flourish.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2">8) Legalization of all drugs would eliminate
the &quot;drug life&quot;, the endless cycle of getting money,
&quot;copping&quot;, getting high, etc. that constitutes a career
for many. Indeed, many addicts are among those who have most to
lose from legalization. They would have to give up their entire
&quot;lifestyle&quot; with its many positive aspects including
good friendships, camaraderie, etc.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">9) Legalization would restore many to useful
endeavor, even some who continue to use drugs. It would
decriminalize an even greater number of people who use drugs
properly as discussed below.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">10) Legalization and decontrol would allow
people to exercise their right to be their own physicians. Many
people could do this without deterioration in the quality of
medical care they receive. The legitimate medical uses of drugs
prohibit punitive taxes such as those levied against cigarets.
Moreover, the legalization and decontrol of all drugs is a step
toward controlling medical costs, which we all know are spiraling
out of control, to some extent because of the greed of
physicians. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">11) Drug legalization would eliminate the need
for controversial and perhaps unconstitutional intrusion into the
activities and physical bodies of suspected drug users, although
the need to have sober airline pilots, etc. will probably prolong
the debate on just how this is to be accomplished for some time,
even after legalization. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">12) Recently, subsequent to the original draft
of this paper, new drug legislation has been enacted by Congress
that includes cruel and unusual punishment. Wayne Saums writes in
a letter to the <i>Houston Post</i> as follows:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The current drug hysteria is the closest thing
to McCarthyism America has seen in 40 years. Draconian penalties,
in a drug bill that just passed Congress, include $10,000 fines
for a single marijuana cigarette!</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The biggest mistake any American could make, in
the face of such insanity, is to assume he is safe if only he
does not smoke marijuana.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">This drug is cheap and plentiful. An angry
neighbor, a political opponent, anyone at all, would have only to
toss a &quot;joint&quot; onto your property, into your home, or
your car. A police officer could stick it right in your shirt, or
your trash can!</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">No, the truth is that, once police state
tactics get to this advanced stage, no one is safe.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">NO ONE!</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Legalization would eliminate the possibility
that some diabolical adversary could put us through the nightmare
of being falsely accused, or even punished, by a Pharmacological
Inquisition.</font> </p>

<h2>Ethical Benefits </h2>

<p><font size="2">Thus, there are many practical and humanitarian
benefits to be derived from legalization, but, in addition, there
are many ethical benefits beginning with respect for the Ninth
Amendment to the Constitution. The Ninth Amendment states that
&quot;The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall
not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the
people.&quot; A fundamental right, recognized at least abstractly
by most Americans, is the right and freedom to do anything one
pleases so long as it doesn't interfere with the rights and
freedom of others. This right is not explicitly stated in the
Constitution, but it is retained by the people in accordance with
the Ninth Amendment. Whether or not the majority of Americans
believe that the right to take drugs is reserved under the Ninth
Amendment, any interference with that right is unacceptable to a
large group of Americans and they will struggle to protect it.
Thus, widespread disobedience of antidrug laws can be interpreted
as political struggle. Apparently, Americans recognized that the
right to take drugs falls under the Ninth Amendment when they
required a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol. This
corroborates my position that the laws against drugs are
essentially unconstitutional; i.e., such laws cannot be enacted
by Congress without a constitutional amendment. It required a
constitutional amendment then; why should it not require a
constitutional amendment now! </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Legalization would end the hypocrisy of banning
most drugs while not banning others, namely, alcohol, nicotine,
and caffeine. The legality of alcohol is probably related to its
role in the Christian faith. Thus, the banning of hashish, for
example, and not alcohol could be construed as a violation of the
doctrine of separation of church and state. We all know why
caffeine is legal. Most of the working people of the nation, at
least those who work in offices, are addicted to caffeine, but
that's what gives them the strength, or the will, to work long
hours for the benefit of their employers, some of whom have a lot
to say about what the law of the land will be. In the case of
caffeine, many people who try to stop using it will experience
violent headaches; so, at least in this sense, caffeine is truly
addictive.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">People Who Oppose Legalization </h1>

<h2>Hypocrites and Prudes </h2>

<p><font size="2">Some members of society, particularly the
religious right, would like to impose their sexual and religious
&quot;morals&quot; on others. The word &quot;morals&quot; is
enclosed in quotation marks to distinguish these personal and
arbitrary &quot;morals&quot; from higher morals about which
nearly everyone can agree. As discussed in the introduction, a
reasonable test of these higher morals, as exemplified by the
Sixth and Ninth Commandments, is that their violation does indeed
interfere with the rights of others. Some opponents of
legalization are genuinely concerned about the welfare of others,
but many of them are simply too mean-spirited to approve of
pleasure. At least they do not approve of intense pleasure, and
drugs do, on occasion, provide some people with intense pleasure,
a plain fact that deserves more discussion.</font> </p>

<h2>Control Addicts </h2>

<p><font size="2">There is another group of people in the
opposition (to legalization) who simply like to control others.
These are the control addicts. It is ironic that in their war
against addiction they succumb to one of the most insidious of
all addictions, namely, the addiction to power. Of course, most
of these people have an appetite for power that can never be
satisfied other than in the authority they exercise over people
in their own family. They are perfect candidates to be parents of
children who escape into the world of drugs. Many control addicts
might benefit from taking drugs themselves, since one of the most
desirable effects of some drugs is to shock people out of rigid
modes of thought. Taking drugs might be a form of therapy for
control addicts.</font> </p>

<h2>Legislators </h2>

<p><font size="2">The congressman from my district wants to apply
lethal force to stop the flow of drugs, but he doesn't have the
slightest idea how to stop people from wanting drugs. As long as
people want them, someone will find a way to deliver them,
although the prices (and the profits) will be high. Addicts will
have to steal even more than they do now; criminals will have
even greater incentive to murder other criminals who muscle in on
their territory; and the problem will get worse. What the
congressman doesn't realize is that his policies are part of the
reason that many people take drugs in the first place. He is part
of the problem, not part of the solution. (Subsequent to the
first draft of this paper a new and tougher drug law has been
passed by Congress. As we watch the situation worsen in the wake
of this law, we should gain confidence in the essential
correctness of my position. For example, dealers will have even
less to lose by killing other dealers inasmuch as the law puts
their life at even greater risk. Of course, in many cases, this
risk is what motivates them.)</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Uses and Users of Drugs </h1>

<h2>The Right to Use Drugs </h2>

<p><font size="2">In the beginning of this paper I made the claim
that taking drugs does not interfere necessarily with the rights
of anyone. The reader can prove this by performing a thought
experiment in which someone takes drugs and no one's rights are
violated. (For example, a man with no family lives alone; food
and drugs are delivered to him daily by a disinterested party;
the fruits of his solitary labors, proofs of mathematical
theorems, say, are picked up by the letter carrier. There is no
impact on society other than the benefits to be derived from his
proofs, which are assumed to be correct.) The reader should
realize that this one example of what many may feel is an
abnormal case is sufficient to prove the premise. I maintain that
thousands of &quot;normal&quot; cases occur daily, but it is not
necessary to enumerate them. Nevertheless, I will offer some
additional evidence to support this important claim and to show,
further, that taking drugs is not always bad.</font> </p>

<h2>Drugs for Celebration </h2>

<p><font size="2">Most of the discussion about legalizing drugs
neglects the traditional and proper use of drugs in ritual and
celebration. Some opponents of legalization believe that the
so-called recreational drugs have no valid use, but those same
people probably would be disappointed if they could not have a
drink or two on New Year's Eve, Christmas, or their birthdays.
Many Americans don't consider Saturday night a success unless
they become at least somewhat intoxicated. Is it really so bad to
want to experience the exhilaration, release from tension, and
just plain joy of getting a little &quot;high&quot; with good
friends? Most people consider complete abstinence a little weird
if not downright antisocial. People who never loosen up with a
drink or the drug of their choice could be thought of as
deficient, a judgment that is undoubtedly too harsh. (Wayne Saums
points out how much people enjoy that first cup of coffee in the
morning with its &quot;pure chemical high&quot;.)</font> </p>

<h2>Drugs in Ritual and Religion </h2>

<p><font size="2">Throughout recorded history intoxication has
played a large role in human ritual. Whereas the Catholic mass
cannot be celebrated without wine, the religious rituals of some
native-American Indians are incomplete without peyote. Government
control or taxation is inconsistent with freedom of religion.
True religious freedom is not limited to a few established
religions, moreover vows of poverty preclude payment of taxes on
substances that can be cultivated on the homestead without
participation in the mainstream of the economy. The book, <i>Ceremonial
Chemistry</i> [2] by Thomas Szasz, elaborates on the role of
drugs in ritual and, in addition, explains why many people are so
anxious to persecute people who use drugs other than the ones of
which they approve. Every person who participates in this debate
should read this book. In fact, I will go further and say that
anyone who advocates the regulation of drugs by government and
has not read this book should be disqualified from the drug
debate. For the edification, and convenience, of the reader, the
preface to <i>Ceremonial Chemistry</i> appears in Appendix A of
this paper by permission of Dr. Szasz. </font></p>

<h2>Drugs to Kill Pain </h2>

<p><font size="2">Another legitimate use of drugs is to eliminate
pain. What could be more absurd and inhumane than limiting the
dosage of painkillers taken by terminally-ill people because they
might become addicted! The place of the medical profession is to
advise not control. The final decision on the dosage of
pain-killing (or any other) drugs must rest with the patient. For
that matter, drugs must be made available to those who wish to
end their lives.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Many people in American society rely on drugs
to assuage the pain inflicted upon them by a callous,
materialistic society and by their own mistakes or bad luck.
Apparently, society is not yet ready to make the commitment to
remove the circumstances that cause this pain and suffering nor
is society willing to pay the price to relieve human misery. Now,
society wants to take away the drugs that provide the only
relief, however fleeting, that these people will ever enjoy.
Ironically, it may be drug use and only drug use that is
preventing a violent revolution in America.</font> </p>

<h2>Drugs to Enhance Ability </h2>

<p><font size="2">Drugs can be used to enhance the ability of
people to perform certain tasks. Many jazz musicians in the 40s
and 50s used drugs. I do not believe there was a single exception
among, at least, my fifty favorite jazz musicians. It was common
to hear people opposed to drugs say that musicians played well
despite the use of drugs, but does it make sense that all of them
played well in spite of taking drugs! Maybe taking drugs helped
them just a little. In any case, the connection between
intoxication and the muse dictates that the music could not have
been the same without the drugs. Actually, many &quot;drug
addicts&quot; do very well in society. Many famous entertainers,
athletes, artists, and, yes, even scientists take or have taken
drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I just found out from Jim Bouton's book, <i>Ball
Four</i> [4], that more than half of all major-league baseball
players in the 60s and 70s took amphetamines. This doesn't prove
that it made them play better, but it was said on one occasion
when a famous ballplayer narrowly missed a fly ball that with
five more milligrams he would have made the play. So, in any
case, there was a widespread belief among major-leaguers that
amphetamine helped them. It's interesting, though, that people do
apply a different set of standards to major-league baseball
players from those they apply to the average drug user, just as
racists accept black people provided they are celebrities. After
all, the cult of fame and the cult of money are the core of our
national religion.</font> </p>

<h2>&quot;Very Unimportant People&quot; </h2>

<p><font size="2">As long as I have brought up the cult of fame I
might just as well say a few additional words on that subject
here. In the minds of many Americans wealth, power, and fame are
subsumed under the general concept of Importance. Many people
take drugs because society is telling them that they are not
important or even significant. Many people are selling drugs
because being a dealer makes them feel important. Television and
other media seem to be telling us every day of our lives that, if
we are not important, our lives are meaningless. A comicstrip
child after seeing her grandfather on television says, &quot;Gee
Gramps, you are a real person.&quot; This phenomenon goes a
little way toward explaining some of the so-called senseless
crimes reported in the media practically daily. Because it is
controlled by commerce, television is one of the most pernicious
influences in society.</font> </p>

<h2>Special Uses of Drugs </h2>

<p><font size="2">It is easy to construct hypothetical scenarios
wherein the use of drugs makes possible an important human
activity. For example, suppose that it is necessary to stay awake
and alert for several days in order to perform an important
scientific experiment. The use of artificial stimulants is
justified in this exceptional case. The use of a sedative is
indicated if a person is required to remain motionless for a long
period in order to participate in a test.</font> </p>

<h2>Moderation </h2>

<p><font size="2">No one advocates the use of drugs all of the
time by everyone. The infiltration of drugs into the lives of our
children is deplorable as are many other aspects of drug abuse.
Some people should never touch certain drugs and they know who
they are. Perhaps no one should use drugs every day except for
the treatment of a pathology. On the other hand, there is
practically no one who would not benefit from the occasional use
of one or another drug as an alternative to complete abstinence
from all drugs. For nearly everyone there is a drug that can be
used safely on special occasions to improve the quality of his or
her life. I find it interesting that practically every discussion
of drugs jumps from abstinence to abuse as though there were
nothing in between.</font> </p>

<h2>Drugs as a Spiritual or Intellectual Adventure </h2>

<p><font size="2">Needless to say, the mere taking of drugs does
not automatically elevate people to an elite class of individuals
capable of discerning right from wrong and able to see through
all the illusions and myths perpetuated by society. Many drug
users are just as narrow-minded with respect to drugs that happen
to differ from their own particular favorites as are those who
oppose the use of all drugs. But, of two hypothetical people who
exhibit the same moral and ethical behavior in all respects other
than the taking or not taking of drugs, I would have to rank
higher, in the traits that distinguish us from the beasts, the
person who takes a risk in order to discover and experience
something new, even if the discovery and experience is
catastrophic. In fact, it could be argued that the taking of
drugs, under many circumstances, indicates an intelligence higher
than the intelligence of the abstainer even though the latter may
excel in prudence. Therefore, it is conceivable that the average
intelligence of the drug-taking population, which, of course,
includes those who exercise moderation, exceeds that of the
abstainers. Also, it should be pointed out that many drug users
claim that drugs <i>have</i> helped them see through the myths
and illusions perpetuated by society.</font> </p>

<h2>&quot;Good Guys&quot; and &quot;Bad Guys&quot; </h2>

<p><font size="2">Moreover, the taking of drugs, particularly in
excess, cannot help but teach a lesson in compassion learned by
virtue of experiencing one's own vulnerability. Further, drug
users are rarely involved in the struggle for money and power
that is destroying our civilization. On the other hand, many
people who are waging the war on drugs employ devious and
underhanded tactics, not the least dishonorable of which is
arranging a highly-contrived purchase of drugs near the White
House and then implying, for rhetorical purposes, that the
purchase was routine. Thus, it is not at all clear that those who
are trying to prevent people from taking drugs are the &quot;good
guys&quot; and those who are using drugs are the &quot;bad
guys&quot; as the establishment would have us believe. It seems
that just the opposite is true.</font> </p>

<h2>Fear of Death </h2>

<p><font size="2">Also, it is interesting to note that the
following statement, attributed to Jesus, could be construed as
approval of drug users: &quot;For whosoever will save his life
shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall
find it.&quot; Of course, it is not clear that everyone who uses
drugs will die from taking drugs, nor is it clear that everyone
who destroys his life with drugs is moved by a divine purpose.
Nevertheless, one wonders about all those people who want to go
to heaven but are afraid to die.</font> </p>

<h2>Some Words from Victims of the War On Drugs </h2>

<p><font size="2">I have talked with many users of drugs. Some of
them support the laws against drugs. Some users imagine that the
laws against drugs are the only thing standing between themselves
and lethal doses. If so, they would have to adopt the techniques
employed by alcoholics to save themselves in a world where
alcohol is legal, cheap, and advertised on TV. But, many users of
drugs are outraged at the attempts of society to deprive them of
their personal liberty. Many believe, as I do, that it is not the
function of the government, however well-meaning, to protect us
from ourselves. The authors of the following ideas shall remain
anonymous. I do not recall their exact words, thus the
responsibility for the wording rests with me although I shall
employ quotation marks, which are to be interpreted loosely.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">One well-known speaker on drugs sets the tone
by saying, &quot;I do not permit anyone to tell me what to put
into my own body.&quot; A woman, who contracted AIDS from her
husband, who was an intravenous drug user and has since died from
AIDS, says, &quot;I blame every legislator, bureaucrat, and
medical lobbyist who is responsible for the restrictions against
the purchase of new disposable syringes. I blame the
law-enforcement agents too.&quot; A man who is dying of cancer
and is forced to endure unspeakable agonies because he is a drug
addict and &quot;cannot&quot; be given the indicated dosage of
painkillers asks, &quot;Is it legal to do this to me?&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">A middle-aged man who has health insurance but
still objects to the outrageous fees charged by physicians
answers, &quot;Certainly I'd like to boycott doctors. They make
far too much money and most of them don't place their patients'
interests far enough above money to spend enough of their time to
do a good job. Of course, they're generous enough with <i>your</i>
time. If I couldn't live without doctors, well ... no one ever
got out of this life without dying. I would never be operated on
nor would I ever submit to chemotherapy or other radical
treatment; but, I should have access to the drugs I know about or
could find out about to treat my medical complaints; I should be
allowed to have whatever drugs I needed to kill pain if I were in
great pain; and I should be allowed to end my life if I were
seriously ill and it became impossible to kill the pain. Instead
I am forced to pay the doctor a ridiculous fee to write a
prescription. Of course, I could petition the FDA [Food and Drug
Administration] to permit me to prescribe for myself and sue them
if they refused, but I don't have the time, money, and energy.
And, as we all know, I would lose.&quot; I agree with this man.
We have a right to repair our own car or be our own gardener.
Even more valid is our right to heal ourselves and to avoid doing
business with people who are extracting excessive profits from
society. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">A young mathematician tells his story: &quot;My
physician started me on a psychic energizer when I began to get
ulcers from drinking too much coffee. Now, he won't write
prescriptions for it because it has been classified as a
dangerous drug and is monitored by the state, which requires a
prescription in triplicate. I can't do math without it and I am
about ready to turn to the black market. Is it fair for the state
to interfere with my career in this way? If this drug is a
dangerous narcotic, why wasn't it classified as such before I
became dependent upon it? It seems that the classification of a
drug is a political decision.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I have talked to numerous musicians who play
classical, jazz, and rock music and who are dependent on drugs.
I've heard some musicians say, &quot;I can play music without
drugs, but I don't enjoy it.&quot; Others say, &quot;Drugs put me
in a state of mind wherein I am receptive to musical
inspiration&quot;, &quot;Drugs open up a part of my mind that is
unavailable without drugs&quot;, &quot;I couldn't begin to play
inspired music without drugs.&quot; Other similar statements are
commonly heard. One musician complains, &quot;Music is the only
thing in life that matters to me and, for me, drugs and music go
together. How dare the state try to deprive me of life as I want
to live it.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A famous jazz musician is supposed to have
said, &quot;The three greatest things in the world are music,
drugs, and sex, <i>in that order</i>.&quot; Notice, he chooses
drugs before sex. Now, taking drugs for the pleasure it gives is
similar to having sex for the pleasure it gives. There are people
in this world who don't want anyone to have sex for pleasure. How
would the average prohibitionist like it if sex for pleasure were
made illegal?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Another famous jazz musician, now deceased
after a reasonably long life of approximately 60 years, said to
me, &quot;I haven't had sex in two years and, if I never have it
again, it will be too soon.&quot; Now, this man not only
preferred drugs to sex but rejected sex entirely, although it may
have been deficiencies in society or the drugs themselves that
caused him to abandon sex altogether. One can argue that the
world would be better off if a significant number of people
substituted abstinence from sex for abstinence from drugs. As bad
as it is, our drug problem doesn't come close to our population
problem. The main point, though, is that, for this man,
prohibiting drugs was like prohibiting sex for the average man.
If the government can stop people from taking drugs with today's
technology, it might be able to stop people from having sex with
the technology of tomorrow.</font> </p>

<h2>In Defense of Liberty </h2>

<p><font size="2">It seems clear then that very many people,
perhaps millions, believe that they have a right to manufacture,
sell, buy, possess, and consume whatever drugs they please. They
consider a system irrational and unfair that punishes a drug
dealer who sells a chemical to someone who wants to ingest it,
but rewards a person who dumps, into the air or water, poisons
that everyone must ingest whether they want to or not. These
pro-choice people are bound to regard those who are attempting to
repress drugs as tyrannical and evil. Normally, the criminal
justice system of the United States is directed against people
who acknowledge that they have done something wrong; and,
needless to say, not everyone involved with drugs is completely
innocent of wrongdoing. But, there is a large group of people who
use drugs and, yes, sell drugs who know that they have done
nothing wrong. Those who persecute them will be fighting an enemy
who knows he is on the right side. As for the ones who feel
guilty about their involvement with drugs, enlightenment will
reveal that they are not the guilty ones. As for you, William J.
Bennett, <i>you</i> are fighting on the side of evil.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The other day I saw a large piece of graffiti
that said, in English and in Spanish, &quot;The war against drugs
is a war against people!&quot; It is a crime to conduct such a
war. If Czar William (Bennett) wants to behead people, has he not
committed murder in his heart already; is he not a man of
violence; are not his enemies entitled to retaliate violently,
however ill-advised that may be! If the American people want to
wage a declared war on drugs, they should expect
&quot;drugs&quot; to fight back. For example, drug enforcement
agents not in uniform could be shot as spies. Prisoners of war on
both sides should be treated according to the Geneva conference,
provided, of course, that they are &quot;in uniform&quot;.</font>
</p>

<h1 align="center">Dealing with the Negative Aspects of
Legalization </h1>

<h2>The Abuser as a Bad Example </h2>

<p><font size="2">Naturally, there is bound to be some negative
impact from legalization. Some individuals are bound to increase
their intake of drugs and some will exhibit bizarre or antisocial
behavior, but there is a positive side even to that. If some drug
users make horrible examples of themselves, it will be a
deterrent to others, particularly children. Perhaps some people
will try drugs who would not have been willing to break the law,
but these must constitute a very small class of Americans. As
taking drugs begins to assume its natural role in society, free
from the denormalizing effects of criminalization, most negative
activity will die out. But, we should not expect to recover from
decades of wrong thinking and bad public policies without some
pain. Drug legalization could be compared to balancing the
budget, another pill that will have to be swallowed eventually.</font>
</p>

<h2>Physicians Who Are Addicts </h2>

<p><font size="2">A recent letter to <i>Time Magazine</i> warns
that the increase in drug use would not be trivial. It cites the
high use by physicians, who have easy access to drugs but should
know better. While it is true that many physicians use drugs, the
health care system in the United States is not exactly in a state
of collapse. At least the physicians and surgeons, whether they
take drugs or not, have managed to look after their own interests
quite well, and the number of doctors on skid row is not
excessive. If society at large does no worse with free access to
drugs than the physicians have done, we will be able to withstand
the shock of legalization.</font> </p>

<h2>The Dissemination of Information </h2>

<p><font size="2">Of course, many nonphysicians will not
&quot;know better&quot;. It is up to the government, which caused
this mess in the first place, to do a first-rate job of informing
the public about the risks of taking drugs without neglecting to
mention the positive aspects of drug use. There is no use in
denying that many people may enjoy the occasional use of
recreational drugs without incurring appreciable harm,
particularly if drugs are free of harmful impurities and are
labeled properly. The dissemination of information is cheap
compared to the alternatives.</font> </p>

<h2>Establishment Drug Firms </h2>

<p><font size="2">One possible infelicitous aspect of drug
legalization is that drugs would be manufactured and sold by
establishment chemists, engineers, and businessmen. I still have
faith in most chemists and engineers, be they establishment or
not, but my experience with American and foreign businessmen has
been most disappointing. It is possible that they might be more
unethical than the drug traffickers they would replace. Just look
at what they have done with cigarets, alcohol, and patent
medicines. The solution, I fear, in a capitalist society, is
strict government regulation of manufacturers. Of course, this
would not be necessary in a dematerialist society because there
would be nothing to be gained by being unethical. Spending of
excessive profits would be noticed and prevented by social
pressure.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Despite the tolerable track record of
established drug firms, strict standards of purity, labeling,
documentation, and pricing should be enforced. Also, the
government must ensure that the public is getting correct,
complete, and up-to-date information on all drugs. Any drug
whatsoever may be manufactured, but the effects of new drugs must
be understood sufficiently well that a well-informed public can
have expectations concerning the new drugs that are reasonably
likely to be fulfilled. A well-informed person, then, can begin
using a new drug at any time during the testing cycle, completely
aware of the risks involved. This could benefit many people
suffering from AIDS, for example, or other &quot;incurable&quot;
diseases.</font> </p>

<h2>The Social System </h2>

<p><font size="2">Many people believe that a share of the blame
for excessive use of drugs must be placed on the many unnatural
aspects of our economic and social system. The abuse of drugs is
a symptom of a deeper problem, the solution to which is a gradual
movement toward dematerialism preceded by the teaching of the
necessity of dematerialism, along with an open discussion of how
the difficulties of implementing dematerialism might be overcome.
Suffice it to say that the prohibition of the free use of drugs
is part of the problem, not part of the solution. In any case, we
have no choice as to whether or not we will endure whatever
negative impact accompanies drug legalization. We can only hope
to hold the damage to a minimum by making the necessary changes
gradually and by providing help for people who request it.</font>
</p>

<h1 align="center">Conclusions </h1>

<h2>The Correct Solution </h2>

<p><font size="2">Legalization and decontrol is the correct
solution because it will eliminate most of the evil surrounding
the drug trade; it will have many desirable consequences and very
few bad side effects, all of which can be overcome; and, finally,
it is the ethical and prudent thing to do in a nation of free
people who will not tolerate being told how to live their lives,
particularly by people whose actions are not even based on decent
motives or good will. Legalization and decontrol could be gradual
in order to absorb the shock of a sudden change in policy, but I
hesitate to say this because no matter how rapidly legalization
is implemented it is nearly certain to take place too slowly
rather than too rapidly. Education of the public, especially
children, should continue, but educators should tell the truth
about drugs or lose credibility. Employers should continue to
demand sobriety on the job, so the testers probably will not be
put out of business immediately. The tests, however, must
determine sobriety at the time of the test, not last Saturday
night. A man can be drunk on Saturday night and fly an airplane
as safely as it can be flown on Monday. </font></p>

<h2>Anti-Discrimination </h2>

<p><font size="2">Laws should be passed to make it illegal to
discriminate against drug users in employment, housing, etc. Of
course, the performance and behavior of drug users should be
evaluated by the standards that apply to everyone else.</font> </p>

<h2>Research </h2>

<p><font size="2">Some of the money saved by abandoning the war
against drugs should be devoted to research to develop better
drugs, e.g., drugs that induce euphoria but have no unpleasant
side effects or withdrawal symptoms. Research could be done to
develop drugs that do not require larger and larger doses to
achieve similar effects or at least reach the saturation dose
earlier. Perhaps we should stop trying to prevent people from
taking drugs (they will always take drugs) but give them better
drugs. However, we must be careful not to let the government
create a &quot;brave new world&quot; by means of some future
class of drugs. It is unlikely, though, that any drug will ever
be as great a threat to freedom of thought as television and
religion are.</font> </p>

<h2>Dematerialism as a Solution </h2>

<p><font size="2">Naturally I believe that an important step
toward ending the drug problem (and the problems of crime,
poverty, forced labor, unhappiness, injustice, inequality, and
undemocratic government) is the teaching of the virtues of
dematerialism in the schools. The adoption of dematerialism by
society will be extremely gradual. For those of you who think
they know why dematerialism won't work, let's hear your solution.
For the rest, let's begin to think of ways to make dematerialism
work in the United States, to overcome its difficulties (and it
does have difficulties), and to convince others that we must make
a change. Most (in my opinion, all) social problems have been
solved theoretically. The difficulty is convincing a brainwashed
people to adopt the theoretical solutions and to make them
practical. The failures of others to do this are not really
relevant (unless you can prove that people will never learn).</font>
</p>

<h2>Letters to Congress </h2>

<p><font size="2">The drug problem persists because the
government and other institutions continue to pursue incorrect
solutions based on poor reasoning and hysteria. We, the people,
should demand an end to this folly through letters and telegrams
to our elected representatives. One letter is probably worth a
thousand votes since congressmen know that fewer than one in a
thousand writes.</font> </p>

<h2>An Appeal to Reason </h2>

<p><font size="2">The comments by Szasz in an address he gave at
an anti-prohibition conference in Brussels last year [3] are so
incisive that I must repeat them.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Sadly, the war on drugs has offered, and
continues to offer, modern man much of what he seems to crave:
fake compassion and genuine coercion; pseudo-science and real
paternalism; make-believe disease and metaphorical treatment;
opportunistic politics and unctuous hypocrisy. It is hard for me
to see how anyone who knows anything about history, about
pharmacology, and about the fundamental human struggle for
self-discipline and the seemingly equally intense human need to
reject it and replace it with submission to a coercively
paternalistic authority - how any such person could avoid coming
to the conclusion that the war on drugs is simply another chapter
in the natural history of human stupidity.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I believe that just as we regard freedom of
speech and religion as fundamental rights, so should we also
regard freedom of self-medication as a fundamental right; and
that, instead of mendaciously opposing or mindlessly promoting
illicit drugs, we should, paraphrasing Voltaire, make this maxim
our rule: &quot;I disapprove of what you take, but I will defend
to the death your right to take it!&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In closing, it is important to emphasize that
the war on drugs is the longest, most protracted formally
declared war of this turbulent century: It has already lasted
longer than the First and Second World Wars and the wars in Korea
and Vietnam combined - and its end is nowhere in sight. Indeed,
because this war is a war on human desire, it cannot be won in
any meaningful sense of that term. Finally, since its principal
beneficiaries are the politicians who wage it, we must, against
all odds, try to enlist some honest and humane [and courageous]
politicians in our quest to lay before the people the case that
peace, after all, is better than war - even if the 'enemy' is
stupidly called &quot;drugs&quot;.</font> </p>

<h2>Other Methods of Effecting Social Change </h2>

<p><font size="2">Although I don't claim to know much about
effecting social change (hopefully the reader will know more), it
seems to me that legalization could be achieved by strong
advocacy, education, demonstrations, and organized lobbying.
Prolegalization groups exist and are growing in number and size.
Despite the negative aspects of lobbying and other types of
concerted effort, participation in prolegalization organizations
probably is essential in American society as it (American
society) is presently constituted. One such group is the Drug
Policy Foundation, 4801 Massachusetts Ave. N.W., Washington,
D.C., 20016. This group sponsors periodic meetings on issues
pertaining to drug policy. These meetings are attended by many
resourceful people who support legalization and who could have an
influence on government.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Also, the first edition of <i>The International
Journal on Drug Policy</i>, 10 Maryland St., Liverpool L1 9BX,
England, was published on July 1st, 1989. This bi-monthly
publication will concern itself with &quot;the legal, social,
medical, and educational issues [surrounding] the use of
psychoactive substances&quot;. While the emergence of this
journal should be viewed with cautious optimism, there is a
danger that the people who contribute to it (and to the meetings
of the Drug Policy Foundation) will become a permanent part of
the drug &quot;industry&quot; and thus become one more group of
people who have a vested interest in the drug problem never being
solved.</font> </p>

<h2>Remedies at Law </h2>

<p><font size="2">There is one additional approach that I would
like to see tried, perhaps by a sympathetic attorney in his or
her spare time, although I have no idea if one person could
manage this alone. I would like to see someone file suit to get
the laws against drugs declared unconstitutional. The amount of
resources required to carry this out would depend on whether the
intent was to win the case or not. The probability of winning is
low because the decisions of the Supreme Court are not based
entirely on logic, but the action itself, if publicized properly,
would help to educate the public and, if handled masterfully,
would discredit authoritarians. Also, a class-action suit to
recover damages for all those who have been injured by the laws
against drugs might have a similar
&quot;consciousness-raising&quot; effect.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Appendix A: The Preface to the Book <i>Ceremonial
Chemistry</i> </h1>

<p><font size="2">There is probably one thing, and one thing
only, on which the leaders of all modern states agree; on which
Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Mohammedans, and atheists agree; on
which Democrats, Republicans, Socialists, Communists, Liberals,
and Conservatives agree; on which medical and scientific
authorities throughout the world agree; and on which the views,
as expressed through opinion polls and voting records, of the
large majority of individuals in all civilized countries agree.
That thing is the &quot;scientific fact&quot; that certain
substances which people like to ingest or inject are
&quot;dangerous&quot; both to those who use them and to others;
and that the use of such substances constitutes &quot;drug
abuse&quot; or &quot;drug addiction&quot; - a disease whose
control and eradication are the duty of the combined forces of
the medical profession and the state. However, there is little
agreement - from people to people, country to country, even
decade to decade - on which substances are acceptable and their
use therefore considered a popular pastime, and which substances
are unacceptable and their use therefore considered &quot;drug
abuse&quot; and &quot;drug addiction.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">My aim in this book is at once simple and
sweeping. First, I wish to identify the actual occurrences that
constitute our so-called drug problem. I shall show that these
phenomena in fact consist of the passionate promotion and panicky
prohibition of various substances; the habitual use and the
dreaded avoidance of certain drugs; and, most generally, the
regulation - by language, law, custom, religion, and every other
conceivable means of social and symbolic control - of certain
kinds of ceremonial and sumptuary behaviors. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Second, I wish to identify the conceptual realm
and logical class into which these phenomena belong. I shall show
that they belong in the realm of religion and politics; that
&quot;dangerous drugs,&quot; addicts, and pushers are the
scapegoats of our modern, secular, therapeutically imbued
societies; and that the ritual persecution of these
pharmacological and human agents must be seen against the
historical backdrop of the ritual persecution of other
scapegoats, such as witches, Jews, and madmen. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">And third, I wish to identify the moral and
legal implications of the view that using and avoiding drugs are
not matters of health and disease but matters of good and evil;
that, in other words, drug abuse is not a regrettable medical
disease but a repudiated religious observance. Accordingly, our
options with respect to the &quot;problem&quot; of drugs are the
same as our options with respect to the &quot;problem&quot; of
religions: that is, we can practice various degrees of tolerance
and intolerance toward those whose religions - whether theocratic
or therapeutic - differ from our own. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">For the past half-century the American people
have engaged in one of the most ruthless wars - fought under the
colors of drugs and doctors, diseases and treatments - that the
world has ever seen. If a hundred years ago the American
government had tried to regulate what substances its citizens
could or could not ingest, the effort would have been ridiculed
as absurd and rejected as unconstitutional. If fifty years ago
the American government had tried to regulate what crops farmers
in foreign countries could or could not cultivate, the effort
would have been criticized as meddling and rejected as
colonialism. Yet now the American government is deeply committed
to imposing precisely such regulations - on its own citizens by
means of criminal and mental health laws, and on those of other
countries by means of economic threats and incentives; and these
regulations - called &quot;drug controls&quot; or &quot;narcotic
controls&quot; - are hailed and supported by countless
individuals and institutions, both at home and abroad. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">We have thus managed to replace racial,
religious, and military coercions and colonialisms, which now
seem to us dishonorable, with medical and therapeutic coercions
and colonialisms, which now seem to us honorable. Because these
latter controls are ostensibly based on Science and aim to secure
only Health, and because those who are so coerced and colonized
often worship the idols of medical and therapeutic scientism as
ardently as do the coercers and colonizers, the victims cannot
even articulate their predicament and are therefore quite
powerless to resist their victimizers. Perhaps such preying of
people upon people - such symbolic cannibalism, providing meaning
for one life by depriving another of meaning - is an inexorable
part of the human condition and is therefore inevitable. But it
is surely not inevitable for any one person to deceive himself or
herself into believing that the ritual persecutions of scapegoats
- in Crusades, Inquisitions, Final Solutions, or Wars on Drug
Abuse - actually propitiate deities or prevent diseases.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Appendix B: Addendum </h1>

<p><font size="2">The following are a number of afterthoughts
that were not included in the September 25, 1989 version of the
paper. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">1) There are drugs that improve one's interest
in things. Why not encourage our apathetic students to take these
drugs provided the risk were acceptably low?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2) Probably, without drugs to aid our
imaginations, we cannot emerge from the social abyss into which
we have descended. When the world is a better place, with fewer
mind-deadening institutions, we will not need drugs as much. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">3) Another circumstance often mistaken for
addiction: Drugs anesthetize one from the pain of awareness of
the world. The more sensitive one is, the greater the likelihood
of using drugs, all else being equal (and it never is). Some
people would take drugs habitually whether chemical dependence
existed or not; they simply cannot stand the world. Some of these
people are recognized geniuses. Vahn Lewis, a professor at U. of
T., Austin, asked me if there was a correlation between talent
and drug-taking among jazz musicians in the 50s and 60s. I
thought for a minute and then replied, &quot;Yes, the better they
were, the more drugs they took.&quot; Perhaps, they were too good
for this world. (Undoubtedly some people take drugs because they
are not &quot;good&quot; enough.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2">4) Some of the points made in my paper can be
clarified by the ideas of Andrew Weil [5]. He supplied a general
principle to account for a number of phenomena that I accounted
for separately. The principle was lurking in my
&quot;subconscious&quot; (unarticulated or preverbal thoughts),
but Weil put it in words beautifully. The general idea is that it
may not be drugs at all that get you &quot;high&quot;.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">5) Corroboration of Weil's theories: Sometimes
the less you take the higher you get. Some people who have no
faith in drugs are not affected even by a large dose. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">6) Frequently the spiritual rewards of taking
drugs far outweigh the harm and risk. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">7) On the constitutional point again: Drugs are
legal. I wish someone would offer a constitutional defense. The
DPF should offer to pay for such a defense for people like those
middle-class farmers who grew pot out of economic necessity. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">8) I have not emphasized sufficiently that we
will never accept laws against drugs or sex or food or guns or
anything that is our personal business. Even the seat-belt laws
are wrong, though seat-belts are essential. Some people prefer
drugs to sex. How would you like it if sex were prohibited! This
war can end up in terrorist attacks or all-out civil war.
Although I personally am against violence, it wouldn't be hard to
convince some people that violence is the only answer. Eventually
the religionists must be defeated, so there is no possibility of
peace any time soon. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">9) The following paragraph is from my paper
&quot;Introduction to Dematerialism&quot; [6]: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The point of my paper &quot;Toward Axiomatic
Morality&quot; [7] is that it might be possible to get nearly
everyone to agree to a few basic morals (or moral axioms) from
which all other morals [and laws] could be derived. By basic
morals, I do not mean religious superstition or sexual and
pharmacological prudery. I am referring to respect for the
freedom of others (and their posterity), respect for the
environment, and respect for truth. The fundamental principle of
morality, which allows one to be free to do anything one pleases
so long as the freedom of others is not abridged, is the
prehistoric basis for society, giving everyone his or her own
share and space. I believe that respect for the freedom of others
implies equal distribution of material wealth, since excess
wealth can be used to abridge the freedom of the other, in one
case by purchasing excess political power, in another by bidding
up the price of land and acquiring unfair exclusive access to
part of the earth's surface, in another by holding a stronger
negotiating position in an economic transaction, which might be
the employment of one person by another, a practice that is
revolting to many thoughtful people. The violation of these
morals causes all of our troubles and creates all of our logical
conflicts and inconsistencies.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">10) The following statement might be able to be
understood by most intellectuals: &quot;The notion of controlling
the possession of a substance is absurd. One may possess
plutonium if one desires. The conflict arises out of the
unreasonableness of society not out of the unreasonableness of
possessing plutonium.&quot; These final statements may sound
silly to all but the most astute philosophers: &quot;Everyone has
forbidden substances inside his or her body with a nonzero
probability due to quantum effects.&quot; &quot;Substance is a
variation in the geometry of space, therefore the notion of
possession of a substance is absurd.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">11) A woman suffering from arthritis
complained, in a letter to a Houston newspaper, that, due to
anti-drug hysteria, she has difficulty obtaining prescriptions
for Tylenol 3, which contains codeine, a drug the research for
which was supported by her tax dollars. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">12) The proponents of prohibition indulge in a
number of fallacies and one way to undo their mischief might be
to point out their fallacies. Bennett, lately, has been indulging
in <i>ad hominem</i> arguments. Also, when he refers always to
the use of drugs as abuse, he is indulging in the fallacy of the
excluded middle. Almost all prohibitionists indulge in Bentham's
dyslogistic and eulogistic fallacies, which consist in applying a
term of either denigration or praise to an item that is logically
neutral. An example is calling drugs &quot;poison&quot; or
&quot;horrible mind-bending chemicals&quot; [Carl Rowan]. Clearly
drugs are good if they are used to remedy an unpleasant condition
or cure a disease; but, for the sake of argument, they could be
considered neutral, i.e., their goodness or badness depends on
how they are used. Referring to drugs as poison is a clear case
of the dyslogistic fallacy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Another use of the dyslogistic fallacy is
reference to the spread of drugs as an epidemic, whereas taking
drugs is not even a disease. Also, users of drugs are referred to
as slaves even though they act more independently than the
average employee of the average American corporation. Actually,
the average Christian, who accepts Christian dogma without
reservation is more of a slave than is the most hooked addict,
i.e., the religionist's soul is entirely subjugated whereas the
body only of the addict is under the control of the addicting
drug, as evidenced by the fact that his will remains free to wish
to be free of the addiction. Even this analysis is granting too
much to the use of the word slave. How can one become the slave
of an inanimate substance, which has no will! An example of the
eulogistic fallacy is the praise of the narcs as the good guys,
when in fact they are no better and no worse than anyone else
including the dealers. This ignores the fundamental facts of
man's existence. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">13) I recently heard an ex-addict make the
following statements more or less (I do not remember his exact
words): &quot;I used drugs for about 30 years so I know what I'm
talking about when I talk about drugs. Some of these guys who are
making these outrageous attacks on drugs ought to try drugs
before they shoot off their mouths. Anyway, I quit taking drugs
about 10 years ago. Why? I guess they didn't fit into my plans
anymore. I changed careers and the new career didn't require the
use of drugs. To be fair, I should say that the new career really
didn't tolerate drugs either. Maybe I just outgrew drugs. I know
a lot of people to whom that happened. One day drugs no longer
interested them. They put up with all kinds of drug treatments
and it didn't mean a thing, then one day they just stopped. It
happens all the time, especially to older folks. So you can
forget that hooked-for-life nonsense.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;On the other hand, although I do not wish
to argue that I am not better off now that I have stopped taking
drugs or that the next older person who stops taking drugs won't
be better off, it's worth considering that, if you stop taking
drugs, you may lose the ability to take drugs! That's true. You
may wish to take drugs again to get high, but your body may lose
the ability to tolerate them after a certain age. This could lead
to serious regrets. At least, it's worth thinking about. People
are accustomed to thinking that the decision to take drugs is
irrevocable, but they do not consider the possibility that the
decision to stop taking drugs might be irrevocable.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;But, I want to make a couple of
additional comments about taking drugs: First, the laws against
drugs caused me to take more drugs and to take them more often
and for a very understandable reason. I took as much as I could
because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to get any more. Even if
I didn't feel like getting high and I had the opportunity to get
high, I got high because I was afraid it might be my last chance.
The law was always there with the threat of interrupting the
supply. One had to make hay while the sun shone.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Also, I want you to know that I was never
harmed by drugs, but I was harmed a number of times by the laws
against drugs. Once because I used an infected needle, which I
would not have used had needles been available in the drugstore.
A number of times I took bad drugs. If they were legal, I would
have used desoxyn or isotonic solution of methamphetamine
hydrochloride for a stimulant, dilaudid (or pharmaceutical
heroin) for a narcotic, hashish (orally, in cookies) for a
hypnotic (trance inducer or meditation enhancer), and valium for
a tranquilizer and/or a soporific. By the way, it was a dark day
for America when the ampules of isotonic solution of
methamphetamine hydrochloride were removed from the market. The
effect of that stuff, when injected, was like turning on the
lights in a room that had been darkened with a dimmer switch.
Perhaps it did a little harm, but the damage must have been
negligible compared to the benefits. Also, American civilization
(such as it is) took a giant step backward when heroin was
removed from the pharmacopoeia.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I know I can't sue the law enforcement
community and Congress, but those people owe me plenty. Sometimes
I hope there really will be a judgment day so that those guys
will get the punishment they deserve. But, what the hell, they
are just ignorant slobs like the rest of us. No one is perfect.
If they were in the john when the brains were being passed out,
is it their fault!</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Finally, I want to say a word about drugs
and sex. I enjoyed sex before I took drugs, but after I started
having sex while I was high I wondered why I thought it was so
great when I was not high. I mean it was a thousand times better.
So, go ahead. Abstain from drugs. (Probably you should nowadays.
Maybe it's no longer safe. If so, too bad.) Maybe you'll live
longer. Maybe you'll never go to jail. Maybe you'll be a big
success in business. So what! You'll miss out on one of the two
or three greatest things on this earth. Maybe I wouldn't think
that were true if society hadn't destroyed most of the natural
pleasures of life by perverting the way we live, but I can't
imagine a life that wouldn't be enhanced by drugs. Some people
think Jesus lived a perfect life and he took drugs. Put that in
your pipe and smoke it.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">14) The most important hidden assumption in the
thinking of Bennett and other prohibitionists is that the
individual serves some higher purpose than himself, usually the
needs of the economy. In a paper, &quot;Drug Abuse in the
Workplace&quot;, by Walsh and Gust of the NIDA [8], this tacit
assumption stands behind every conclusion. It is interesting that
they viewed as an intolerable circumstance surrounding drug use
the discovered fact that &quot;marijuana and cocaine users
`skipped work' two to three times as often as nonusers, simply
because they 'didn't want to be there'. [Shuster C.R., Testimony
Before the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control,
May 7, 1986.] Walsh and Gust were unable to recognize that drugs
might have helped users realize their true feelings and that the
difficulty might lie with the workplace rather than with drugs. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">15) Someone said, &quot;I broke my toe and the
doctor gave me some nasty little codeine substitute. I needed a
pill for pain, but not a pill that makes me wish I hadn't taken
it. Heroin would be fine. What's that you say? Heroin is too
strong? Fine, I'll take less. Also, I could use a Sabbatical from
this nasty little world we live in. I could have killed two birds
with one stone, killed the pain and had a holiday, for the price
of the same harm to my body, if there would have been any harm.
But this codeine substitute feels so much worse than heroin that
nobody will ever be able to convince me that it doesn't do more
harm as well. My body isn't stupid you know!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">16) &quot;If I were a young man, I would go to
any lengths to avoid living in a drug-free society. I would find
an island refuge and grow and manufacture my own drugs or I would
live on the high seas as a pirate. Forcing a person to go without
drugs is intolerable repression. Some of the greatest moments of
my life, physically and spiritually, have occurred while I was
high on legal and illegal drugs. Unfortunately, I am too old to
do what I would have to do to re-create those moments.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">17) The choice between taking drugs and not
taking drugs is a little like the choice between a planned
economy and a laissez-faire economy. Actually it is like a
religious choice if not precisely a religious choice. Most
Americans think that planned economies have been discredited, but
that is not the case. It is easier to argue that laissez-faire
economies have created the more undesirable circumstances. In any
case, to regulate one's own body chemistry or not is clearly a
personal decision. Nearly everyone chooses to regulate to some
extent.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">18) In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley depicts a
nation enslaved with the aid of drugs, free sex, and freedom from
religion. It appears that Huxley has the situation reversed.
Nowadays one sees that the forces of repression favor drug
prohibition, restrained sex, and the spread of religious dogma. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">19) Banning of all drugs, even for children,
might be compared to banning masturbation. While masturbation is
admittedly a poor succedaneum for true erotic sex, our public
school system has not sufficiently prepared many
thirteen-year-old children for responsible, meaningful sexual
relations. For the time being, then, masturbation is the
inevitable alternative. When society is sufficiently advanced
that no one feels the need for the artificiality of drugs,
coercion will no longer be required to discourage the use of
drugs. Until that time, no amount of coercion will suffice. Thus,
it appears that, as usual, we have the cart before the horse. The
problem isn't drugs at all; it is a badly organized society.</font>

<h1 align="center">FALLACIES AND UNSTATED ASSUMPTIONS IN
PREVENTION AND TREATMENT </h1>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Thomas L. Wayburn, PhD</font>
</p>

<h2>Everything We Need to Know We Learned in Kindergarten. </h2>

<p><font size="2">We think we know almost everything; what we
actually know is almost nothing - and most of that is false. The
most pernicious type of ignorance is belief in falsehood. We are
ignorant, but our minds are filled with <i>something</i>. In the
beginning, our minds begin to be filled by words, which represent
ideas. That's why I shall place so much emphasis on the abuse of
words. Next, our minds begin to be filled with notions, i.e.,
unexamined assumptions, promulgated or inculcated by parents,
teachers, government, business, etc. Some of these notions we
hear repeated every day, but others are buried so deeply that we
are never aware of their existence. In either case they are
prejudices; they have been assimilated without the exercise of
our judgment or our reason. Some are true, but most are false.
Social institutions are willing to go to great lengths to prevent
falsehood from being exposed. Heterodox views are everywhere
repressed. The world stands on the brink of the Orwellian abyss.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">People who are unwilling to examine their
prejudices are said to be closed-minded. The notion that all
fundamental philosophical questions have been answered is the
ultimate mind closer. The world is filled with closed-minded
people and we may never be able to influence most of them by an
appeal to reason, but that does not excuse any one of us as an
individual from being willing to drag out and examine under the
cold light of reason even our most cherished prejudices. The
world may not be ready to give up its myths, but there is no law
of the universe that says we cannot understand something merely
because our ability to make a living depends on our not
understanding it. As soon as one of our assumptions is questioned
or its opposite averred by even one solitary soul, it becomes
incumbent upon us to drop the contested claim as an assumption
and provide for it, instead, a proof. If the claim is
metaphysical, it must be supported by the twin pillars of
reasonableness (aesthetics) and utility. That's what I believe.
None of us is completely open-minded. I am curious to know,
however, why there is such a great disparity between what one can
say to an individual and what one can say to the general public. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Currently, we are moving from a law-enforcement
approach to a prevention-treatment approach to drugs. This change
is resisted by government to whom it represents a loss of power,
but it is supported by business, education, medicine, and other
institutions that stand to gain. The unstated assumption is that,
since prevention and treatment are less repressive than law
enforcement, they are not <i>at all</i> repressive. This is the
fallacy of false consolation, an appeal to peace (<i>ad quietem</i>).
Both law-enforcement and prevention-treatment are characterized
by the notion that one person has a right to regulate the
behavior of another. The prevention-treatment approach puts drugs
under the auspices of the health establishment. People who have
run afoul of both the criminal-justice system and the
mental-health system know that between the two there is not much
to choose. Both enjoy pretty gruesome reputations. The days of
shock therapy, pre-frontal lobotomies, and &quot;One Flew Over
the Cuckoos Nest&quot; are not far behind us, <i>if</i> they are
behind us. The Supreme Court ruled recently that mental health
institutions may force patients to take drugs against their will.
Man's inhumanity to man continues apace. The decriminalized
&quot;addict&quot; may wonder whether he has jumped out of the
frying pan directly into the flame. The jailer knows damn well he
is punishing someone for nonstandard behavior, in which he may
indulge himself. The therapist may be running around with his
head full of what is very likely to turn out to be mush. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The assumption that some people have a right to
have power over other people is usually justified on the basis
that the dominant people know what's best. Even if we dispose of
the notion that drugs represent a public-health problem, we will
have to contend with those who have the most to gain from the
point of view that drugs represent a spiritual problem, namely,
the clergy. As Bertrand Russell [1] said, &quot;It is possible
that mankind is on the threshold of a golden age; but, if so, it
will be necessary first to slay the dragon that guards the door,
and this dragon is religion.&quot; (I would have said &quot;<i>organized</i>
religion&quot;.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Eventually we will realize that we have a
political problem resulting from spiritual corruption. That
problem has nothing to do with drugs. An example of spiritual
corruption, in my opinion, is the notion that one should receive
something in return for what one gives. This is supported
indirectly by the so-called Protestant work ethic, which has been
adopted by Catholics and which is accepted in Asia. Only by a
complete change of heart will we be able to recognize the types
of political change required, but we should not look forward to
the assistance of any professional politician alive in this world
today. Enlightenment will come exceedingly slowly and is
contingent upon the survival of the human race. In the meantime,
we must struggle to be allowed to teach our view of things in
contradistinction to the conventional wisdom. Exposing fallacies
and stating unstated assumptions might be helpful.</font> </p>

<h2>A Drug-Free Society is Desirable. </h2>

<p><font size="2">Whether stated or unstated, this represents a
serious fallacy backed up by dozens of other fallacies. In my
previous paper [2], I said what I thought of the idea. It is
based in part on the notion that drugs are what get us high. This
assumption, taken to be so obvious as to require no mention, is
questioned by Andrew Weil [3]. What if we show people how to get
high without drugs, but the subsequent behavior and other
consequences of getting high were the same as they are now with
drugs. Would that be acceptable to prohibitionists? Some of them
believe that pleasure itself is evil. The idea that a drug-free
society is desirable depends, too, on the assumption that genuine
devotees of drugs will submit to tyranny. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Frequently, we are told that taking drugs is
immoral. This is the vague-generalities fallacy, another fallacy
of confusion and an example of <i>ad judicium</i> (to judgment).
Some morals are good, others bad. The proponent implies that the
nature of good morals is understood and that, if we violate his
morals, we are against Morality. Drugs may be bad for the body
but good for the soul. Perhaps the body and the soul are at war
for possession of the will.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In <i>Brave New World</i>, Aldous Huxley
pictured a dreadful totalitarian society, supported by atheism,
free sex, and free drugs. Huxley's fears are well founded, but,
in my opinion, he has precisely reversed the instruments of
repression, perhaps purposely to suggest what he could not
espouse publicly. A drug-free society would expedite the
repression of independent thought. Drug users have been in the
vanguard of the anti-war and other progressive movements,
including the movements for civil rights, women's rights, and gay
rights.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some believe that LSD and marijuana were
symptoms of &quot;the movement&quot;, but it is easy to make a
good case that they were the prime cause. Whatever else one
thinks of Uspenski, it is difficult to argue against his theory
that drugs provide a conscious shock that enables one to break
through the walls of prejudice that bind us, especially in a
society where we are immersed in propaganda. In any case, those
who use drugs are in a better position than those who don't to
judge the validity of the argument. Finally, many people believe
that drugs themselves are the cause of the drug problem. This
assumption is highly suspect. Apparently, outside of context,
drugs are neutral.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Almost all prohibitionists indulge in Bentham's
[4] dyslogistic and eulogistic fallacies, which consist in
applying a term of either denigration or praise to an item that
is logically neutral. An example is calling drugs
&quot;poison&quot; or &quot;horrible mind-bending chemicals&quot;
[Carl Rowan]. Clearly drugs are good if they are used to remedy
an unpleasant condition or cure a disease; but, for the sake of
argument, they could be considered neutral; i.e., their goodness
or badness depends on how they are used. Referring to drugs as
&quot;poison&quot; is a clear case of the dyslogistic fallacy.
Potassium cyanide is poison! William Bennett, lately, has been
indulging in <i>ad hominem</i> arguments.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Users of drugs are referred to as
&quot;slaves&quot; even though they act more independently than
the average employee of the average American corporation.
Actually, the average religionist, who accepts religious dogma
without reservation is more of a slave than is the most hooked
addict; i.e., the religionist's soul is entirely subjugated
whereas the body only of the addict is under the control of the
addicting drug, as evidenced by the fact that his will remains
free to wish to be free of the addiction. Even this analysis is
granting too much to the use of the word slave. How can one
become the slave of an inanimate substance, which has no will!</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Similarly, we are told that drug enforcers are
the &quot;good guys&quot; and users and dealers are the &quot;bad
guys&quot;. This ignores the fundamental facts of human
existence. Needless to say, the mere taking of drugs does not
automatically elevate people to an elite class of individuals
capable of discerning right from wrong and able to see through
all the illusions and myths perpetuated by society. On the other
hand, many people who are waging the war on drugs employ devious
and underhanded tactics, not the least dishonorable of which is
arranging a highly contrived purchase of drugs near the White
House and then implying, for rhetorical purposes, that the
purchase was routine. Thus, it is not at all clear that those who
are trying to prevent people from taking drugs are the &quot;good
guys&quot; and those who are using drugs are the &quot;bad
guys&quot; as the establishment would have us believe.</font> </p>

<h2>Fallacies and Lies Can Be Used to Prevent Drug Use. </h2>

<p><font size="2">Recently I attended a class given by the
Houston Council on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (HCADA) for people who
will speak to students in the Houston Independent School District
(HISD) to prevent them from taking drugs. I attended another
class (to be discussed below) for children referred by the court
and their parents. I will not apologize to the reader for
attending only two classes or for assuming that these classes
were typical. No one is better able to judge than some of my
audience whether the fallacies discussed in the sequel apply or
not. The assumption that falsehood and fallacious reasoning are a
proper means to the end of preventing children from taking drugs
is not specifically stated by the HCADA nor do they acknowledge
it; but, if it is not behind their program, they are very badly
deceived. Under these circumstances, this is the
end-justifies-the-means fallacy (<i>ad judicium</i>).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Charles Manson, for example, took drugs,
therefore drugs are bad&quot; is an example of an <i>ad odium</i>
(to hatred) fallacy. It neglects the fact that William Rowan
Hamilton, for example, took drugs. Counselors are advised to tell
the students that marijuana, nowadays, is 1000% more powerful
than formerly rather than 10 times more powerful, despite the
fact that percentages are applied normally only when they lie
between 0 and 100. Whether increase in strength is observed or
not (NORML says &quot;not&quot;), the deception that 1000% seems
more than 10-times reinforces stupidity and is <i>ad metum</i>
(to fear). Again, &quot;the end justifies the means&quot;. The
HCADA neglects to mention that one might simply take 1/10th as
much, which will reduce the trauma to the throat, very much
exaggerated by HCADA. The HCADA does not recommend ingestion by
eating (in hash brownies, say) or the use of a water pipe, which
they might do if they were truly interested in the student's
welfare.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The HCADA says that marijuana is toxic. The
best scientific data places its toxicity below that of potatoes
on the LD-50 scale. Also, marijuana has a therapeutic ratio
immeasurably superior to that of aspirin, for example. HCADA
claims marijuana is often contaminated, sometimes by dried horse
manure. This is unjustified and <i>ad metum</i>. They describe
horrible effects of smoking pot, which, in real life, are never
seen. They give data for exceptionally heavy smoking and for
tests done on animals with absurdly heavy doses. They describe an
isolated case as though it were common, failing to give
statistics. <i>Ad metum</i>, again and again. They show
photographs of damaged nerves in a videotape by AIMS Media of Van
Nuys, California, which refuses to supply literature citations
for the purported research. Lester Grinspoon thinks it's faked.
The AIMS tape features a narrator dressed in a white lab coat
with a stethoscope hanging around his neck. The more astute
students will recognize that this man is not likely to need a
stethoscope during the narration of this tape. This is an
appeal-to-authority fallacy, an example of <i>ad verecundiam</i>
(to modesty).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Reported side-effects of marijuana are listed
in dyslogistic terms, whereas they might have been listed in
eulogistic terms by a devotee of pot or in neutral terms by an
unbiased reporter. Examples: &quot;lethargic&quot; (dyslogistic)
instead of &quot;meditative&quot; (eulogistic), &quot;loss of
interest in school&quot; instead of &quot;able to see through the
stupidity of the curriculum and the teachers&quot;,
&quot;absenteeism&quot; instead of &quot;unwilling to tolerate
the inhospitable atmosphere in which we work and learn&quot;,
&quot;chaotic&quot; thinking instead of &quot;creative&quot; (or
&quot;imaginative&quot;) thinking, and so on. In a perverse abuse
of language, many anti-drug people try to detach the word
&quot;square&quot; from non-users and attach it to users.
&quot;Hip&quot; and &quot;square&quot; are the words coined by
users to differentiate themselves from others.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The HCADA employs the gateway fallacy.
Epidemiological evidence seems to point to marijuana as a
&quot;gateway&quot; to &quot;harder&quot; drugs. The evidence can
be explained by the behavior of individuals who cannot obtain
their drug of choice <i>due to the laws against drugs</i>. The
HCADA employs a poster that indicates one might go to jail for
smoking pot without mentioning that many people believe that the
laws against smoking pot should be repealed. They claim that
smoking marijuana impairs one's sense of time without mentioning
the great musicians who smoked marijuana when they played. It is
intellectually dishonest to report only half of the story, but
that's what HCADA does at every point. They divide drugs
improperly into stimulants and depressants.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Two charts were employed showing drugs that are
not abused and drugs of abuse. Nyquil, which can be abused, if
the word is to have any meaning, was on the first chart, and
alcohol and cigarets as well as the usual illegal drugs were
shown on the second chart. I asked if moderate use of alcohol or
any of the illegal drugs constituted drug abuse. I was told that
any use whatsoever was considered abuse. This is the
excluded-middle fallacy and illustrates that the Houston Council
of Alcohol and Drug <i>Abuse</i> doesn't know the meaning of the
word &quot;abuse&quot;. I could go on and on, but I will finish
by noting that the teacher commented in passing that, &quot;with
kids, honesty is best&quot;! </font></p>

<p><font size="2">After the class, I reminded the teacher that
exaggerating the danger had been tried and failed. When I pointed
out the factual and logical errors in her presentation, she
&quot;refuted&quot; my objections on the basis that (i) she had
many years experience in this field and I had very little (<i>ad
verecundiam</i>), (ii) her presentation was consistent with the
latest &quot;scientific&quot; research, and (iii) the HCADA was a
highly respected United-Way institution. These are fallacious
appeals to authority and the use of the term
&quot;scientific&quot; is a vague generality. I pointed out that
it is intellectually dishonest not to present both sides. Even
when I reminded her that it was not I who was disseminating
questionable facts in the public schools, she insisted that the
burden of proof was on me. Students don't have to prove we are
lying, they need only <i>know</i> it, after which they discount
everything we have said even though some of it may be true.
&quot;Falsehood is so unexacting, [it] needs so little help to
make itself manifest!&quot; [Proust] If I wished, I was told, I
could bring my argument to the director, but the director refused
to meet with me and review the evidence I had assembled. So much
for truth in the public schools of Houston. My letters to the
school board and the United Way are still in my head. They will
be written but probably to no avail. </font></p>

<h2>Drug Abuse and Drug Addiction Are Diseases. </h2>

<p><font size="2">The effect of this assumption, whether stated
or unstated, is to bring &quot;drug abuse&quot; and &quot;drug
addiction&quot; under the purview of the medical profession. We
wish to investigate under what circumstances this may be done
legitimately. Peele [5], Schaler [6], and others make an
excellent case that it cannot be done at all. But, placing drug
treatment under the auspices of the medical profession
constitutes an appeal to respect for authority and to fear.
Leading authorities support prevention and treatment, therefore,
if we are against prevention and treatment, we are against
Science. In the preface of <i>Ceremonial Chemistry</i> [7], Szasz
states, essentially, that &quot;everyone&quot; is against drugs,
but different drugs depending on era and culture. The use of
acceptable drugs is a popular pastime, while the use of
unacceptable drugs is considered &quot;drug abuse&quot; and
&quot;drug addiction.&quot; &quot;Drug abuse is not a regrettable
medical disease but a repudiated religious observance.
Accordingly, our options with respect to the 'problem' of drugs
are the same as our options with respect to the 'problem' of
religions: that is, we can practice various degrees of tolerance
and intolerance toward those whose religions - whether theocratic
or therapeutic - differ from our own.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I believe that terms such as
&quot;disease&quot;, &quot;epidemic&quot;, &quot;treatment&quot;,
and &quot;recovering&quot; in the context of drug (mis)use
originated in metaphor but continue to be used to confuse the
public because it is advantageous to the health professions to do
so, in which case the use of these terms is the impostor-terms
fallacy (<i>ad judicium</i>), a fallacy of confusion. Even the
use of the word &quot;illness&quot; in the phrase &quot;mental
illness&quot; probably originated as a metaphor but became
confused with actual illness almost immediately. In any case, it
is not at all clear that mental illness exists in the sense that
the health profession would like us to believe it exists. Szasz
[8] thinks not. Behind the disease model of conflicts in living
is the unstated assumption that &quot;social intercourse would be
harmonious, satisfying, and the secure basis of a good life were
it not for the disrupting influences of mental illness.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><i>The Random House Dictionary of the English
Language</i> [9] defines disease as (i) a condition of the body
in which there is incorrect function resulting from the effect of
heredity, infection, diet, or environment and (ii) any deranged
or depraved condition, as of the mind, society, etc. The
definition in <i>The Mosby Medical Encyclopedia </i>[10] agrees
with (i) but doesn't include (ii). Health professionals can
remove people from environment or society temporarily at some
cost, but they, the people, must return eventually to an
environment or society about which the health profession can do
nothing. Therefore, we may dismiss society and environment from
the discussion for the time being. We must then inquire as to the
meaning of &quot;deranged&quot; and &quot;depraved&quot; and
whether they might not be dyslogistic terms for behavior of which
we do not approve, behavior that might just as well be described
in eulogistic terms, such as &quot;divinely inspired&quot; or
&quot;impelled by a vision&quot;, or neutral terms such as
&quot;nonstandard&quot;.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The effect of infection can be ruled out; there
are no germs, viruses, etc. If we may consider drugs part of our
diets, we recognize that some discomfort due to having taken
drugs might be considered disease, but we wonder if that is what
is being treated by physicians and other members of the health
professions. The effects of heredity have been discussed in
connection with alcohol. Many researchers still believe in a gene
for alcoholism; but, as shown by Peele [5], undesirable responses
to alcohol can be explained in other ways. In any case, we hope
researchers identify the gene for drug addiction soon, if it
exists, so that those of us who don't carry it can use drugs
casually without fear of becoming addicted! </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I have not encountered definitions of drug
abuse or drug addiction. As discussed above, HCADA does not
distinguish between use and abuse. Mathre [11] dissociates casual
users and people &quot;who choose to alter their state of
consciousness through drugs&quot; from abusers and addicts. Peele
[5] states that &quot;the administration's own statistics
disprove the link between recreational drug use and
addiction&quot;. Mathre seems to exempt drug (or chemical)
dependence from her disease model of addiction, but she does not
say what addiction is.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I have compiled a short list of phenomena that
are sometimes referred to as (or mistaken for) drug addiction:
(1) self-medication for chronic depression or chronic pain, (2)
taking a drug that causes a symptom that can be relieved only by
taking more of the drug or by the passage of a few hours, (3)
acute withdrawal symptoms that last several days, (4) dedication
to the repetition of a pleasurable experience regardless of
long-range consequences, (5) taking a drug to perform a task,
which might have to be performed several times a week, perhaps to
make a living, (6) obligatory daily performance of a task that
cannot be performed during withdrawal from a drug, (7) using
drugs to isolate oneself from the painful realities of life in a
bad world, (8) unwillingness to pass an opportunity to take drugs
because the law may cut off one's supply, (9) the case of a drug
that, like valium or blood-pressure medication, poses a health
risk if one forgets to take it in the absence of a craving that
(blessedly) reminds one to take it. In Case 1, a physician may
prescribe another drug, Case 2 is normal and involves a conscious
choice between two alternatives on the part of the individual,
Case 3 might require supervised tapering off or the prescription
of other drugs, Cases 4-8 are behavioral choices in the face of
circumstances that are beyond a therapist's control. I do not
believe any of the cases correspond to what we normally call a
disease. Case 9 is a normal medical situation and stretches the
meaning of addiction seriously, but may not be omitted as it
constitutes a requirement to take the drug, which, in this case
and in this case alone, is strictly medical.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug abuse usually refers to some type of
behavior of which other people do not approve but which is
consistent with the goals of the user, who might be a criminal or
only an oddball. The term &quot;denial&quot; is a fallacious
appeal to the authority of the treatment community in a dispute
with a user who is insufficiently articulate to defend his values
and motives. The term &quot;denial&quot; is an impostor. When the
user himself disapproves of his own behavior, the term &quot;drug
abuse&quot; might make sense, unless the user is a victim of
anti-drug propaganda. Many people who have tried to stop taking
drugs might benefit from the friendship and advice of other drug
users. As suggested by Henman [12], drug use must be looked at
from the perspective of the user.</font> </p>

<h2>Ex-Users and Non-Users Are Competent to Counsel. </h2>

<p><font size="2">Occasionally a person who has never used drugs
but is possessed of great sensitivity and penetrating insight
might be able to offer useful advice to drug users, but normally
a non-user simply does not know what's going on. Ex-users are
usually failed users. If they didn't understand drugs when they
were using them, why should they be expected to understand them
now? </font></p>

<p><font size="2">In my many years of experience in the drug
culture (1954-1963 and 1969-1980), I have observed very few
people whose drug taking was troublesome to themselves or other
users. Ex-users were sometimes more troublesome within the drug
community than were users. If a member of the set was out of
line, the other members could usually bring social pressure to
bear upon the transgressor and things would soon return to
normal. Many of the people with whom I associated during those
years have died short of their 70s, but there is much to be said
for quality of life. Most people, when they are born, have no
right to expect to live as interesting a life as some of my
friends have lived. The reader might protest that I was not
living in the inner-city ghetto of 1990. It is widely assumed
that the greatest problem in the inner city ghetto is drugs, but
isn't it more likely that racism and the other institutions that <i>created</i>
the ghetto are the central problem?</font> </p>

<h2>We Can Predict Human Behavior. </h2>

<p><font size="2">Only mathematics is unconditionally true.
Physicists employ mathematics to provide provisional solutions to
easy problems. The difficult problems are referred to chemists
unless they involve the mystery of life, in which case they are
referred to biologists. Since World War II, social scientists,
particularly economists, have tried to apply the techniques of
physics to the behavior of people. Despite some successes, the
likelihood of continued progress in this direction is open to
doubt, especially now that the phenomenon of chaos has been
observed in systems as simple as a dripping water faucet! For the
purposes of treating drug users, it is insufficient to predict
the behavior of people in statistical aggregates and even that is
suspect. The twentieth century has been distinguished by
revealing what can <i>not</i> be done by science. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">As one might expect from the name, The Houston
Council on Alcohol and Drug Abuse attempts to exploit the
parallel between alcoholics and people who use drugs excessively
(according to someone). In particular, they employ the word
&quot;sober&quot; to mean &quot;not high on drugs&quot;. This is
an impostor term as many drugs, e.g., pot, make one abnormally
sober. The comparison with alcohol breaks down because, whereas
alcoholics might not avail themselves of other drugs to
counteract the effects of alcohol or to substitute for alcohol
when alcohol is not indicated, free drug users could employ a
large slate of drugs, including alcohol, to adjust their body
chemistry appropriately under most circumstances; i.e., they
might use one drug to work, another to play, another to have sex,
a fourth to drive home, and a fifth to go to sleep. With more
research, this might be accomplished safely.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">At the second class at the HCADA, referred to
above, the class leader claimed he could always recognize a kid
from a dysfunctional family. According to Bertrand Russell [13],
the family has been dysfunctional since men began to work away
from the homestead, and it has become less functional with each
change in modern society. Why blame dysfunctionality on drugs
when both parents work? Also, why must it be assumed always that
the behavioral choices of the drug user are incorrect? Often the
members of the family who are troubled by a person taking drugs,
although convinced of the rectitude of their conduct, are not
well-behaved themselves, nor do they always have the best motives
for wishing to restrict the user's activities. How many wives of
musicians complain about the behavior of their husbands without
understanding the importance of the musician's quest! We have a
problem of conflicting values, not a drug problem.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The thrust of the class was an explication (as
fact) of the victim-enabler-hero-scapegoat-loner-mascot theory
wherein &quot;volunteers&quot; were asked to simulate the various
roles, holding up poster-size signs with lists of psychological
attributes. Oversimplifications aside, it is clear that this
theory cannot predict. The class leader did not indicate that the
theory was conjectural and unproven. The term &quot;victim&quot;
is clearly an impostor, used to signal the disease theory of
nonstandard behavior. The term &quot;enabler&quot; ignores the
impediments created by most spouses of alcoholics and drug users.
Also, the theory totally ignores the possibility that the school,
the workplace, or the political system in which we live is the
&quot;culprit&quot;. Political theory seems to be missing from
almost all approaches to social problems in the United States.
Since &quot;substance abuse&quot; seems to be a symptom of a
deeper problem, why should we not expect abstinence to shift the
problem elsewhere?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">While watching the class, I could not help but
be struck by the wide disparity of backgrounds of those present.
This must be reflected in a wide disparity in values. As
suggested by Szasz [8], why should a single approach fit
everyone?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The self-esteem fad was very much in evidence,
but why should people feel good about doing bad? Children have
only to turn on the TV to realize how unimportant they are in a
society where only famous people count, an abuse perpetuated by
ourselves, today, in the conference for which this paper was
prepared. This business of applauding themselves and each other
at the tiniest provocation and standing up and saying &quot;Hi,
I'm Darrell&quot; is brainwashing and gets the respect it
deserves among children. The group leader referred to God and
quoted Proverbs (but not Proverbs 31:6,7) in violation of the
First Amendment, as discussed by Luff [14]. The Tough Love theory
was introduced. Although there may be a little truth to the idea,
truth suffers when one tries to turn tough love into a business.
The unstated assumption is that one can package wisdom.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Nevertheless, some people <i>do</i> stop taking
drugs. Does that mean treatment has been successful? This is the <i>post-hoc-ergo-propter-hoc</i>
fallacy (after this, therefore because of this). Perhaps subjects
have merely exchanged one form of deviance for another. Perhaps
subjects have invested a great deal of money and don't want to
admit they have wasted it. (Charter Hospital of Sugarland, Texas,
charges $825/day for 30 days and employs some pretty hard sell.)
This is not a cure; it's self-deception. And this is the main
point: Do people who stop taking drugs and enter a lifelong
abstinence program along the lines of Alcoholics Anonymous really
improve their lives? Are they not simply exchanging one bad habit
for another, or, perhaps, exhibiting the same character defect in
a new way? Perhaps people in treatment &quot;cults&quot; are
saving the body at the expense of the soul. &quot;I'd rather be a
drunk than belong to AA.&quot; Perhaps, though, as in the case of
Marcel's friend Saint-Loup, who stopped taking cocaine to become
a war hero in <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, they have simply
found something better to do. I believe that nearly anyone will
stop using drugs if he has an opportunity to do something
worthwhile with which drugs are incompatible.</font> </p>

<h2>The Primary Function of a Human Being Is to Serve the
Economy. </h2>

<p><font size="2">The most important unstated assumption in the
thinking of William Bennett and other prohibitionists is that the
individual serves some higher purpose other than himself, usually
the needs of the economy. In a paper, &quot;Drug Abuse in the
Workplace&quot;, by Walsh and Gust of the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA) [15], this tacit assumption stands behind every
conclusion. It is interesting that they viewed as an intolerable
circumstance of drug use the discovered fact that &quot;marijuana
and cocaine users 'skipped work' two to three times as often as
nonusers, simply because they 'didn't want to be there'.&quot;
[Shuster C.R., Testimony Before the House Select Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control, May 7, 1986.] Walsh and Gust were
unable to recognize that drugs might have helped users realize
their true feelings and that the difficulty might lie with the
workplace rather than with drugs. &quot;The number one problem in
the workplace is drugs,&quot; they tell us. But, according to
Husch [16], &quot;Work is not the arena to which problems are
brought, rather work may be the forum within which problems
arise.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Walsh and Gust assume obliquely that drug use
leads to impairment, neglecting cases where it leads to improved
performance. They refer to occupations &quot;where it is
essential that the individual be free of any and all effects of
all drugs at all times&quot;, without naming even one such
occupation. <i>I challenge</i>. The assumption is that the
individual should adjust to the workplace rather than the other
way around. NIDA advocates Tough But Fair drug policies, but is
it likely that business will be fair when faced with values that
conflict with its own? Why is it that, according to business,
drugs are harmful but pesticides are not? </font></p>

<h1 align="center">A REVIEW OF THE 1990 DRUG POLICY FOUNDATION
CONFERENCE </h1>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Thomas L. Wayburn, PhD </font></p>

<h1 align="center">The Plenary Sessions </h1>

<p><font size="2">The plenary sessions are elitist. Moreover, I
didn't hear anything new or insightful in the plenary sessions
that I attended. This is to be expected from elitism. The idea of
effecting social change by influencing important people who will
then make their influence felt is not a good idea, in my opinion.
It always seems to involve the institutionalization of at least a
little falsehood because important people got to be important by
embracing falsehood, usually, at least the falsehood, as
distinguished by me according to my philosophy, that it is valid
for one person to enjoy more importance than another. Perhaps, in
order to practice what I preach, I ought to write anonymously. A
nice precedent for that is N. Bourbaki, which is the pseudonym
for a group of (highly elite (!)) mathematicians who wrote an
entire collection of math books covering almost all of basic
advanced math in a French that is accessible to nearly everyone.
One of the plenary speakers actually addressed the problem of the
limits of what a political person can say publicly. I would have
liked to ask, &quot;Are these talks, then, to be taken as true or
false? I mean, do you people really believe what you're saying or
are you saying what is merely politically expedient?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I believe (and I think Bruce Alexander said
this too) that the important thing is to produce a body of
statements that have meaning and to approach the truth (the
congruence of statements with events) as closely as possible.
This, then, will be disseminated into the collective
consciousness of humanity and affect the way people think and
act. When enough people think and act appropriately, appropriate
change will be inevitable. We must always refer to an ideal to
know what to think and do. It doesn't help to create a politics
with no basis. Being &quot;realistic&quot; is just an excuse for
being wrong. We need to understand without worrying about what is
&quot;acceptable&quot; and what is not. Then, we need to find a
felicitous way to speak the truth recognizing that we are
fallible. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">If money, for example, is a harmful and
unnecessary institution, it will not help to say otherwise, but
it might be helpful to admit that my proof (and I do have a
proof) is based on assumptions that may not be correct and that
we ought not to dispense with money suddenly but rather favor
measures that lead to its eventual disappearance. So, instead of
saying we will accept the monopoly of the control of drugs by the
medical profession, we should say we will never accept such a
state of affairs and would rather see nothing done (other than
the speaking of the truth) until that eventuality is swept out of
the collective mind. We, on the other hand, can lend our own
personal aid to those who are the most abused in the most acute
ways by the status quo, whether our help lies inside or outside
the law. Presumably, what some members of the ACLU are doing
renders aid within the law as far as it can be rendered in case a
person's liberty be violated. The view that law enforcement
should be replaced by prevention and treatment was fairly well
discredited in the workshops I attended. I shall discuss the
workshops next. </font></p>

<h1 align="center">National Drug Strategy Network </h1>

<p><font size="2">Someone explained the network and handed out
copies of the newsletter, which apparently has some good
late-breaking information. We need reasoning more than we need
news however. The Hemp Tour representative, a young woman,
complained about elitism and certain barriers at the meeting they
(the Hemp Tour) had difficulty dealing with, but, actually, she
held the floor longer than anyone.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Health and Science Committee </h1>

<p><font size="2">Lester Grinspoon stated that Kevin Zeese had
asked him to confine our mission to (i) a public-health plan and
(ii) information. Grinspoon and the co-chair, a person whose name
escapes me, thought we ought to forget about the public-health
plan for now and only Jeffrey Schaler was not content to confine
our mission to information. We began with a tremendous amount of
confusion, though, because everyone had a different idea about
who our target should be and what sort of information was
relevant. Someone said we should address ourselves to other
scientists first and I seconded that reminding the room that that
would provide a natural filter for unscientific information. I
neglected (or was afraid) to ask how many of us were
&quot;real&quot; scientists, i.e., people who apply mathematics
to the analysis of models of nature (mathematicians, physicists,
physical chemists, and engineering scientists). (Oh heck, maybe
biologists, psychologists, and some MDs are scientists after all,
but the &quot;real&quot; progress in science has come from
physicists and mathematicians. The Salk vaccine is not to be
compared to the quantum theory or functional analysis.) Timidly I
suggested that if there was a body of valid scientific
information we ought to identify it and protect it from the
infiltration of scientific drivel. Robert Goodman suggested that
we eschew generalities and embrace specifics and I agree that
that's the only way it can be done.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We agreed that a letter would be written
refuting a recent article in <i>Science</i> and people got
together afterward to arrange to do that. (The more signatures by
famous people, the greater the chance of publication,
regrettably.) Art Leccese wants to get together with me to try to
start a truth squad. I know how to do that in a valid way,
although it sounds scary on the face of it. Actually, Lester was
the one that suggested that one be formed, although, clearly,
that was the import of my suggestion. So from great confusion a
sort of consensus was formed, but it is unclear how our consensus
will have a practical effect. I think if Art and I (and Robert if
he's willing) get together and start a drug literature abstracts
service with thorough specific discrediting of invalid research,
we will have done a great deal. Obviously, we could only survey a
small fraction of the scientific literature at first until we got
institutional help. We might restrict ourselves to pharmacology
and toxicology, omitting epidemiology, and also restrict
ourselves to the journals with the widest circulation. We need an
expert statistician to help us, because &quot;figures don't lie,
but liars figure&quot;.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Why Marijuana Should Be Treated Separately </h1>

<p><font size="2">I think they are right about one thing at
least. Marijuana will be treated separately. Dale Gieringer
betrayed a genuine bias against other drugs. &quot;Our drug is
cool, but your drug is bad.&quot; I talked about that in my first
drug paper. Also, Don Fiedler said &quot;other drugs&quot; twice
but &quot;harder drugs&quot; once, without saying in what sense
&quot;harder&quot;. I would never agree to separate treatment for
marijuana, but, if they want to treat marijuana separately, they
must announce that this is a compromise. If they do not, I will
fight them just hard as I would fight someone who wants to treat
alcohol separately. Gieringer used a specious argument about
marijuana having a constituency and, since heroin addicts don't
demand rights, they are not entitled to any. Richard Cowan, the
libertarian, claiming to speak the absolute truth, spoke what is
almost certainly an untruth, namely, that marijuana is the least
dangerous drug. Now, there are millions, perhaps an infinite
number if we count the undiscovered drugs, so the probability
that marijuana is the least harmful is nearly zero. I suggested
yohimbine (an aphrodisiac discussed in <i>The Naked Lunch</i>) as
a better candidate. Mary Lynn Mathre said that the persistence of
marijuana in the urine might induce some users to switch to
cocaine, say, and, I must admit, I never thought of that. Also,
she defined an addict as anyone who says he (or she) is. I
already commented that this definition is easy to apply but,
perhaps, not too useful, as many people are swayed by their
imaginations. (Maybe this is a good time to interject the
Christian Science interpretation, which, I believe, is
unfalsifiable and, therefore, may not be introduced into
scientific discussion, but it still deserves our attention. (To
be falsifiable means that an experiment or a chain of reasoning
could prove it false if it were false.) Maybe it really is all in
our heads or in the heads of others. In Christian Science, the
reason infants get ill is that they are influenced by the
thinking of those around them. This is what Christian Scientists
call &quot;malpractice&quot;. It is not clear that the infant
experiences the disease or only the adults who observe it do.) </font></p>

<h1 align="center">Alternative Models for Reform </h1>

<p><font size="2">Christina Johns said that no one has addressed
the underlying social causes, but she didn't read last year's
Catalog. I addressed them. She said she would reference me next
time, but she ought to reference Ellen Luff's paper given this
year too. We'll see. I'm going to describe Wasserman's very
interesting paper, which, by the way, contains the first
reference I have ever seen to the work of Joel Feinberg, my Aunt
Mildred's brother. Wasserman points out a number of
inconsistencies and other legal difficulties arising from
half-way measures like excusing the buyer and prosecuting the
seller, non-enforcement, and under-enforcement. Then he gets into
a hot topic - culpability for crimes committed under the
influence. He makes an ambiguous statement, namely, &quot;It is
undisputed that a high proportion of violent crimes are committed
under the influence of alcohol and other drugs.&quot; Does he
means that the drugs influenced the commission of the crime or
that some other aspect of the criminals state or behavior was
influenced by the drug? If the latter, the answer is &quot;So
what&quot;. If the former, the answer is &quot;How would you
know?&quot; All we can do is identify the coincidence of the
events committed, namely, a violent crime and having taken a
drug. No inference about cause and effect can be drawn, nor will
it ever be able to be drawn - in my opinion. Then, he questions
the validity of DWI laws. I have questioned them orally, but this
is the first time I have seen them questioned in print. Good for
him. Potsdam State College (part of SUNY) did an experiment. They
had a bunch of drivers take a skills test sober, then get drunk
and repeat the test. Most subjects did much worse, but the guy
who scored highest sober also scored higher drunk than anyone
else scored sober. True, he hit one pylon when he was drunk, but
he still drove better than any sober person - in the test.
Wasserman likes the Fletcher model whereby the intoxicated
defendant is treated like an accomplice to his own misconduct. He
seems to find fault with other models. But my (ideal) approach
adds this. If the perpetrator does not buy into the moral basis
for the law she (or he) has broken, she cannot be regarded as
having committed a crime. She is a prisoner of war and must be
accorded all the rights and privileges of a captive sovereign
head of state. In particular, if a poor person steals from a rich
person or even commits a violent act upon her (or him), it isn't
a crime if the crime followed naturally from the difference in
wealth, according to my theory. This is war! </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Todd Mikuriya discussed the idea of a drug
cooperative. I don't think it is tenable and the audience wasn't
too receptive either, noting its elitist character. Art Hilgart,
though, thinks more like Luff, Johns, and I (do). He discussed
anomie, the incompatibility of social norms and the incapacity to
meet them. He advocated a public health policy for certain drugs,
but I haven't read his paper. I don't see why we can't make
epidemiological data available to everyone (graphically for those
incapable of dealing with abstractions) and take care of the sick
regardless of how they got sick, given that no one really knows,
except in the most trivial cases (you hit a man over the head
with a hammer ). Hilgart dared to bring up the declining power of
the unions as a possible cause of anomie. Good for him. Clark
Hosmer is not a bad man. (You know I'm going to find fault,
right?) BUT, he wants us to study physiology and to create more
jobs without recognizing what a drag jobs are under the
capitalist system. He makes a nice point, though, about
benefit/cost ratio, but it probably won't wash quantitatively.
It's nice to see a retired army officer espouse a liberal view.
Horst Senger is pushing Say's Law (Say is a competitor of Smith,
Keynes, and Marx). He got hooted down somewhat, mainly because he
just wants to stop people from taking drugs. His advice: let the
government provide them free. But, which drugs? how much? etc. To
conclude, I don't know if the audience was moving toward (i)
let's fix society and (ii) no half-way measures. Maybe.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Preventing Drug Abuse with Education </h1>

<p><font size="2">This was better than I thought it would be.
Sandy Burbank, whom I got to know much better, just wants to tell
the truth and Mary Lynn Mathre just wants to heal the sick, never
mind how they got sick (I think), but I haven't read the paper
for bias and falsehood. Alex Stuart wants to re-instill moral
values but couldn't name one. He got put down hard by a young
Harvard student. I felt sorry for him, but I didn't show mercy
either. I stepped out to the john and got back in time for the
discussion. Paul Kelly exercised his prerogative as a Black to
speak at length, which he did at every workshop that we both
attended, while I rushed through my three sentences with my heart
beating wildly because I was unable to distinguish my &quot;right
to be heard&quot; or expected to be treated like a madman. The
Narconon guy was there, but I believe he didn't mention the bad
part about what they are doing. I don't remember what Roberts
said, if I even heard him. </font></p>

<h1 align="center">New Issues in Drug Treatment </h1>

<p><font size="2">Ray Jeffery was thoroughly rejected as was
Patricia Ritter. Ronald Farrell saved himself by expressing
serious doubts about what he is doing, but, if you read his
paper, you hear some ominous terms, cf., conformity, behavior
modification, deviance. After the workshop I commended Jefferey
on the importance of identifying the harm done by heavy metals,
but the appropriate course of action is to prevent - not to
&quot;tag&quot; the victims. I think, by rejecting all the things
that are not permissible, I set up Luff's call for political
action, if I am not jumping too far ahead. The Cult of Ibogaine
was a little disruptive (this is discussed in my contribution to
the 1991 papers) and a young man named Dana thought that it was
hypocritical for people who wear suits and ties to try to change
society when, presumably, only he can change society, but I
sensed a move toward rejecting the disease theory and behavior
modification and recognizing that we need political change. Of
course, as I said, once we get the quacks off our backs, we will
still have to contend with the clergy. Even if there were
supernatural events involved, which, if you read Chapter 3
(available on request) of my book <i>Beyond Competitionism</i>
(working title for work in progress), doesn't make much sense (in
my opinion), the mainstream and fundamentalist clergy aren't
going to be helpful. So, the &quot;new issues&quot; were either
(i) it won't work or shouldn't be done except for ibogaine, IF
ibogaine works and (ii) we can't ignore the political
implications. If Luff's paper, and mine too, are not referenced
next year, it will tell us that something is wrong. [My hope for
ibogaine has cooled considerably since I wrote this.]</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Addiction: Is It a Disease? </h1>

<p><font size="2">As we all know, this session was in trouble
before it started as &quot;addiction&quot; is undefined and was
never defined, so the use of the word at all begs the question.
Poor Henry Blansfield meant well, but, like us poor sexists, he
revealed his biases by the inadvertent use of one word rather
than another or by the use of a give-away term, cf.,
&quot;unfortunate people&quot;. It reminds me of the Sidney Lumet
film &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot;, wherein the pawnbroker referred
to the black derelict as a &quot;poor creature&quot;, which,
admittedly, is worse. &quot;Don't pity me. Sometimes I wish I
weren't me, but I sure as hell am glad I'm not you.&quot; As I
pointed out, even if it were a disease, and it's not at all clear
that it is, the etiology might belong to medicine, but the
treatment not, particularly if there is none, due to the
irreversible nature of the damage. On the other hand, if medicine
can supply us with a work-around drug, i.e., a drug that provides
a new mechanism for the body to achieve whatever it could not
previously achieve because of the irreversible damage, we will
take it, but first let's see the drug. Medicine wants hegemony
over the resolution of all conflicts in living because it's a
good business. As Shaw said, &quot;Every profession is a
conspiracy against the laity.&quot; I said that any doctor who
claimed to be reversing an irreversible condition, i.e., curing
&quot;drug addiction&quot; would be a quack and I offered as
corroboration the fact that Houston's Dr. George S. Glass
relegates his &quot;patients&quot; to non-medical personnel. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I agree with Jeffrey Schaler. I didn't hear him
say anything that I think is wrong. Jonas sketched a reasonable
picture of the public health model and made me regret my use of
the term to describe the treatment industry in my paper. As I
said above, they should patch up any bad effects of drugs and,
perhaps, advise when advice is requested without losing sight of
the fact that there are many things in this life worth a little
harm to the health. Bruce Alexander's discussion was very helpful
to me, but I think, when he says there are three choices, he is
leaving out a multitude of other options. But, I would like to
quote his statement &quot;There is nothing more practical than
straight thought.&quot; Reworded it could have been the title of
my paper. These dialectical distinctions are not mere quibbling.
We could end up providing an acceptable life for a few thousand
miserable people now and end up with a totalitarian
therapeutocracy in a thousand years. I liked Robert Goodman's
talk, but I didn't completely understand his paper. Also, his
experiment with the purple triangle is silly. Once it begins
whistling &quot;Dixie&quot;, it is no longer a triangle, so you
can't imagine it. But, the point is well taken. We can't imagine
hunger when we are full. So, that promise to quit tomorrow is
meaningless today.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I think we have seen the disease theory pretty
well discredited even if there is some physiological changes due
to taking drugs. People are going to have to develop a better
dialectic and, finally, the public health model is acceptable as
long as it doesn't get mixed up with values and decisions. I
think that was the consensus I saw being formed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Paul Kelly was outrageous and Steve Jonas's
action in assuming that he could be the representative of every
black person who wasn't there but should have been there equally
outrageous. Why, then, wasn't I permitted to speak for every
speed and heroin devotee, as opposed to former devotee, who
couldn't be there? [The initial remarks that were in this
paragraph are confidential, but the concluding remarks concerning
the validity of spiritual intuition may be worth passing on -
even out of context.] Chemical and spiritual transformations
occur and may be dual to one another without invoking the
supernatural. The spirit is part of nature too, is it not? My
main point, I guess, is that a person's intuitive feelings about
what happened to him or her cannot be introduced into public
policy because they are not verifiable. Strangely, we want to
pick science's pocket for all the little doodads that are in it,
but we are unwilling to accept the scientific philosophy in
conducting our affairs. That seems a little hypocritical. </font></p>

<h1 align="center">Racism in the War on Drugs </h1>

<p><font size="2">The talks by Siegel, De Vidts, and Aldrich were
informative. Myers brought the focus over to economics, where I
think it belongs, and the moderator, Raymond Brown, mentioned
&quot;all those shiny towers&quot; (skyscrapers) or something
like that. I mentioned to him afterward that, in America, we
imagine that we can have a high standard of living without
producing anything. We are supposed to have an information
economy, which means that we will live by business alone. Take a
look at the section on the work ethic in my separation paper,
&quot;The Separation of the State from the Christian Church&quot;
[1], to see what I think of that. Blacks can produce things that
we need to live, but they are being excluded from the information
economy, because it's based on membership in a club or class of
people who have IT. Meanwhile, the residual minimum-wage or
less-than-living-wage jobs are growing in number and are open to
anyone. I, personally, would not accept a job that required me to
take orders from someone I did not recognize as qualified. The
truth is very nearly this: No one is qualified. As William Morris
said, &quot;No one is qualified to be someone else's boss.&quot;
I reject bosses and I certainly don't blame anyone who elects a
life of crime in preference to taking orders from an unqualified
boss - for peanuts.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Paul Kelly was there to complain about all the
Blacks who are dying and the under-representation of Blacks at
the conference. I have a hard time accepting the idea that the
situation is different for me and for a black user, but, if you
force me to make the distinction, I have to say that this is a
conference to legalize drugs for white middle-class users.
Perhaps, Blacks should have their own conference, especially if
they are not for full legalization, i.e., government off our
backs. They are pissed off that so many black men are in jail,
but they don't want to legalize. It's up to the bright black
people to show their communities that the laws against drugs are
a problem for them too and that getting rid of the laws will
improve things - at least in the long run. They had better get
the &quot;reverends&quot; out of their politics too. I think the
smart black people know that they have an economic and political
problem and the sooner they realize that a few black
millionaires, whether they became millionaires from drug
trafficking or the usual capitalist crimes, are not going to help
them. It won't help to be exploited by a black man. Black bosses
and business tycoons may be more cruel than whites, since they
have less guilt to bear. That's what I think; I don't know what
the audience thinks. I know we get pretty foggy-brained when it
comes to thinking about Blacks. We imagine that a different
system of logic applies.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Summary of the Conference </h1>

<p><font size="2">Paul Kelly returned my call after the
conference and we talked for about a half an hour on his
&quot;nickel&quot;. I told him all the bad things I said about
him (above). Despite that, I think we ended up as friends. I
pointed out the inconsistency of resenting the large number of
black prisoners and still not wanting legalization. He said there
was nothing for them to do even if they weren't in jail. I
pointed out that I had many friends who had done time and it was
very unpleasant in some ways but not because you couldn't get
drugs. Apparently, one can get used to homosexual activities
easily too without becoming &quot;abnormal&quot;, although I
didn't mention this to Paul as it is not relevant. I attacked the
twelve-step plans and he defended them mainly by reminding me
that I didn't know much about them. We agreed that it was wrong
to force someone into a plan, but he wasn't so sure that offering
it as an alternative to prison constituted force. It was a
well-organized and constructive dialogue in which I was able to
interject a little of my political position and, also, to sound
once again the warning about possible future genocide if it is
not already too late. We ended by agreeing that he would call me
when he comes to Houston later this year or early next year and I
would try to audit a twelve-step meeting to get a better idea of
how they work. I did say I was anti-Christian but not an atheist.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">So, to summarize, a drug network bulletin is
useful and a drug science abstract and truth squad service would
be useful. The marijuana devotees probably have a better chance
to get their drug of choice legalized sooner because they feel
better about their drug than users of other drugs feel about
theirs, correctly or incorrectly. We recognize the usual
intolerance of behavior that is not congruent with our own. The
public health model seems to be replacing the disease model, but
many disease-model therapists and God-squad therapists will
continue to masquerade as public health defenders. The political,
social, and economic causes of people taking more drugs than are
good for them are beginning to be recognized and I think we shall
soon begin questioning the onerousness of most jobs. I saw a news
(?) item on TV where an American factory worker was saying that
his biggest problem is boredom on the job. Of course, the
pharmacological, toxicological, and other physiological aspects
of drugs should continue to be investigated by people who have
nothing to do with the treatment industry. Also, the harmful
effects of heavy metals and other toxic chemicals should be
studied and steps should be taken to contain them and keep them
out of the food chain. Meanwhile, the jurisprudential
difficulties of dealing with people who break laws after taking
alcohol or drugs, or, for that matter, take alcohol or drugs to
give themselves the false courage, badly-termed &quot;Dutch
courage&quot; by one contributor (!), to commit crimes (or acts
of war against the establishment), will continue to be debated
for some time without anyone recognizing that the legal system
has no moral standing as it itself, as a character in a movie
said, is &quot;out of order&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The prevention racket will continue to be
pervaded by lies despite Sandy Burbank and MAMA, but an
interesting breakthrough was noted in the news: the Dutch have
decriminalized sex among twelve- to sixteen-year-olds. I daresay
you get the connection. The aforementioned &quot;truth
squad&quot; could make itself felt on the education scene, but
I'm not sure how. This is hooked up with the efforts to prevent
school prayer and the infiltration of religion into the schools
in other ways. Also, we would like to identify (most) forms of
patriotism as irrational quasi-religion. Last night I was asked
to call in on an American Atheists (AA) radio program on the
local Pacifica Radio station here. I'm not sure I said anything
useful, but AA might be able to mount a small effort to get truth
in to ( and falsehood out of) the schools. I think one has to do
this through the courts as there is no public consensus for it.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">I think most of the participants at the
conference are against 1984-style behavior modification and would
be willing to try to keep the medical profession in its place. I
do not believe the supernatural may be introduced into public
policy, but, clearly, many people still think that something
supernatural plays a role in the process of changing one's
behavior with respect to drugs. I think that, if it does, it
should get re-classified as natural. I mentioned the
inconsistency in the viewpoint of most of the black community,
but I think that many black intellectuals are ready to reject the
stupid dichotomy between Capitalism that is not capitalism and
Communism that is not communism. Hopefully, all Americans will be
open to new ideas soon.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">A SEVEN-POINT POST-PROHIBITION DRUG POLICY </h1>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Thomas L. Wayburn, PhD </font></p>

<h1 align="center">Summary of My 1989 Paper and Some Retractions </h1>

<h4><font size="2">SUMMARY OF THE 1989 PAPER</font> </h4>

<p><font size="2">In Chapter 6 of <i>Drug Policy 1989-1990</i>
(1), I made two important points: (1) according to strict logic,
drugs are already legal; i.e., the laws against drugs are
unconstitutional, and (2) prohibited drugs have many valid uses
and do not constitute a threat to society. The laws against drugs
violate the rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness as
retained by the people in accordance with the Ninth Amendment and
they violate the freedom of religion clause in the First
Amendment because: (i) taking or not taking drugs is a moral
choice and moral choices are religious choices and (ii) taking
drugs can be construed to be a religious ritual. The idea that
the illegal drugs have no legitimate uses and are a threat to
society is an unstated assumption of prevention and treatment
proponents. Even if it is stated, it is incorrect and invalidates
arguments based upon it, as shown in my 1990 paper (2).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the 1989 paper, I impugned the motives of
some of the anti-drug crowd, I enumerated some of the lies told
by drug prevention people, and I expressed skepticism of
treatment programs. I pointed out that psychiatrists, psychiatric
assistants, psychologists, social workers, counselors,
therapists, etc. have a great deal to lose if the drug problem
goes away. </font></p>

<h4><font size="2">SOME RETRACTIONS</font> </h4>

<p><font size="2">But, some of my ideas on the drug problem have
evolved over the past years. I no longer believe that the
government should be entrusted with the task of disseminating
information or educating the public on drugs. Look what
government has done with the public schools, where teachers and
prevention specialists tell terrible lies about drugs and
promulgate biased political, economic, and metaphysical views of
life (2). The job of informing can be handled adequately by
private groups of drug users who are in a position to teach the
responsible, safe, and rewarding uses of drugs, to warn of the
dangers of drugs, and to counteract the propaganda of other
private organizations who wish to limit freedom. Also, whereas I
said that the repeal of prohibition &quot;would return many
talented people to the workplace&quot;, I am now convinced that
the workplace will have to change substantially, creating
opportunities for all kinds of people rather than exclusively for
clones of the &quot;ideal worker&quot;, before talented people
possessed of genuine individuality will return.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In 1989, I said that people must be allowed to
take drugs &quot;in the privacy of their own homes or in other
places set aside for that purpose&quot;. Many people labor under
the incorrect assumption that people use drugs merely to get
high, whereas, in many cases, they use drugs to achieve an
important goal. I now believe the using of drugs must be
facilitated nearly everywhere (so long as the rights of
nonsmokers are protected), particularly in workplaces, schools,
concert halls, museums, etc. Isn't it a little hypocritical to
enjoy, in a place where drugs are prohibited, the works of people
who took drugs to produce art!</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">The Defeat of Prevention and Treatment
Proponents at the 1990 Meeting of the Drug Policy Foundation </h1>

<p><font size="2">Alex Stuart (3) wants to re-instill moral
values but couldn't name one. His arguments that drugs are
morally wrong were refuted soundly by a young Harvard student.
Christina Johns (4), Raymond Brown (5), Jerri Husch (6), and
Ellen Luff (7) pointed out, independently, that most prevention
and treatment efforts divert much needed attention from festering
social problems that result in anomie, as Art Hilgart (8) termed
it. (Anomie is the breakdown of social norms due to the
incapacity of people to meet them.) This view was supported to a
certain extent by Clark Hosmer (9) as well. Rufus King declared
&quot;drug abuse&quot; to be a &quot;nonproblem&quot;.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Behavior modification and other authoritarian
methods advocated by Ray Jeffery (10), Patricia Ritter (11), and
Ronald Farrell (11) were not accepted by the audience, whereas
the papers by Wayburn (2) and Luff (7) could not be refuted.
Farrell himself expressed serious doubts about what he is doing.
The &quot;cult of ibogaine&quot; as represented by Howard Lotsof
(12) is discussed below. One of Lotsof's &quot;cured&quot;
&quot;drug addicts&quot; interrupted the meeting repeatedly to
protest that the &quot;cure&quot; had been found and all further
discussion was unwarranted. I didn't get a chance to tell her
that not everyone wants to be &quot;cured&quot;. The cult-like
behavior of the &quot;cured&quot; person probably harmed Lotsof's
case more than it helped it.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The public-health model gained some credibility
from the independent remarks of Steve Jonas and Mary Lynn Mathre
(13), but it is clear that many disease theorists intend to pose
as public-health workers. Henry Blansfield (14) claimed that
there is some scientific evidence that the use of drugs causes
irreversible physiological changes. I pointed out that, even if
&quot;drug abuse&quot; were a disease, and it's not at all clear
that it is, the etiology might belong to medicine, but the
treatment not, particularly if there is none, due to the
irreversible nature of the damage. On the other hand, if science
can supply us with a work-around drug, i.e., a drug that provides
a new mechanism for the body to achieve whatever it could not
previously achieve because of the irreversible damage, we will
take it, but first let's see the drug. In the meantime, any
doctor who claimed to be reversing an irreversible condition,
i.e., curing &quot;drug addiction&quot;, was a quack. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The political-economic-social system of the
U.S. creates ghastly conflicts in living. Every quack, grifter,
and flim-flam artist wants a piece of the action. Granted, a few
sincere and generous souls, free of the desire for private gain,
wish to help, but political problems don't have long-range
personal or psychological solutions. Of course, those who are
able to ignore the general suffering might improve their own lot
marginally. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Bruce Alexander (15) and Jeffrey Schaler (16)
completed the rout of the disease theory of &quot;drug
addiction&quot;, while Robert Goodman (17) called into question
the concept of &quot;addiction&quot; itself. If there is a gene
for &quot;drug addiction&quot;, let's find it quickly so that
those of us who don't carry it can use drugs without worrying
about &quot;getting hooked&quot;.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Thus, in the 1990 meeting of the Drug Policy
Foundation (DPF), advocates of prevention by authoritarian means
rather than by transforming society and advocates of treatment
were fairly well defeated in debate by those who don't accept the
popular notion that drug use is a problem that needs to be
prevented or an illness that needs to be treated. Therefore, the
DPF should abandon its policy of advocating prevention and
treatment as an alternative to law enforcement. One of the
plenary speakers actually addressed the problem of the limits of
what a political person can say publicly. I would have liked to
ask, &quot;Are these talks (the plenary talks), then, to be taken
as true or false? I mean, do you people really believe what
you're saying or are you saying what is merely politically
expedient?&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I believe that the important thing is to
produce a body of statements that have meaning and to approach
the truth (the congruence of statements with events) as closely
as possible. This, then, will be disseminated into the collective
consciousness of humanity and affect the way people think and
act. When enough people think and act appropriately, appropriate
change will be inevitable. We must always refer to an ideal to
know what to think and do. It doesn't help to create a politics
with no philosophical basis. Being &quot;realistic&quot; is just
an excuse for being wrong. We need to understand without worrying
about what is &quot;acceptable&quot; and what is not. Then, we
need to find a felicitous way to speak the truth recognizing that
we are fallible.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Instead of accepting the monopoly of the
control of drugs by the medical profession, we should say we will
never accept such a state of affairs and would rather see no
change in national policy until that eventuality is swept out of
the collective mind. In the meantime, we can lend our own
personal aid to those who are the most abused in the most acute
ways by the status quo, whether our help lies inside or outside
the law. Presumably, what some members of the ACLU are doing
renders aid within the law as far as it can be rendered in case a
person's liberty be violated.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">My Seven-Point Plan </h1>

<p><font size="2">My new plan for post-prohibition society
consists of the following: (1) an equal-rights amendment for drug
users, (2) teaching people how to live with drugs, to choose them
wisely, and to use them properly (to get the most out of them and
to prevent accidents, disease, and unpleasant side-effects), (3)
new opportunities for drug users, heteroclites, and other people
who are &quot;different&quot; to make contributions to society in
appropriate nonstandard settings including settings where one can
work while using drugs, (4) during the transition, reparations
for victims of the laws against drugs amounting to whatever they
need to live abundantly, and (5) free informal counseling for
troubled or troublesome drug users <i>by</i> drug users. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Since, it must be admitted, some people who are
taking drugs might like to stop - even in a normalized society, I
propose two additional &quot;points&quot;: (6) institutions like
commercial hotels that cost no more than hotels and that have all
the amenities of hotels and more, e.g, VCRs and videotape
libraries and books, except that the (voluntary) guest may not
leave for a fixed period of time agreed upon in advance (by the
guest) nor indulge in certain drugs beyond agreed upon limits,
which might be monotonically decreasing. Rural locations might
provide better settings with lower real estate costs offset by
higher transportation costs. Only one &quot;medical&quot;
&quot;professional&quot; per shift would be needed, namely, to
dispense medicine. I can say truthfully that I would trust any
drug dealer I have known to perform that job - except for one,
who was generous to a fault. Vouchers could be provided for those
who can't pay. And, finally, (7) new drugs that prevent
withdrawal symptoms and cravings may be used (voluntarily), if
they exist. Such claims have been made lately for the drug
ibogaine (12), but, unless the costs are reduced or borne by the
state, it will not be widely used. Also, the claims may not be
true - or not true in an acceptable mode; i.e., the effectiveness
of ibogaine may depend on &quot;religious&quot; faith, which
might diminish the humanity of the patient. Moreover, those who
have been &quot;cured&quot; by ibogaine may have merely
transferred their allegiance to a new drug, which, in the case of
ibogaine, is long lasting (six months or longer) - at first, but
which, after repeated doses, might &quot;need&quot; to be used
more frequently. Lately, similar effects have been ascribed to
the South American drug yage or one of its derivatives. Actually,
the possibility of switching to a new drug is included under
points (2) and (5) above.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">CAN THE STATE TEACH THAT DRUGS ARE WRONG AND
HARMFUL? </h3>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Thomas L. Wayburn, PhD</font>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Chemical engineering consultant
and writer</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Recently Congress enacted a law that requires
every public school in the nation to teach students that
&quot;the use of illicit drugs and the unlawful possession and
use of alcohol is (sic) wrong and harmful&quot;. This reminds me
of the story, whether true or false, that the Illinois State
Legislature once changed the value of pi, the ratio of the
circumference to the diameter of a circle in the Euclidean plane,
to 3.0. The difference this time is that only what may be taught
is mandated rather than what is true. What remains the same, if
we neglect the question of harmfulness for a moment, is that both
judgments are transcendental and may not be legislated by man.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">From a utilitarian viewpoint, &quot;wrong&quot;
and &quot;harmful&quot; amount to the same thing, but it is not
clear that the viewpoint of this law is entirely utilitarian. Nor
is it clear whether the law means that drugs are entirely
harmful, in which case no one would use them, or that the harm
merely outweighs the good. The question of harmfulness (unless
moral harmfulness is meant) presumably belongs to medicine, which
is an inexact science and cannot supply answers to all such
questions. One school of medical researchers claims to have
evidence that marijuana, for example, is harmful; another school
refutes this evidence and presents contrary evidence that
marijuana is exceptionally safe. When the truth has been
discovered scientifically, such disputes tend to disappear. It is
difficult to see how government or the schools can supply answers
that science cannot supply. How is this dilemma to be hidden from
inquisitive students?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Regarding right and wrong, two important
questions are at stake here and neither of them is trivial: (1)
May the state legislate right and wrong in the absence of a
consensus? and (2) May the state legislate what is to be taught
concerning right and wrong? It is not clear whether the subject
of right and wrong belongs to ethics or to morality, if ethics
and morality are at all different. In my lexicon, ethics pertains
preponderantly to respect for truth and morality pertains to
behavior. Most moral decisions are religious decisions, therefore
the legislation of morality is usually a violation of separation
of church and state.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Many may object that the state legislates right
and wrong all the time. For example, the state forbids murder.
Without getting into all of the philosophical considerations that
obtain in the banning of murder, I may safely say that most
people who commit it allow that it is wrong. On the other hand,
we have about twenty-five million Americans who use illegal drugs
and a sizable percentage of them do not allow that it is wrong.
On the contrary, many insist that it is wrong for the state to
repress their natural inclinations and, in some cases, what they
claim are God-given rights and, yes, even duties.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Regarding teaching that using drugs is wrong
and harmful, one must distinguish between teaching both sides of
an open question, i.e., a question under dispute, and teaching
which side is correct. When the state legislates which side of an
open question is to be taught, either it is legislating what is
true, which is totalitarian, or it is denying the necessity of
teaching truth, which is unethical. Perhaps ethics may be
legislated without violating separation of church and state, but
the state may not legislate bad ethics, i.e., an ethic that does
violence to truth.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If drugs are wrong independently of context,
teachers must show why they are wrong or students will ask
questions that cannot be answered without gross distortions of
truth. For example, if a brilliant artist used drugs to create a
masterpiece, the students must be told that the importance of
creating a masterpiece is overwhelmed by the importance of the
damage to the artist's health, however slight, and the importance
of the artist breaking a law. This will be especially difficult
to do if the artist, who may have been Picasso, lived a long life
or lived in a country where - or at a time when - the substances
were legal. If the students are discouraged from asking
questions, the schools will be reinforcing stupidity.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If taking marijuana to treat glaucoma is legal,
then taking marijuana under other circumstances may be wrong only
because it is illegal. Also, the law seems to say that drinking
alcohol (in moderation?) is wrong only when it is unlawful.
Paraphrasing Bertrand Russell: To appeal to the law to invalidate
an act that otherwise would be good is to impute evil to the law.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">But, the law has proved to be evil on numerous
occasions. The law once required the return of runaway slaves.
Nowadays, the law requires an innocent family to be turned out of
its home if a visitor is found with illegal drugs. Therefore, to
ask a student to believe that the use of a drug is wrong simply
because it is illegal is asking too much.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Whether one desires a drug-free society or not,
one ought to deplore this law and take appropriate action to have
it repealed. It is guaranteed to have no effect on many, to
stultify the education of many more, to drive the astute further
into rebellion, to provide additional justification for taking
drugs, to discredit further the educational process, and to
diminish what little respect the law still enjoys.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">DESPITE RECENT FLURRY OF ANTI-DRUG PROPAGANDA,
DRUG PROHIBITION IS INDEFENSIBLE. </h1>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Thomas L. Wayburn, PhD</font>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Executive Director of the
American Policy Institute, Inc.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Recently, a number of anti-drug editorials and
Op-Ed pieces have appeared in the Houston Post disparaging drugs,
drug users, drug merchants, and those who espouse drug
legalization; but, today, December 13, 1993, was a record low for
sheer volume of misguided opinion, misinformation, and incorrect
bad reasoning - mostly as a response to the surgeon general's
innocent off-hand reply to a questioner.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">An interview with John Lucas, the coach of the
San Antonio Spurs and a failed drug user, appeared on page one.
The headline was: 'There are no benefits at all' to legalizing
drugs in the U.S. Deborah Mathis on the Op-Ed page claims,
&quot;Proponents [of legalization], who come from all walks, have
only one argument: It would reduce the violence tied to
drugs.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Both of these statements are patently false. In
my 1989 paper [&quot;No One Has a Right To Impose an Arbitrary
System of Morals on Others&quot; in <i>Drug Policy 1889-1990, A
Reformer's Catalogue</i>, Arnold S. Trebach and Kevin B. Zeese,
Eds., The Drug Policy Foundation, Washington, D.C. (1989)], I
listed twelve practical benefits of legalization. Mathis, at
least, should be acquainted with my paper, which appeared in the
mainstream of anti-prohibition literature.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The twelve practical benefits may be enumerated
briefly (and incompletely) as follows: (1) remove the economic
incentive, (2) eliminate the need to steal, (3) eliminate the
violence, (4) take profits from criminals, (5) remove the thrill,
(6) end the suffering and death caused by unmetered doses,
impurities, dirty paraphernalia, cf. AIDS, substitutes, and
substances that have only a short history of use, e.g., designer
drugs, (7) provide more alternatives for users to select best or
least harmful drug, (8) eliminate the &quot;drug life&quot;, (9)
restore many to useful endeavor, (10) permit people to treat
simple ailments thus reducing health-care costs, (11) eliminate
invasion of privacy, (12) eliminate pharmaceutical McCarthyism.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">But, much more important is the one compelling
ethical reason for legalizing drugs, namely, that any rational, <i>non-politicized</i>
Supreme Court would find the laws against drugs unconstitutional
because they violate the rights to liberty and the pursuit of
happiness as retained by the people in accordance with the Ninth
Amendment <i>and</i> they violate the freedom of religion clause
in the First Amendment because: (i) taking or not taking drugs is
a moral choice and moral choices are religious choices and (ii)
taking drugs can be construed to be a religious ritual. It is
inconceivable that the framers of the Constitution (1789) could
have forgotten the Declaration of Independence. Any argument
based on the &quot;compelling interests of the State&quot; would
fail because the compelling interests of the State would be to
legalize drugs to achieve the benefits enumerated above except
insofar as the State should be interested to support the
prevailing religious superstitions of the masses, which would be
a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">In the paper, I present many other arguments
and answer all the objections of Mathis, Charles Rangel, and
others. In fact, I make a complete case.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Today's Post reminded me that David Robinson,
one of John Lucas' players, libeled all drug users <i>as a class</i>
in a paid endorsement. Also, in an editorial about River Phoenix
(11-18-93), The Houston Post wrote, &quot;Every person who abuses
drugs ... is <i>directly</i> responsible for the death and
destruction caused by those drugs. It matters little whether his
is a casual or serious use&quot;. [Italics mine]</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">To qualify as libel, a statement must be (i)
untrue, (ii) malicious, and (iii) harmful. In the case of David
Robinson, we all know what &quot;scum&quot; is. The great
physicist William Rowan Hamilton was not scum, Charlie Parker was
not scum, Lawrence Taylor is not scum. No human being can be
truthfully said to be scum. In the case of the Houston Post, the
statement is completely wrong, but the use of the word <i>directly</i>
is easiest to refute. Obviously, the direct cause was the bullet,
the impurities in the drug, or the excessive size of the dose,
which was not standardized. As I showed in my 1989 paper, one
might more properly blame the <i>laws against drugs</i>.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">While the tone of Robinson's voice convicts him
of malice, in the case of the Houston Post, the argument is more
subtle - but more informative: It is difficult to reconcile
logically the inclusion of &quot;casual&quot; use under
&quot;abuse&quot;, moreover abuse is not defined. Under
&quot;serious&quot; use the author of the editorial has rashly
failed to consider religious uses and artistic uses, which are
clearly serious. The illogic of his verbiage indicates an
emotionally charged state. Further consideration suggests that
the operative emotion must have been malice. It is obvious that
drug users suffer from this invective. If it does not lower their
own self-esteem, it surely reduces their esteem in the eyes of at
least some bigots. Thus, all the requirements of a class-action
libel suit against David Robinson and the Houston Post have been
met.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Juan Palomo's column of December 13 urges
respect for Joycelyn Elder's suggestion. Paradoxically, he does
not escape my criticism. He says we need &quot;effective
treatment programs&quot;. In my 1990 paper [&quot;Fallacies and
Unstated Assumptions in Prevention and Treatment&quot; in <i>The
Great Issues of Drug Policy</i>, Arnold S. Trebach and Kevin B.
Zeese, Eds., The Drug Policy Foundation, Washington, D.C.
(1990)], I denounced drug treatment. One may call the Drug Policy
Foundation at (202) 537-5005 to obtain copies of these
publications. In some cases I will supply copies of my papers
upon request.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In present day America, however, I would not
expect many people to be swayed by my reasoning. Three hundred
years ago, in his famous <i>Essay Concerning Human Understanding </i>[Oxford:
Clarendon Press, New York (1979)], John Locke wrote &quot;[H]ow
can we imagine that [anyone] should renounce those tenets which
time and custom have so settled in his mind that he thinks them
self-evident, and of unquestionable certainty; or which he takes
to be impressions he has received from God himself, or from men
sent by Him? How can we expect, I say, that opinions thus settled
should be given up to the arguments ... of a stranger or
adversary?&quot; Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky discuss how
the modern totalitarian state works in their book <i>Manufacturing
Consent</i>: <i>The Political Economy of the Mass Media</i>
[Pantheon Books, New York (1988)]. In America, the multi-national
corporations and their servants - the State and the Church -
impress the weak-minded. Strangely, the talking heads on TV are
perceived as men sent by God himself - even though many people
claim to hate them.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">John Lucas got at least one thing right.
&quot;The war on drugs has not been a failure.&quot; The war on
drugs has managed to create an irrational bias against drugs in
many people who are capable of fairly reasonable decisions when
it comes to taking care of their automobiles - for example. The
war on drugs has been successful in promoting falsehood and
tyranny.</font> <br>

<p><font size="2">'It's opium, Dearie. Neither more nor less. And
it's like a human creetur so far, that you always hear what can
be said against it, but seldom what can be said in its praise.' -
Charles Dickens, <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Introduction </h1>

<p><font size="2">I claim that, if one does NOT insist that (i)
drugs are essentially neutral - having good or bad effects
depending upon circumstances only - and that (ii) one has a moral
and legal right to take the drugs of his (or her) choice without
government regulation, control, or interference, that: (1) the
Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) position can be defended
effectively by a non-governmental person (unconstrained by
separation of Church and State) and (2) the pro-legalization
position can be defeated in debate as Charles Rangel defeated
William Buckley in the &quot;Firing Line&quot; debate on the
Public Broadcasting System. (The letter I sent Buckley subsequent
to that debate is in Appendix A.) The argument recommended by
Cliff Schaffer in his paper, &quot;Persuasive Strategies&quot;
and Schaffer's point-by point rebuttal to the DEA position is
convenient to employ as the (imaginary) argument to be defeated
by the (imaginary) civilian apologist for the War on Drugs. By
&quot;civilian&quot;, I mean someone unconstrained by separation
of Church and State and for whom a prohibitionist position does
not represent a conflict of interest, e.g., someone who is not
employed by the DEA. On the other hand, if one insists upon the
aforementioned (provable) conditions, the DEA can be defeated, as
will be shown in the second part of this paper.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Armed with the philosophically and
pharmacologically correct positions on the two crucial issues, I
can defeat an imaginary &quot;civilian&quot; apologist for the
DEA, i.e., a supporter of the War of Drugs. First (1), I show why
the laws against drugs are immoral and illegal
(unconstitutional). Next (2), I attack the morals, motives, and
methods of the drug warriors, thus my argumentation must be
squeaky clean even if I have to admit weak links in my chain of
reasoning (I am generous and give my opponent all the ammunition
he is ever likely to find to use against me; of course, my armor
plating has been designed to withstand this very ammunition).
Then (3), I give arguments for legalization avoiding nearly all
of the arguments discussed in the unnumbered book <i>Drug
Legalization: Myths and Misconceptions</i>; these are the
arguments for which my opponent is not likely to be prepared. If
he can't prepare an argument on the spot, he will be in serious
intellectual trouble. (Cliff Schaffer points out that the reason
this book has no document number or control number or any
reference number whatsoever is that the government didn't want to
publish or admit to publishing this book. I believe he is right.)
Finally (4), I demolish most of the arguments the DEA gives in
the book avoiding the two or three points that I am willing to
concede as I don't believe any of us knows very much about them,
viz., alcohol prohibition in the U.S., the experiences of foreign
governments, and environmental uses. However, I do point out the
unfair tactics used by the DEA. The DEA employs fallacies even in
the very few cases where an honest argument would have sufficed.
I shall omit Step 3 in this presentation as it is covered
adequately in my earlier essays, which shall be made available to
interested parties (Actually, this, my latest essay on drug
policy, may be part of a complete collection if it can be
arranged.)</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Partial Rebuttal of Cliff Schaffer's Argument
by an Imaginary &quot;Civilian&quot; Apologist for the Drug
Enforcement Agency (DEA) </h1>

<p><font size="2">Assume that drugs are unmitigated evil and that
no one has a moral or legal right to use them. As an example of a
defense of the DEA position let us attempt to rebut Cliff
Schaffer's argument - not line by line at this time, although I
have annotated his argument against the DEA essentially line by
line, but this results in too much repetition. Rather, I will
give a few samples of rebuttals that will suffice for one or more
of his arguments. This half of my thesis is less important and
will receive considerably less space, since, like Cliff, I am
interested to defeat the DEA. We differ only in which approach to
the common goal we prefer.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1) A DEA apologist might say, &quot;You
misunderstand the aims of our strategy, which have been fulfilled
to a remarkable degree for the present generation. We must push
forward to benefit future generations similarly. To ask for a
drug-free America is asking too much. However, we have made it
much harder for the productive members of society to get drugs
and, in contrast with the sixties and early seventies, almost no
one approves of drugs. Even artists no longer use drugs to any
great extent, which you can tell by the lack of deep feeling in
their work. In the inner city, the drugs are so weak that it is
difficult for people to become addicted - even to heroin.
Conceivably, most heroin habits are largely imaginary. Jail is an
essential part of our strategy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Mr. Schaffer is either being dishonest or
facetious when he asks us if jail makes people more productive.
We never said (and Mr. Schaffer knows that we don't mean to
imply) that people who go to jail are more productive than they
would be otherwise (they probably were not very productive to
begin with), however many people abstain from drugs or
drastically curtail their drug use to avoid or reduce the risk of
jail and they are the ones we expect to be more productive.
Certainly, Mr. Schaffer knows this. The deterrent effect of jail
is greater in the white population because whites do less well in
jail and jail is more of a disgrace for them, whereas many black
men take jail in stride. Some even feel more at home in jail that
on the street. It's good that they are in jail as they are
provided for and they do not set a bad example in the population
at large.&quot; (From now on I drop the quotes. Also, I shall
abandon the effort of the speaker to emphasize that he is not
part of the DEA, but the reader is to understand he is not
anyway. Therefore, his community standards argument can be rather
religious in nature, which will be harmful to Mr. Schaffer's
likeability - as he, Mr. Schaffer, appears to be going against
God! It is doubtful that Mr. Schaffer holds a degree as high as
the PhD as he puts his SAT scores in English up as evidence of
his entitlement to criticize his interlocutor for using
&quot;big&quot; words. Twice he refers to big words as
sequipedalianistic, which, of course, is an old joke, apparently
not understood by Mr. Schaffer as jokes are not usually told
twice. This is <i>ad hominem</i> and not part of the argument.)</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">2) Mr. Schaffer continues to preface his
remarks with &quot;Every major study shows ...&quot; How did he
become qualified to determine which are major studies and which
are not? How does he know that he is familiar with every study?
This is indeed remarkable. I have here the tables of contents of
the latest issues of the five leading refereed journals dealing
with this subject. Would he be willing to state the results of
each study as I state the journal and authors' names? The
throwing around of names of authoritative studies is an example
of what Jeremy Bentham calls the <i>ad verecundiam</i> fallacy,
i.e., an appeal to the natural modesty of the interlocutor. This
is a form of sophistry designed to make us seem inferior when
there is no good reason why we should. Undoubtedly, Mr. Schaffer
is not familiar with the results of most of the best science done
in this area although he would like us to imagine that he is.
Also, Mr. Schaffer is cavalier with expressions such as &quot;No
one believes ....&quot;, &quot;Everyone knows ... &quot;. These
are sweeping statements and rather dubious to say the least.
Could it be that Mr. Schaffer plays fast and loose with the
facts? Since his remarks obviously are memorized, conceivably he
has read none of the studies, and receives his information
second-hand. A few simple test questions should determine if this
is the case. I have in this box photocopies of hundreds of
reviewed articles supporting our claims. Shall we see how
familiar Mr. Schaffer is with these studies and which he
considers major? Shall we plumb the depth of his knowledge of the
study he last mentioned?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3) Mr. Schaffer refers frequently to historical
facts that tend to support his thesis that drug laws were passed
for all the wrong reasons. Besides being irrelevant to the
question of whether or not they are good laws, what gets written
in history books tends to depend upon the biases of the
historian. Much of this history was written during the long
period, which has not yet ended, in which history departments at
most universities have been dominated by left-wing liberals who
tend to denigrate the white male patriarchy regardless of what
actually occurred. This is part of being &quot;politically
correct&quot; and is only just now being recognized as just as
unfair and biased as history in praise of chattel slavery. The
white male is inevitably cast in the role of demon and the
minority or economically disadvantaged groups are portrayed
always as victims regardless of how many white males they
scalped.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4) Mr. Schaffer claims he wants sensible drug
laws, but he doesn't say what is sensible nor does he give an
example of a sensible drug law.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">5) On the contrary, if drug use is immoral it
is certainly not sensible to tolerate it under the law. If we
did, the law would be incomplete and therefore flawed (containing
something immoral but not illegal). (This is as bad as something
moral but illegal and imputes evil unto the law - if I may
paraphrase Bertrand Russell.) To be fair we should say &quot;more
flawed than it already is&quot;. We are trying to reach an ideal
set of laws, which can be done only after an infinite period of
struggle. We must never bring discredit to the law knowingly,
though. The law does not enjoy much respect - even in the
middle-class. This does not promote the welfare of the State.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">6) Arguments about the success or failure of
drug legalization or prohibition in foreign countries can be
skewed because drugs may not be despised as much abroad as here.
We have done a better job of drug education, presumably. I don't
think we should have too much confidence in anyone's ability to
evaluate the success or failure of drug policies abroad,
therefore I wouldn't make too much of Mr. Schaffer's defense of
so-called legalization programs abroad. Clearly, though,
variations in punishment of drug use from place to place be it
continent to continent or county to county are bound to engender
some migrancy. As we do not approve of unnecessary and wasteful
migrancy because of its environmental and social effects, we
should continue to insist upon a universal international attack
on drugs all over the world to avoid providing safe havens for
moral degenerates.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">7) If adults can get drugs more easily,
children will be able to get drugs more easily. Many adults are
willing to provide drugs for kids as they provided alcohol for me
when I was a kid - either for monetary compensation or for other
reasons of their own (perhaps misguided goodness of heart). I
nearly died driving a car after adults gave me so much liquor
that I had to be carried to my car and placed behind the wheel
where my automatic pilot took over until I plowed into three
parked cars totaling all three and the brand new car I was
driving and putting myself in the hospital. Some goodness of
heart. This could occur if drugs were legal and supplanted
alcohol as the party enhancer of choice.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">8) If multi-national corporations were free to
market drugs, they could employ the media blitzes that have made
Advil a household word in a very short time. If they were no more
scrupulous in the sale of heroin or cocaine than they have been
with Tylenol or Micatin - making extravagant and patently false
and/or deceptive claims, society might be even more threatened
than it is now with dangerous patent medicines. A Tylenol OD is
not a pretty picture. Virtually every vital organ shuts down.
These companies have no morals. It is not their business to have
morals. Profits feed the bulldog and we all know it. &quot;A man
with a wife and children to support will do anything for
money.&quot; His justification is represented by the charming
family portrait on his desk next to his calendar.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">9) If heroin were legal, it stands to reason
that it would be more popular than alcohol. It's a much better
drug and gives more pleasure to the user. Many people do not
realize they are hooked until they try to stop. They don't want
to stop because it's so enjoyable and, for awhile, they may be
able to carry on their lives more effectively than they could
without it. Thus, they have a large window of opportunity to
become addicted. Young people think they are invulnerable.
&quot;Other people might get hooked but not me.&quot; The upshot
is that, with such a seemingly superior product and a long period
of time before its drawbacks are perceived, we have circumstances
guaranteed to result in many more users than currently and quite
plausibly more users than alcohol has ever been able to attract.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">10) The following is a very important point and
the simulator would like the reader to imagine that this speech
is to be delivered with many embellishments and passionate
religious fervor. We cannot have laws in conflict with our
community moral standards and our family values. We cannot allow
these degenerates and perverts to walk freely among us - possibly
infecting our children with their vile condition. This is a
God-fearing Christian country and we will not let the devil have
our children. Blah, blah, blah.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">11) Jail is more effective than treatment.
People must be held accountable for the laws they break.
Prevention works especially when backed up by the deterrent of
jail - both the physical inconvenience of jail especially to
whites and the shame of going to jail particularly for whites.
The black religious leaders must make blacks more ashamed of jail
than they are currently. They may employ the argument that their
own shame is shared by all blacks and that they have let down
their brothers and sisters if they go to jail. One Black in jail
is a disgrace to all Blacks. Consider the argument used by
Dickens with respect to the Jew in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>. He
is a good man, so he leaves the money lending business, which he
was fronting for a gentile anyway, so as not to disgrace all
Jews. &quot;When a Greek goes bad, they say, 'Well, there's some
bad apples in every race', but when a Jew does something of which
society does not approve, they say, 'All Jews are bad.' &quot;
So, Riah leaves the money-lending business and goes to work in a
factory operated by Jews that is a model enterprise for its day
with the best treatment of employees imaginable.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">This ends Part I, wherein I have played the
Devil's advocate against an opponent not armed with moral outrage
and faith in all the good uses of drugs.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Rebuttal to the Arguments in the Book: <i>Drug
Legalization: Myths and Misconceptions</i>, by Raymond J.
McKinnon, Published by the Drug Enforcement Agency to Teach
Prohibitionists How to Argue with Pro-Legalization Advocates </h1>

<h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>

<p><font size="2">I now wish to refute the arguments of the DEA
armed with moral outrage and faith in all the good uses of drugs,
which, according to the beliefs of this author, a benevolent and
far-seeing God included in His design of Nature so that men might
be spiritually inspired by song, story, verse, and imagery to
draw closer to Him. (The author's religious viewpoint toward
drugs explains, metaphorically, why he claims that virtually ALL
great artists used and use drugs as do the greatest scientists
who share the worship of the infinite with artists as discussed
by Whitehead, which makes them the only true scientists, the
others being more or less technicians, though not to be entirely
disparaged if that is all they are capable of. If they took drugs
they might be capable of much more; but, in many cases, their
love of this earthly life, however fleeting and petty, far
exceeds their love of the infinite in the sense of Whitehead -
and Russell, too (writing independently). Therefore, they avoid
drugs because they believe, perhaps correctly, that drugs might
shorten their lives. The author has no intention to prove his
belief, which is, after all, a religious belief. He asks merely
for the same respect that other religious people ask for their
views. Obviously, this view is protected by the Free Exercise
clause of the First Amendment, regardless of what anyone else,
e.g., a Supreme Court justice, thinks.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Thus, I have not proved this close connection
between art and science and drugs. Nevertheless, I am permitted
to assume that such a connection exists in this exposition as an
example of a good use of drugs, which is assumed to exist; and
this positive use is as good as any and reasonably easy to
believe. I do not believe it is fair to &quot;out&quot; living
artists and scientists, but many artists and scientists who are
deceased and have left adequate documentation of their drug use
should convince a fair-minded person that this connection exists.
</font><a name="rmzgreats"><font color="#0000FF"><font size="2">See
Appendix B.</font></font></a> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Declaration of Independence written ca.
1776 gives man the unalienable rights of life liberty and the
pursuit of happiness. Surely by 1789 the Founding Fathers had not
forgotten this when they wrote the Ninth Amendment: &quot;The
enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the
people&quot;. [quoted loosely from memory] Among those other
rights must be liberty and the pursuit of happiness. They did not
guarantee happiness - only its pursuit. Certainly, many men
pursue happiness in no other way than by taking drugs. Your
opinion of whether they are likely to find happiness in this way
does not abrogate their right to pursue happiness in this way.
Needless to say, a man is not free, i.e., possesses not liberty,
unless he can take whatever drugs he wishes.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Amazingly, the argument that drugs actually
enslave the user has been advanced lately; so, apparently, it is
not &quot;needless to say&quot;. This is very easily refuted. A
passage borrowed from another essay should suffice:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">[R. Emmitt] Tyrrell employs the term
&quot;enthralls&quot; with two distinct meanings. This is
equivocation, which is unfair in debate. Since we are enthralled
by drugs as we would be by a great love, it is easy to agree that
these wonderful, miraculous, divine drugs of antiquity have lost
none of their charm with age. It is as though our beloved were
snatched from our arms when the word is suddenly used to connote
slavery, which we detest. We are no more enslaved by our favorite
drugs than we are by our favorite foods - or, to bring home the
sharp sword of truth, far less than the average employed American
is enslaved by his job. The average drug user is free compared to
the average corporate employee. This is the beauty of Jack
Nicholson's speech in the pot smoking scene in the film <i>Easy
Rider</i> when he tells the bikers that the townspeople fear them
because they represent freedom. The druggies of the Beat
Generation and subsequently have been symbolic of man's quest for
freedom. From among us come the free spirits of the land. Only
the oppressor's iron yoke can bow the heads of those who dare to
tread the paths of the liberated criminal saints of the
free-wheeling drug culture. The whole world knows this is true.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">This enslavement argument is extraordinarily
perverse as the whole point of the War of Drugs is to enslave the
world in the interests of the multi-national corporations, i.e.,
the rulers of the world, and those who serve them. Drug users are
not good candidates for wage slaves and they are most likely to
break the mental shackles forged by the massive indoctrination to
which ordinary people are subjected beginning even before
pre-school as their parents are very likely mental zombies and
which continues throughout school and on the nightly news and in
every statement made by the government or big-business through
its massive advertising campaigns, which, lately, have taken to
disseminating such philosophical gems as &quot;Life is a sport;
drink it up.&quot; Drugs serve as a conscious shock, in the sense
of Uspenskii [1], which reorders rigid mental patterns by which
the received wisdom of the church, the workplace, and the State
keep us in line - docile servants of the agendas of the rich
whose &quot;vile maxim&quot; is &quot;everything for us and
nothing for anyone else&quot;. Business (capitalism) requires
large supplies of readily available, unthinking, docile workers,
who may be employed when needed and laid off when not. They refer
to these unfortunate human beings as human resources, which is
supposed to be a more advanced term than <i>employee</i> but
which tends to corroborate our claim that business thinks of
people as so many tons of coal just like any other business
resource.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Allow me to reprint my earlier remarks [2] on
this subject:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Users of drugs are referred to as
&quot;slaves&quot; even though they act more independently than
the average employee of the average American corporation.
Actually, the average religionist, who accepts religious dogma
without reservation is more of a slave than is the most hooked
addict; i.e., the religionist's soul is entirely subjugated
whereas the body only of the addict is under the control of the
addicting drug, as evidenced by the fact that his will remains
free to wish to be free of the addiction. Even this analysis is
granting too much to the use of the word slave. How can one
become the slave of an inanimate substance, which has no will!</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">After we have cleared away the garbage-speak
and the double-speak, we see that freedom to take drugs is a
major point. Many people rate taking drugs higher than sex. Would
you like to prohibit sex? Just try it. To many people, (taking)
drugs is not just the best thing - it's the only thing. Drug
tyranny is total tyranny. Then there is art, which, without
drugs, is gone. Naturally, the establishment wants to keep us
from taking drugs. Taking one tip from Uspenskii, another clue
from Aldous Huxley, and from personal observation, I have
determined that drugs is the fastest route to political. social,
and economic enlightenment - perhaps the only route. (A friend of
mine confessed that he had been a hidebound, right-wing Christian
reactionary until he smoked one joint. The scales fell from his
eyes - instantly.) Cast off the shackles of your mind. &quot;Turn
on; tune in; and drop out.&quot; As Jack Nicholson's character,
George, an open-minded lawyer and an alcoholic, in <i>Easy Rider</i>
says, &quot;They're afraid of you because you represent freedom
and freedom terrifies them.&quot; [quoted loosely]</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Tenth Amendment may be violated as well,
since, as we have shown, such laws may not be enacted by the
federal government. The only question is whether the Constitution
prohibits the States from enacting such laws. In any case, the
Texas Constitution, for example, prohibits the passage of such
laws because of their religious nature. (The Texas Constitution
separates Church and State more definitely than does the U.S.
Constitution.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I have alluded to the religious aspect of drugs
above. Drugs also entail normally a great deal of group ritual
that has every feature of a formal religious observation or rite,
thus the Free-Exercise Clause of the First Amendment is violated
by any law that prohibits these rituals. Actually, the decision
to take drugs or not is a moral decision; moral decisions are
religious decisions; thus &quot;Congress shall make no law
respecting&quot; [with respect to] them, which is the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Moreover, the
controlled substances act has no proper definition of
&quot;substance&quot;, which, according to Bertrand Russell [3],
is a nonsense term, nor is the odd term &quot;drug abuse&quot;
defined. (Does it mean that the user is harming the drug as in
child abuse or does it mean the drug is abusing the user? To
satisfy the due-process clause of the Fifth Amendment, laws have
to make sense. The controlled substance law, employing undefined
terms, does not make sense, thus the drug laws violate due
process as well. Throw in a little illegal search and seizure and
violation of privacy (Fourth Amendment) and you have a nice mess
of constitution bashing all in the name of protecting us from
ourselves. Not a pretty picture. What do you do when you live in
a tyranny with unfair, illegal, and plain wicked laws? You break
them and with a vengeance. If hard drug users would act up like
Act Up, the government would be reeling. I wish drug users would
act up a little more. I believe some &quot;dirty tricks&quot; <i>a
la</i> Abbie Hoffman are in order. A little polite ass kicking
might get some people's attention as well. You know, the place to
get their attention is where they live. (I prefer massive
graffiti attacks, e.g., spray painting &quot;liars&quot;,
&quot;thieves&quot; in huge black letters across the front of the
DEA building in Washington or on the homes of prominent drug
warriors.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I have written voluminously on the positive
uses of drugs and the rights of drug users. This is as much as I
need to repeat here, because I am going to assume the two
condition in my argument anyway. They don't have to be true for
this argument to be true. I wish only to illustrate the utility
of proving that they are true. I wish to show how much you can
prove once you have these two simple principles at your disposal;
namely, (i) the laws against drugs are illegal and immoral and
(ii) drugs are inherently neutral such that the desirability of
drug use depends upon circumstances.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">After I attack their arguments, I plan to
introduce arguments from my earlier papers that they are
undoubtedly not prepared to rebut. If I am to go first, I would
studiously avoid every argument in their book! This should create
general confusion among poor debaters who cannot think for
themselves on their feet. I intend to approach their arguments in
two ways: (i) logically, i.e., without an appeal to questionable
data, and (ii) empirically, concentrating mainly on their
misstatements.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Finally and most importantly, one can state
with confidence that no valid scientific evidence exists to
indicate that the use of drugs is more harmful than it is
beneficial or that it causes any type of impairment rather than
enhanced abilities as we claim. Actually, no satisfactory
experiment can be performed to test the effects of drugs on
humans so long as we are living in a state of mass hysteria that
is guaranteed to skew the results. Nor will any such experiment
be performed before drugs are legal and drug use is normalized to
the point where a drug user is considered no more abnormal than a
reader of poetry, say.</font> </p>

<h2>FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES </h2>

<p><font size="2"><b>Fletcher's Doctrine:</b> This comes from
legal philosophy. It proposes that the drunken man is not
responsible for what he does when he is drunk, but the sober man
he was when he decided to become drunk and, then, performed the
acts required to become drunk is responsible for what the drunken
man has done. This is fair because the person enabling the
drunkard presumably had good knowledge from personal experience
of how the drunken man might behave. No one gets away with
anything.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Dram shop laws:</b> The Fletcher Doctrine,
which is valid, is in sharp contrast with the dram shop laws,
which punish individuals who may have no knowledge of the
individual whom they enable to become intoxicated, who are in the
business legally of so enabling him, and who have every right to
assume his behavior will be rational and normal. Dram shop laws
are unfair and violate due process, probably, as they are
unreasonable.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Definition (Imaginary offense).</b> An
imaginary offense is an act that appears to violate the rights of
another individual only because of how that individual conceives
of that act. But, with a different viewpoint on the part of the
person putatively offended would not violate any rights
whatsoever, in contradistinction with acts that violate the
rights of individuals regardless of what they think. An example
is a mother who imagines that her son's homosexuality is ruining
her life, but would not be offended or inconvenienced if her
attitude toward homosexuality were different. Many family members
of drug users imagine that they are disgraced by the behavior of
their close relative who uses drugs, but this is because they
have a bigoted and intolerant attitude toward drug use, in many
cases inculcated by anti-drug propaganda and mass hysteria. The
proof of this is that in some families no one thinks anything of
it. If the rights of one family are not violated by the drug use
of one of its members, then no family's rights are violated
because the verdict depends upon how the non-users think and is
completely independent of the behavior of the drug user. If, on
the other hand, the drug user beats his wife when he is on drugs,
the Fletcher Doctrine kicks in.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Wayburn's Doctrine (unless a prior
enunciator of the doctrine can be identified): </b>One cannot be
convicted of a crime in the average. Crimes do not apply to
statistical averages, but to individuals only. A statistical
average cannot commit a crime. If an activity is harmless in some
cases then it cannot be considered a crime. One must discover
what aspect of that activity is always harmful to identify the
crime. Thus, since using drugs is normally (or even sometimes)
harmless, in which case it interferes with no one's rights and
the State has no compelling reason to prevent it, it cannot be
considered a crime even if it is harmful in some particular case
involving some particular individual or individuals. One must
base criminal law upon the combination of the activity and the
harmfulness. If, due to societal conditions, harm is done
independent of the user of the drugs and because of circumstances
that are not of his making, the harm should be blamed on the
social conditions operative and, since all of society is to
blame, no criminal law can be construed. This is very much
related to the commonly known principle that a person may not be
punished for a crime until he commits it - certainly not because
people who share some characteristic with him have committed the
crime in the past.</font> </p>

<h2>SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE DEA ARGUMENT </h2>

<h3 align="center">Dyslogistic and Eulogistic Fallacies
(Respectively) </h3>

<p><font size="2">These consist in using terms that have negative
or positive (respectively) connotations in situations that call
for neutral expressions, generally because they belong to
statements about which nothing has been proven, often statements
that would be the conclusions of their logical developments, if
they had resulted from logical developments rather than a jump
directly to the conclusion without evidence or logical
development of any type, usually appealing to nothing better than
popular opinion or the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot;, which in
some cases has been &quot;manufactured&quot; by their own
propaganda. A good example is the use of the conclusory terms
&quot;myths&quot; and &quot;misconceptions&quot; in the title of
their book, which, by the way, is in violation of their mandate
and represents a clear-cut conflict of interest.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Passing off unscientific work as scientific </h3>

<p><font size="2">The literature cited by the DEA refers, in some
cases, to &quot;scientific&quot; studies funded by organizations
with a vested interest in the outcome. Impartiality is an
absolute requirement for science. That work is disqualified. In
other cases, unrefereed journals such as the <i>New York Times</i>
are cited. This, too, cuts no ice. Only very few studies have
even a chance of having been performed by scientists who are
disinterested in the outcome. Even university professors know
what side they are on before the study commences.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Shifting the Purpose of the Drug War to
Accommodate the Argument </h3>

<p><font size="2">The DEA is not very specific as to the purpose
of the War on Drugs. Obviously, the intent is to prevent people
from taking drugs. But, why? Actually, a host of social ills are
ascribed to the manufacture, sale, and consumption of drugs.
However, over the course of their (imaginary) rebuttal to the
affirmative of the question: Should Drugs Be Legalized? one ill
or the other is mentioned depending on the argument they pretend
to be refuting.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Occasionally, the great &quot;evils&quot; that
are supposed to arise due to legalization are inherently neutral
and may actually be beneficial under important circumstances. For
example, addiction is beneficial if it is in the best interests
of the &quot;victim&quot; of &quot;addiction&quot; not to forget
to take the drug in question regularly. If blood pressure pills
were addictive, we wouldn't forget to take them, would we!</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Sometimes the &quot;bad effect&quot; to be
avoided actually favors one or more of the other goals of the
War. For example, early death by overdose of heroin certainly
reduces the share of the national health-care budget consumed by
the victim. Also, if the user can write his own prescriptions -
for athlete's foot medication, as well as for sleeping
medication, if indicated - the doctor's time is saved and the
health-care budget is reduced. Physicians, in particular, do not
want the health-care budget to be reduced. They wish to gather
more and more conflicts in living under their already sweeping
purview. For example, physicians want to take charge of the
gang-warfare problem!</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The DEA is careful not to mention mitigating
circumstances that do not favor their argument. Clearly, they are
interested in winning this debate by whatever means necessary
rather than arriving at a valid policy, which, unfortunately,
would cost them their jobs. They have a definite bias, but so do
I. I want a longer drug menu. Moreover, I wish to avoid going to
jail. Actually, jail for me, even for five minutes, is absolutely
out of the question!</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It makes sense to look at the DEA rebuttal from
the point of view of its goals, real or pretended, to determine
if a goal is worth achieving or if a circumstance that interferes
with one goal achieves another. I shall employ an outline form in
which the Roman numerals correspond roughly to chapter numbers.
This section may serve as a brief summary of the remarks that
will follow, although I will have much to say that will not be
repeated.</font> </p>

<h4><font size="2">I. ADDICTION</font> </h4>

<h5>A. Biological </h5>

<p>The only difficulty with addiction occurs if it becomes
necessary to stop the addictive behavior. But, why would anyone
want to stop taking drugs unless an external influence were
operative. (Occasionally, though, people just stop for no
apparent reason, in which case the addiction has disappeared and,
therefore, was not a serious problem - at least not the problem
it was cracked up to be.) Normally, the external influence arises
because of the laws against drugs and the propaganda necessary to
&quot;sell&quot; an inhuman and unnatural point of view to
otherwise rational persons. Taking drugs is a natural trait of a
natural person and has been since drugs were discovered in
pre-history. No one has any evidence to the contrary, thus the
position need not be defended. If one disagrees, one merely holds
a different view and nothing more. This is insufficient reason to
exercise tyranny. </p>

<h5>B. Psychological </h5>

<p>The psychological aspect of &quot;addiction&quot; is, in the
view of Dr. Robert Goodman [4], a manifestation of the simple
fact that we like to repeat pleasant experiences. It is simply
absurd to try to turn that into a pathology. In Iran, when
opiates were legal, a large proportion of the population consumed
them. Is it reasonable to suppose that a large proportion of the
population of Iran was mentally ill! </p>

<h4>II. CRIME </h4>

<p>As will be shown, it is futile to claim that crime will be a
serious consequence of drug legalization. Crime is caused by our
insistence upon allowing human activity to center around
competition for wealth and power - our refusal, in the face of
incontrovertible evidence, to abandon competition for wealth,
power, and fame utterly! [5] </p>

<h4>III. PLACES WHERE LEGALIZATION FAILED </h4>

<h5>A. Addiction increased. </h5>

<p>For every bad case of addiction they can find, I can find a
good case. Addiction like drugs themselves, is neutral, i.e.,
depending upon circumstances as to its desirability. One may not
demonize addiction any more than one may demonize drugs. The
demons are imaginary. This view is just as good as any and must
be respected until a valid scientific experiment proves
otherwise. No such experiment has been made. Always drugs are
placed in a singularly disadvantageous position, thus ensuring
the results desired by the biased pseudo-scientists. (A true
scientist must be absolutely fair if not completely
disinterested. It is practically impossible to find a
disinterested scientist and, if he could be found, who would fund
his research?) </p>

<h5>B. Death rate of users increased. </h5>

<p>The true spiritual man is undaunted by this kind of talk. It
means nothing to him. But, his death, in any case, if, indeed,
there is any rational reason to fear death from drugs in a
normalized society where drugs are legal and drug users are
treated like everyone else or like an avid reader of good
literature, for example, i.e., merely an anomaly, I say, his
death will normally be quick and inexpensive so that people who
think along such lines (sorry specimens of humanity in my view)
needn't worry about having to support health care for someone
they don't like or have no interest in. (In Appendix C, I show
that the laws against drugs cause many more deaths than are
caused by drugs themselves. This provides a compelling reason for
legalization.) </p>

<h5>C. Crime increased. </h5>

<p>The evidence presented by the DEA seems to indicate that the
only crime that increased, at least in Great Britain, was the
State-manufactured crime of taking drugs itself. </p>

<h5>D. Cost of law enforcement increased. </h5>

<p>If any crime other than the artificial crime of taking drugs
itself increased it was caused by competition for wealth, power
including negotiable influence, i.e., influence that can be
converted to wealth or power, and negotiable fame. Drugs have
nothing to do with our need for law enforcement. Perhaps, if
everybody &quot;turned on and tuned in&quot;, we wouldn't need
law enforcement or, for that matter, armed forces. This view is
as good (and better if one reads my book [5]) as any other view
until proven otherwise. I remain confident that no such proof is
forthcoming as I have proved (in my book) the view supported by
myself as well as social theorems are ever proved (without the
absolute necessity to employ drugs to achieve the spiritual
revolution of which I have spoken). </p>

<h5>E. Addicts will burden welfare and the health-care sector. </h5>

<p>If, as we demand, drug users are given the same opportunities
as everyone else, they will out-perform everybody. No experiment
to disprove that has ever been attempted even though it is easy
to design one. (Remember, the drug users must be free of any
negative expectations or social stigma or fear of social
retaliation or demonization or scapegoating during the trials of
their effectiveness at tasks of their own choosing.) So much for
welfare. </p>

<p>The health-care issue is settled. Prohibitionists can't have
it both ways. Either drugs will shorten lives or they won't. If
they don't, drug users are as likely or more likely to contribute
to health care (by virtue of their genius) and less likely to
burden the system as many will choose to doctor themselves. </p>

<h4>IV. CRACK BABIES </h4>

<p>Let's wait six months to a year. I can virtually guarantee
that, by then, so-called crack babies will prove to be yet
another myth surrounding drugs - in a category similar to
&quot;reefer madness&quot;. See below. </p>

<h4>V. MONEY </h4>

<p>As will be shown, the money is in prohibition. What will all
the quacks, charlatans, and parasites do when peace breaks out?
The ineptness of drug users that is supposed to cause workplace
accidents has no scientific basis as in the previous cases. </p>

<h4>VI. MORALS </h4>

<p>The American government and the Christian right are not
qualified to comment upon morals. The moral position is held by <i>us</i>
as will be made abundantly clear as the argument unfolds. </p>

<h4>VII. MEDICAL USES OF SO-CALLED ILLEGAL DRUGS </h4>

<p>The DEA opposes the medical use of certain drugs for their own
political reasons only. This is criminal. They wish to pretend
that they can make certain drugs go away completely. The War on
Drugs has been amazingly successful in demonizing drugs and drug
users. (I can hear Chomsky saying, &quot;Goebbels would be
impressed&quot;, which is not something I would write.) However,
in stopping the flow of drugs it has been a dismal
&quot;failure&quot;. I predicted [5] that we would see new
horrors and we have seen them. Too many people have too much to
lose if drugs disappear. The DEA, itself, will never let that
happen! So, the typical pro-legalization cant that the War on
Drugs has failed is only half right and by no means the best
half. Personally, I think the DEA has achieved nearly every goal
on its agenda. </p>

<h4>VIII. INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS </h4>

<p>The DEA claims that individual rights must bow to the
potential harm done by a few; however, it seems that the
trampling of human rights itself is the <i>raison d'tre</i>. A
free people do not permit the punishment of people before they
commit a crime and the prohibition of drugs is just that. For
many of us, it is a draconian punishment that we shall struggle
against as we would struggle against the worst sort of tyranny -
for which drug prohibition is a good candidate. No measures
should be ruled out in a struggle for an essential element of our
humanity, e.g., the ability to make our own decisions, which is
part of the definition of freedom, cf., The Random House
Dictionary [6]: </p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2"><b>Definition (Freedom).</b>
<i>Freedom</i> is the exemption from external control,
interference, regulation, etc. It is the power of determining
one's own actions or making one's own decisions.</font></font> </p>

<h4><font size="2">IX. LEGAL ASPECTS</font> </h4>

<p><font size="2">The difficulties suggested by the DEA can be
overcome easily. We still have Fletcher's Doctrine, so nobody
gets away with anything. The Food and Drug Administration can
advise and we are certain to take its advice into account.
However, desperate people may take desperate measures if they
wish, e.g., those dying from AIDS. Pharmaceutical companies and
other drug manufacturers must continue to bear responsibility for
what they do - as do we all. Nothing new here.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">The Meaning of the Word Addiction Is Not Made
Clear </h3>

<p><font size="2">In Chapter 1, below, I have defined nine types
of addiction, which does not constitute an exhaustive list. When
the DEA compares the rates at which given substances addict,
i.e., the fractions of people who having used at all become
addicted, they are comparing apples with oranges if the types of
addiction are widely disparate. For example, comparing the
addiction rate of cocaine to that of nicotine is nonsense, as the
short-term addictive effect of cocaine is gone once one elects to
sleep. On the other hand, nicotine withdrawal is normally
accompanied by painful symptoms that make the victim unfit for
human companionship in many cases. In real life in the fast lane
of rock music, we rarely encounter severe cocaine withdrawal
symptoms. The psychological dependence is merely the regret one
experiences when one must forego a gratifying and delightful
experience. This kicks in when the physiological withdrawal is
over and its unpleasantness depends entirely on the individual
and not at all on the drug.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If I wished to add an amusing tenth type of
addiction to the list below, I would consider an entirely
separate type of addiction that is added intentionally to a
medication, such as blood pressure medication, that must be taken
daily, but, by itself, provides no gratification that impels one
toward a healthful regularity in one's use. I wish the drug
company would add something addictive to my Indiral so that I
wouldn't forget to take it. I have just given an example of an
addiction that is useful and wholesome. Evidently, the
demonization of addiction is irrational and those who use
addiction always in a dyslogistic sense have fallen into a
logical trap.</font> </p>

<h2>CHAPTER BY CHAPTER REBUTTAL </h2>

<h3 align="center">The Introduction to the DEA Document </h3>

<p><font size="2">The DEA expects us to prove that the benefits
of legalization outweigh its costs, however benefits and costs
may be noncomparable when a moral imperative is involved.
Generally, the DEA will be concerned with length of life as
opposed to quality of life. The notion that some suffering is
worthwhile is lost on them. Their question about using drug
addiction as a defense in a trial is answered by the Fletcher
Doctrine above. Finally, they wish to dictate the terms of the
debate. Naturally we shall insist that the terms of the debate be
negotiated between us and we shall have something to say about
them.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter One: Addiction Rates and Drug
Legalization </h3>

<p><font size="2">I don't use the argument that drug use will go
down and, frankly, in some cases, I hope it goes up. We can make
the best drugs available and, quite naturally, users will choose
the better drugs over those with serious drawbacks. If powder
cocaine and new syringes are readily available, the use of crack
cocaine might well disappear. Further, legal research should turn
up even better drugs with few, if any, drawbacks.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Cocaine is said to be much more addictive than
alcohol and yet some experts [7] claim that cocaine is not
addictive at all. I have classified cocaine under Case 2 (below),
short-term addiction, and Case 4, pseudo-addiction, you enjoy an
experience so you wish to repeat it. Years ago, no one considered
cocaine addictive, mainly because there are no withdrawal
symptoms. The &quot;violent psychotic behavior&quot; they
associate with cocaine is almost never seen in practice. Make
them state incidence rates and how they were obtained. The reason
that there is &quot;no effective, permanent treatment&quot; for
cocaine use is simple. Cocaine use is not a disease! Naturally,
some people want to medicalize everything. There's gold in them
thar hills. For the record, I include my short list of types of
addiction together with a brief analysis of how well they fit the
definition of disease [8].</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I have compiled a short list of phenomena that
are sometimes referred to as (or mistaken for) drug addiction:
(1) self-medication for chronic depression or chronic pain, (2)
taking a drug that causes a symptom that can be relieved only by
taking more of the drug or by the passage of a few hours, (3)
acute withdrawal symptoms that last several days, (4) dedication
to the repetition of a pleasurable experience regardless of
long-range consequences, (5) taking a drug to perform a task,
which might have to be performed several times a week, perhaps to
make a living, (6) obligatory daily performance of a task that
cannot be performed during withdrawal from a drug, (7) using
drugs to isolate oneself from the painful realities of life in a
bad world, (8) unwillingness to pass an opportunity to take drugs
because the law may cut off one's supply, (9) the case of a drug
that, like valium or blood-pressure medication, poses a health
risk if one forgets to take it in the absence of a craving that
(blessedly) reminds one to take it. In Case 1, a physician may
prescribe another drug, Case 2 is normal and involves a conscious
choice between two alternatives on the part of the individual,
Case 3 might require supervised tapering off or the prescription
of other drugs, Cases 4-8 are behavioral choices in the face of
circumstances that are beyond a therapist's control. I do not
believe any of the cases correspond to what we normally call a
disease. Case 9 is a normal medical situation and stretches the
meaning of addiction seriously, but may not be omitted as it
constitutes a requirement to take the drug, which, in this case
and in this case alone, is strictly medical.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug abuse usually refers to some type of
behavior of which other people do not approve but which is
consistent with the goals of the user, who might be a criminal or
only an oddball. The term &quot;denial&quot; is a fallacious
appeal to the authority of the treatment community in a dispute
with a user who is insufficiently articulate to defend his values
and motives. The term &quot;denial&quot; is an impostor term.
When the user himself disapproves of his own behavior, the term
&quot;drug abuse&quot; might make sense, unless the user is a
victim of anti-drug propaganda. Many people who have tried to
stop taking drugs might benefit from the friendship and advice of
other drug users. As suggested by Henman [9], drug use must be
looked at from the perspective of the user.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We are told marijuana is stronger nowadays. So,
take less! Also, label it honestly. If anything, its strength
will be exaggerated, by establishment growers. <i>Especially</i>
by establishment growers! Also, remind people that you needn't
smoke it. The THC can be extracted with butter and drunk with
coffee or even milk. (Never try to extract it with water, of
course. It's not soluble in water.) If they use the argument that
the commercial product Marinol, which contains THC, lists
numerous side effects associated with THC. Just pull out the
blurb that goes with a common prescription medicine that is
normally deemed safe and see how long the list is for <i>it</i>.
I would choose Imitrex, which cures migraine headaches, the total
number of side effects listed is thirty-four, unless I
miscounted. Remember, any symptom that is reported by as many as
1% of the test group and appeared at least as frequently as it
did in the placebo group must be listed. If they tell you
marijuana impairs sexual function, ask them if they are worried
about low birth rates. That's the kind of shifting of priorities
that they are fond of doing when it suits them. Just what is it
they don't want to happen? Do they really care more about the
health of junkies or about the property of the affluent? If they
tell you drug use drives up medical costs, ask them how much they
spend on the indigent compared to the well-heeled. Of course,
early death, if it really occurs, reduces consumption of scarce
resources, e.g., gasoline. Obviously, the ill effects of
marijuana are never seen in the real world - only in the labs of
over-zealous &quot;scientists&quot; anxious to ingratiate
themselves with funding agencies, who, it must be admitted, are
rarely run by hippies.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Finally, they use the term &quot;common
sense&quot; in a fallacious way and refer to &quot;misery and
death&quot;, which occurs only rarely among sensible users. It is
worth noting that the increase in use foreseen by some is mere
speculation at best as no one can predict the future in this
case. They have no scientific theory upon which to base their
predictions.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Two. Crime and Drug Legalization </h3>

<p><font size="2">Once again, at the beginning of this chapter,
the DEA claims that some drugs, notably crack and PCP, cause
violent and anti-social behavior. First of all, ask with what
frequency. This behavior is virtually never seen in the real
world. If pressed, I could indicate, from personal experience and
the experience of friends and acquaintances, how exceedingly rare
this behavior must be as it is never witnessed by me or anyone I
know. Even if a few did exhibit such anti-social behavior,
society may not punish everyone for the actions of a few - and I
mean a very few. Alcohol is the drug that causes violent and
anti-social behavior,<i> particularly if the user has seen armed
combat</i>.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The DEA divides crime associated with drugs
into three categories: purchase-related crime, drug-induced
crime, and black market crime, which I shall consider separately
as they do.</font> </p>

<h4><font size="2">PURCHASE-RELATED CRIME</font> </h4>

<p><font size="2">They claim, at the outset, that drugs are cheap
now, which is far from the case - even for a middle-class user.
They claim that prices might not go down, therefore
purchase-related crime (crimes committed to get the money to buy
the drugs) would not decrease. However, establishment drug firms
have the technology to produce drugs cheaply and they might find
themselves in heavy competition as no patents can be held on the
traditional drugs. Moreover, they would have no research costs to
defray. (Research on marijuana has already been done by the
underground - and done well, I might add. Tobacco growers would
benefit immediately from this knowledge.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">First the DEA claims that purchase-related
crime would not decrease because prices would not go down. Next,
they claim that, if prices go down, use would increase, so
purchase-related crime would rise proportionately. Possibly use
would increase, and I hope it would, as drug use improves people
in my experience. But, the price should be sufficiently reduced
that the cost of the saturation dose would not be prohibitive to
poor people even, who manage to find the price of a pack of
cigarettes. At one point in the argument, the DEA claims property
crime goes up with drug use - essentially for no reason at all.
This won't wash as all the conditions will have changed and no
such general rule can be justified.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Of course, if hard pressed, poor people will
steal just to live, but that's another problem, namely, poverty
itself, which had better be solved and solved soon. But, nothing
the DEA recommends will solve poverty. People who cannot get
drugs do not have a better chance to get decent work than drug
users would in a normalized situation. The trouble is in the
economy and has nothing to do with drugs. In fact, the drug war
can be explained as a tactic to draw attention away from real
problems.</font> </p>

<h4><font size="2">DRUG-INDUCED CRIME</font> </h4>

<p><font size="2">Drug testing of people arrested for putative
crime proves nothing about drugs causing crime. This is the
well-known <i>post hoc ergo propter hoc</i> (after this therefore
because of this) fallacy. (The fallaceous assumption is that
everything that happens after some distinguished event is caused
by it.) The DEA statement that, &quot;Drugs changed their
behavior, enabled, and encouraged them to act violently and
irrationally,&quot; is completely unsupported and has been
dismissed by my earlier remarks. The authors of the DEA arguments
are shameful in their use of deceptive and inflammatory rhetoric.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">They often bring up crack, a drug that I, for
one, shall assiduously avoid; however, they neglect the role of
the drug war in encouraging the invention of crack as a marketing
gimmick. If Squibb would provide a wide menu of cocaine products
other than crack, the use of crack would probably disappear, as
it is not a very good drug and users would choose better ones.</font><font
color="#0000FF"><font size="2"> </font></font><font
color="#000000"><font size="2">Moreover, the research of Schama
et al. [10] will disprove the existence of crack babies - unless
I am very much mistaken.</font></font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug-induced crime is largely a myth. The DEA
has no case here. The constitutional rights of (otherwise) law
abiding citizens may not be denied due to the behavior of a few
exceptional people who would probably commit crimes with or
without drugs. No scientifically verified mechanistic link has
been established between taking drugs and committing crimes.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The DEA says, &quot;Drugs changed [drug users]
behavior, enabled and encouraged them to act violently and
irrationally.&quot; Presumably, this would not occur except in
psychotic individuals, however it is well known that psychotic
people are incapable of coping with the exigencies of habitual
drug use with all its complicated business of obtaining money,
copping, and dealing with diverse and complicated people. Thus,
people who are likely to behave irrationally will not be able to
take illegal drugs on a consistent basis such that the fears
retailed by the DEA would be at all realistic. <i>Fear</i> of
people going crazy on drugs is the only irrational behavior one
is likely to encounter in connection with drugs. It is no stretch
of logic to claim that the DEA is driving Americans crazy by
inducing mass hysteria and unjustified fear of drugs, dealers,
and users.</font> </p>

<h4><font size="2">BLACK MARKET CRIME</font> </h4>

<p><a name="bmcrime"><font size="2">It is patently absurd to
imagine the black market competing with Parke-Davis unless
punitive taxes are levied, which would be unfair and unwise. It's
not likely that the Cali cartel has the muscle (or ruthlessness)
to take on multi-national corporations, most of which can put a
creditable army in the field if it serves their selfish interests
to do so. The Cali cartel is a midget compared to Squibb. This is
the DEA's silliest argument - so far; but, don't worry, they will
top themselves.</font></a> </p>

<p><font size="2">Children are bound to get drugs from adults
under any scenario unless they can be convinced not to - black
market or no. I believe the best an honest educator can do is
steer kids to the better and less harmful drugs and teach them
how to use drugs effectively and safely. The schools presently
are incapable of offering an educational alternative that can
compete with drugs with their power to attune our sensibilities
to the best that our culture has to offer and make worthwhile
subjects intensely interesting. All that the schools offer is
lies, drudgery, boredom, and all the wrong stuff. Kids who take
drugs are much more likely to take an interest in scholarship and
art than are squares. Personally, I don't want my kids attending
any school I can think of - not Harvard, not any of them - and I
have taught in four universities and attended many more including
the elite academies. Frankly, I don't see many important
differences among them. They are all bad.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Three. The Experience of Foreign
Countries and Drug Legalization </h3>

<p><font size="2">I do not intend to use this argument, but I
must comment on some of the specious arguments in this chapter.
The DEA claims that &quot;legalization did not work&quot; in any
foreign country. They neglect to say what they mean by
&quot;work&quot;. In some cases, it worked for me. In the
paragraph on Great Britain, the DEA refers to the journal <i>Lancet</i>,
but they don't give us a reference directly to <i>Lancet</i>.
Rather, they refer to a letter, which, we, of course, would not
be able to find in our library. This simply makes it impossible
to determine if they have quoted <i>Lancet</i> correctly - if
they have evaluated the conclusions of the <i>Lancet</i> article
fairly. From experience, acquired in this booklet, we know better
than to trust the DEA. They are dishonest and must be watched
carefully in everything they say and do. In fact, every single
reference at the end of this chapter is clearly biased in favor
of their position. This is typical of the references, as I have
said before. Even references to university studies are tainted,
as the sponsors and/or the directors of the institute doing the
study are far from disinterested - to the everlasting shame of
all who profess science as their field of endeavor. Science: once
sacred, is now a tool of the wickedest people on earth.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Later in the section on Great Britain, we are
told that only 20% of the &quot;addicts&quot; participate in
methadone programs. They conclude that the reason for this is
that heroin is a better drug. Almost certainly, street heroin is
a much worse drug. The true answer undoubtedly is the
dehumanization one experiences in any drug &quot;program&quot;
or, for that matter, any government program of any type. That is
why this author will never submit to a decriminalization plan
with controls of any kind. This is why anti-prohibitionists who
advise against asking for complete legalization and decontrol
(and, perforce, rejecting any halfway measure) are part of the
problem not part of the solution. We have a moral imperative.
There shall be no compromise - even if it means all-out war.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Next, we are told that, while the clinical
heroin experiment in Great Britain was going on, the death rate
of heroin addicts was twenty-six times the average for the
population. Firstly, I don't believe them (the reference is a
letter that refers to an article in <i>The New Republic</i>,
which is <i>not</i> a refereed scientific journal); and,
secondly, why would they care, as they are obviously against drug
addicts. Undoubtedly, a considerable portion of whatever excess
death rate the addicts <i>do</i> enjoy is caused by the laws
against drugs, which is proved in Appendix C. This is typical of
the way in which this booklet switches objectives whenever the
authors find that a new objective is useful to make a point. If I
prove that result A will be achieved by legalization, they
suddenly abandon A as an objective and look for a new objective
that will be met less well by legalization than by a bad law. We
are told that when the British &quot;programs&quot; were in
operation Scotland Yard had to double its <i>narcotics</i> <i>division</i>
&quot;to cope with the increased crime rate&quot;. [emphasis
mine] It appears, then, that the crime they are concerned about
is taking drugs itself, which, of course, would not be a crime if
they had not made it a crime artificially.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The DEA equates success with less drugs
consumed and fewer users. But, clearly, they are not concerned at
all with the quality of life of users, which they do everything
they can do to diminish. In the Netherlands, they are concerned
about an increase in property crime, but one wonders what laws
were passed in the Netherlands, or anywhere, making it illegal to
refuse employment to a person merely because he or she uses
drugs, regardless of his effectiveness. I, for example, can do
nearly anything better stoned than anyone else can do it not
stoned - to put it modestly. I claim that nearly anyone can find
a drug or combination of drugs that will enhance his performance.
That's why so many athletes take drugs when they play, or,
rather, used to before the systematic persecution and invasion of
privacy of drug users (through testing) forced its nasty
tentacles deep into sports.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I shall not go into the experiences of other
countries or cities with partial decriminalization, mainly
because it is nearly impossible to find out what really happened
and, furthermore, it's irrelevant. Whatever the DEA says, we
shall have to check it carefully as they are so dishonest. After
all, they are fighting to protect lucrative jobs with virtually
unlimited opportunities for corrupt practices.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the summary of Chapter 3, we read, &quot;In
Iran and Thailand, countries where drugs are readily available,
the prevalence of addiction has been and continues to be
exceptionally high.&quot; Why don't they tell us how high? The
last two sentences are as follows:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1.) Both the Single Convention on Narcotic
Drugs of 1961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of
1971 (both signed by the U.S.) insist that drugs should not be
legalized. [&quot;Issues and Comments to respond to Legalization
of Illegal Drugs.&quot; Drug Enforcement Administration, May
1988].</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2.) The International Narcotics Control Board
of the United Nations concluded that &quot;legalization advocates
have not yet presented a sufficiently comprehensive, coherent or
viable alternative to the present system of international
drug-abuse control.&quot; [&quot;Report of the International
Control Board for 1992,&quot; United Nations Publication].</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Undoubtedly, these are true statements and I
think they deserve a comment. They are indicative of the great
control exercised by the United States in international politics,
including the United Nations, which has become little more than a
tool of U.S. aggression and imperialism. We have become the
all-time world's greatest bully - a nation of puritanical
hypocrites willing to impose intolerance and bigotry wherever it
suits our &quot;interests&quot;, namely, the continued predation
of the largely U.S.-based multi-national corporations. It isn't
just drugs of which we are intolerant; it's any form of
self-determination among the weaker nations and any form of
democracy, be it capitalist or communist. Of course, since the
only path to true democracy lies through some type of communism,
every democratic movement arising from the people will be
interpreted as communism, perhaps rightly. I don't have to say
much to support this picture of the world as it really is. This
has been done for me by Noam Chomsky with hundreds of details
painstakingly documented [11,12,13, ... ]. The War on Drugs is
only the tip of a gigantic iceberg.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Four: The Economics of Drug
Legalization </h3>

<p><font size="2">I do not use the argument that drug
legalization will provide tax revenue. Drugs should not be taxed
as they are a necessity of life. Food is taxed in Utah. Shame!
Normally, the necessities of life are not taxed. In civilized
jurisdictions, they are never taxed. But, I must comment on the
falsity employed by the DEA - even in this pointless argument.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Again, we see a reference to so-called crack
babies. When the Emory University studies [10] are finally
published, and the detractors have been silenced, this myth will
be put to rest for all time. I shall rewrite this section at that
time.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The DEA is again concerned about lost
productivity even though they have done nothing to ensure that
drug users have jobs if they want them. Again, they make the
unsupported claim that drug use is responsible for workplace
accidents. The fact that Conrail train operators had used
marijuana may have had nothing to do with the accident that they
constantly harp on. I pointed out that just because events
coincide does not prove that one is the cause of the other. This
is a logical fallacy. In the chemical industry, which I know best
and where the accidents are of apocalyptic proportions,
management pays lip service only to the prevention of accidents.
Certainly, measures are taken, but the main cause of accidents is
not addressed, namely, the hiring of contract workers to avoid
paying benefits. Many of these workers do not read the language
in which the safety and operating manuals are written. Until this
outrage is corrected, all bets are off concerning workplace
accidents.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I wish to express a sentiment peculiar to
myself to close my comments on economics. As far as I am
concerned drug users ought to be able to occupy themselves
exclusively with art if they so desire. Even fifty million drug
users supported by the rest of the work force does not seem
excessive to me. We have too many people working. The economy is
too large to be in harmony with nature. It is destroying the
environment. For those of you who feel you should not have to
support drug users, let me remind you that we haven't even
addressed the slight matter of reparations for the inconvenience
we have suffered due to unconstitutional and immoral laws against
drugs. I, personally, would be satisfied with $100,000 per year
for the life of myself and my wife, however many will want much
more - perhaps a one-time payment of fifty million 1996 U.S.
dollars?</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Five: The Lessons of Prohibition and
Drug Legalization </h3>

<p><font size="2">In a recent talk, Jerry Epstein of the Drug
Policy Forum of Texas pointed out that the difficulty we are
encountering in ending drug prohibition exceeds the difficulty
encountered in ending alcohol prohibition simply because the
people who remember what it was like before drug prohibition are
all dead, whereas the people who repealed alcohol prohibition
remembered the period before Prohibition vividly. If the vast
majority of the body politic remembered that drugs were not a
serious problem when they were legal, we would have an easy time
repealing the laws against drugs. By the way, they would remember
why the drug laws were enacted and they would realize, now that
racism has fallen into bad repute, that the drugs were enacted
for all the wrong reasons. Furthermore, it took a constitutional
amendment to prohibit alcohol. Why did it not require a
constitutional amendment to prohibit drugs? Clearly, a
constitutional amendment was required but conveniently by-passed,
as it would not have passed muster in any rational court.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Other than these observations, I have nothing
to say about the lessons of Prohibition. Thus, the DEA is
preparing to defend itself against an argument I will not make.
Apparently, the DEA has availed itself of &quot;recent historical
evidence&quot;. Why should <i>new</i> evidence about past events
be more reliable than whatever evidence has been available since
the time of Prohibition! I am skeptical of all such evidence
whether it furthers my case or not.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is more useful to me to hang the DEA with
its own arguments. They seem to think that the majority favors
drug prohibition, which somehow justifies prohibition. On the
contrary, the tyranny of the majority must be rejected along with
every other form of tyranny. What I think, though, is that, not
only do the majority favor drug legalization, the majority uses
illegal drugs. I think it is amusing to contemplate the
possibility that, if every user came out of the closet, the set
of users might turn out to be <i>everyone</i>! Ha!</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In Appendix B, I shall place Bob Ramsey's list
of great men and women (mostly men) who have used drugs
habitually. This may interest those who imagine that the
persecution of drug users will have no unintended social effects.
If all of our great men were put in jail, society would certainly
suffer - embarrassment at the very least.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Six: The Role of Alcohol and Tobacco
in the Drug Legalization Debate </h3>

<p><font size="2">I will add caffeine to that list. Can you
imagine how office workers would react to a ban on caffeine! I am
not suggesting that these other drugs should be made illegal or
demonized. I am sympathetic with smokers, particularly those who
began smoking before the general propaganda campaign to
discourage smoking began. However, one must really wonder about
smokers who are so stupid as to congregate near the doorways of
buildings to smoke, since that is an area through which <i>everyone</i>
who enters or leaves the building must pass. Why would they want
to lose the few sympathizers they have among nonsmokers when it
would cost them only a minimal additional effort to walk a few
paces away from the building entrances? I suppose it is unfair to
remark that quitting smoking cost me no effort worth mentioning,
I suppose I am immune to addiction. Actually, I can take any drug
or leave it. Arguments that hinge upon addiction, crime, health,
etc. don't apply to me; so, presumably, neither should the laws.
Actually, I am uncomfortable with the laws against drunk driving
because of the large number of drivers who drive well - even
better - while intoxicated. This must be a very large class of
drivers, extending perhaps, to everyone on the road after
midnight every Saturday night / Sunday morning, otherwise how
would they get home from the bars? It seems to me that the law
should not kick in until actual harm is done. I cite the Fletcher
Doctrine, stated above.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The DEA seems unprepared for my claim that the
legality of alcohol, the blood of Christ, and the illegality of
peyote, marijuana, etc. is a violation of the Establishment
Clause of the First Amendment. Other than that I remark only that
the DEA argument is typically silly, but I do not wish to go into
what is obvious. Let me list a few fallacious statements from
each of the remaining chapters even though I do not use the
argument with which the chapter deals. By now the reader can tell
the author what's wrong with these statements. Let's leave such
criticism as exercises for the reader.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>&quot;Cocaine debases the user's life.&quot;</b>
Is that what they think? If it does, it is only because they say
so. And, they are willing to say anything regardless of whether
it makes sense or not. I am not nor have I been guilty of the <i>ad
hominem</i> fallacy. The drug warriors <i>really are wicked</i>.
The general public ought to see them for what they are. They
discredit their own arguments by employing dishonest and immoral
methods to promote their own selfish interests. If their
arguments were valid, they would not have to resort to such
tactics.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>&quot;[T]obacco does not affect one's
intellectual processing or decision-making ability.&quot;</b> So
what! It is not clear that these other drugs affect them except
possibly to improve them. In most cases, the most popular illegal
drugs definitely enhance the IQs of most users. Users for whom
this is not true usually haven't much intellectual ability to
begin with. Personally, I don't think such people should be using
drugs, but I am not prepared to tell them they may not; and, from
time to time, they will surprise me with an outstanding
intellectual leap, which, probably, they could not have made
without drugs. Nobody has any evidence that is worth citing in a
scientific debate.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As Professor [James Q.] Wilson explains [Notice
that what follows is in no way an <i>explanation</i>, which by
itself makes the <i>entire</i> statement a <i>flat-out lie</i>.],
<b>&quot;Tobacco shortens one's life, cocaine debases it.
Nicotine alters one's habits, cocaine alters one's soul </b>[which
Prof. Wilson knows from measurements on his soul-o-meter].<b> The
heavy use of crack, unlike the heavy use of tobacco, corrodes
those natural sentiments of sympathy and duty that constitute our
human nature and make possible our social life.&quot;</b> [When a
man uses the word &quot;duty&quot; in this manner &quot;stand not
on the order of your leaving but leave immediately&quot;. Please,
Prof. Wilson, spare me your society.] Professor Wilson's opinion
is worthless. Quoting &quot;authority&quot; is the weakest type
of argument and may safely be dismissed. One can always find
someone as stupid as oneself.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">See my article on academia [14], to understand
why I don't think college professors deserve the respect of
ordinary people. During the last few decades, they seem to have
become incorrigibly stupid. I have deliberately dissociated
myself from all but a few with whom I remain on civil terms.
These few are cynical enough concerning the intellectual
abilities of the rest. I have been attending seminars at Rice
University, lately, to correct all the stupid things that are
said - except in mathematics, where profound stupidity has not
yet carried the day. But, more and more, I despair of being
understood. Occasionally, one or two receptive minds can be
found, but only on rare occasions. The drivel one hears is beyond
what anyone could imagine only a few short years ago, but
academia has succumbed to the cesspool mentality almost
completely. The college students, even in the prestige academies,
are pathetic, especially those who come from homes that allow
television viewing. (PBS, even, is an unmitigated intellectual
disaster.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I honestly see no point in being diplomatic in
this effort to change people's minds. No good will come from
adopting partial truths or downright falsehood as Madison Avenue
and the mainstream culture have done. I should expound at greater
length on this attitude of uncompromising truth regardless of
consequences, that is, truth as we perceive it - recognizing that
we are fallible.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>&quot;And although cholesterol may kill you,
it does not lead to the types of bizarre, destructive behavior
that is associated with most illegal drugs.&quot;</b> Refute this
as an exercise. (Why should not the reader get a chance to
participate in the slaying of monsters of falsehood?)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;[W]e should compare the risks of alcohol
and tobacco [don't forget caffeine] with those of legalized
cocaine and marijuana.&quot; [Fair enough] <b>&quot;Likely, we
would find that the latter are much more dangerous than the
former.&quot;</b> False; say why as an exercise.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>&quot;[A]lcohol, while admittedly,
dangerous, is much less addictive than presently illegal drugs
and also is easier to quit once addicted.&quot;</b> Criticize as
an exercise. Hint: Add what we said about the definition(s) of
addiction to the other falsehoods in this sentence.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Seven: Medical Uses of Presently
Illegal Drugs </h3>

<p><font size="2">Criticize this chapter as an exercise unless
you find its illogical point of view and other faults too
obvious. Hints: (1) They call what <i>we</i> say
&quot;propaganda&quot;. We admit to that, but wonder if they
think that what they say is &quot;education&quot;. (2) One can <i>drink</i>
marijuana. (3) Appeal to authority is the fallacy known as <i>ad
verecundiam</i>, i.e., toward modesty - your modesty.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Eight: Individual Rights and the
Legalization of Drugs </h3>

<p><font size="2">I do not refer to John Stuart Mill, so it's no
good pawning his remarks off on me. I have made an irrefutable
constitutional argument. It remains only to examine the majority
and minority opinions in the case law that reached the Supreme
Court of which, I would venture to say, very little exists;
however, I may be in for a surprise, a surprise I can handle. The
majority opinions that ruled against my positions must involve
unconscionable assaults on logic. These can easily be refuted
with whatever slight aid I expect from the minority opinions. No,
Your Honors, &quot;I'm not trying to show contempt for this
court, I'm doing my best to hide it.&quot; My contempt knows no
bounds, thus it's impossible to hide it. What will they arrest me
for, contempt of word processor - to take a page from Tom Wolfe.
I have no fear that the Supreme Court will defeat my argument in
the higher court of unfettered reason.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">They will try to establish compelling reasons
why these violations of the Constitution are essential to the
commonwealth of the United States. We shall not allow that the
government has a right to regulate the health and personal safety
of its citizens against their will. We can raise an army in no
time that will put down that heresy. (Obviously, such armies are
already out there in force - although they are rarely informed by
the highest principles.) Other sections of this paper will
disqualify nearly every compelling reason they are likely to come
up with. If they pull something new, it will be just as specious
as the rest and I can refute it on my feet under as much pressure
as they wish to put to bear. One must realize that, although they
wield immense raw force, they are basically little people -
barely more than children and they have not had a valid thought
in years. They are almost nobody - in the existential sense. We
should not fear them, rather, we should get busy and get them out
of there. We can certainly contrive to arrange <i>that</i> if we
apply our minds and exercise a little moral resolution.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">They have repeated my argument in their
&quot;little book&quot;. They claim our freedom <i>does</i>
interfere with the freedom and well-being of others. (They use
the weak phrase &quot;affect other people&quot; to which we might
respond: So what! But, for the sake of argument, we shall grant
that they mean that the effect is to interfere with the freedom
of other people, and we shall use this concept in the widest
possible sense giving them every opportunity to make a valid
case, which they cannot do.) In my philosophical papers, I have
shown how to disqualify imaginary offenses, i.e., offenses that
would not occur if the mental outlook of the victim were
different. For example, a mother is distraught because she has
learned that her son is homosexual. Her pain is caused by her
intolerance and misunderstanding of the situation. It cannot be
said that he is interfering with her freedom or &quot;hurting
her&quot; in a way from which she can be protected by the State.
I will take their arguments one at a time and finish with the
most common situation of all, namely, the case of the wife who
claims to be suffering because her husband gets high.</font> </p>

<h2>CRIME </h2>

<p><font size="2">Earlier, I have shown that the argument that
drug use increases crime is invalid. Even if drug use <i>did</i>
lead to crime on occasion, the Wayburn Doctrine invalidates
punishing every drug user for the behavior of a few.</font> </p>

<h2>DAMAGE TO THE UNBORN </h2>

<p><font size="2">The epidemiological data suffers from the
well-known fallacy <i>post hoc ergo propter hoc</i>. But, most
compelling, the study by Schama et al. [10], which is mechanistic
(rather than epidemiological), has good controls, employs more
than adequate variation in conditions, subjects the young monkeys
to a wide range of accepted psychological tests, and is being
performed using the strictest scientific procedures to avoid an
embarrassment when it is subjected to (expected) harsh scrutiny
by drug warriors subsequent to publication, this study, I say,
pretty much shows that <b>there is no such thing as crack babies</b>.
I have known this for years from vast personal, albeit anecdotal,
experience, namely, nearly daily observation of the pregnant
mothers throughout their pregnancies - observations that the drug
warriors never have at their disposal. The plain truth about much
science funded by the public is that it can be replaced without
loss by introspection and casual observation. This is especially
true of the so-called social sciences and a large part of medical
research even. I do not intend to tar everyone with the same
brush. Notable and laudable exceptions exist. However, research
that is sponsored by government agencies or other parties with
vested interest in the outcome, e.g., a study of the carcinogenic
effects of chemicals sponsored by Dow and DuPont, <b>is not
science!</b></font> </p>

<h2>CHILD ABUSE </h2>

<p><font size="2">This, again, is the fallacy of <i>post hoc ergo
propter hoc</i>. Drug users almost never abuse children. Poverty
abuses children. Capitalism abuses children. Instances of child
abuse by drug users must be so rare that to punish every drug
user for their crimes is an outrageous abuse of law. Punish child
abusers when they abuse children - if the government has the
remotest idea what constitutes child abuse, which I doubt. This,
by the way, is an equivocal way of using the term abuse in a
booklet that employs the term drug abuse. What do they mean, then
by drug abuse? Striking a pill with a blunt instrument or merely
yelling at a bag of cocaine? These people are such terrible liars
and morons. They deserve our utmost contempt. (This paper is not
calculated to make friends among them. To the drug warriors, as
W.C. Fields would say, &quot;<i>I hate you!</i>&quot;)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The horror stories can be attributed one-by-one
to the War on Drugs and, of course, Capitalism, itself, which is
behind the War. I suppose the rich old men are afraid that young
hip drug users might refuse once more to dress up in soldier
suits and go out and be killed (and kill those with whom they
share the same old men as enemies) to make the old men and their
families richer still at the expense of themselves and their own
families. I find it ironic that, in the case of our armed
aggression against the people of Viet Nam, our boys went out as
squares and came back hip junkies, knowing the score even if it
cost them a limb or two, unless, of course, they were killed -
or, rather, murdered by the same company that brings you, now,
The Drug War, in living color.</font> </p>

<h2>AUTO ACCIDENTS </h2>

<p><font size="2">The DEA paragraph on this topic begins by
asserting that a large percentage (how large?) of automobile
accidents in the U.S. is caused by marijuana. They think they
know this - or, perhaps, they think they can convince us of this
- by doing drug testing <i>after</i> the accident. This is <i>post
hoc ergo propter hoc</i>, which proves nothing; it doesn't even
give us a clue. What percentage of drivers who didn't get in
accidents were high on grass? I'll tell you what: I'll put my
bunch of vipers, higher than kites, in a driving contest against
a random bunch of squares. I'm not going to let you employ the
Penske team, naturally, that's why I say random. It is easy to
design a fair experiment to determine if drug use causes
impairment of driving skills, for example; however, no such
experiment will be conducted. The authorities will not provide
immunity, remove the stigma, the social expectations, and past
demonization and scapegoating of drugs and drug users.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Contrary to the DEA claim, the Conrail accident
probably had nothing to do with pot. I say this with confidence.
No one has even remotely proved that it did. Would you like to
discuss the evidence? No unbiased scientific experiment has ever
been carried out to study the effects of drugs! Nor is it likely
that such an experiment can or will be carried out until drugs
are legalized and drug use is normalized.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The last statement in the (DEA) paragraph under
consideration is just plain ludicrous on the face of it. That's
why we know these drug warriors are plain old-fashioned liars -
desperately trying to hold on to their lucrative (very lucrative,
I opine) jobs that are not and never were needed. Can you say
parasite? Here's the statement: &quot;Furthermore, a study
conducted by Stanford University found that twenty-four hours
after smoking one joint, pilots could not safely land a
plane.&quot; The reference is the <i>Drug Awareness Information
Newsletter</i>, undoubtedly another bunch of liars, but certainly
not a reviewed scientific journal. Now, after making a
sensational claim like this, why wouldn't they give us a
reference to the actual study? Twenty-four hours after smoking a
joint, hardly anyone can distinguish a difference from the way he
felt before he smoked the joint. Given this indisputable everyday
fact, why should we ever get in a plane knowing that the pilot is
unable to discern by feelings alone whether he is capable of
landing it? How did they get permission to carry out this test
legally? Who would carry it out <i>illegally</i>? I know the
president of Stanford might divert research funds to luxuries for
his personal use, but illegally fly planes ... ? This is the
dumbest thing in the book! (The only reason I am bothering with
people whose only logic is bullets is that I promised someone I
would do it.) The people who wrote this book are dishonest. Go
ahead sue me for libel. It ain't libel if it's true. (Any
suggested advocacy anywhere in this paper - or in any other paper
by this author - of illegal acts by the author or others is to be
construed as humor, naturally.)</font> </p>

<h2>MONEY </h2>

<h3 align="center">Lost Productivity </h3>

<p><font size="2">The DEA claims that drugs cost the nation money
due to lost productivity. This reveals, already, an unclear
concept of economics, but the reader must read my other papers to
learn economics. (If you learned economics from Samuelson, you
don't know economics.) But, I'll leave economics out of it.
Proponents of the American economic system (quasi-Capitalism)
don't seem to understand that the lives of working people have no
extrinsic purpose. People are not here to be exploited by
entrepreneurs, to designate employers as charitably as I can.
People belong to themselves. We better ask ourselves why people
who take drugs often lose all interest in their employers'
agendas. Isn't it clear that the fault lies with the work, the
workplaces, and the bosses, not with drugs! Further, the remarks
above concerning the lack of any scientific evidence continue to
apply to performance in the workplace.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Higher Taxes </h3>

<p><font size="2">The DEA is not clear how these higher taxes
come about. I shall argue in a moment that it is unlikely that
the higher taxes are needed to benefit drug users. I hope I have
made it abundantly clear that the purpose of a human life is not
to be of the greatest possible service to the State, which might
include paying taxes. I shall have to await a cogent argument
from the DEA (or one of its pawns) before I can say what I think
of it.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Increased Health Costs Including Increased
Insurance Premiums </h3>

<p><font size="2">Since we have no decent scientific evidence
that links workplace accidents to drug use, we shall rule out
that factor. (Certainly, the most dangerous corporate policy in
the chemical industry, with which I am familiar, is hiring
contract workers who cannot read the language in which the safety
and operating manuals are written. This has resulted in many
horrible catastrophes. Probably, chemical plants need to be much
smaller to lessen the scope of the harm done by mishaps.
Currently, plants are large enough to wipe out entire cities,
cf., Bhopal.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If we are to believe the DEA, many drug users
will not be receiving health insurance benefits due to their own
choice, but we Americans have not enacted equal opportunity
legislation to prevent unfair and unconstitutional employment
discrimination against drug users who are as competent as anyone
whether they are stoned at work or not. Drugs enhance
performance. That's why most major-league baseball players used
drugs before the country returned to the Dark Ages, cf., Jim
Bouton [15]. Also, if the DEA wants to claim that drug users have
shorter life spans, they must admit as well that they will
require health care for a shorter period. Also, many drug users
don't avail themselves of the medical establishment at all. After
all, they are into self-medication, are they not? To carry that
point further still, if people could write their own
prescriptions, medical costs and, concomitantly, the incomes of
physicians would be reduced. For my first paper on drugs [2], I
interviewed a drug user who wishes to boycott doctors. In that
paper, I make practically the complete case for complete
legalization and decontrol of all drugs. If you had read it, as
you should have, we might not need to have this discussion so
many years later as there would be nothing to discuss.
Nevertheless, I am pleased to record my latest thinking on the
subject for my own personal records. Suppose, for example, that a
person is willing to sign an affidavit that he will never avail
himself of the health-care system, except for the pharmaceutical
sector (and of course the textbook publishing and sales
business). In that case, would the DEA (or Congress) be willing
to permit him to prescribe for himself? Finally, in the unlikely
event that drugs kill a user, the death is swift, normally, and,
therefore, inexpensive!</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">The DEA's Last Word on Personal Freedom </h3>

<p><font size="2">&quot;In short, few people use the Individual
Autonomy argument any more because it is painfully obvious that
drug use affects not only the individual user, but also the
user's family, innocent third parties, and society as a
whole.&quot; We shall need many more words than this to establish
our rebuttal, but not only because the DEA expects the American
people to be incredibly stupid and, of course, they will not be
disappointed. In America, independent thought has been wiped out
by insidious propaganda techniques learned from Madison Avenue
with the full force of the academic social science establishment
in the vanguard. (How do professors shave themselves in the
morning? After only a few years, I became so ashamed of my
(academic) calling that I could not go on, even though I thought
that I needed the money.) The Sufis, an amusing little
free-thinking off-shoot of Islam, ask, &quot;Are people really as
stupid as we say they are?&quot; Absolutely, as they demonstrate
persuasively.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I first wish to comment on the gratuitous use
of the expression &quot;painfully obvious&quot;. This is simply
infuriating, as no valid evidence has been given. Not only is it
not obvious, it is not even true. In mathematics, we would call
this handwaving. It's what you do when you have forgotten the
proof or no proof exists. To use this argument to suspend
constitutional guarantees, one would have to show that this
&quot;effect&quot; occurs in every case, and that the effect is
bad, and that the drug user is somehow in the wrong to create
this effect. I wish to discuss the effect on the family first.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">We may safely disregard the possibility that
the effect involves violence as we have no evidence that drug use
is responsible for violence with a non-negligible frequency of
occurrence. On the contrary, drug users are more gentle,
sensitive, and caring than the public at large. I have drawn up a
list of complaints made by the wife of a friend of mine. <i>I
shall pretend that I am he.</i> When I say &quot;my wife&quot;, I
mean &quot;his wife&quot;. I shall suppose that my children would
not come up with complaints substantially different from these. I
distinguish between imaginary offenses, such that the
&quot;victim&quot; would not be inconvenienced if her attitude
were at least different if not more correct, and actual offenses,
such that the state of mind of the victim has no bearing on the
&quot;abuse&quot; she must suffer. I have used the analogy of the
mother whose son is homosexual, in which her suffering depends
entirely on <i>her</i> state of mind and has nothing to do with
his behavior.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">My Wife's Concerns </h3>

<p><font size="2"><b>1. Fear for my health.</b> Not really valid
as she refuses to respect my dietary needs, which have an
immediate and permanent effect on my health.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>2. She objects to what she perceives as
unattractive and bizarre behavior manifested when I'm stoned and
which she finds embarrassing.</b> Sounds pretty subjective to me.
When I get stoned, I become preoccupied with art, literature,
mathematics, and, music. I look distracted, particularly when I
am interrupted. I am at work and, therefore, my long and enduring
faithful devotion to my wife, although always strong and
sustaining, is, perforce, in the background. Interruptions,
therefore, cause me confusion, which might be mistaken for idiocy
by a person who has never experienced an obsession. I have no
idea what I look like, but it probably bears comparison to the
crazy artist or mad scientist stereotyped unfavorably in our
commercial movies. Of course, even geniuses don't get the respect
due them from their wives - or their valets. How can that fat
slob who belches at the dinner table be in a class with Einstein
or Beethoven? I wonder what Bach's wife called him when the
children weren't around, which, come to think of it, must have
been infrequently in his case.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Mrs. Bach - &quot;Hey, [ironically] maestro,
you left the lid up on the toilet seat again. Honestly, I don't
know why I married you; you can't do one single thing right. Mrs.
Handel's husband just bought her a new dish washer, but what do I
get from you - another grosse fugue, you bum.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Bach - &quot;Yes, dear, you're perfectly right,
dear, I'm listening to every word you say, dear; I'll get to it
the first thing in the morning; but, if you'll give me half a
sec, I'll put the finishing touches on this cantata and <i>then</i>
take out the garbage. [sotto voce] What the hell is she talking
about now? Goddam alto clef, let's see - F-A-C-E-G. [loudly] Yes,
dear, right away, dear. [sotto voce] No respect! And I think
she's pregnant again. That little bastard Carl [his son, Carl
Philipp Emanuel Bach] ate all my morphine suppositories, again.
Why me! [loudly] No, dear, you do <i>not</i> smell pot.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>3. Maybe taking drugs is immoral.</b> Well,
that's what the DEA, other authoritarians, and the liquor and
cigarette lobby are spending a fortune to induce her to think,
but I don't think she's that stupid. No, that's not a problem for
us. In any case, I've gone to a lot of trouble to show that
taking drugs is not immoral [5]. What is immoral is trying to
stop someone from taking drugs! My wife would not be in a
position to criticize my morals as she puts meat products on my
plate, rarely but sometimes, even though I have expressed my
moral outrage at the killing of animals for food, not to mention
the horrible treatment of many animals prior to slaughter, cf.,
large chicken &quot;plants&quot;. Eating meat really is immoral,
however I have not forcibly prevented anyone from doing it nor
have I exacted punishment from those who do. If this drug war
continues, that will undoubtedly change, although not because of
any direct action on my part.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>4. What will the neighbors, her parents, her
employers, and co-workers think?</b> Well, that's the same
problem as above, <i>but why should she care what people think!</i></font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>5. Danger from the police.</b> Well, yes,
that's what we're trying to fix.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>6. Danger in the Third Ward, a Black ghetto.</b>
Ditto.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>7. I earn less money when I take drugs.</b>
I don't earn any money in any case. But, to tell the truth, I
usually don't take drugs when I am employed. It's really too
complicated and, since I can take them or leave them according to
my inclinations and the circumstances, I choose not to take them
when engaged in certain activities, but I have never said I would
not ever take them again. I have never repudiated drugs. That
would be dreadful.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>8. I am less productive on drugs.</b>
Absolutely and categorically false. While, it is true that I
don't design chemical plants on drugs, I could if I wanted to,
provided I worked at home, the way things are nowadays, which we
are trying to fix. I don't watch professional football or junk
movies when I'm using drugs, but I get more done by orders of
magnitude and my work is far superior to anything I can do
without drugs. That includes mathematics, any type of problem
solving, philosophy (old-fashioned &quot;big philosophy&quot; -
original philosophy, music theory and practice, craftsmanship,
housework and home repairs, writing, study, financial
transactions (yes, I do financial transactions, just like
ordinary folks and I <i>do</i> live in the world), driving a car
(long-distance travel), photography, graphic arts (modeling), and
sex (if sex may be called work). I'm sure I've forgotten a few
things. But, basically, I can do anything on drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>9. I don't eat well when I'm stoned.</b> Oh,
that it were true! I gained four pounds over a two-day period the
last time I got high. Heroin improves my appetite tremendously
and cocaine does not attenuate it. Sometimes I may get absorbed
in my work and skip lunch, but I always sit down with my wife for
the (obligatory) family evening meal. I may eat differently as I
am trying very hard to avoid meat. My wife cannot seem to
understand that I object to killing animals for food on moral
grounds.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>10. She likes to have things her way, which
includes me.</b> I have been subjected to a remodeling agenda
from the beginning; and, believe it or not, I <i>have</i> changed
considerably to accommodate my wife's design. I think many women
commit to men under the assumption that, although men are not
satisfactory as they are found in nature, it won't take long to
change them into whatever the women want! I believe this is a
proverb.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>11. She likes me better when I'm not high.</b>
This is a matter of taste and tolerance for what does not
correspond to what we would wish for. I was high when she met me
and it was some time before she saw me when I was not high. If I
didn't suit her tastes, that was the time to do something about
it, However, in those days I did not object to sacred pledges and
we pledged ourselves to each other without any conditions.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>12. Drugs are too expensive.</b> Amen. I
could synthesize or grow any drug I need to take. I do not
believe taking legalized drugs would be a financial burden,
especially if I could make some for my friends.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>13. I could lose the car if I am arrested
for drugs while I'm using it.</b> This is unfair,
unconstitutional (due process violation), and must be changed.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>14. When I take drugs, our family is not
like the TV family we are indoctrinated to want to emulate,
presumably, to support the environmentally catastrophic consumer
culture. </b>Thank God for drugs, because, if I did not take
drugs, there, but for the grace of God, go we.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>15. When I am high on drugs, I frequently
get wrapped up in my arts, viz., music and literature.</b> At
last, we come to what I believe is the real reason my wife
doesn't want me to take drugs. Music and literature take me away
from her, at least temporarily. Women fear these rivals more than
they fear other women. As Duke Ellington put it musically,
&quot;A drum is a woman.&quot; W. Somerset Maugham claims that
women hate art [16]. Mark Hecker, the guitarist and graphic
artist, once quipped, &quot;I have never been in a situation
where music was being played, women were present, and they did
not do everything in their power to destroy (stop) the
music.&quot; I think we have arrived at the sad and unfortunate
truth. Thus, it is the drug taker whose freedom is being
abrogated by his wife. This is classic. And, as usual, the
authoritarians (read Conservatives if you wish) turn the truth
into its opposite. This book by the DEA is a handbook of lies.
[It's worse than the Bible, which I always thought was the
epitome of falsehood. Moses spoke to God. Oh, sure.]</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Nine: Legal Issues Surrounding the
Legalization of Drugs </h3>

<p><font size="2">The DEA points are easy to answer. Use the
Fletcher Doctrine described earlier. Remember that we insist that
people may not be punished for doing harm until they actually do
harm. This does not remove the element of prevention, which
remains education - not propaganda but education. Read the
definition of &quot;education&quot; in a good dictionary such as
the Random House [6]. Condemn Dram Shop Laws. The function of the
FDA (Food and Drug Administration) is to advise not control.
Thus, hopelessly ill people could try anything with a full
knowledge of the risks. The DEA does not present difficult
problems in this chapter.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Ten: Environmental Issues and the
Legalization of Drugs </h3>

<p><font size="2">I do not use this argument. Nevertheless, as an
exercise, the reader may look for errors in the DEA logic.</font>
</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Eleven: &quot;Anything Is Better Than
What We Are Doing Now&quot; Hopelessness, Drug Control, and
Potential Solution </h3>

<p><font size="2">Again, I do not use this argument. Be careful
here, though, because, if the purpose of the DEA is to demonize
drugs, drug users, and drug dealers, they are very successful. Of
course, they can never stop the flow of drugs, but they may not
claim that that is their objective. They are making it plenty
tough for many users, which, of course, we view as immoral,
wicked, and, indeed, illegal. Threaten them with class-action
libel if you wish. If they think about it, they may be worried.
David Robinson in his sneaker ad was definitely guilty of libel
and would have lost in a fair trial. Nowadays, one never knows
who the jury may be and any verdict is possible! This is an
important point and the tyranny better start worrying about it. I
conclude with my seven-point post-prohibition plan. Obviously, my
major thrust was the constitutional and moral issue, which they
have said nobody uses anymore! That's only the <i>main</i> issue.
Next comes terrorism and selective assassinations if the tyranny
persists. That Pablo Escabar sure knew how to treat authoritarian
public officials. Well, we have to get their attention. Of
course, we do not condone violence and we will repeat that as
often as necessary. Any allusions to violence are in the nature
of humor or, at their most drastic, represent dire predictions of
events we would do anything to prevent. Insist on this. We never
discuss anything more drastic than an occasional dirty trick that
we would never play on anyone. We only mention these tactics to
express our good-natured joviality, as we are the last people on
earth who will lose their sense of humor.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">My Seven-Point Plan for Post Prohibition </h1>

<p><font size="2">My new plan for post-prohibition society
consists of the following: (1) an equal-rights amendment for drug
users, (2) teaching people how to live with drugs, to choose them
wisely, and to use them properly (to get the most out of them and
to prevent accidents, disease, and unpleasant side-effects), (3)
new opportunities for drug users, heteroclites, and other people
who are &quot;different&quot; to make contributions to society in
appropriate nonstandard settings including settings where one can
work while using drugs, (4) during the transition, reparations
for victims of the laws against drugs amounting to whatever they
need to live abundantly, and (5) free informal counseling for
troubled or troublesome drug users <i>by</i> drug users.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Since, it must be admitted, some people who are
taking drugs might like to stop - even in a normalized society, I
propose two additional &quot;points&quot;: (6) institutions like
commercial hotels that cost no more than hotels and that have all
the amenities of hotels and more, e.g., VCRs and videotape
libraries and books, except that the (voluntary) guest may not
leave for a fixed period of time agreed upon in advance (by the
guest) nor indulge in certain drugs beyond agreed upon limits,
which might be monotonically decreasing. Rural locations might
provide better settings with lower real estate costs offset by
higher transportation costs. Only one &quot;medical&quot;
&quot;professional&quot; per shift would be needed, namely, to
dispense medicine. I can say truthfully that I would trust any
drug dealer I have known to perform that job - except for one,
who was generous to a fault. Vouchers could be provided for those
who can't pay. And, finally, (7) new drugs that prevent
withdrawal symptoms and cravings may be used (voluntarily), if
they exist. Such claims have been made lately for the drug
ibogaine (17), but, unless the costs are reduced or borne by the
state, it will not be widely used. Also, the claims may not be
true - or not true in an acceptable mode; i.e., the effectiveness
of ibogaine may depend on &quot;religious&quot; faith, which
might diminish the humanity of the patient. Moreover, those who
have been &quot;cured&quot; by ibogaine may have merely
transferred their allegiance to a new drug, which, in the case of
ibogaine, is long lasting (six months or longer) - at first, but
which, after repeated doses, might &quot;need&quot; to be used
more frequently. Lately, similar effects have been ascribed to
the South American drug yage or one of its derivatives. Actually,
the possibility of switching to a new drug is included under
points (2) and (5) above.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Appendix A. Letter to William Buckley After He
Lost Debate to Charles Rangel </h1>

<p><font size="2">March 28, 1990</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">William Buckley</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Firing Line&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">P. O. Box 5966</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Columbia, SC 29250</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Dear Mr. Buckley,</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I suspect that many great and famous men do not
get to see the mail addressed to them. In case this is being read
by someone who is considering not letting Mr. Buckley see it, let
me caution against that idea. Whether I receive a reply or not, I
will assume that Mr. Buckley is aware of the arguments expressed
in this letter and in the enclosed paper, &quot;The Case for Drug
Legalization and Decontrol in the United States.&quot; Any future
deeds or words by Mr. Buckley in connection with this debate will
be construed in the light of this. Whereas it would be an
injustice to Mr. Buckley to assume that he had ignored convincing
arguments if his staff had not permitted him to see them, the
blame would reside with his staff. I wish I knew how to say that
better in fewer words, then I could begin all letters to the high
and mighty with a stock paragraph - like the warning on a package
of cigarettes.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">That said, I would like to comment on the
special edition of &quot;Firing Line&quot; with the debate on
drug legalization, although I tuned in a little late and had to
turn it off 15 minutes early to go to bed. It seems that none of
the pro-legal team could answer Rangel's point that we should try
prevention and treatment before legalization. Also, his
observation that we have not addressed the social causes of
improper drug use, e.g., poverty, was detrimental to the
pro-legal side. So, when I tuned out, the prohibitionists had won
the debate.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The pro-legal side deserved to lose because
they did not produce the most important arguments for
legalization, the points covered in my paper, the addendum, and
my letters to the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), which might make
sense to someone who had read the DPF Newsletter (in particular,
one of them destroys Judge Sweet's position). Since I covered
basically everything, let me single out the crucial points,
namely, those that destroy Rangel's position. Also, before I
forget, why in the world wasn't the anti-prohibition side
adequately represented? Didn't you consult Arnold Trebach? If you
did, why didn't Arnold get someone who supports the following
points (not me, I can't appear on television; however, I am
willing to debate anyone, anytime, anywhere in the print media,
including you):</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1. The laws against drugs are unconstitutional
on the basis of (i) the First Amendment (the laws are essentially
of a religious nature), (ii) the Ninth Amendment (proceeding from
rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness), and (iii)
violation of due process (&quot;abuse&quot; is undefined, as
pointed out by Dr. Robert Goodman).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2. Prevention and treatment are based on
fallacies and unstated assumptions, namely, (i) drugs are bad for
everyone, (ii) drug abuse is a disease, not is <i>like</i> a
disease but <i>is</i> a disease, to name only two.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3. Prevention and treatment won't work, mainly
for the reasons stated in (2). You continued to emphasize that
prevention and treatment won't get the criminals out of the drug
trade, which is one of your main concerns, and certainly a valid
concern, but the thrust of the argument fails because no one
could prove that Rangel's plan wouldn't dry up the demand.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">I am interested in obtaining a transcript of
the debate; but, by the time you have read this, I will have
spoken to &quot;Firing Line&quot; and obtained my copy if it is
at all possible. I am preparing another paper for the DPF. (Part
of the enclosed paper is in <i>Drug Policy 1989-1990, A
Reformer's Catalogue</i>, Chapter 6 [1].) The new paper is to be
entitled &quot;Unstated Assumptions and Fallacies in Prevention
and Treatment.&quot; [2] Perhaps you would like a copy?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Sincerely,</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Thomas L. Wayburn</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Note to the reader (4-30-96): Buckley did not
request a copy of Reference 2; however, he did read Reference 1,
at least as much of it &quot;as he had time for&quot;. He
accepted my position in that paper but without excessive
enthusiasm. Nowadays, one no longer expects famous men and women
who dabble in essay writing to exclaim, &quot;My Heavens, this is
the greatest essay I have ever read, at least the best I have
read lately. Why is this writer not recognized? I shall do
whatever I can to bring this great talent to the attention of the
reading public.&quot; I don't believe anyone (save myself alone)
would do that even for his own son. Hey, it's a jungle out there.</font>

<p>APPENDIX C. THE LAWS AGAINST DRUGS AND THE WAR ON DRUGS RATHER
THAN THE USE OF DRUGS PER SE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST (ALMOST
ALL) DEATHS ASSOCIATED WITH DRUGS. Classification of Deaths
Involving Drugs We may place deaths associated with drugs in
categories, which should be nearly exhaustive. If someone takes
exception to the proposition that forms the title of this section
and names a category not on my list, I am prepared to deal with
that category at any time the detractor wishes. (I am prepared to
defend my viewpoint against all comers at any time and any place
provided the debate be fair; e.g., I must be allowed as much time
as I need to make my points or my rebuttals to my opponents
points regardless of the exigencies of television or other
broadcast medium. Nothing could be more outrageous than placing
time limits on a debate of this importance. I don't care if
regular programming has to be suspended for a year. The airwaves
are a public trust and must serve the needs of the people and the
people desperately need rational debate on public issues.] The
categories are as follows: Accidental deaths Murders perpetrated
by debtors and creditors in the drug trade Murders associated
with the battle for market share Deaths due to marketing in
general and advertising in particular Deaths due to conspiracies
or the ultimate conspiracy, a monopoly on the sale of a specific
drug Deaths due to overdoses, substituted chemicals, impurities,
and unexpected effects Crimes of passion of which people who
don't take drugs are incapable Deaths due to physical impairment </p>

<p>Analysis of Each Category </p>

<p>ACCIDENTS OCCURRING DURING THE MANUFACTURE OF DRUGS These are
rare and, in any case, are of much smaller scope, than accidents
occurring in the commercial pharmaceutical business. Thus,
legality might increase the number of such deaths, but in the
same way that the manufacture of a cure for cancer would. We
would not be against a cure for cancer just because, in the
normal course of operations, accidents do occur wherever
chemicals are present. MURDERS PERPETRATED BY DEBTORS AND
CREDITORS IN THE DRUG TRADE The murder of a creditor to avoid
payment with a child caught in the crossfire On December 12,
1995, an article about a three-year old child who was killed in
the crossfire associated with the an unpayable drug debt appeared
in The Houston Chronicle. Undoubtedly, the intention of the
article was to demonize drug users and sellers further; but the
fact is that, due to the illegality of drugs, creditors and
debtors do not have access to the normal legal procedures
associated with debt. Thus, the laws against drugs are the
culprit. Sellers of legal drugs do not in general extend credit.
When drugs are legal no premium is added to compensate the dealer
for additional risk. Further, in the case of the most popular
illegal drugs research costs are virtually nonexistence because
of thousands of years of experience available at no cost to
anyone. Thus, manufacturers do not have to add a premium to
recoup the cost of research as must be done in the case of
Zantac, for example. The low price justifies drug stores in
refusing to extend credit for a bottle of aspirins, say.
Therefore, it is the laws against drugs that allow debt and
credit with its concomitant disputation into the picture.
Creditors in legal trades have recourse to the courts - whatever
that's worth. Whereas, it must be admitted that the civil courts
are not a realistic remedy for most people who are involved in
business disputes, including the great number that arise due to
debt, such recourse as they do afford is a slight deterrent to
violence. We all know that a broken knee cap is a much more
effective expedient in the case where one feels he has been
unjustly treated or, if one retains bourgeois values, a punch in
the nose. Debtors in legal trade have recourse to bankruptcy and,
in any case Deaths due to marketing in general and advertising in

<p>, are rarely murdered by their creditors who have much too
much at stake to risk everything to recover a single debt. It is
but a poor business indeed, whose solvency depends on the
performance of a single account, although, to be sure, such
single-client businesses do exist and, undoubtedly a ruined
tradesman has from time to time dispatched the perceived cause of
his ruin in a fit of pique - if that is not too mild a word. In
the normal case &quot;legitimate&quot; businessmen do not conduct
their affairs in the presence of children, upon whom they wish to
impose the delusion that not all decency in the world has been
dispensed with in the life-and-death struggle for wealth and
power exemplified by our ever and abiding mercantile economy.
'Nuff said. MURDERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BATTLE FOR MARKET SHARE
As a Common Feature in the Conduct of All Business I believe the
battles for market share among the robber barons are sufficiently
well documented that no one need doubt that, if you did not sell
your upstart gas station to Standard Oil at the price they
suggested, it would be blown sky high regardless of who got hurt.
In the &quot;old&quot; days, i.e., the days of John D.
Rockefeller, who has living great-grandchildren if not living
grandchildren, the establishment got established by playing
hardball - no less hard than the drive-by shootings in the
'hood'. If these were the old days, we might not expect to see
the violence surrounding the drug trade go down just because drug
traffickers were made &quot;legit&quot; by virtue of legislative
fiat. But, these are not the &quot;old days&quot;. As a Vanishing
Tradition Displaced by Still More Insidious Methods That Happily
Visit Most of the Concomitant Misery Upon People Who Are of No
Account, i.e., Not &quot;Our&quot; Type of People The above title
is an example of irony in its most bitter form. The very
&quot;highest&quot; class of people in our country, the real
plutocracy, do not in general tolerate competition from
&quot;upstarts&quot;. If a large drug company were manufacturing
cocaine for the mass market and I should attempt to enter the
market by selling a purer, cleaner product by mail-order through
my web site on the internet at no profit but at a lower cost than
the big company, the big company would turn its lawyers on me
like a pack of killer dogs. They might try to get me on
&quot;look-alike&quot; charges; they might try to dig up
something in my past that could be used against me; they might
try to get me kicked off the internet; and I can't imagine what
else they might do; but, and this is most important, they
probably would not have me murdered like they used to do in the
old days. Thus, violence associated with the struggle for market
share would take a different form from the violence in the
neighborhoods between rival street gangs who wish to sell
&quot;crack&quot; in a city park. Marketing in general and
Advertising in Particular It is probably safe to say that all
marketers practice fraud to some extent and that every
advertisement at the mass market level (not a child advertising
for homes for some of his cat's kittens) is deceptive if it is
not in such incredibly bad taste that young children raised on
television can no longer tell the difference between fine art and
meaningless garbage. Conspiracies and Monopolies In a normalized,
legal drug market, the people must take precautions against
conspiracies of all types, including total monopolies. But, drug
production is not such an arcane art that people cannot manage to
carry it forward in their garages and basements even if they are
producing effectively for themselves alone. The danger of
industrial monopolies is a political problem or, as the Unabomber
would put it, an industrial problem. Frankly, I don't see the
difference. People who get stoned are guaranteed to make better
political decisions than those who don't, which is yet another
point for legalization, which should reduce the violence normally
associated with the formation and destruction of conspiracies and
monopolies. OVERDOSES, SUBSTITUTED CHEMICALS, IMPURITIES, AND
UNEXPECTED EFFECTS We must demand high-quality drugs, carefully
and truthfully labeled. This can be done, in the beginning by a
government bureau; but, as the profit motive disappears,
government regulation will gradually become unnecessary, as who
would perpetrate evil for no advantage to himself when the
rewards of virtue for its own sake are right before his eyes.
Thus, most of the deaths caused by drugs will be eliminated by
avoiding (i) overdoses that occur because the user is used to
weak dope and accidentally gets some that has not been cut very
much - either intentionally or by accident, (ii) drugs containing
harmful impurities (information on how to produce high-quality
drugs will be widely disseminated without government
interference), and (iii) drugs will not be mislabeled - neither
intentionally to defraud the consumer nor accidentally through
carelessness and/or ignorance. These are the most important ways
in which the laws against drugs kill. CRIMES OF PASSION OF WHICH
PEOPLE WHO DON'T TAKE DRUGS ARE INCAPABLE For Those Who Believe
Such Crimes Exist If a person takes a drug that enables him to
experience deep passion of which he is not capable otherwise, he
is nowise more culpable than a naturally deeply passionate person
who exhibits the same behavior. The test of whether his behavior
qualifies as passion is the observation of the person on the
identical dosage of the identical drug but not exhibiting the
passion. If such a time comes, we know that the passion was not
caused by the drug but, rather, was triggered by an insult, a
sexual provocation, or some other external stimulus. The drug,
then, merely permits an inhibited person to experience the depth
of feeling that is his due as a sentient being and a child of God
- a feeling that is experienced normally under the same
circumstances by a natural person. The tragedy of a sick society
that kills natural impulses in men and women is not something for
which a person may be punished if he merely discards the binding
neurosis by means of a conscious shock. The man who is capable of
deep feeling and correspondingly violent action is healthier than
the man who is incapable of feeling deeply and takes no steps to
free himself from the shackles imposed by an insane society. This
analysis can be applied to nearly every form of violent crime.
The criminal bears less guilt than all but the most spiritual of
souls - actually the truly enlightened who can transcend the
world completely and must be a rare species indeed. But, the
enlightenment of the spiritual sage is no substitute for the
political change needed to make society rational and just, such
that people who are truly alive needn't be bound and gagged like
animals by the oppressors and their willing dupes, who, of
course, are victims as well. Conservatives will recognize this as
the typical liberal notion that society is at fault for the
behavior of criminals. It is stated here without reservations,
qualification, or, needless to say, apologies of any kind. It is
the plain truth and easy to prove, as I have done in Chapter 4 of
Reference 1, my large work in progress, of which the first part,
which includes Chapter 4, is available from the American Policy
Institute, Inc. The Myth of Reefer Madness and its Contemporary
Counterparts As stated in my rebuttal of the DEA argument,
drug-induced crime is largely a myth. The DEA has no case here.
The constitutional rights of (otherwise) law abiding citizens may
not be denied due to the behavior of a few exceptional people who
would probably commit crimes with or without drugs. No
scientifically verified mechanistic link has been established
between taking drugs and committing crimes. No such link may be
as sumed until a valid scientific experiment proves its
existence. No such experiment has been performed. Always drugs
are placed in a singularly disadvantageous position, thus
ensuring the results desired by the biased pseudo-scientists. (A
true scientist must be absolutely fair if not completely
disinterested. It is practically impossible to find a
disinterested scientist and, if he could be found, who would fund
his research?) The above is merely a repetition of more complete
statements made earlier. DEATHS DUE TO PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT
Mythical Impairment Prohibitionists are fond of citing studies
that demonstrate how inept we become when we take drugs. These
studies are normally conducted by people whose funding comes from
those with a vested interest in positive results, i.e., showing
that impairment does indeed exist. By definition, these are not
scientific studies as scientific studies are performed by
disinterested people who are just as willing to be proved wrong
as right, nay, more willing - as the falsification of a
scientific hypothesis is more likely to lead to new and
interesting results than a corroboration, e.g., Michelson-Morley.
In a sense, every experiment is designed to prove a hypothesis
false. But, those who accept funding from &quot;interested&quot;
parties are already tainted and we should discount their findings
one hundred percent. (Personally, I advocate spitting in their
faces and cutting them dead in public - &quot;cutting&quot;, that
is, in the old-fashioned sense of high-class snobbery. Normally,
I am as egalitarian as the next chap; but, in the case of those
who drag our noblest institutions in the mud, I am willing to
make an exception - with the greatest of regrets, of course.) Let
me give an example (from the main text) provided by the Drug
Enforcement Agency: The last statement in the (DEA) paragraph
under consideration is just plain ludicrous on the face of it.
That's why we know these drug warriors are plain old-fashioned
liars - desperately trying to hold on to their lucrative (very
lucrative, I opine) jobs that are not and never were needed. Can
you say parasite? Here's the statement: &quot;Furthermore, a
study conducted by Stanford University found that twenty-four
hours after smoking one joint, pilots could not safely land a
plane.&quot; The reference is the Drug Awareness Information
Newsletter, undoubtedly another bunch of liars, but certainly not
a reviewed scientific journal. Now, after making a sensational
claim like this, why wouldn't they give us a reference to the
actual study? Twenty-four hours after smoking a joint, hardly
anyone can distinguish a difference from the way he felt before
he smoked the joint. Given this indisputable everyday fact, why
should we ever get in a plane knowing that the pilot is unable to
discern by feelings alone whether he is capable of landing it?
How did they get permission to carry out this test legally? Who
would carry it out illegally? I know the president of Stanford
might divert research funds to luxuries for his personal use, but
illegally fly planes ... ? Genuine Impairment Of all the drugs,
that which impairs physical and mental faculties to the maximum
extent possible is, of course, alcohol, which is not under
discussion. Average doses of a few drugs can really get the
subject whacked - notably Quaaludes, PCP, and most barbiturates
under fairly common circumstances if the subject be not confined
to bed. In the very first place, suppose that the menu of
available drugs contain the entire pharmacopoeia. My claim is
that the vast majority of users of these drugs will choose other
drugs. (I can't imagine anyone choosing phenobarbital when heroin
is available; heroin does not cause impairment in the great
preponderance of cases - quite the contrary.) For the very few
who do not choose better drugs, I give you the Fletcher Doctrine,
which belongs to legal philosophy. The Fletcher Doctrine states
that, while the person who does the damage due to lack of
self-possession under these drugs is not responsible for his
actions, the person who decided to use those drugs of impairment
is responsible for what his other self may have done. Is that
clear? Responsibility is properly assigned; no one gets away with
anything; and, in all probability, no more harm is done than in a
society in which the only legal drug of impairment is alcohol.
This should be an extremely rare class of unfortunate incidents
with which we shall have to contend as best we can. It is nothing
new and I don't think we may punish the user of a drug of
impairment until he causes damage - in keeping with Fletcher.
(Don't look now, but all those people who drove cars while they
were drunk and did not do any harm have been improperly contemned
- according to this entirely reasonable view.) Conclusion We have
shown that in nearly all cases death would not have occurred if
drugs were legal and freely available to everyone, provided, of
course, that they are of high quality and properly labeled as to
strength, recommended dosage, and with all information necessary
to the user correctly supplied. We have many deaths attributed to
alcohol, which is legal, but we claim that alcohol is a very bad
drug that no reasonable person ought to prefer when a wide
variety of alternative drugs is available. The same comment
applies to many other inferior drugs and may even apply to crack
cocaine. Thus, deaths due to drugs should be rare in a
normalized, post-legalization society. We are left with an odd
case or two where the Fletcher Doctrine must be applied, but we
have satisfied our promise to prove the statement in the title;
namely, the laws against drugs and the war on drugs rather than
the use of drugs per se are responsible for most (almost all)
deaths associated with drugs. Finally, although it is easy to
design a fair scientific experiment to test all of these
observations, such an experiment cannot be performed until drugs
are legal and normal and all of the stigma of drug taking has
disappeared, at which time we shall have achieved our objective
and the drug problem will be just another shameful chapter in
human history. Reference 1. Wayburn, Thomas L, On the
