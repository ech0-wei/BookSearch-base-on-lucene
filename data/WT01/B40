<p> RESEARCH IN BRIEF </p>

<p> NOVEMBER 1993 </p>

<p> PREVENTING ILLEGAL DIVERSION OF CHEMICALS: </p>

<p> A MODEL STATUTE </p>

<p> BY SHERRY GREEN </p>

<p> Letter from Michael J. Russell, Acting Director, National
Institute of </p>

<p> Justice: </p>

<p> Chemicals diverted from legitimate commerce are used in the
production of </p>

<p> illicit drugs such as cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, PCP,
and LSD. </p>

<p> Controlling illegal diversion and use of such chemicals is
essential to </p>

<p> limiting illicit drug production. Recent efforts to address
this problem are </p>

<p> based on the belief that illicit drug production can be
traced from the </p>

<p> records of chemical manufacturers and dealers of raw
materials in the same </p>

<p> way that laundered money can be traced through financial
records. </p>

<p> The principal U.S. statute to control chemical diversion is
the Chemical </p>

<p> Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988, which established
record keeping </p>

<p> requirements and enforcement activities, initially for 20
chemicals. </p>

<p> The Act has already proven effective in limiting the
international illicit </p>

<p> diversion of the identified chemicals and controlling some
domestic </p>

<p> manufacturing. However, illicit drug production in the United
States has been </p>

<p> rising at an alarming rate, with illegal domestic
laboratories now capable of </p>

<p> producing enough stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and
narcotics to </p>

<p> satisfy demand for these substances. </p>

<p> Adequate record-keeping ensures that there are paper trails
on chemicals sent </p>

<p> to illegal laboratories that make drugs. Thirty-two States,
however, do not </p>

<p> require record-keeping of transactions involving chemicals
identified as </p>

<p> necessary for producing illegal drugs. Criminals camouflage
diversion of </p>

<p> chemicals by moving shipments through States without
record-keeping </p>

<p> requirements. </p>

<p> To focus attention on the need for all State law enforcement
agencies to </p>

<p> supplement Federal controls over chemical traffic and its
diversion into </p>

<p> illicit drug manufacturing, the National Institute of Justice
sponsored a </p>

<p> project to create a Model State Chemical Control Act. The
Model Act seeks to </p>

<p> balance and accommodate the interests of law enforcement and
legitimate </p>

<p> commerce. This Research in Brief explains how the Model Act
can be used to </p>

<p> help halt the growth of illegal domestic drug manufacturing
by stopping the </p>

<p> diversion of chemicals from legitimate to illegitimate
purposes. </p>

<p> [End letter] </p>

<p> Law enforcement agencies around the world are using a variety
of methods to </p>

<p> attack the illegal and deadly &quot;industry&quot; of illicit
drugs. Enforcement </p>

<p> officials seize contraband substances, break up distribution
networks, </p>

<p> disrupt money-laundering operations, and destroy crops. A
critical part of </p>

<p> this multifaceted attack on drug trafficking is the control
of specific </p>

<p> chemicals that are necessary to produce illegal drugs. </p>

<p> The United States is one of the world's leading producers and
distributors of </p>

<p> the chemicals that are used to make controlled substances.
Each year our </p>

<p> Nation exports more than 50,000 metric tons of chemicals to
Latin America, </p>

<p> many of which find their way into the clandestine
laboratories of cocaine- </p>

<p> and heroin-producing countries. In fact, seizures of illegal
labs in Colombia </p>

<p> and other Latin American countries often uncover chemical
containers with US. </p>

<p> company logos. Until 1989 much of the cocaine entering our
country was </p>

<p> produced using chemicals originating in the United States. </p>

<p> Although there has been a decline in the export of chemicals
for </p>

<p> manufacturing illegal drugs, there has been an increase in
the chemicals' </p>

<p> distribution at home. Illegal domestic laboratories are now
capable of </p>

<p> producing enough illicit drugs to satisfy U.S. consumers'
demand. </p>

<p> In 1991 the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) supported a
project to help </p>

<p> the States develop a legislative response to the problem of
distribution of </p>

<p> chemicals and their manufacture into illegal drugs. To
prepare the Model </p>

<p> State Chemical Control Act of 1992 (the Model), the American
Prosecutors </p>

<p> Research Institute (APRI), the research arm of the National
District </p>

<p> Attorneys Association, brought together investigators and
prosecutors from </p>

<p> Arizona, California, Oklahoma, Texas, and Washington State.
In addition, APRI </p>

<p> solicited comments from the Department of Justice and the
Drug Enforcement </p>

<p> Administration (DEA) on the lessons they had learned at the
Federal level and </p>

<p> sought to understand the concerns of the chemical and
pharmaceutical </p>

<p> industries. </p>

<p> This Research in Brief describes how chemicals are used to
make illicit </p>

<p> drugs, discusses existing Federal and State legislation to
curtail the </p>

<p> diversion of chemicals for illicit drug production, and
reviews the Model </p>

<p> statute. </p>

<p> DOMESTIC ILLICIT DRUG PRODUCTION </p>

<p> --Essential and precursor chemicals: All major illicit drugs
except marijuana </p>

<p> are either extracted or synthesized in a process requiring
chemicals that are </p>

<p> categorized as either &quot;essential&quot; or
&quot;precursor.&quot; Essential chemicals are </p>

<p> used to extract drugs, such as cocaine, from plants. Although
these chemicals </p>

<p> do not become part of the drug's molecular structure, they
are crucial to the </p>

<p> manufacturing process. Precursor chemicals are used to
synthesize drugs (such </p>

<p> as PCP), which are not naturally derived. These chemicals do
become part of </p>

<p> the drug's molecular structure. </p>

<p> --Clandestine Labs: Highly sophisticated laboratory
operations are sometimes </p>

<p> necessary to manufacture drugs. For example, producing
marketable quantities </p>

<p> of cocaine requires large-scale operations to handle the
enormous amounts of </p>

<p> coca leaves and solvents required. On the other hand, illegal
drug production </p>

<p> is often a simple process, without need of complex
technology, sophisticated </p>

<p> education, or training. Many synthetic drugs such as
methamphetamine and PCP </p>

<p> can be produced in someone's home with readily available
laboratory </p>

<p> equipment. In fact, with equipment and precursor chemicals
worth $200, a </p>

<p> criminal can in 18 hours produce a batch of methamphetamine
with a street </p>

<p> value of $98,000.(ref. 1) </p>

<p> In the 1980's States faced an outbreak of clandestine
laboratories because </p>

<p> chemicals were readily available on the open market or were
easily diverted </p>

<p> from legitimate commerce. In 1986 the Oklahoma Bureau of
Narcotics (OBN) </p>

<p> seized 28 labs, an almost 100 percent increase over the 16
labs seized in </p>

<p> 1985. Another 100 percent increase in seizures occurred in
1988 when OBN </p>

<p> seized 62 laboratories, compared to the 30 labs seized the
previous year. </p>

<p> From 1985 to 1987, Texas narcotics officers seized more than
twice the number </p>

<p> of labs as OBN. </p>

<p> Clandestine laboratories range from small crude operations in
sheds, </p>

<p> bathtubs, mobile homes, boats, and motel rooms to highly
sophisticated </p>

<p> operations with professional quality laboratory glassware and
equipment. </p>

<p> More than 80 percent of the clandestine labs in the United
States produce </p>

<p> methamphetamines.(ref. 2) With a knowledge of chemistry
equivalent to that </p>

<p> learned in high school, illicit lab operators are believed to
produce 25 tons </p>

<p> of methamphetamines annually with a street value of $3
billion. Less than 1 </p>

<p> percent of that amount is spent on the chemicals needed for
production.(ref. </p>

<p> 3) </p>

<p> CHEMICAL DIVERSION AND TRAFFICKING ACT </p>

<p> In 1988 Congress enacted the Chemical Diversion and
Trafficking Act (CDTA), </p>

<p> Subtitle A of the Anti-Drug Abuse Amendments of 1988
(codified as amendments </p>

<p> to the Federal Controlled Substances Act). CDTA established
record-keeping </p>

<p> and reporting requirements and authorized enforcement
activities for domestic </p>

<p> and international transactions in designated precursor and
essential </p>

<p> chemicals. Originally CDTA regulated machines for making the
drugs into </p>

<p> tablets or capsules, 12 precursor chemicals, and 8 essential
chemicals. Now, </p>

<p> 27 precursor and 7 essential chemicals are on the CDTA list.
Chemicals may be </p>

<p> added or deleted under standard Federal rule making
procedures. </p>

<p> CDTA applies to any individual or legal entity that
manufactures, distributes </p>

<p> domestically, imports, or exports any of the listed
chemicals. The Act makes </p>

<p> the unauthorized trade in these listed chemicals equivalent
to trafficking in </p>

<p> illegal drugs. </p>

<p> Each chemical has been assigned a threshold amount, by volume
or weight, or a </p>

<p> threshold number of monthly transactions. Once the threshold
has been reached </p>

<p> or exceeded, regulated individuals and entities must comply
with Federal </p>

<p> record-keeping, reporting, and identification requirements.
However, </p>

<p> threshold quantities do not apply to machinery; distribution
of a single </p>

<p> tableting or encapsulating machine triggers CDTA provisions. </p>

<p> Among the provisions are requirements that purchasers supply
proof of </p>

<p> identity in all regulated transactions. The type of
identification required </p>

<p> depends on whether the customer is new, is an individual or
established </p>

<p> business, is paying in cash, or is exporting the chemical to
another country. </p>

<p> Records of regulated domestic transactions involving a
precursor chemical or </p>

<p> a tableting or encapsulating machine must be kept for 4
years. For an </p>

<p> essential chemical, the record must be kept 2 years. Records
must be readily </p>

<p> retrievable either at the business where the transaction
occurred or some </p>

<p> other central location. Each record must contain specific
information about </p>

<p> the transaction and is subject to inspection and photocopying
by the Drug </p>

<p> Enforcement Administration. </p>

<p> CDTA requires that regulated individuals and entities report
some </p>

<p> circumstances both orally and in writing to DEA. These
include uncommon </p>

<p> methods of payment, loss or disappearance of a chemical, and
suspicion that a </p>

<p> chemical has been diverted for illegal purposes. As with
records, reports </p>

<p> must contain the date of the transaction, quantity of the
chemical purchased, </p>

<p> name and address of each party, method of transfer, and other
descriptive </p>

<p> details. On the basis of the reports or a lapse in
record-keeping, DEA has </p>

<p> the authority to stop chemical shipments. Receipt of the
required advance </p>

<p> notice of shipments can trigger DEA suspension when an
illicit transfer is </p>

<p> suspected. </p>

<p> --The effect of Federal control: Shortly after implementation
of CDTA, DEA </p>

<p> noted a downward trend in domestic illegal lab activity as
measured by the </p>

<p> number of lab seizures. Of the 1,000 projected DEA lab
seizures for 1989, 807 </p>

<p> materialized. A sharper decline occurred the following year
when DEA seized </p>

<p> 521 laboratories. This decline was the first time seizures
had dropped </p>

<p> significantly since 1981. </p>

<p> CDTA has also been successful in controlling exports of
essential chemicals </p>

<p> to Latin America. But as the pathways to foreign buyers have
narrowed, some </p>

<p> U.S. exporters have turned their attention to the domestic
market. </p>

<p> Opportunities for diversion exist all along the domestic
commercial chain. </p>

<p> Although CDTA's strict requirements help safeguard the legal
transfer of </p>

<p> chemicals above the threshold levels, illicit operators are
restructuring </p>

<p> their businesses to avoid Federal regulations. They are
focusing their </p>

<p> efforts on States that do not have effective mechanisms for
controlling </p>

<p> chemicals. </p>

<p> --Closing the door: The Office of National Drug Control
Policy has estimated </p>

<p> that the world supply of cocaine in 1990 was 1,000 metric
tons, or about 2.2 </p>

<p> million pounds. To produce this amount of cocaine, millions
of pounds of </p>

<p> essential chemicals were required for processing. But many of
these chemicals </p>

<p> such as hydrochloric acid also have hundreds of legitimate
uses, and for this </p>

<p> reason, they are common substances in international trade. </p>

<p> Criminals obtain these substances from manufacturers through
theft, bribery </p>

<p> of employees, or even legal purchase, especially in areas
that lack chemical </p>

<p> control laws or do not enforce them. Poor plant security can
increase theft, </p>

<p> and some retail purchasers are actually &quot;front
companies&quot; set up by producers </p>

<p> to disguise the illicit drug trade. </p>

<p> In addition, the vast international network of freight
forwarders, brokers, </p>

<p> and agents provides access to chemicals through multiple
sales transactions, </p>

<p> similar to money-laundering operations. In ports and free
trade zones, </p>

<p> criminals can obtain the desired chemicals by repacking or
re-labeling </p>

<p> materials. </p>

<p> CDTA has greatly decreased U.S. exports of essential
chemicals to Latin </p>

<p> America. This Federal statute has added to costs borne by
criminals, and the </p>

<p> new regulation and record-keeping requirements of the Act
make it </p>

<p> increasingly likely that illicit operators are restructuring
their businesses </p>

<p> to avoid Federal regulations. They are focusing their efforts
on States that </p>

<p> do not have effective mechanisms for controlling chemicals. </p>

<p> THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE STATE CONTROLS </p>

<p> State regulatory and enforcement efforts are needed to
supplement Federal </p>

<p> controls over the movement of chemicals into illegal
channels. If State </p>

<p> officials can follow the trail of precursor and essential
chemicals from the </p>

<p> chemical manufacturer to the illicit drug producer, then
producers can be </p>

<p> identified and apprehended before they manufacture illegal
drugs. Controlling </p>

<p> these chemicals, therefore, is a potent strategy that can
help identify drug </p>

<p> criminals and interfere with their operations. </p>

<p> Effective regulation of chemical transactions could dry up
the sources that </p>

<p> supply illegal labs. However, clandestine drug production is
a nomadic </p>

<p> business. When chemicals become difficult to obtain in one
locale, illegal </p>

<p> lab operators simply move their operations to a location
where acquisition of </p>

<p> chemicals is less complicated. Differences in the extent of
control exercised </p>

<p> by the States currently make that a fairly easy process. More
consistent </p>

<p> State laws could curtail movement of illegal labs from State
to State. </p>

<p> EXISTING VARIATIONS IN STATE CONTROLS </p>

<p> To date 18 States have sought to control the existence of
clandestine labs by </p>

<p> enacting their own detailed chemical tracking requirements.
Some </p>

<p> jurisdictions have incorporated these requirements into their
controlled </p>

<p> substances acts already on the books, while others have
adopted new, distinct </p>

<p> statutes. </p>

<p> --Number of chemicals: Colorado controls the largest number
of chemicals (35) </p>

<p> while Montana regulates 9. The differences reflect each
State's experience or </p>

<p> policy regarding diversion, abuse, and the potential illicit
use of a </p>

<p> chemical. Nearly all of the States that have controls exclude
prescription or </p>

<p> over-the-counter drugs, or both, from chemical requirements,
with special </p>

<p> exemptions for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine,
norpseudoephedrine, and </p>

<p> phenylpropanolamine. </p>

<p> --Registration: All 18 States require a license or permit to
lawfully </p>

<p> manufacture or transfer a regulated chemical. Only a few
regulate the </p>

<p> purchase or possession of chemicals. Registration renewal
generally happens </p>

<p> annually and involves a reasonable fee; the definition of
reasonable varies </p>

<p> from a maximum of $25 in Arkansas to a minimum of $250 in New
Mexico. Grounds </p>

<p> for denial, suspension, or revocation include fraud; drug law
violations and </p>

<p> convictions; and denial, suspension, or revocation of Federal
registrations. </p>

<p> --Record-keeping: Differences also occur in the requirements
for </p>

<p> record-keeping. For example, several jurisdictions mandate
that chemical </p>

<p> transfer records be kept for 2 years after the transaction
date, but </p>

<p> Minnesota requires that records be kept for 5 years. Texas
requires that </p>

<p> records of sales of laboratory apparatus also be kept. Hawaii
and Missouri </p>

<p> maintain the confidentiality of information obtained through
records. </p>

<p> Pennsylvania penalizes wrongful use of the information. </p>

<p> --Reporting: Required reporting of intrastate transfers and
out-of-State </p>

<p> purchases also varies among States. In several States the
regulatory agency </p>

<p> must be given 21 days advance notice of any chemical
delivery. Some States </p>

<p> provide a monthly reporting alternative for individuals and
entities with a </p>

<p> history of lawful use, a regular relationship with a
recipient, or both. </p>

<p> While California and Montana require notice of receipt of
chemicals within 3 </p>

<p> days after delivery, Oregon allows 10 days. Ten States
require that special </p>

<p> reports be submitted within 3 days after discovery of a theft
or loss of </p>

<p> chemicals, and eight require reports within 3 days for a
discrepancy in </p>

<p> quantities shipped and received. Iowa and Washington extend
these deadlines </p>

<p> to 7 days. </p>

<p> --Exemptions: Medical professionals, agents, and licensed
entities such as </p>

<p> common carriers are traditionally exempt from licensing or
reporting </p>

<p> obligations. Some States expand the exemptions to include
college chemistry </p>

<p> students, government employees, or researchers. </p>

<p> --Purchaser identification: Most jurisdictions mandate that
individual </p>

<p> purchasers identify themselves with a photograph, proof of
street or </p>

<p> residential mailing address, and signature. Some
jurisdictions ask for the </p>

<p> purchaser's birth date, driver's license or other
State-issued identification </p>

<p> number, year in which the purchaser's vehicle was
manufactured, and vehicle </p>

<p> license tag number. Most business recipients must furnish an
authorization </p>

<p> letter listing an identification number, an address, a phone
number, and a </p>

<p> description of the chemical's intended use. </p>

<p> --Responsibility: Finally, there is no consensus among the
States on which </p>

<p> government agency should be given regulatory responsibility.
The 18 States </p>

<p> assign this duty to a wide variety of health, pharmaceutical,
commerce, and </p>

<p> enforcement agencies. </p>

<p> ILLEGITIMATE USES FOR LEGITIMATE PRODUCTS </p>

<p> Many people recognize ephedrine as an ingredient in sinus
medications. </p>

<p> However, consumers are often unaware that ephedrine is also
the primary </p>

<p> precursor used to illegally produce methamphetamine (meth).
In 1990, 53 </p>

<p> percent of the clandestine meth labs seized by the Drug
Enforcement </p>

<p> Administration used the ephedrine reduction method to produce
the drug.(ref. </p>

<p> 4) </p>

<p> State officials report that illicit meth laboratories in the
West and </p>

<p> Southwest began using ephedrine after phenylacetic acid came
under State </p>

<p> regulation. In northern California 85 percent of the seized
meth labs used </p>

<p> single-ingredient ephedrine tablets. In Oregon officials
discovered that </p>

<p> over-the-counter ephedrine tablets sold in the Portland area
had become a </p>

<p> source of ephedrine for northwest meth lab operators.(ref. 5)
</p>

<p> For this reason, ephedrine has been included in the list of
chemicals </p>

<p> targeted for regulation under the Model State Chemical
Control Act. </p>

<p> MODEL STATE CHEMICAL CONTROL ACT </p>

<p> In developing the Model State Chemical Control Act of 1992,
the drafters </p>

<p> sought to close loopholes in existing Federal and State
legislation and to </p>

<p> foster greater consistency among State regulations. Unlike
most criminal </p>

<p> laws, the Model is a preventive measure. Its goal is to stop
drug offenses </p>

<p> before they occur by preventing precursor and essential
chemicals from being </p>

<p> diverted to illegal channels. It seeks to protect the
interests of legitimate </p>

<p> commerce without limiting the ability of law enforcement to
stop illicit </p>

<p> chemical transactions. </p>

<p> Monitoring every transaction involving a regulated chemical.
The Model </p>

<p> creates a monitoring system that tracks 35 chemicals from
source to use. It </p>

<p> covers a comprehensive range of chemicals controlled by
States and the </p>

<p> Federal Government. </p>

<p> The Model's reporting and record-keeping requirements apply
to every </p>

<p> transaction involving a regulated chemical, not just those
exceeding a legal </p>

<p> threshold. Under Federal law, manufacturers and distributors
do not have to </p>

<p> report or keep records on individuals or businesses who buy
chemicals in </p>

<p> amounts below the legal threshold. Individuals can circumvent
the law by </p>

<p> making multiple purchases of small quantities, thereby
accumulating large </p>

<p> amounts of chemicals for clandestine production.
Unfortunately, Federal </p>

<p> officials have no way of obtaining information about such
transactions. The </p>

<p> Model permits State and local officials to address this type
of diversion </p>

<p> activity, which would otherwise escape detection until after
illegal use of </p>

<p> the chemicals. </p>

<p> The list of regulated chemicals can be modified by rule in
response to </p>

<p> changes in diversion or use. Under the Model, State officials
may regulate a </p>

<p> chemical on an emergency basis while awaiting completion of
normal </p>

<p> rule-making procedures. </p>

<p> Emergency regulation is sometimes necessary to prevent
imminent hazards to </p>

<p> public health and safety. Some chemicals are flammable or
toxic and their use </p>

<p> must be controlled as soon as possible to prevent explosions,
environmental </p>

<p> damage, or illness. </p>

<p> Registering manufacturers and distributors. Responsibility
for the control of </p>

<p> regulated chemicals rests primarily with manufacturers and
distributors. </p>

<p> Therefore, the Model requires that they annually furnish law
enforcement with </p>

<p> detailed information about the sources, location, and amount
of chemicals </p>

<p> available for sale. The purpose of annual registration is
threefold: </p>

<p> --To convey to manufacturers and distributors an
understanding of the </p>

<p> critical role they play in eliminating illegal chemical
transfers. </p>

<p> --To help government officials determine if the chemicals
found at </p>

<p> clandestine lab sites have been supplied by a legal or
&quot;underground&quot; source. </p>

<p> --To help government officials more accurately assess the
extent of illegal </p>

<p> diversion. </p>

<p> The drafters anticipate that the number of annual
registrations to be </p>

<p> processed will be manageable. For example, in California
officials currently </p>

<p> register only 40 to 45 companies per year. </p>

<p> Requiring permits to possess a regulated chemical. Permits
identify which </p>

<p> persons intend to use specific quantities of chemicals for a
specific </p>

<p> purpose. </p>

<p> With certain exceptions, every applicant for a permit must
provide detailed </p>

<p> personal information, including a criminal history and
notarized fingerprint </p>

<p> card. Based on this information, government officials
ascertain the fitness </p>

<p> of a potential chemical recipient and ensure that the
intended use is lawful. </p>

<p> The permit provision is modeled after Oklahoma's chemical
control statute, </p>

<p> which extends the law beyond the traditional
&quot;receiving&quot; category of </p>

<p> purchasers to individuals who want to &quot;possess&quot; a
regulated chemical. By </p>

<p> requiring that they obtain a permit each time they seek to
possess a </p>

<p> regulated chemical, the Model eliminates a significant
loophole in many </p>

<p> existing statutes. For example, some illegal
&quot;cookers&quot; manufacture controlled </p>

<p> substances using chemicals produced in their own clandestine
laboratories. </p>

<p> They are not subject to existing regulation and liability
provisions, which </p>

<p> apply solely to purchasers, because they do not buy the
chemical from an </p>

<p> outside source. Under the Model statute, &quot;cookers&quot;
would be subject to the </p>

<p> law because although they do not &quot;receive&quot; the
chemicals, they nonetheless </p>

<p> &quot;possess&quot; them. </p>

<p> The Model's permit process protects legitimate commerce in
two ways. First, </p>

<p> it exempts the owners and officers of publicly held
corporations (those with </p>

<p> 35 shareholders or more) from the disclosure requirements of
permit </p>

<p> applications. These corporations are often fairly sizable
businesses or are </p>

<p> headquartered out-of-State. Their shareholders and officers
lack the personal </p>

<p> access necessary to illegally use or transfer regulated
chemicals. The Model </p>

<p> assumes that there is no need for detailed background
information or </p>

<p> fingerprint cards for such persons. </p>

<p> Second, the Model includes a reporting alternative for
possessors who </p>

<p> demonstrate a history of regular, legitimate use. The risk of
these </p>

<p> possessors diverting chemicals for unlawful purposes is less
than with other </p>

<p> possessors. Therefore, they may submit retrospective monthly
reports of </p>

<p> actual chemical use in lieu of obtaining permits. The Model
prevents </p>

<p> unnecessary duplication by accepting copies of Federal
reports containing </p>

<p> information about threshold amounts of regulated chemicals. </p>

<p> --Exempting individuals from regulation: The Model exempts
common carriers </p>

<p> pharmacists, physicians, and other authorized practitioners
from the </p>

<p> statute's requirements. Manufacturers can obtain a special
exemption to </p>

<p> continue marketing bona fide drug products such as over-the
counter sinus and </p>

<p> asthma medications. A special exemption is granted upon a
finding by State </p>

<p> officials that a product is manufactured and distributed in a
manner that </p>

<p> prevents its diversion. In making the finding, State
officials consider the </p>

<p> product's packaging, advertising, and actual or potential for
diversion.(ref. </p>

<p> 6) </p>

<p> --Safeguarding possession of regulated chemicals: The Model
contains a number </p>

<p> of safeguards to prevent unauthorized or unscrupulous persons
from gaining </p>

<p> access to regulated chemicals. It specifies that the
following persons are </p>

<p> ineligible to apply for a registration or permit: </p>

<p> Convicted drug offenders. </p>

<p> Persons who have had a prior registration or permit </p>

<p> Minors </p>

<p> Because juveniles are subject to milder penalties than
adults, they </p>

<p> frequently have been recruited to become participants in
criminal activity. </p>

<p> Therefore, making minors ineligible should preclude drug
balers from using </p>

<p> juveniles to acquire chemicals for illegal purposes. </p>

<p> The Model also provides for denial, suspension, or revocation
of a </p>

<p> registration or permit. Violation of the statutory rules,
falsification of a </p>

<p> document, and similar acts are grounds for denial of
authorized access to </p>

<p> regulated chemicals. </p>

<p> Spotting discrepancies in the flow of chemicals. The Model
establishes four </p>

<p> information-gathering mechanisms to help State officials spot
possible </p>

<p> diversion activities. </p>

<p> First, the Model requires manufacturers, distributors, and
possessors to </p>

<p> report any suspicious transaction or circumstance. cash
payments, </p>

<p> discrepancies between quantities shipped and received, and
theft or loss of </p>

<p> chemicals are all examples of suspicious circumstances. </p>

<p> Second, the Model requires manufacturers, distributors,
brokers, and traders </p>

<p> to provide monthly reports detailing every transaction
involving a regulated </p>

<p> chemical. The reports allow officials to identify the true
purchaser of </p>

<p> chemicals and ascertain whether the actual chemical use is
consistent with </p>

<p> the stated intended use. </p>

<p> Third, the Model requires purchasers to submit information
about themselves, </p>

<p> their permit or other authorization, and their vehicles prior
to receiving or </p>

<p> distributing a regulated chemical. This provision, which
incorporates </p>

<p> California's purchaser identification requirements, also
facilitates </p>

<p> determination of the ultimate purchaser and the chemical's
use. </p>

<p> Fourth, manufacturers and distributors are required to take
inventory </p>

<p> annually and to keep all transaction records readily
accessible for 4 years. </p>

<p> --Providing for enforcement: The Model vests State officials
with the </p>

<p> authority to identify and respond to situations of
noncompliance. It </p>

<p> authorizes limited warrantless inspections during regular
business hours and </p>

<p> allows State officials to routinely inspect inventories,
storage facilities, </p>

<p> records, papers, files, and equipment.(ref. 9) It also grants
State officials </p>

<p> the power to subpoena witnesses and require document
production. The Model </p>

<p> provides for stiff fines and terms of imprisonment for
noncompliance. </p>

<p> To eliminate the economic incentive for this type of criminal
activity, the </p>

<p> Model applies a State's drug forfeiture procedures to money
and property used </p>

<p> in violation of the chemical diversion statute. </p>

<p> --Recovering expenses: As with any proactive regulatory
scheme, the Model </p>

<p> requires a continuing investment of time and money. To
prevent financial </p>

<p> strain on scarce State resources, a system of nonrefundable
application fees </p>

<p> is recommended to help offset the cost of administering the
program. </p>

<p> In addition, the Model imposes a special civil assessment on
violators of the </p>

<p> statute to be used for cleanup of illegal laboratory sites.
Seizure of </p>

<p> clandestine laboratories often reveals significant amounts of
hazardous or </p>

<p> toxic waste and other byproducts that have been found. Under
Federal law, law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies become liable for various cleanup and
transporting </p>

<p> operations, damage to natural resources, and subsequent
health risks that </p>

<p> remain after the lab is dismantled.(ref. 10) </p>

<p> Last year Oklahoma spent approximately $6,000 to clean up
illegal labs, and </p>

<p> for several years California has spent more than $1 million a
year for </p>

<p> similar tasks. However, these expenses were only for removing
bulk </p>

<p> contamination. In the future site restoration through
hazardous waste removal </p>

<p> may require even larger sums of money. The civil assessment
will prevent </p>

<p> violators from escaping financial liability for the
environmental damage they </p>

<p> cause and help States address the issue of long-term
hazardous waste or </p>

<p> residual contamination. </p>

<p> APPLYING THE MODEL </p>

<p> The chemical control legislation in California, Oklahoma,
Texas, and </p>

<p> Washington served as guides for creating the Model. Oklahoma
and Texas </p>

<p> officials have already noted the positive effect of their
legislation on the </p>

<p> struggle to eliminate illegal drug production. The Oklahoma
Bureau of </p>

<p> Narcotics and Texas Department of Public Safety indicate that
their States' </p>

<p> precursor laws significantly reduced the availability of
chemicals throughout </p>

<p> Oklahoma and Texas. The reduction in supply has led to a
decrease in </p>

<p> clandestine laboratory activity in both States. The Texas
Department of </p>

<p> Public Safety reports that the availability of illicit
amphetamine and </p>

<p> methamphetamine in Texas decreased about 50 percent during
the 3-year period </p>

<p> since passage of its statute.&quot; </p>

<p> Despite the success of these States' efforts, the lack of
adequate chemical </p>

<p> controls in many states provides illegal drug manufacturers
with </p>

<p> opportunities to expand their production of controlled
substances. The toll </p>

<p> in health, welfare, enforcement, and safety costs as well as
human suffering </p>

<p> is incalculable. The Model is designed to help State
policymakers and </p>

<p> criminal justice professionals develop legislation that will
severely curtail </p>

<p> domestic illegal drug production while protecting legitimate
commercial </p>

<p> interests. </p>

<p> COPING WITH CHEMICAL HAZARDS </p>

<p> Seizures of clandestine labs pose special problems for law
enforcement </p>

<p> officers because many of the chemicals used in drug
manufacturing are </p>

<p> dangerous. For example, acids and solvents are corrosive and
flammable, and </p>

<p> some are highly explosive. About one-fifth of clandestine lab
seizures result </p>

<p> from reports of fires caused by chemical processes.(ref. 7) </p>

<p> In addition, many precursor and essential chemicals are
corrosive and can </p>

<p> cause lung and eye damage, even upon exposure to vapors
emanating from the </p>

<p> lab. Furthermore, according to a study in California,
one-tenth of seized </p>

<p> labs were booby-trapped with explosives or with disfiguring
and poisonous </p>

<p> chemical devices.(ref. 8) </p>

<p> For these reasons, law enforcement experts recommend that
police officers in </p>

<p> all areas of the criminal justice system be given special
training in </p>

<p> handling these substances. They note that rural police
agencies are just as </p>

<p> likely to encounter clandestine labs as urban police. Highway
patrols and </p>

<p> other agencies in jurisdictions with large railroad and other
transportation </p>

<p> hubs are likely to find such substances en route to a
clandestine location. </p>

<p> This briefing report provides information on drug courts,\1 a
new </p>

<p> approach used by state and local governments to address
drug-related </p>

<p> crime. These courts monitor the treatment and behavior of
drug-using </p>

<p> defendants. </p>

<p> Title V of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act
of 1994 </p>

<p> (the 1994 Crime Act) authorizes the award of federal grants
for drug </p>

<p> courts. The act requires that we assess the effectiveness and
impact </p>

<p> of these grants and report to Congress by January 1, 1997. To
assist </p>

<p> Congress in its deliberations on whether to fund drug courts,
we </p>

<p> developed this preliminary report. Specifically, we gathered </p>

<p> information on drug courts in existence prior to the awarding
of </p>

<p> grants under the 1994 Crime Act, assessed evaluations of
these </p>

<p> courts, and reviewed the Department of Justice's (DOJ) </p>

<p> responsibilities and plans for implementing the federal drug
court </p>

<p> grant program. </p>

<p> During April and on May 11, 1995, we briefed the Committees
on the </p>

<p> results of our work. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \1 Throughout this briefing report, we use the terms drug
courts and </p>

<p> drug court programs interchangeably. </p>

<p> RESULTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :1 </p>

<p> In response to the deluge of drug cases since the late 1980s
and the </p>

<p> cycle of recidivism (rearrest rates) common to drug
offenders, some </p>

<p> state and local jurisdictions created drug courts, the
majority of </p>

<p> which have been operating since 1993. The main purpose of
drug </p>

<p> courts is to use the authority of the court to reduce crime
by </p>

<p> changing defendants' drug-using behavior. In exchange for the
</p>

<p> possibility of dismissed charges or reduced sentences,
defendants are </p>

<p> diverted to drug courts. Judges preside over drug court
proceedings, </p>

<p> monitor the progress of defendants through frequent status
hearings, </p>

<p> and prescribe sanctions and rewards as appropriate in
collaboration </p>

<p> with prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment providers, and
others. </p>

<p> Although there are basic elements common to many drug court
programs, </p>

<p> they vary in terms of participant eligibility, length of the
program, </p>

<p> penalties and rewards, and other practices. The courts are
supported </p>

<p> by a variety of local, state, federal, and private funds and </p>

<p> participant fees, according to the Drug Court Resource
Center.\2 </p>

<p> As of March 1995, there were at least 37 drug courts
operating </p>

<p> nationwide, most of which had been fully operational for at
least 9 </p>

<p> months. Thirty-three drug courts responding to our
questionnaire </p>

<p> reported having accepted over 20,000 defendants, of whom a
third had </p>

<p> completed their programs. According to the Project Director
of the </p>

<p> Drug Court Resource Center, none of the drug courts accept
defendants </p>

<p> currently charged with a violent offense, and most do not
accept </p>

<p> defendants with prior violent convictions. However, at least
one </p>

<p> drug court accepts defendants regardless of prior offenses.
(See </p>

<p> sect. I for more general information on drug courts.) </p>

<p> We assessed six evaluations of five drug courts completed as
of March </p>

<p> 1995. Although some evaluation results indicated that drug
courts </p>

<p> may have some beneficial effects, limitations in their
designs and </p>

<p> methodologies, as well as the relative newness of drug
courts, </p>

<p> precluded firm conclusions about the overall impact of these </p>

<p> programs. The evaluations showed mixed results in recidivism
and </p>

<p> other defendant outcomes. For example, two evaluations showed
less </p>

<p> recidivism by drug court defendants. However, three other </p>

<p> evaluations showed no significant differences in recidivism. </p>

<p> Additionally, two evaluations of the same drug court showed </p>

<p> contrasting recidivism results. (See sect. II and app. III
for </p>

<p> more information on the evaluations we assessed.) </p>

<p> The 1994 Crime Act authorized the Attorney General to award
and </p>

<p> administer discretionary grants for drug court programs. A
key </p>

<p> requirement of the act is that violent offenders are
prohibited as </p>

<p> drug court participants. The act authorized $1 billion from
fiscal </p>

<p> years 1995 through 2000 to support drug court programs. For
fiscal </p>

<p> year 1995, $29 million was appropriated. However, Congress
has </p>

<p> proposed fiscal year 1995 budget cuts in a pending rescission
bill. </p>

<p> In addition, the House has passed legislation repealing the
drug </p>

<p> court grant program authorized in the 1994 Crime Act. </p>

<p> DOJ expects to award grants beginning in the summer of 1995.
The </p>

<p> 1994 Crime Act also authorizes the Attorney General to
provide for a </p>

<p> national evaluation of drug courts supported by federal
grants. DOJ </p>

<p> expects to complete the evaluation to assess the impact and </p>

<p> effectiveness of drug court grants in about 2 years. (See
sect. III </p>

<p> for more information.) </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \2 The Bureau of Justice Assistance funds the Drug Court
Resource </p>

<p> Center. The Resource Center began operating October 1, 1994,
under </p>

<p> the direction of The American University in partnership with
the </p>

<p> National Center for State Courts and the National Consortium
of </p>

<p> Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime Programs. The Resource
Center </p>

<p> assists state and local justice system officials in planning,
</p>

<p> implementing, managing, and evaluating drug courts. It also
acts as </p>

<p> a clearinghouse and provides technical assistance and other
services </p>

<p> to jurisdictions interested in developing or expanding drug
courts. </p>

<p> OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND </p>

<p> METHODOLOGY </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :2 </p>

<p> In preparation for our 1997 mandated study, we initiated a </p>

<p> preliminary review of drug court programs. Our objectives
were to </p>

<p> determine </p>

<p> the number, location, and key elements of drug courts; </p>

<p> the results and validity of evaluations of drug courts; and </p>

<p> DOJ's responsibilities and plans for implementing statutory </p>

<p> requirements for the federal drug court grant program. </p>

<p> The Drug Court Resource Center, which is based at The
American </p>

<p> University, Washington, D.C., provided us with general
information on </p>

<p> drug courts. To obtain more current information, we sent a </p>

<p> questionnaire to 37 drug courts. We received responses from
33 drug </p>

<p> courts as of March 31, 1995. We did not verify the accuracy
of the </p>

<p> data provided to us by the Drug Court Resource Center and
drug </p>

<p> courts. In addition, we attended a January 1995 national
training </p>

<p> conference for drug court professionals in Las Vegas, NV, and
visited </p>

<p> drug courts in Las Vegas and Washington, D.C. </p>

<p> To determine the results and assess the validity of
evaluations of </p>

<p> drug courts, we obtained 11 drug court evaluations completed
as of </p>

<p> March 1, 1995, from the Drug Court Resource Center. These </p>

<p> evaluations were done by a variety of sources, including
independent </p>

<p> researchers, county officials, and court representatives. We </p>

<p> reviewed them and assessed the evaluative methodology used
and the </p>

<p> validity of reported findings. We did not analyze the
reported </p>

<p> results of three of them because they reported outcome data
for drug </p>

<p> court defendants without any reference to comparison or
control </p>

<p> groups. We were unable to assess the validity of one because
it did </p>

<p> not include a description of the methodology used. Two dealt
with </p>

<p> one drug court and were assessed as one evaluation because
one was a </p>

<p> follow-up to the other and contained the same methodology and
</p>

<p> findings. </p>

<p> To determine DOJ's responsibilities and plans for
implementing the </p>

<p> federal grant program, we met with representatives of the
Office of </p>

<p> Justice Programs, DOJ. We held discussions and reviewed
documents </p>

<p> regarding their responsibilities and plans for implementing
the </p>

<p> federally supported drug court program. We also obtained drug
court </p>

<p> funding information from the Department of Health and Human
Services' </p>

<p> Center for Substance Abuse Treatment. </p>

<p> Our review was done from January 1995 to April 1995 in
accordance </p>

<p> with generally accepted government auditing standards. </p>

<p> AGENCY COMMENTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :3 </p>

<p> In April 1995, we provided a draft of this report for comment
to the </p>

<p> Attorney General and the Project Director of the Drug Court
Resource </p>

<p> Center. </p>

<p> On April 21, 1995, we discussed the report with the Project
Director </p>

<p> of the Drug Court Resource Center. On May 5, 1995, we also
discussed </p>

<p> the report with the Deputy Assistant Attorney General and
other </p>

<p> officials from DOJ's Office of Justice Programs. These
officials </p>

<p> generally agreed with the information presented in the report
and </p>

<p> provided comments that we incorporated as appropriate. </p>

<p> DOJ officials said the report was positive, informative, and
will be </p>

<p> helpful to drug court professionals. They explained that
there is no </p>

<p> universal model for drug courts, and as a result, each drug
court </p>

<p> operates differently due to local needs and conditions.
Similarly, </p>

<p> the Project Director of the Drug Court Resource Center said
that the </p>

<p> information presented in the report was comprehensive,
accurate, and </p>

<p> objective. </p>

Letter </p>

<p> TYPES OF DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :4 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> In the late 1980s, state and local criminal courts were
inundated </p>

<p> with drug cases. One response to this challenge was the
creation of </p>

<p> drug courts, a relatively recent grassroots movement to deal
with </p>

<p> drug-related crime and drug-using defendants. </p>

<p> According to DOJ, two main types of drug courts have evolved,
those </p>

<p> that (1) expedite the processing of drug cases and (2) use </p>

<p> court-monitored drug treatment to attempt to achieve changes
in </p>

<p> defendants' drug-using behavior. In addition, some drug
courts </p>

<p> combine these two types. </p>

<p> The 1994 Crime Act authorizes grants for those drug courts
that have </p>

<p> programs offering court supervised drug treatment. The act
does not </p>

<p> authorize grants for courts designed solely to expedite the </p>

<p> processing of drug cases. This briefing report provides
information </p>

<p> on drug treatment courts. </p>

<p> Courts offering court-monitored drug treatment are referred
to as </p>

<p> &quot;drug treatment courts&quot; or simply &quot;drug
courts.&quot; Although there is no </p>

<p> standard definition applicable to drug treatment courts, the
National </p>

<p> Association of Drug Court Professionals\3 defines them as
follows: </p>

<p> &quot;A Drug Court is a special court given the
responsibility to </p>

<p> handle cases involving less serious drug using-offenders
through </p>

<p> a supervision and treatment program. These programs include </p>

<p> frequent drug testing, judicial and probation supervision,
drug </p>

<p> counseling, treatment, educational opportunities, and the use
of </p>

<p> sanctions and incentives.&quot; </p>

<p> One of the first drug courts to employ drug treatment as an
integral </p>

<p> part of the processing of drug felonies is located in Dade
County </p>

<p> (Miami), FL, and began operations in June 1989. This court
became a </p>

<p> model for other jurisdictions that implemented drug courts. </p>

<p> Although drug courts share certain common elements such as </p>

<p> court-monitored treatment, the courts are uniquely designed
to meet </p>

<p> local needs and can vary considerably in the way they
operate. </p>

<p> Organizationally, drug courts generally are distinct parts of
trial </p>

<p> courts. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \3 This is the principal organization of professionals
involved in </p>

<p> the development of treatment-oriented drug courts. Its
members </p>

<p> include judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment
service </p>

<p> providers, educators, researchers, and community leaders. </p>

<p> DRUG COURT APPROACHES </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :5 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> DRUG COURT APPROACHES </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :5.1 </p>

<p> According to a report provided by the Drug Court Resource
Center, </p>

<p> drug courts have generally taken two approaches to processing
cases: </p>

<p> (1) deferred prosecution and (2) postadjudication. In the
deferred </p>

<p> prosecution approach, shortly after being charged, defendants
waive </p>

<p> their right to a speedy trial and enter a treatment program. </p>

<p> Defendants who fail to complete the treatment program have
their </p>

<p> charges adjudicated. Defendants who complete the treatment
program </p>

<p> are not prosecuted further or have their charges dismissed.
This </p>

<p> approach is intended to capitalize on the trauma of arrest
and offers </p>

<p> defendants the opportunity to obtain treatment and avoid the </p>

<p> possibility of a felony conviction. </p>

<p> In the postadjudication approach, defendants are tried and
convicted, </p>

<p> but their sentences are deferred or pronounced and
incarceration is </p>

<p> suspended until they complete or withdraw from the treatment
program. </p>

<p> This approach provides an incentive for the defendant to
rehabilitate </p>

<p> because progress toward rehabilitation is factored into the </p>

<p> sentencing determination. </p>

<p> Appendix I presents examples of how cases are processed under
the two </p>

<p> drug court approaches. </p>

<p> PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY </p>

<p> CRITERIA </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :6 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY </p>

<p> CRITERIA </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :6.1 </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center, drug courts
generally </p>

<p> accept defendants with substance abuse problems who are
currently </p>

<p> charged with drug possession and/or other nonviolent offenses
such as </p>

<p> property crimes. Some drug courts accept defendants who have
prior </p>

<p> convictions, and others do not. </p>

<p> The Project Director of the Drug Court Resource Center also
pointed </p>

<p> out that drug courts do not accept defendants currently
charged with </p>

<p> a violent offense. The Project Director further commented
that most </p>

<p> drug courts do not accept defendants with prior violent
offenses. </p>

<p> However, at least one drug court accepts defendants
regardless of </p>

<p> prior offenses possibly including defendants with prior
convictions </p>

<p> for violent crimes. Under the 1994 Crime Act, federal grants
cannot </p>

<p> be awarded to any drug court that allows either current or
past </p>

<p> violent offenders to participate in its program. </p>

<p> DRUG COURT PLAYERS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :7 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> DRUG COURT PLAYERS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :7.1 </p>

<p> According to a DOJ-funded report on the first national drug
court </p>

<p> conference,\4 judicial leadership is the foundation on which
the </p>

<p> overall drug court approach is most often built. A
jurisdiction's </p>

<p> trial court provides the leadership, authority, and
management </p>

<p> capacity to enable the drug court to operate. The drug court
is </p>

<p> headed by a judge whose role is generally expanded beyond
normal </p>

<p> court duties to include active involvement in monitoring the
status </p>

<p> of defendants in the treatment program. The judge's duties
may </p>

<p> include conducting hearings, reviewing treatment progress
reports, </p>

<p> issuing bench warrants, and deciding who may enter the
program and </p>

<p> who should be terminated considering recommendations of
prosecutors, </p>

<p> public defenders, and treatment providers. </p>

<p> The judiciary alone, however, cannot successfully implement
and </p>

<p> operate a drug court, according to the conference report.
Rather, a </p>

<p> drug court requires a special collaborative effort among
judges, </p>

<p> prosecutors, defense attorneys, and related criminal justice
agencies </p>

<p> along with treatment providers and other social services and </p>

<p> community organizations. This collaborative effort is based
on local </p>

<p> needs and the targeted population being served and may differ
</p>

<p> considerably among drug courts. </p>

<p> Specifically, drug courts create new and different roles for </p>

<p> prosecutors and defense attorneys. In most drug courts these
players </p>

<p> are not adversaries in the traditional sense but rather are
to work </p>

<p> in concert with the court for the sole purpose of helping
defendants </p>

<p> become drug free. This nonadversarial role is significant
because </p>

<p> the court does not arbitrate in the usual fashion and has the
</p>

<p> opportunity to address addiction-related issues. Further,
drug </p>

<p> courts place the defendant in the unique role of being held
publicly </p>

<p> accountable for his or her actions. </p>

<p> COMMON ELEMENTS OF DRUG COURT </p>

<p> PROGRAMS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :8 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> COMMON ELEMENTS OF DRUG </p>

<p> COURT PROGRAMS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :8.1 </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center, in most drug
courts, </p>

<p> treatment is designed to usually last at least 1 year and is </p>

<p> administered on an outpatient basis with limited inpatient
treatment </p>

<p> as needed to address special detoxification or relapse
situations.\5 </p>

<p> These courts operate with the philosophy that because drug
addiction </p>

<p> is a disease relapses can occur, and that the court must
respond with </p>

<p> progressive sanctions and/or enhance treatment rather than </p>

<p> immediately terminate a participant. </p>

<p> The central element of all drug court programs is attendance
at the </p>

<p> regularly scheduled status hearings at which the drug court
judge </p>

<p> monitors the progress of participants. Monitoring is based on
</p>

<p> treatment provider reports on urine test results that detect
drug </p>

<p> use, attendance at counseling, etc. The judge reinforces
progress </p>

<p> and addresses noncompliance with program requirements. The
primary </p>

<p> objective of the status hearing is to keep the defendant in </p>

<p> treatment. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \5 These programs recognize that some individuals will
require a </p>

<p> longer period to complete the program. </p>

<p> PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :9 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :9.1 </p>

<p> Overall, according to the Drug Court Resource Center,
treatment </p>

<p> program requirements are more demanding than the applicable
sanction </p>

<p> received through traditional adjudication. Most drug court
programs </p>

<p> require that defendants attend status hearings, participate
in </p>

<p> counseling sessions, and submit to urine tests with the goal
of </p>

<p> becoming drug free. Some programs focus on special classes of
</p>

<p> defendants such as women. Many programs also provide support </p>

<p> services such as public health services; assistance with
housing, </p>

<p> food, and child care; vocational training; and job placement.
</p>

<p> TREATMENT PHASES </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :10 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> TREATMENT PHASES </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :10.1 </p>

<p> Treatment services are generally divided into three phases:
(1) </p>

<p> detoxification, (2) stabilization, and (3) aftercare. First,
the </p>

<p> defendant's physical dependence on drugs is eliminated
through </p>

<p> detoxification. Acupuncture is sometimes used as an adjunct
to </p>

<p> treatment in the detoxification phase. According to the
Project </p>

<p> Director of the Drug Court Resource Center, 9 of 20 drug
courts </p>

<p> responding to the Center's 1994 survey indicated that they
used </p>

<p> acupuncture. Second, the defendant's psychological craving
for the </p>

<p> drugs is treated during stabilization. Frequent group and/or </p>

<p> individual counseling sessions are employed during this
phase. And </p>

<p> third, aftercare focuses on helping the defendant obtain
education or </p>

<p> job training, find a job, and remain drug free. </p>

<p> PROGRAM SANCTIONS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :11 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PROGRAM SANCTIONS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :11.1 </p>

<p> Sanctions for failing to abide by program rules can include
(1) </p>

<p> verbal admonition from the judge; (2) demotion to an earlier
stage of </p>

<p> the program; (3) incarceration for several days or weeks,
increasing </p>

<p> with the number and severity of the violations; and (4) more
frequent </p>

<p> status hearings, treatment sessions, or urine tests. Many
programs </p>

<p> also use graduated sanctions, increasing the severity of the
sanction </p>

<p> with subsequent violations of program rules. </p>

<p> DOJ also pointed out that most drug courts use sanctions not
to </p>

<p> simply punish inappropriate behavior but to augment the
treatment </p>

<p> process. For example, many drug courts will place a defendant
in </p>

<p> residential treatment if he or she is unable to achieve
satisfactory </p>

<p> progress in an outpatient setting. In addition, many drug
courts </p>

<p> incarcerate defendants for the purpose of detoxification
rather than </p>

<p> detain them for inappropriate behavior. </p>

<p> REASONS FOR TERMINATING </p>

<p> DEFENDANTS FROM THE PROGRAM </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :12 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> REASONS FOR TERMINATING </p>

<p> DEFENDANTS FROM THE PROGRAM </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :12.1 </p>

<p> Drug courts use various criteria for ending a defendant's </p>

<p> participation in the program before completion. These may
include a </p>

<p> new felony offense; multiple failures to comply with program </p>

<p> requirements, such as not attending status hearings or
treatment </p>

<p> sessions; and a pattern of positive urine tests. According to
DOJ, </p>

<p> many drug courts do not terminate defendants for a new drug </p>

<p> possession offense. </p>

<p> Before terminating a defendant for continuing to use drugs,
drug </p>

<p> courts will use an array of treatment services and available </p>

<p> sanctions. There are no uniform standards for the number of
failed </p>

<p> urine tests and failures to attend treatment sessions that
result in </p>

<p> a participant being terminated that apply to all programs.
Each drug </p>

<p> court sets its own standards. Relapses are expected and the
extent </p>

<p> to which noncompliance results in terminations varies from
program to </p>

<p> program. </p>

<p> Generally, the drug court judge makes the decision to
terminate, but </p>

<p> the prosecutor or treatment provider can recommend the
termination. </p>

<p> Once a defendant is terminated, he or she will be referred
for </p>

<p> adjudication or sentencing. </p>

<p> PROGRAM GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :13 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PROGRAM GRADUATION </p>

<p> REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :13.1 </p>

<p> Drug courts typically require defendants to complete a
treatment </p>

<p> program in order to graduate. Some impose other conditions </p>

<p> defendants must meet after treatment. These could include
remaining </p>

<p> drug free and not being arrested for a specified period of
time, </p>

<p> paying restitution, being employed full-time, or performing
community </p>

<p> service. </p>

<p> For example, the Seattle, WA, drug court requires that a
defendant </p>

<p> complete all phases of the program to graduate. However, the </p>

<p> Beaumont, TX, drug court requires that, in addition to
completing the </p>

<p> treatment program, the defendant maintain sobriety for a
specified </p>

<p> time and participate in education and vocational training
and/or be </p>

<p> working full-time. </p>

<p> EFFECTS OF PROGRAM GRADUATION </p>

<p> ON CASE OUTCOME </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :14 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> EFFECTS OF PROGRAM </p>

<p> GRADUATION ON CASE OUTCOME </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :14.1 </p>

<p> In many jurisdictions, completion of the drug court program
leads to </p>

<p> a dismissal of charges or cessation of prosecution. In
others, the </p>

<p> guilty plea can be stricken, the defendant can be sentenced
to </p>

<p> probation in lieu of incarceration, or the defendant's
probation can </p>

<p> be shortened. </p>

<p> DOJ pointed out that some drug courts will seal all case
records, </p>

<p> including arrests, when defendants complete the program. The
sealing </p>

<p> of records is particularly significant when attempting to
measure the </p>

<p> impact of drug court programs at a later date. </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :15.1 </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center, as of March
1995, there </p>

<p> were at least 37 drug courts operating across the country.\6
Of these </p>

<p> drug courts, 29 had been fully operational for at least 9
months, and </p>

<p> 8 others had been operating for a lesser period. </p>

<p> The number of drug courts steadily increased from 1991 to
1994, with </p>

<p> substantial increases since 1993. As of March 1995, 24
jurisdictions </p>

<p> were developing drug courts. Another eight jurisdictions had </p>

<p> exhibited interest in starting drug courts by initiating
feasibility </p>

<p> studies. </p>

<p> Appendix II lists the number of drug courts in operation and
being </p>

<p> developed. </p>

<p> DRUG COURT PARTICIPANTS' </p>

<p> STATUS AS OF MARCH 1995 </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :17.1 </p>

<p> Data obtained from 33 of 37 drug courts responding to our </p>

<p> questionnaire showed that since inception of the first drug
court in </p>

<p> 1989, 20,421 persons have participated in drug courts. Of
these, </p>

<p> 7,235 participants have graduated, and 7,595 are currently in
the </p>

<p> programs. The remaining participants did not complete the
programs. </p>

<p> Generally, when participants do not complete drug court
programs it </p>

<p> is because they were terminated, voluntarily withdrew, or
died. </p>

<p> Based on the data received, these totaled 5,591.\7 </p>

<p> The number of participants currently in each of these drug
court </p>

<p> programs varied widely, ranging from a low of 1 participant
in Santa </p>

<p> Ana, CA, a new drug court,\8 to a high of 1,200 participants
in </p>

<p> Miami, FL, one of the oldest drug courts. The median number
of </p>

<p> participants in these drug court programs is 105. </p>

<p> It should be noted that many of the drug courts have been
operating </p>

<p> for less than a year and would not yet have graduates. As
shown, </p>

<p> more than one-third of the total participants are currently
enrolled </p>

<p> in drug court programs. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \7 We calculated the number (5,591) of participants not
completing </p>

<p> the programs by subtracting the number (7,235) of graduates
and the </p>

<p> number (7,595) of participants currently in the programs from
the </p>

<p> total number (20,421) of participants in the programs since
their </p>

<p> inception. </p>

<p> bankruptcy and curtailed resources for its drug court. </p>

<p> FUNDING SOURCES </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :18 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center Project Director,
drug </p>

<p> courts generally piece together funding from a variety of
sources. </p>

<p> Information reported to the Drug Court Resource Center by 15
drug </p>

<p> courts showed that these sources included local taxes and
surcharges, </p>

<p> state alcohol and drug agency funds, private foundation
monies, </p>

<p> participant fees, and federal grants. </p>

<p> Some drug courts have developed innovative funding
approaches. For </p>

<p> example, a drug court judge from Orange County, CA, told us
that when </p>

<p> the county filed for bankruptcy, it cut back services
necessary for </p>

<p> the drug court operation. The judge said that he was forming
a </p>

<p> nonprofit corporation to try to provide funding for the drug
court </p>

<p> outside of the bankruptcy proceedings. </p>

<p> Until the 1994 Crime Act, there was no federal grant program </p>

<p> specifically designed for drug courts. However, some drug
courts </p>

<p> have received federal grants and technical assistance from
the </p>

<p> Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Substance
Abuse </p>

<p> Treatment (CSAT) and DOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance
(BJA). </p>

<p> According to CSAT, it has provided or plans to provide an
estimated </p>

<p> $15 million in assistance to some drug courts. Of the $15
million, </p>

<p> about $6 million is for a drug court demonstration project
for the </p>

<p> District of Columbia Superior Court. </p>

<p> BJA could not provide us with complete information on DOJ
grants used </p>

<p> in support of drug courts. According to a BJA official,
&quot;drug </p>

<p> courts&quot; was not a specific grant category that grantees
could </p>

<p> designate for funding. However, this official commented that
BJA is </p>

<p> aware that DOJ grant funds provided under other grant
categories such </p>

<p> as &quot;corrections options&quot; have been used in support
of drug courts, </p>

<p> and that three drug courts had received $2.5 million from the
</p>

<p> Corrections Options program.\9 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PARTICIPANT FEES </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :19.1 </p>

<p> We obtained data (based on our questionnaire and information
provided </p>

<p> by the Drug Court Resource Center) from 34 drug courts on
fees </p>

<p> charged to participants in drug court programs. Twenty-three
of the </p>

<p> 34 drug courts reported that they charged fees, and 11
reported that </p>

<p> they did not. Insufficient data on fee amounts actually
collected </p>

<p> precluded us from determining the extent to which drug courts
relied </p>

<p> on participant fees as a funding source. </p>

<p> Of the 23 drug courts charging participant fees, the amounts
charged </p>

<p> for the total cost of treatment ranged from $20 to $2,500.
One drug </p>

<p> court reported charging fees on a sliding scale from $60 to
$300 for </p>

<p> treatment based on a defendant's ability to pay, while
another </p>

<p> reported charging on a sliding scale from $500 to $2,500. At
least </p>

<p> nine courts responded that they charged fees ranging from
$200 to </p>

<p> $350. </p>

<p> Several drug courts reported applying participant fees to
counseling </p>

<p> and treatment costs, drug testing costs, and other program
expenses. </p>

<p> In addition, DOJ commented that many treatment providers
believe </p>

<p> participant fees are a useful therapeutic tool and should be
charged </p>

<p> regardless of the extent to which fees are needed to cover
program </p>

<p> costs. </p>

<p> COST SAVINGS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :20 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> COST SAVINGS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :20.1 </p>

<p> Drug courts have reported information to the Drug Court
Resource </p>

<p> Center on savings that they believe their programs have
achieved in </p>

<p> the costs of court and other criminal justice system
operations. </p>

<p> One of the larger categories of savings reported by drug
courts was </p>

<p> jail costs avoided, i.e., the estimated costs of
incarcerating a </p>

<p> typical drug court defendant that would be expected to incur
if </p>

<p> he/she were not participating in a drug court program. One
court </p>

<p> estimated savings of $5,400 per drug court participant, and
another </p>

<p> estimated savings of $2,566 to $5,185. </p>

<p> Another drug court claimed a savings of $2 million over a
3-year </p>

<p> period resulting from drug court participants spending fewer
days in </p>

<p> custody and the consequent ability of the county to rent
unused jail </p>

<p> cells to other law enforcement agencies. Still another drug
court </p>

<p> estimated it had saved about $875,500 in jail costs for its
program </p>

<p> but did not specify the time frame. </p>

<p> The National Association of Drug Court Professionals noted
that drug </p>

<p> court programs are much less costly than the incarceration of
</p>

<p> drug-using offenders. The Association reported that
incarceration of </p>

<p> drug-using offenders ranges from $20,000 to $50,000 annually,
and the </p>

<p> cost to build a prison cell is $80,000 to $90,000. It also
said that </p>

<p> drug courts cost less than $1,500 annually for each offender.
</p>

<p> Some drug courts identified savings such as reduced caseloads
of </p>

<p> other trial judges not in the drug court program. In
addition, some </p>

<p> drug courts claimed savings in court-appointed attorney fees,
reduced </p>

<p> probation office caseloads, and costs of prosecution,
arrests, and </p>

<p> police overtime. </p>

<p> We did not verify this information, and further analysis of
all drug </p>

<p> court costs is essential to fully understanding the benefits
of these </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> DRUG COURTS </p>

==============================================================
Letter </p>

<p> DO DRUG COURTS MAKE A </p>

<p> DIFFERENCE? </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :21 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> In evaluating the effectiveness of drug courts, the basic
question </p>

<p> is: Do drug courts make a difference? Specifically, do
defendants </p>

<p> who successfully complete drug court programs exhibit reduced
</p>

<p> recidivism, decreased drug use, and other socially beneficial
effects </p>

<p> as a result of participating in drug court programs when
compared to </p>

<p> their counterparts, i.e., control groups who were not exposed
to the </p>

<p> same drug court treatment? </p>

<p> Based on evaluations we reviewed, drug courts generally may
have some </p>

<p> beneficial effects. However, because of the nature of the
study </p>

<p> designs and the short periods of time elapsed between
treatment and </p>

<p> measurement of outcomes (drug courts are relatively new),
firm </p>

<p> conclusions cannot be drawn about the effects of drug courts.
</p>

<p> It is both difficult and costly to conduct program
evaluations that </p>

<p> can measure program effects. Although the strongest design
involves </p>

<p> assembling and randomly assigning defendants to control
groups </p>

<p> (comparing drug courts versus traditional courts, for
example), such </p>

<p> studies raise serious logistical and ethical issues.
Additionally, </p>

<p> according to the Project Director of the Drug Court Resource
Center, </p>

<p> control groups cannot be used properly unless a drug court is
</p>

<p> originally designed to define such groups. </p>

<p> An alternative approach is to design studies allowing the
researcher </p>

<p> to create comparable groups from existing programs, through
the use </p>

<p> of various analytical techniques. However, even such studies
are </p>

<p> often made more difficult by the fact that existing programs
change </p>

<p> over time, resulting in individuals at the end of the study
period </p>

<p> being exposed to different treatments than those at the
beginning. </p>

<p> Also, different locations of the same program may have very
different </p>

<p> implementation needs, making it more difficult to compare
such </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> GAO ASSESSED DRUG COURT </p>

<p> EVALUATIONS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :22 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> We assessed six evaluations that compared performance
outcomes for </p>

<p> drug court defendants to the experiences of other defendants,
i.e., </p>

<p> previous divertees or unsuccessful drug court defendants or </p>

<p> defendants who had never been in a drug court. In order to
determine </p>

<p> whether a drug court has an impact on its participants, an
evaluation </p>

<p> should compare outcomes of drug court defendants to those of
other </p>

<p> groups of similar defendants who are not in drug courts. </p>

<p> The six evaluations covered five drug courts and varied
considerably </p>

<p> in terms of the study designs, types of outcomes measured,
and scope </p>

<p> of analyses performed on the available information. Our
assessment </p>

<p> indicates that the evaluations differed particularly in terms
of the </p>

<p> validity of the designs, which determine the extent to which
the </p>

<p> reader is able to draw conclusions from any findings. Of the
six </p>

<p> studies: </p>

<p> two studies had fairly strong designs; of these, one provided
some </p>

<p> evidence of an effect of the drug court program, and the
other </p>

<p> study's results were too preliminary to draw any conclusions;
</p>

<p> two studies had designs with more serious problems; of these,
one </p>

<p> suggested possible effects of the program, and the other was </p>

<p> inconclusive; and </p>

<p> two studies had design weaknesses that prevented any
conclusions </p>

<p> about the effects of the program. </p>

<p> The major outcome measure used, in five of the six
evaluations, was </p>

<p> recidivism (rearrest rates). To a lesser degree,
recidivism-related </p>

<p> measures were also used, such as length of time before
rearrest and </p>

<p> days spent in custody for felony offenses. We focused on
these </p>

<p> measures in this report because they provided the strongest
evidence </p>

<p> for the long-term effect of the drug court programs, even
though </p>

<p> other measures were used in these studies. </p>

<p> EVALUATION OUTCOMES </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :23 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> Two of the six evaluations were well-designed. However, the
results </p>

<p> in terms of recidivism outcomes were mixed. One of the
evaluations </p>

<p> showed that drug court defendants had significantly lower
rearrest </p>

<p> rates than defendants not in drug court, and that they spent
fewer </p>

<p> days in custody for felony offenses (app. III, evaluation 1).
This </p>

<p> evaluation also showed that drug court defendants had a lower
rate of </p>

<p> failures-to-appear for required court hearings than did other
</p>

<p> defendants. However, the other evaluation, with preliminary </p>

<p> information only, showed no significant difference so far in
rearrest </p>

<p> rates between drug court defendants and defendants who were
not in </p>

<p> the drug court (app. III, evaluation 2). </p>

<p> Although these evaluations have strong study designs and one </p>

<p> indicates some beneficial effects on defendants resulting
from the </p>

<p> drug court programs, the evidence does not permit firm
conclusions </p>

<p> about the effects of the drug courts studied. Additionally,
for one </p>

<p> of the evaluations, insufficient time had elapsed to provide
firmer </p>

<p> evidence of program effect. </p>

<p> Of the next two evaluations, both of the same drug court, one
</p>

<p> provided some suggestive evidence of program effect. It
showed lower </p>

<p> recidivism by drug court defendants and longer time before
rearrest </p>

<p> (app. III, evaluation 3). The other generally showed no
difference </p>

<p> in recidivism rates (app. III, evaluation 4). Design problems
made </p>

<p> it difficult to attribute these findings to the programs.
There are </p>

<p> too many potential differences between the drug court
participants </p>

<p> and the groups to which they were compared to develop strong </p>

<p> conclusions. </p>

<p> The final two evaluations did not provide reliable evidence </p>

<p> concerning the effects of the programs. One showed no
substantial </p>

<p> difference in recidivism between drug court defendants and
defendants </p>

<p> who left the drug court (app. III, evaluation 5). The other </p>

<p> evaluation measured defendants' drug abstinence and
failure-to-appear </p>

<p> rates and showed positive results for drug court defendants
as </p>

<p> compared to defendants terminated from the drug court (app.
III, </p>

<p> evaluation 6). Because the study design did not control for a
number </p>

<p> of factors, such as motivation and susceptibility to
treatment, these </p>

<p> evaluations do not permit conclusions to be drawn about the
effects </p>

<p> of the programs. </p>

<p> Appendix III contains further information on each of these </p>

<p> evaluations. </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> THE 1994 CRIME ACT </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :24.1 </p>

<p> Beginning in fiscal year 1995, DOJ may provide jurisdictions
with </p>

<p> drug court grants. Title V of the Violent Crime Control and
Law </p>

<p> Enforcement Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-322) authorizes the
Attorney </p>

<p> General to award discretionary drug court grants to states,
units of </p>

<p> local government, Indian tribal governments, and state and
local </p>

<p> courts. Grants may be awarded to drug court programs when a
judge </p>

<p> continuously supervises the progress of nonviolent offenders
with </p>

<p> substance abuse problems. </p>

<p> The act requires the Attorney General to issue regulations to
ensure </p>

<p> that jurisdictions receiving drug court grants to support
their </p>

<p> programs do not allow violent offenders to participate. It
defines a </p>

<p> violent offender as a person who is charged with or convicted
of an </p>

<p> offense involving a firearm, dangerous weapon, death, serious
bodily </p>

<p> injury, or force; or who has one or more prior convictions
for a </p>

<p> violent felony crime. </p>

<p> Drug court programs must also integrate a number of judicial </p>

<p> sanctions and treatment services. Specifically, the act
requires </p>

<p> programs to include (1) mandatory periodic testing for the
use of </p>

<p> addictive substances; (2) substance abuse treatment; (3)
diversion, </p>

<p> probation, or other supervised releases with the possibility
of </p>

<p> prosecution, confinement, or incarceration when participants
do not </p>

<p> comply with program requirements or fail to show satisfactory
</p>

<p> progress; and (4) program and aftercare services, such as
relapse </p>

<p> prevention, health care, education, vocational training, job </p>

<p> FEDERAL FUNDING FOR DRUG </p>

<p> COURTS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :25.1 </p>

<p> The 1994 Crime Act authorized a total of $1 billion for
fiscal years </p>

<p> 1995 through 2000 to support drug court programs. Although
the act </p>

<p> authorized $100 million for fiscal year 1995, DOJ's fiscal
year 1995 </p>

<p> Appropriations Act (Public Law 103-317) included only $29
million for </p>

<p> the drug court program. However, Congress has proposed fiscal
year </p>

<p> 1995 budget cuts for the drug court program. On March 16,
1995, the </p>

<p> House passed H.R. 1158, the Emergency Supplemental
Appropriations </p>

<p> Act of 1995, which rescinds $27.75 million for the drug court
</p>

<p> program. During its consideration of H.R. 1158, the Senate
reduced </p>

<p> the rescission to $17.1 million. On April 6, 1995, the Senate
passed </p>

<p> its version of the bill and requested a conference with the
House. </p>

<p> The House and Senate conferees began May 3, 1995, to try to
reconcile </p>

<p> the separate provisions of the bill. </p>

<p> The President's fiscal year 1996 budget requests $150 million
for </p>

<p> drug court grants. However, H.R. 667 (The Violent Crime </p>

<p> Incarceration Act of 1995) passed by the House of
Representatives on </p>

<p> February 10, 1995, would amend Title V of the 1994 Crime Act
and in </p>

<p> doing so would repeal the 1994 Crime Act's drug court
discretionary </p>

<p> grant provisions. On February 22, 1995, H.R. 667 was referred
to </p>

<p> the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. </p>

<p> DOJ'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR DRUG </p>

<p> COURTS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :26 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> DOJ recognizes that no single model exists for an effective
drug </p>

<p> court. Consequently, DOJ plans to maintain flexibility in
awarding </p>

<p> grants to programs that use a variety of approaches to
coordinate </p>

<p> drug treatment and persuade offenders to abstain from drugs
with the </p>

<p> goal of becoming drug free. In addition, given the great
diversity </p>

<p> in the structure and operation of state and local courts and
criminal </p>

<p> justice systems, DOJ plans to allow jurisdictions to tailor
local </p>

<p> initiatives to best suit their needs and local conditions. </p>

<p> DOJ's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) has overall
responsibility for </p>

<p> the new federal drug court program, including policy setting.
To </p>

<p> carry out this responsibility, OJP has hired an acting
director and </p>

<p> policy analyst to staff its Drug Court Program Office. In
addition, </p>

<p> BJA, an office of OJP, recently established a Drug Court
Program </p>

<p> Office to manage and monitor drug court program grants,
according to </p>

<p> an OJP official. BJA has hired four people to staff this
office. </p>

<p> Since November 1994, OJP and BJA staffs have worked together
to </p>

<p> develop program guidelines and application materials.\10 </p>

<p> Currently, these staffs are considering the most appropriate
and </p>

<p> effective ways of providing technical assistance to federally
</p>

<p> supported drug courts, operating drug courts, and related
federal </p>

<p> projects to be funded with other fiscal year 1995 resources.
The </p>

<p> level and source of funding to support this technical
assistance is </p>

<p> also under review. </p>

<p> OJP's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) is responsible for
funding </p>

<p> a national evaluation of drug court program impacts. This
evaluation </p>

<p> will assess whether federally supported drug court programs
have </p>

<p> helped their participants to break the cycle of substance
abuse and </p>

<p> crime. It will also assess the cost-effectiveness of these
programs. </p>

<p> NIJ is also responsible for ensuring that drug court programs
use </p>

<p> part of their grants to conduct process evaluations. These
are aimed </p>

<p> at determining, among other things, if the drug court is
achieving </p>

<p> its objectives, if it was implemented as originally intended,
and </p>

<p> whether major changes are appropriate. They will also examine
how </p>

<p> drug courts affect the rest of the court system and other
elements of </p>

<p> the criminal justice system. </p>

<p> If Congress does not rescind the fiscal year 1995
appropriation, DOJ </p>

<p> plans to award grants for planning, implementing, and
improving or </p>

<p> enhancing drug court programs. Eligible applicants may apply
only </p>

<p> for one type of grant. Assuming no rescission is enacted, of
the $29 </p>

<p> million appropriated for fiscal year 1995, DOJ plans to award
up to </p>

<p> 100 planning grants for not more than $35,000 each to
jurisdictions </p>

<p> interested in establishing drug courts, </p>

<p> 10 implementation grants for not more than $1 million each to
</p>

<p> jurisdictions that have identified their target populations
and </p>

<p> case processing procedures, </p>

<p> 3 additional implementation grants for not more than $2
million to </p>

<p> larger jurisdictions with populations exceeding 1 million,
and </p>

<p> 20 improvement and enhancement grants for not more than $1
million </p>

<p> to jurisdictions that have already established drug courts. </p>

<p> Federal grants for each drug court program will be 75 percent
of </p>

<p> program costs. The grantees will be required to provide cash
to fund </p>

<p> the remaining 25 percent. </p>

<p> Applications are due by May 23, 1995. Then, OJP and BJA
staffs will </p>

<p> focus on screening and processing qualified applications for </p>

<p> potential grant awards, pending final congressional action on
the </p>

<p> fiscal year 1995 budget rescission. If the current deadline
for </p>

<p> filing drug court applications does not change, the first
grants are </p>

<p> expected to be awarded in the summer of 1995. </p>

<p> FEDERALLY FUNDED DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :28 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> Evaluating effectiveness is a critical element of the federal
drug </p>

<p> court program. The 1994 Crime Act authorizes the Attorney
General to </p>

<p> carry out or make arrangements for evaluations of programs
that </p>

<p> receive discretionary program grants. The act also mandates
us to </p>

<p> study and assess the effectiveness and impact of these
discretionary </p>

<p> grants and report to the Congress by January 1, 1997. </p>

<p> OJP program guidelines require recipients of drug court
grants to </p>

<p> cooperate with a national evaluation team. The evaluation
will be </p>

<p> aimed at measuring program impact primarily through the use
of the </p>

<p> following criteria: </p>

<p> reduction in recidivism rates of program participants, </p>

<p> maintenance of acceptable treatment completion rates, </p>

<p> decreased participant drug use, and </p>

<p> maintenance of a cost-effective program. </p>

<p> NIJ is responsible for overseeing the national evaluation.
The </p>

<p> evaluation will focus on treatment and its impact and is
expected to </p>

<p> take at least 2 years to complete. At the time of our review,
NIJ </p>

<p> was developing the solicitation for proposals to conduct the </p>

<p> evaluation. </p>

<p> Program guidelines also require each drug court grant
recipient to </p>

<p> conduct process evaluations of their programs. For these </p>

<p> evaluations, grantees are expected to collect descriptive
information </p>

<p> on the role of drug court players, potential eligible
population, and </p>

<p> participant program characteristics. Grantees will also be
asked to </p>

<p> collect information on program procedures used to identify
and screen </p>

<p> eligible offenders, accept and assess offenders, respond to
relapses, </p>

<p> manage and monitor cases, and discharge and refer
participants. </p>

<p> OUTCOMES REPORTED IN AND GAO'S </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT OF EVALUATIONS OF FIVE </p>

<p> DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> =========================================================
Appendix III </p>

<p> EVALUATION 1: F.I.R.S.T. </p>

<p> OAKLAND </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:1 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.1 </p>

<p> Drug use defendants granted admission to a diversion program.
</p>

<p> Admission requirements changed during the course of the
study. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 110 defendants in a program with a similar
group of 110 </p>

<p> defendants in a different program a year earlier. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.3 </p>

<p> Drug court participants referred in January and February of
1991; </p>

<p> earlier group referred in January 1990 through March of 1990.
The </p>

<p> report contained a 3-year follow-up study. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Felony rearrests: Drug court defendants had a lower
average rate </p>

<p> of felony rearrests per defendants (0.75) than had previous
divertees </p>

<p> (1.33). </p>

<p> (2)Days in custody for felony offenses: Drug court
defendants, on </p>

<p> average, spent fewer days in custody per defendant (44) than
had </p>

<p> previous divertees (78). </p>

<p> (3)Bench warrants: Drug court defendants, on average, had
fewer </p>

<p> bench warrants issued for failures to appear at court
hearings (0.67) </p>

<p> than had previous divertees (1.1). </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.5 </p>

<p> There were some questions concerning the comparability of the
two </p>

<p> groups, as well as the eligibility requirements for the two
programs. </p>

<p> (The report stated that eligibility requirements were relaxed
for the </p>

<p> drug court program participants in order to obtain a broader
group </p>

<p> for comparative purposes.) In spite of these concerns, the
evaluation </p>

<p> suggested some fairly strong evidence of program success
after 3 </p>

<p> years. </p>

<p> EVALUATION 2: MARICOPA COUNTY </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:2 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.1 </p>

<p> Offenders sentenced to probation for first-time drug
possession </p>

<p> convictions. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.2 </p>

<p> Random assignment to four groups: </p>

<p> (1)No drug testing, frequent visits (n=approximately 154). </p>

<p> (2)Monthly random drug testing, occasional visits
(n=approximately </p>

<p> 154). </p>

<p> (3)Biweekly scheduled drug testing, limited visits
(n=approximately </p>

<p> 154). </p>

<p> (4)Drug court, with testing and treatment supervised by a
probation </p>

<p> officer (n=177). </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants in program between March 1992 and April 1993.
Current </p>

<p> data reported only preliminary findings after 6 months. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Rearrest rates: No statistically significant differences
(16.95 </p>

<p> percent for the drug court group vs. 15.37 percent for
others). </p>

<p> (2)Rates of technical probation violations: Drug court group
had </p>

<p> lower rates than those of others (7.9 percent vs. 11.9
percent). </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.5 </p>

<p> Although the evaluation design was quite strong, the results
were </p>

<p> preliminary; insufficient time had elapsed to provide a firm </p>

<p> indication of program effect. Future comparisons may be
complicated </p>

<p> by the fact that the drug court sample had lower rates of
reported </p>

<p> history of prior marijuana use. Otherwise, the control groups
</p>

<p> (groups 1-3) were quite similar to the drug court group
(group 4). </p>

<p> EVALUATION 3: DADE COUNTY </p>

<p> (GOLDKAMP AND WEILAND) </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:3 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.1 </p>

<p> Persons arrested for 2nd and 3rd degree drug-related
felonies. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.2 </p>

<p> Five key groups:\11 </p>

<p> (1)Persons admitted to drug court program (n=326). </p>

<p> (2)Sample of felony drug defendants in same period not
eligible </p>

<p> because of more serious drug-related offenses (n=199). </p>

<p> (3)Sample of nondrug felony defendants in same period
(n=185). </p>

<p> (4)Sample of felony drug defendants in period several years
earlier </p>

<p> (n=302). </p>

<p> (5)Sample of felony nondrug defendants in period several
years </p>

<p> earlier (n=536). </p>

<p> In addition, the evaluation compared persons completing the
drug </p>

<p> court program with those failing to complete. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \11 An additional sample of offenders could not reliably be
used as a </p>

<p> control group because they were exposed to the drug court
program. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants in groups 1-3 had charges filed in August 1990
and </p>

<p> September 1990. Charges for groups 4-5 were filed in the
summer of </p>

<p> 1987. Data report results after 18 month follow-up. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Rearrest rates: Drug court defendants were rearrested at a
</p>

<p> statistically significant lower rate (33 percent, vs. 40
percent to </p>

<p> 53 percent for other groups). </p>

<p> (2)Time before rearrest: Drug court defendants had
statistically </p>

<p> significant longer time before rearrest (median of 235 days,
vs. 52 </p>

<p> to 115 days for other groups). </p>

<p> (3)Rearrests and treatment completion: Rearrest rates were </p>

<p> associated with failure to complete the treatment program. </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.5 </p>

<p> The results suggested an effect of the program. However, the
study </p>

<p> design was unable to make the comparison with offenders in
the same </p>

<p> situation with similarly serious drug offenses; therefore,
the </p>

<p> results must be interpreted cautiously. In particular, the
drug </p>

<p> court sample had fewer prior arrests than had the other
comparison </p>

<p> groups, and the key group of felony drug defendants used for </p>

<p> comparative purposes were not eligible for the drug court
program </p>

<p> because of the seriousness of their charges or prior records.
</p>

<p> The comparisons between those completing and failing to
complete the </p>

<p> program must also be viewed with caution, due to possible </p>

<p> motivational and other differences between the groups. </p>

<p> In commenting on a draft of this report, DOJ officials noted
that </p>

<p> this study had a strong design with carefully drawn
comparison </p>

<p> groups. We agree that the study's design was generally
strong. </p>

<p> However, as we state in this report, there were some
potentially </p>

<p> important differences in prior arrest rates between the
groups, and </p>

<p> the study was not able to compare similarly situated drug
defendants </p>

<p> in a roughly similar time period. Therefore, as we noted, the
</p>

<p> study's results should be interpreted cautiously. </p>

<p> EVALUATION 4: DADE COUNTY </p>

<p> (SMITH, DAVIS AND GORETSKY) </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:4 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.1 </p>

<p> Defendants with no prior convictions charged with a drug
possession </p>

<p> offense, admitting to a drug problem for which they wanted
treatment. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 318 defendants assigned to the drug court with
a sample </p>

<p> of 99 narcotics cases in early 1988. In addition, a group of
drug </p>

<p> court defendants who were accepted into the drug court
program were </p>

<p> compared on rearrest rates. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants were assigned to the drug court in January 1990
through </p>

<p> March 1990. The comparison group was charged between January
1988 </p>

<p> and March 1988. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Rearrest rates: There was no statistically significant
difference </p>

<p> in the rate of felony rearrests after 1 year between those
assigned </p>

<p> to drug court (32 percent) and the comparison group of
defendants </p>

<p> charged 2 years earlier (33 percent). Those defendants
accepted by </p>

<p> the drug court did have lower rates of rearrest (15 percent),
but the </p>

<p> authors noted that these individuals constituted &quot;a
highly select </p>

<p> group . . . least disposed to commit new crimes.&quot; The
rearrest </p>

<p> results in this evaluation differed from those in the other </p>

<p> evaluation of Dade County (evaluation 3). </p>

<p> (2)Sentencing dispositions: There were statistically
significant </p>

<p> differences in dispositions between those assigned to drug
court and </p>

<p> the comparison group of earlier defendants. Those assigned to
drug </p>

<p> court were more likely not to face further prosecution and
less </p>

<p> likely to serve probation or short jail terms. </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.5 </p>

<p> There were concerns about the comparability of the
participants in </p>

<p> the various groups. In particular, the finding of lower
rearrest </p>

<p> rates for program participants should be viewed cautiously in
light </p>

<p> of the selectivity of admission to the program. As a result,
there </p>

<p> were strong reservations about the results reported. </p>

<p> DOJ officials, in commenting on a draft of this report,
indicated </p>

<p> that this study had several flaws. They pointed out that the
study </p>

<p> was done when this drug court was less than 10 months old.
They </p>

<p> further noted that information on successful drug court
participants </p>

<p> was not available for evaluation because the participants'
records </p>

<p> were sealed. We concur with these comments. </p>

<p> EVALUATION 5: BROWARD COUNTY </p>

<p> (TERRY) </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:5 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:5.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 392 defendants completing or remaining in the
drug </p>

<p> court program with 241 defendants not completing the drug
court </p>

<p> program. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:5.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants entered the program from July 1991 through June
1992. </p>

<p> Study results were reported for October 1993. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:5.0.4 </p>

<p> Rearrests: Persons remaining in the program committed
felonies at a </p>

<p> slightly lower rate than did those leaving the program (7.7
percent </p>

<p> vs. 12.0 percent). (Cases dismissed were not included in
these </p>

<p> comparisons.) No differences occurred in comparing the
proportions </p>

<p> having committed misdemeanors (4.1 percent for persons
remaining in </p>

<p> the program vs. 5.0 percent for those leaving the program). </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:5.0.5 </p>

<p> There was no adequate comparison group in this study from
which to </p>

<p> draw any conclusions about the effect of the program. </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:6.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 105 defendants graduating from the drug court
program </p>

<p> with 78 defendants who terminated unsuccessfully. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:6.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants entered the program on or before August 1, 1992,
and </p>

<p> graduated or terminated unsuccessfully on or before April 1,
1994. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:6.0.4 </p>

<p> Graduates had lower rates of bench warrants for failure to
appear, </p>

<p> went slightly longer before the first bench warrant was
issued, and </p>

<p> had a lower percentage of positive urine tests than those who
</p>

<p> terminated unsuccessfully. However, the report did not
indicate </p>

<p> whether these figures referred to prior histories or
follow-up </p>

<p> information after program completion. </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:6.0.5 </p>

<p> There was no adequate comparison group in this study from
which to </p>

<p> draw any conclusions about the effect of the program. </p>

<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a> </h3>

<p> Despite the demonstrated relationships between drug abuse and
crime, criminal justice agencies too seldom focus on reducing
drug abuse as a means of reducing the criminal activities of
drug-involved offenders. Yet evidence from the research
literature continues to accumulate, indicating that some drug
treatment programs have been successful in reducing recidivism.
Following an overview of pertinent research findings, this paper
outlines the elements of an effective strategy for treating
cocaine and heroin abusing offenders. </p>

<p> The interventions proposed in this paper grow out of the drug
abuse research literature, the authors' urban-based research, and
their clinical expcriencc with drug abuse treatment in
corrections. In addition, the suggested interventions emerge from
years of correctional outcome research which has assessed what
works, with whom, and under what circumstances. Although this
paper will focus on heroin and cocaine involved offenders, some
recommendations may apply to offenders who use other illicit
drugs. </p>

<h3><a name="ResearchFindings">Research findings</a> </h3>

<h4><a name="TheProblem">The problem </a></h4>

<p> Recent research provides amplc evidence that offender
populations are composed of large numbers of drug abusers-and
that drug-involved offenders commit substantial number-, of
undetected crimes. </p>

<p> <b>Very recent cocaine and heroin abusers constitute a
majority of the arrestees and inmates in jails and prisons in New
York City and some other jurisdictions.</b> </p>

<p> National surveys of jail and prison populations, smaller
self-report studies, and urine testing results indicate that
increasing proportions of offenders are users of drugs and that
cocaine use is increasing the most rapidly. More than
three-quarters of the nation's inmates and almost all inmates in
New York City report illicit drug use.' Similarly, sclf-rcport
studies among prison and jail inmates in California, Michigan,
and Texas reveal that approximately half are heroin users and
many are daily heroin users.' Recent urinalysis-based studies of
arrestees in Washington, D.C. reveal that well over half test
positive for at least one illicit drug and a quarter test
positive for two or more illicit drugs, In a recent Manhattan
study the level of co caine use had doubled .;ince 1984.
Eighty-three percent of arrestees in September and October 1986
tested positive for cocaine, compared with 42 percent in 1984;
the increase in cocaine was found at all age levels and for all
offenses. Comparable increases have also been reported in
Washington, DC. </p>

<p> <b>Frequent users of heroin and cocaine in the general
population exhibit </b>a <b>multiproblem lifestyle that may
include a pattern of persistent criminal behavior.</b> </p>

<p> Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing condition that is part
of a complex multiproblem lifestyle which is highly resistant to
rehabilitation. Several studies show that daily or near daily
heroin users-many of whom also use other illicit substances
daily-are not in treatment, and do not seek treatment. Many also
consume alcohol heavily. They average over 200 non-drug crimcs
and hundreds of drug distribution offenses annually, yet are
unlikely to be arrested more than once a year, and then spend
less than a month in incarceration, The majority commit many
crimes for which they are not arrested or incarcerated, but
because of sheer volume of activity, they still have many more
arrests and incarceration periods than non-drug offenders. Over
half their generally modest income comes from drug distribution
activities. They usually spend most of that income on drugs.
Daily heroin abusers also generally do not have a residence nor
make their own meals, but rather stay and eat with a relative or
friend. They do not receive or seek public assistance. They have
no legal employment during a typical week nor do they seek any.
Thus, they are typically an economic burden on the poorest
members of their low-income communities. Many aspects of their
lifestyle also put them at high risk for violence and many other
social and health problems such as AIDS, alcoholism, and TB.
Therefore, whatever treatment programming is applied to this
population, it must contend with all or most of these problems if
it is to achieve long-term changes in this lifestyle.' </p>

<p> Data about chronic cocaine users' crime rates are not as well
developed. Recent evidence from street and treatment setting
interviews with crack users indicate that about 60 percent admit
paying for their cocaine with money derived from illicit
sources-ranging from drug dealing and prostitution to theft and
robbery. The persons using cocaine, however, generally come from
more varied socioeconomic backgrounds than heroin users, their
lifestyles vary accordingly, and many do not ever get arrested.
Nevertheless, the lifestyles of cocaine abusers who do become
involved with the criminal justice system appear to be very
similar to those of heroin abusers, as cocaine users often also
use heroin. </p>

<h4><a name="CriminalJusticeResponse">The criminal justice
response </a></h4>

<p> While much remains to be learned about the precise nature of
the links betnveen doing drugs and doing crime, the two behaviors
are clearly associated. Yet criminal justice agencies have few
strategies for routinely detecting and intervening in the drug
use of arrested heroin and cocaine abusers. The justice system
focuses almost exclusively on its criminal processing functions
of arrest, adjudication, probation, incarceration, and parole.
Even these interventions often represent a limited intrusion on
the criminal activities of the drug abusing offender. </p>

<p> <b>Criminal justice agencies, with rare exceptions, do not
seek or use information about the drug use of persons who are
arrested or convicted of crimes.</b> </p>

<p> Littlc cffort is made to identify drug abusers, to record
information about their drug use, to provide treatment (other
than dctoxification) while in jail or prison, to refer them to
treatment programs in the community, or to use such information
in plea bargaining or case dispositions (where legally
appropriate). <b>Only </b>a few jurisdictions maintain any
information about the drug use of arrestees or convicted
offenders, and there is a strong likelihood that the drug
information in their records is both incomplete and inaccurate
because it is most often based on self-report and not
substantiated through urinalysis. Thus, information that could
help inform criminal justice processing is not generally
available.' </p>

<p> <b>To the extent that criminal sanctions are applied, their
ability to interrupt the life style of the vast majority of
cocainc-heroin abusers is minimal.</b> </p>

<p> Nationally, only a low percentage (less than 10 percent) of
all felony arrests lead to a felony conviction resulting in
incarceration. Over half of all felony arrests (60 percent in
Manhattan) lead to conviction, but there is much variation by
jurisdiction. Typically, offenders plead guilty to lesser charges
and are sentenced to time served, a fine, community service,
probation, or a few months in jail. Consequently, the vast
majority of offenders, mainly those arrested on less severe
felony and misdemeanor charges, are at liberty within three
months after arrest. In addition, many felony offenders (a
significant portion of whom are involved with drugs) are at
liberty on bail or on personal recognizance while awaiting trial.
Active heroin-cocaine users have higher failure-to-appear rates
and much higher rates of rearrest while out on bail than
offenders not involved with drugs.9 </p>

<h4><a name="EfficacyofCriminalSanctions">The efficacy of
criminal sanctions </a></h4>

<p> Little evidence is available that criminal justice sanctions
alone are as effective as drug treatment in reducing the drug use
and criminality of cocaineheroin abusers at liberty. The central
value of the criminal process may lie in the leverage that can be
exerted to bring hardcore drug abusers into treatment. </p>

<p> <b>Existing evidence does not show that criminal justice
sanctions (fine, probation, or parole, or length of time served)
reduce criminality or drug </b>use <b>more effectively than drug
treatment among cocaine-heroin abusers.</b> </p>

<p> It is not known whether or to what extent jail or prison time
alone suppresses post-incarceration criminality or cocaine-heroin
abuse among drug involved offenderq- The limited evidence
available suggests that two-thirds or <b>more </b>of arrested
heroin abusers return to heroin-cocaine use and their diverse
criminal patterns within three months after release from
detention. In contrast, several studies of drug treatment
outcomes with criminal justice clients (mainly probationers) show
substantial post-treatment reductions in both drug use and
criminality.10 Outpatient clients in methadone treatment report
less than half as much criminal activity as heroin abusers not in
treatment. Compared with their pretreatment criminality,
methadone clients report 50 to 80 percent less crime during
treatment.&quot; Even among those who continue criminal activity
during treatment, methadone clients report reduced involvement in
serious crimes such as robbery, burglary, or dealing of heroin or
cocaine; they report mainly low-level property crimes, con games,
and sale of marijuana or pills.&quot; </p>

<p> Residential drug programs have sizable proportions
(frequently over half) of clients who are on probation or parole
or under related <b>legal </b>pressure, and whose criminality is
near zero while in the residential program. This nearzero
criminality of cocaine-heroin abusers while in residential
programs is documented for therapeutic communities in several
cities. A study of treatment facilities in New York found that
about a third of residential clients were criminal justice
referrals and had extensive criminal histories. These clients
tended to stay longer and have as good or better outcomes than
clients with similar pretreatment criminal and drug abuse
histories who were not referred by the criminal justice system.
13 </p>

<p> <b>The coercive power, surveillance potential, and time
offcmd through criminal justice sanctions, open significant
opportunities for effectively treating cocaine-heroin abusers.</b>
</p>

<p> Although criminal justice sanctions alone may have uncertain
value in reducing the criminality of drug involved offenders,
those sanctions can serve a powerful role by facilitating
effective drug treatment. There are a variety of pressures that
bring hardcore drug abusers into treatment: parents, employers,
loved one, and friends may all apply psychological and social
pressures. The most powerful pressure, however, may be the threat
of legal sanction -- the threat of arrest and conviction, and
most importantly, the threat of incarceration. The leverage
created by this threat, and by the sanction itself, permits
treatment to be considered as a viable option by serious abusers.
Moreover, by reducing early program termination, it allows the
treatment and aftercare to continue for the length of the
permissable custody. </p>

<p> Cocaine-heroin abusers typically wish to avoid the
&quot;hassles&quot; associated with changing their lives. When
the alternative is lengthy incarceration, cocaine-heroin abusers
may be more willing to be referred to drug treatment. If,
however, the alternative is a short sentence, detainees and jail
inmates may prefer the incarceration rather than diversion to
long-term drug abuse treatment. </p>

<p> Unfortunately, relatively few offenders voluntarily seek
treatment. Many offenders are referred by the criminal justice
system to drug treatment as the result of negotiated plea
bargains in which the offender agrees to enter treatment instead
of receiving a substantial sentece. For many years TASC
(Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime) has operated in selected
jurisdictions to recruit clients and negotiate with court staff
for release of offenders to drug programs. TASC clients are more
likely to select treatment because the alternative is considered
more onerous. </p>

<p> Few cocaine-heroin abusers in custody volunteer for drug
treatment unless the treatment program is seen as an attractive
alternative. Prison inmates seek out in-house treatment programs
because they often provide better living conditions, a safer
environment, parole release considerations, and an opportunity to
possibly change one's lifestyle. In-prison programs that offer
such conditions are substantially better able to recruit
participants than those which do not. Although these offenders
may not be completely sincere at admission, there is an
opportunity for the program to engage them in an effective
treatment experience. In short, the threat of substantial
sanctions (for arrestees) or the promise of better in-prison
conditions (for those in custody) can operate as extremely useful
incentives for treatment. Nevertheless, it must be understood
that a significant portion of offenders who have long chronic
heroin or cocaine abuse patterns will not want treatment under
any circumstances. </p>

<h4><a name="Somedimensions">Some dimensions of effective drug
abuse treatment.</a> </h4>

<p> As the preceding section has demonstrated, the criminality of
heroin abusers is substantially reduced while they are receiving
some form of treatment. The experiences of effective programs
suggest that whatever treatment method is used must have a sound
theoretical and empirical basis for its implementation.
Additionally, the treatment method must emerge from a powerful
social restoration tradition (discussed further below) that is
capable of teaching offenders to interact with others in less
deviant, more socially acceptable ways. Such an approach must be
credible to participants and not be perceived to be coercive and
authoritarian. The approach must have the capability to convince
offenders that the demanding path to a socially acceptable
lifestyle is worthwhile despite their deprived backgrounds, their
experience with quick criminal profits, and their recognition
that there is a low probability they will be caught for their
crimes. </p>

<p> <b>Despite the often cited conclusion that &quot;nothing
works&quot;, evidence from the research literature continues to
accumulate that some programs have been successful in reducing
recidivism.&quot;</b> </p>

<p> The majority of successful programs have been based on a
social learning theory of criminal behavior.&quot; According to
this theory, criminal behavior is learned through a process of
social interaction with others. Thus, pro-social behaviors must
be learned to replace deviant behavior. Effective approaches
include: therapeutic communities, self-help groups, family
therapy, contingency contracting, role playing and modeling,
vocational and social skills training, training in interpersonal
cognitive problem-solving skills, and other programs involving
ongoing peer monitoring of participants' behavior.&quot; </p>

<p> Successful programs have several things in common: authority
structures that clearly specify rules and sanctions,
anti-criminal modeling and reinforcement of pro-social behavior,
pragmatic personal and social problemsolving assistance, program
staff knowledgeable about the use of community resources, and
relationships between staff and clients which are empathic and
characterized by open communication and trust. Ex-offender-addict
counselors who serve as credible role-models of successful
rehabilitation also are often utilized.&quot; The &quot;Stay 'N
Out&quot; program (see Appendix A) provides an example of a
successful program that employs these treatment principles. </p>

<p> Conversely, unsuccessful programs are frequently based on a
medical (disease) model of criminology which suggests that
criminal behavior is a sickness.'9 <b>Similarly, </b>intervention
programs based on deterrence models (e.g., &quot;Scared
Straight&quot;) have shown very limited effects and have even
been associated with increased offending.&quot;' Other types of
programs that have been unsuccessful include those that rely
solely on open communication, &quot;friendship&quot; models,
inmate-directed therapy groups, and those that are
non-directive.,, </p>

<p> While inmate-dircctcd therapy groups have not had a record of
success, behavioral programs that are simply imposed-without
involving inmates in their development-do not appear to work
either. Such programs are often focused on anti-social rather
than pro-social behaviors and as a result give undue attention
and reinforcement to negative behavior. Other features of
unsuccessful programs include the failure to either neutralize or
utilize the inmate's peer group and failure to sustain continuity
of care after release from prison. 22 </p>

<p> A number of factors have been identified that degrade
treatment integrity23 and impede treatment success. Many are
common to intervention pro grams in any setting. The absence of
sound theoretical basis for treatment is a typical obstacle to
the development of successful programs. Often, the quality and
intensity of treatment interventions are inadequate. Sometimes
programs propose treatment interventions that are based on sound
principles which are not followed when the program is
implemented. Another common problem is lack of staff training and
treatment experience, and/or their inadequate commitment to.both
the clients' and program success. </p>

<p> Other impediments to the establishment and maintenance of
successful treatment programs are related to a lack of
correctional system support and the negative influence of inmate
subcultures. Fundamental differences between custodial and
treatment perspectives often contribute to the failure of the
correctional environment to support program staff and goals, The
lack of support from the custodial forces of an institution is
exacerbated within prisons by the negative influence of the
anti-authoritarian and antitherapeutic &quot;prisoners'
code.&quot; Under this code, suspicion colors most interactions
between staff and inmates. The result may be a program that
receives neither staff support nor inmate cooperation. </p>

<p> <b>Time in community drug treatment is inversely related to
posttreatment cocaine-heroin abuse and criminality.</b> </p>

<p> Turning to a more quantitative dimension of treatment
programming, the available research clearly suggests the longer
heroin and cocaine abusers remain in treatment, the greater the
reduction in post-treatment criminality. Those who remain in
community-based residential, methadone, or outpatient programs
for more than three months have lower levels of both
post-treatment heroin and cocaine abuse and criminality than
those who drop out before three months and significantly lower
rates than their own pre-treatment levels. Subsequent months of
treatment in these programs yield even greater reductions in
post-treatment criminality, especially after 12 months of
treatment and after each subsequent treatment cycle. </p>

<p> Treatment personnel generally agree that it is hard even to
stabilize the cocaine-heroin abuser's lifestyle in three months,
much less begin to transform long-standing patterns of deviance.
After three months, clients can begin to be comfortable with the
treatment regime and start to make progress in changing
disruptive patterns in their lives. However, due to the chronic
relapsing pattern characteristic of the drug addict, several
&quot;cycles of treatment&quot; are frequently necessary for
hardcore drug abusers to achieve substantial improvement in their
behavior and lifestyle. </p>

<p> Clients who leave treatment early against program advice are
significantly more likely to recidivate than those who complete
the recommended program, Early leavers who later return to
treatment ultimately have less heroin use and criminality than
those who fail to return.&quot; </p>

<p> Outcome studies have shown that the first 12 months in
treatment are critical to long-term reductions in criminality
after leaving treatment. For cocaine and heroin abusers who are
incarcerated <b>and </b>who participate in prison-based
therapeutic community programs, the optimum period of treatment
appears to be nine to twelve months followed by release into the
community. Longer stays are associated with diminishing results.
It is believed this occurs for two reasons: First, longer periods
of program participation while in prison creates increased
dependency on the program and less transference of the learned
experiences to the community upon release. Secondly, some persons
are transferred as rehabilitated back into the general prison
population after completing more than a year of treatment, and
the criminal subculture undermines some gains made during the
treatment period. Thus, the timing of treatment and release for
prison inmateswith serious drug abuse problems needs to be
coordinated to achieve the optimum outcome </p>

<h4><a name="Conclusion">Conclusion</a> </h4>

<p> Clearly, much has been learned about effective ways of
reducing the drug involvement of heroin and cocaine abusing
offenders. Given the chronic recurring nature of addiction, no
program can realistically expect to eliminate severe heroin and
cocaine abuse for all offenders. Yet even if a program succeeds
only in reducing the frequency of use, substantial reductions in
criminality may follow. The evidence is clear: cocaine-heroin
abusers commit much less crime when they use once or twice a week
or less often than when they use once a day or more often. If,
for example, daily cocaine-heroin users were placed under
court-directed intensive surveillance and frequent urine
monitoring which curtailed their use of drugs by half or more, a
very substantial drop in their criminality'. would be likely to
occur, especially in crimes such as robbery and burglary- </p>

<h3><a name="PolicyRecommendations">Policy recommendations </a> </h3>

<p> What steps should be taken by the criminal justice system to
deal more effectively with the drug-involved offender? Based on
the research findings discussed in the preceding section and the
experience and opinions of <b>the </b>authors, this section
presents a series of policy recommendations. While it may not be
possible to institute all or even most of these recommendations
in many jurisdictions, they are offered as goals or guidelines
for the practitioner. We argue that the interventions proposed
will improve the system by leading to the effective integration
and coordination of offender supervision and drug treatment
approaches. </p>

<p> Beginning with the crucial need to identify heroin and
cocaine abusers at arrest, the recommendations focus in turn on
jail-based interventions, inprison programs, and community
treatment options. Also included are systemwide recommendations
pertaining to the organization and staffing of drug abuse
treatment programs. All of the recommendations presented in this
;ection call for the criminal justice system to supervise
cocaine-heroin users frequently and systematically: </p>

<p>  Convicted cocaine-heroin abusers under community
supervision should be intensively supervised and compelled to
attend treatment for their maximum period of custody. Optimal
supervision includes near daily validation of employment, time in
residence, associations, and absence of drug use. </p>

<p>  Convicted cocainc-hcroin abusers sentenced to prison
should be required to participate in drug treatment for nine
months to one year prior to release <i>and </i>to continue in
community treatment as a condition of parole. Their urine and
behavior should be carefully monitored while under field
supervision to insure attendance and prevent relapses.&quot; </p>

<p>  Steps should be taken to ensure that drug-involved
offenders in city and county detention facilities are placed in
treatment after release, During their confinement, methadone
maintenance should be continued for addicts previously assigned
to this program or initiated for other heroin users. Naltrexone
combined with urine surveillance should be used for those heroin
users on work release who opt for drug-frcc treatment. </p>

<h4><a name="identification">The identification of drug-involved
offenders </a></h4>

<p> <b>In areas with a large number of heroin and cocaine users,
urinalysis should be used to identify these users at arrest.</b> </p>

<p> Most cocaine-heroin abusers who have contact with the
criminal justice system are arrested about once per year. Results
of the pretrial drug-testing program operating in Washington,
D.C. suggest that recent users of cocaine or heroin can be
identified accurately at arrest through urinalysis. By collccting
urine samples from all arrestees, and analyzing the specimens for
five types of drugs including opiates, the D.C. Pretrial Services
Agency has been able to identify and increase supervision of drug
users released pen-ding trial. These procedures appear to have
reduced the rates of rearrest and failure-to-appear. Moreover, by
systematically retaining the results of the urine tests, the
information has been made available to help determine appropriate
criminal sanctions for those arrestces ultimately
convicted.&quot; </p>

<p> The costs of a urine testing program may be amply justified
in any jurisdiction with a significant drug problem. As in D.C.,
the data collected should be systematically maintained and used
for determining conditions of pre-trial release and sanctions for
those convicted. In particular, the opportunity should be seized
to present appropriate treatment options. </p>

<h4><a name="jailbased">Jail-based interventions </a></h4>

<p> <b>Treatment orientation and referral to drug treatment
programs should </b>be <b>instituted </b>in <b>metropolitan
courts and jails.</b> </p>

<p> A central intake staff and/or representatives of drug
treatment programs should be present at court and in jails. All
offenders who test drug positive at arrest should be required to
attend orientation and preliminary intake procedures while in
detention. These preliminary treatment steps may help ensure that
those who are released from custody are placed in appropriate
treatment after returning to the community.&quot; </p>

<p> Full treatment interventions, however, should not be
initiated for cocaineheroin offenders who will be free of custody
in less than three months. It is neither cost effective nor
therapeutically wise to implement full treatment programming when
there is little expectation that treatment can be completed. </p>

<p> <b>Methadone programs should be permitted to maintain clients
in jails to facilitate resumption of treatment at the end of
detention.</b> </p>

<p> Methadone treatment has proven effective in reducing daily
heroin use and substantially reducing criminality among heroin
abusers. Enrolled methadone clients who are arrested can be
maintained on methadone while detained. In this way, return to
methadone treatment upon release after short-term jail custody
would be facilitated. Those who are convicted and sentenced to
incarceration should be given the option (when medically
recommended) to remain on methadone or to detoxify from methadone
and enter an in-prison therapeutic community. Consideration
should also be given to initiating methadone treatment in jails
for chronic heroin addicts. Heroin addicts serving short
sentences who arc introduced to methadone treatment while
incarcerated are more likely to enter and remain in methadone
maintenance treatment in the community when they are released
from custody. </p>

<p> <b>Daily naltrexone consumption should be used for some
convicted heroin abusers in combination with drug-free treatment
and intensive supervision.</b> </p>

<p> <i>For her-oin-abusing </i>offenders who receive jail or
probation sentences <i>and </i>who opt for drug-free treatment,
use of naltrexone (Trexan@), combined with urine surveillance,
could be instituted. Its use with jail inmates on work release or
school furlough appears particularly appropriate. Naltrexone is
an easily administered narcotic antagonist drug which taken daily
produces almost immediate withdrawal symptoms in addicts when
they use an opiatc, but is harmless to nonaddicts. It is most
effective with heroinaddicted offenders who have a high level of
community integration. It has no effect on cocaine, however;
therefore, urine monitoring <i>must be </i>sustained.'o </p>

<h4><a name="inprison">In-prison treatment </a></h4>

<p> <b>Therapeutic communities and other intensive milieu drug
treatments should be made available to cocaine-heroin abusing
state prisoners about one year prior to parole eligibility.</b> </p>

<p> A successful therapeutic community, the &quot;Stay 'N
Out&quot; program (see Appendix A), was developed at two
correctional facilities in New York Stateone for men and one for
women. This model therapeutic community in prison holds the
greatest promise for changing hard-core, drug-abusing inmates and
reducing recidivism.&quot; </p>

<p> Despite their proven effectiveness, few therapeutic
communities such as &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot; are in place for
criminally involved drug abusers. One of the factors that limits
the creation of additional programs of this type is the concern
that such programs might engage in activities that threaten
security and encourage inmate resistance to the correctional
system. Nonetheless, correctional administrators learn quickly as
they become exposed to the operation of well-run programs that
such undesirable variance can be avoided. In fact, in
institutions where most of these programs have been established,
the wardens and correctional officers frequently are their most
vocal champions. To encourage their development, however, staff
and administration need education and training. Further, a number
of fiscal and practical issues have to be addressed prior to
implementation- </p>

<p> <b>The implementation of prison-based treatment programs
requires isolation from the general prison population.</b> </p>

<p> The inimical influence of the criminal inmate subculture
(&quot;prisoners' code&quot;) will inevitably undermine any
attempts to establish viable programming if the program is not
isolated from this anti-therapeutic force. Separate living
quarters, recreation, food services, etc. should be maintained
within the institution for this separation to be ideally
effective. Total isolation is, however, neither necessary nor
desirable; rather, some contact with the general inmate
population is useful for the purpose of allowing the inmate in
treatment to see where he has come from and how much he has
changed. In addition, the contact experience provides the
opportunity for the program resident to test both his new
prosocial values against the inmate subculture and his resistance
to negative influences. This kind of isolation is most possible
in medium security institutions with dormitorytype housing space
where one dormitory or two are physically segregated or separable
from the main institution. </p>

<p> <b>Prisoners in therapeutic communities who make good
treatment progress should be paroled to residential drug-free
programs that sustain the therapeutic community model prior to
completion of (heir sentence. They should be required to stay in
treatment as a condition of parole until their date of maximum
custody or until the program deems them recovered.</b> </p>

<p> It is essential for the successful treatment of
cocaine-heroin abuser offenders to maintain continuity-of-care
from the outset of treatment to termination of custody. While
there is benefit from prison treatment alone, these effects are
augmented and sustained by continuing that specific treat inent
in the community. </p>

<p> Ideally, release to the community facility would be
contingent on the progress made during in-prison treatment. Under
this incentive system, specific behaviors would be rewarded with
a specified number of restitution or release &quot;points&quot;
that might be administered as a form of &quot;good timc&quot;
system. Alternatively, prisoners might earn more favorable
conditions of confinement or higher status and associated program
privilege.-,. However it is administered, the basic notion is to
reinforce <b>the </b>desirability of pro-social behaviors. </p>

<h4><a name="community">Community treatment programs </a></h4>

<p> <b>Drug-abusing misdemennants should be considered for
communitybased sentencing alternatives.</b> </p>

<p> In lieu of confining drug-involved offenders in jails and
county penitentiaries, a range of intermediate sanctions should
be considered for heroin and cocaine abusers convicted of
misdemeanors. These might include house arrest with electronic
monitoring, intermittent sentences (e.g., weekend or evening
incarceration), TASC programs, or residence in a facility such as
a &quot;halfway in-halfway out&quot; center (a &quot;HiHo&quot;).
Again, in any of these alternatives offenders would ideally be
able to achieve release status more quickly by providing
drug-negative urine samples, routinely attending and
participating positively in treatment sessi ns, paying back their
victims, and providing evidence of prosocial activity.'2 </p>

<p> The community treatment resources available to support
intermediate sanctioning policies range from self-help groups
that meet once a week for a couple of hours to residential
facilities that provide 24 hour supervision and programming- At a
minimum, almost all communities have an Alcoholics Anonymous or
Narcotics Anonymous group that provides an context for recovering
substance abusers to meet, discuss day-to-day steps for
maintaining a drug free life, and participate in many different
types of social activities not involving alcohol or drugs.&quot;
Some communities provide drug treatment counseling through the
Department of Mental Health. And in many cities, recovering
substance-abusers operate group homes that use many of the same
principles of Alcoholics Anonymous or therapeutic communities
found in prison programs. </p>

<p> TASC programs run throughout the nation provide staff who are
familiar with the particular resources available for
drug-involved offenders in specific communities. And almost all
states have an agency that periodically determines the
availability of both private and public programs available for
drug treatment. <b>A </b>list of these agencies is available from
the National Association of State Drug and Alcohol Abuse
Directors, in Washington, DC </p>

<p> <b>Even if no other treatment is provided, heroin-cocaine
abusers who are on probation and parole should be required to
have frequent urine tests.</b> </p>

<p> Drug-abusing offenders on probation or parole who are in no
special treatment programs, as a minimum should be routinely
required to provide specimens for urinalysis over the entire
length of their probation or parole. At the outset the frequency
of urinalysis should be near daily, and decreascd as positive
progress warrants. The effective monitoring of urinalysis results
will help to interrupt relapse to daily heroin or cocaine use,
and, hence, high-rate criminality is likely to drop
substantially.&quot; When drug positive urines are detected,
offenders should be immediately confronted, clearly warned after
the first such incident, be required to enter treatment for
diagnosis and assessment after the second positive urine, and be
required to remain in treatment if relapse seems imminent or has
occurred. Refusal to enter treatment upon an affirmative
diagnosis should be considered a violation of release conditions.
</p>

<h4><a name="organization">Organization and staffing issues </a> </h4>

<p> <b>The integrity of the treatment programs for convicted
offenders must be maintained by developing structural safeguards
of independence and autonomy from correctional management.</b> </p>

<p> All too often well designed interventions operated by
competent and motivated agency and institutional staffs do not
succeed. Usually, the efforts arc not trusted by the criminal
justice clients, are overwhelmed by the difficulty of the
clients' problems, are weakened by inadequate funding and
institutional resistance, and are subject to high rates of staff
burnout and turnover. For a treatment program to last long enough
to make a substantial difference, it must maintain its own
integrity, ie., honesty and commitment to the treatment goals and
program participants. The staff must also have sufficient
independence and automony to deliver on their promises. </p>

<p> Treatment programs conducted by organizations independent of
(but closely linked to) corrections agencies are more likely to
maintain their integrity thz programs operated by correctional
staff within institutions or community corrections settings. This
suggests that an outside agency working in cooperation with or
under contract to the Department of Corrections may be the most
appropriate treatment organization. Management responsibility for
the rehabilitation program should be assigned to a team of
committed treatment professionals, as well as
ex-addict/ex-offender peer counselors, For this approach to work,
the power and authority of the treatment team should be
comparable to and complement the criminal justice authority. This
management group should be associated with and monitored by
respected professional self-help/therapeutic community
organizations, for example, Therapeutic Communities of America. </p>

<p> <b>Probation and parole officers should have their functions
divided into Surveillance Officers and Community 'fteatment Team
Leaders.</b> </p>

<p> For many years, correctional observers have debated the
wisdom of vesting probation and parole officers with the
potentially conflicting responsibilities of surveillance and
treatment. In the opinion of the authors, surveillance and
treatment functions of field supervision officers should be
separated to resolve the inherent conflicts and strengthen each
function. Essential to the effectiveness of the
treatment/counseling relationship is trust and confidentiality.
Persons tinder field supervision are unlikely to freely admit
criminal acts or drug use to someone in a position to return them
to prison for such violations. Therefore, surveillance and
rehabilitation responsibilities should be handled by staffs who
work separately but cooperatively to avoid role confusion for
both officer and offender. As the next recommendation suggests,
both types of officers should be augmented by carefully selected
exoffeiider-addicts who would serve as Monitors for the
Surveillance Officers and as Treatment Team staff for the
Community Treatment Team Leader. </p>

<p> The Treatment Team staff should rotate between working in
prison and the community to maintain continuity between the
rehabilitation efforts in both environments. For in-prison
programs, the objective of separating custodial and treatment
functions is satisfied by the organization discussed in the
preceding point. </p>

<p> <b>Former addict-offenders who have shown clear evidence of
prosocial change should have training and employment
opportunities, for example, as Monitors and Rntment Team members.</b>
</p>

<p> Large numbers of offenders who have been chronic
cocaine-heroin abusers are unable to gain and to keels legal
employment. Their background is so limited and so stigmatized
that legal employers are reluctant to employ them, and suspicious
after they do. Thus, even after making good treatment progress,
many offenders may still be unable to gain stable employment.
First, systematic skill development and training programs should
he providcd. Second, providing employment to ex-addict-offenders
within the treatment program itself is a valuable opportunity to
deal with this unemployment issue as well as cope with shortages
of field supervision personnel. </p>

<p> The employment of ex-addict-offenders in a variety of
progressively more responsible paraprofessional and professional
rolcs will help new monitoring and drug treatment systems
function effectively. They also will serve as role models to
offenders they supervise. The ex-addict offenders are the role
models (as in &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;) whose presence
demonstrates the realistic possibility of achieving successful
rehabilitation. Graduation from a drug treatment program,
evidence of successful integration into community life, and
additional training are prerequisites for the employment of
ex-addictoffenders as Monitors and Treatriient Team members. </p>

<h4><a name="Conclusion2">Conclusion</a> </h4>

<p> By substantially reducing their cocaine-heroin abuse, the
criminality of drug-involved offenders may be reduced by 20 to 50
percent or more. To do so, however, the criminal justice system
must develop an alliance with the drug treatment system geared to
achieve the goals of effective rehabilitation, enhanced prosocial
behavior, and reduced recidivism. </p>

<p> The difficulties inherent in bringing about this alliance
should not be minimizcd. Some reallocation of resources clearly
will be required, with all the tensions attendant on any
significant shift in funding and operational priorities. If
custodial and treatment functions are to be effectively
separated, recruitment, training, and retraining programs will
have to be developed for community corrections personnel.
Institutional corrections environments must be prepared to accept
independent treatment organizations. Procedures must be developed
to identify and train those therapeutic community graduates best
qualified to become competent treatment team members and
monitors. The problem of intensive community resistance to
accepting community treatment facilities (HiHo's) that house
felons and substance abusers must also be addressed. Within
prisons, space will have to be reallocated to create therapeutic
communities to house clients during treatment. If institutions
are converted for total therapeutic community utilization,
abandoned mental hospitals may be utilized, with significant
capital expenditures necessary for conversion. Beginning at the
point of arrest, screening procedures will have to be developed
to monitor drug use and to identify cocaine-heroin users who can
most benefit from the proposed interventions. </p>

<p> Perhaps most important, cooperation will be needed among
stable drug abuse agencies and drug treatment programs and
criminal justice organizations (courts, probation, corrections,
and parole) that traditionally have had competing political and
fiscal interests and often lack a history of successful Joint
ventures. Careful documentation of pilot results will also be
needed to evaluate whether the system is moving in desired or
unanticipated directions. For this, evaluation researchers will
have to be in place from the outset. Since many problems will
arise that have the potential for compromising the interventions,
the evaluation design must provide decision makers with timcly
information to assist them in formulating corrective actions. At
the same time, ongoing dissemination of outcome information
through professional and media channels will help foster and
maintain the support necessary to accomplish the changes
proposed. </p>

<h3><a name="AppendixA">Appendix A </a></h3>

<p> &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;: A model for prison-based drug
treatment </p>

<p> &quot;Stay 'N <b>Out&quot; </b>is a therapeutic community
(TC), in part based upon the Phoenix House model, that has been
operating in the New York State prison system for the last ten
years. Over time the program has been modified to operate more
effectively within the prison environment. The program has been
fortunate to be operated by many of the founding staff who have
provided the vision, commitment, and determination necessary for
a successful prison program. </p>

<p> An early evaluation of the &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot; program
indicated that it was successfully implemented, maintained a
positive TC environment, and produced positive psychological and
behavioral changes in participants. In 1984, the National
Institute <b>on </b>Drug Abuse funded an evaluation of &quot;Stay
'N Out&quot;, comparing it to two other prison-bascd programs in
New York State and a control group of inmates on program waiting
lists, but receiving no treatment. A milieu program and a
standard counseling program were the comparison groups. Although
participants were not randomly assigned to thcsc treatment
conditions, preliminary results of the comparison are
provocative. The data indicate the &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;
participants who remained in the program for nine to twelve
months were less likely to have problems while on parole than
either those who left &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot; earlier or those in
other prison-based programs. For example, &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;
participants who remained in the program more than nine months
were more likely to have a positive parole discharge (80 percent
positive) than those who remained in the program less than three
months (50 percent positive). Positiv e parole discharge is
defined as no reported violations of parole during the parole
custody period. Long-term (9-12 months) participants of the other
programs studied also had fewer cases of positive parole
discharge; the milieu program reported a 56 percent positive
discharge rate and the counseling program a 47 percent positive
rate. </p>

<p> Preliminary analysis indicates that long-term &quot;Stay 'N
Out&quot; participants may also have a more encouraging pattern
of re-arrest than those in the other programs. Continuing
follow-up shows that only 27 percent of the TC participants were
re-arrested compared to 35 percent of the milieu participants, 50
percent of the counseling participants, and 42 percent of the
waiting list persons. In addition, TC participants averaged 18
months to rearrest compared to 11 months for the milieu and nine
months for the counseling group. These data should be interpreted
with caution, however, as variation in the actual number of days
at risk may vary greatly among samples. </p>

<h4><a name="overview">Program overview </a></h4>

<p> 64 Stay IN Out&quot; programs were begun as a joint effort
among New York </p>

<p> State Division of Substance Abuse Services (DSAS), New York
Therapeutic Communities (NYTC), New York Department of
Correctional Services (DOCS), and the New York State Division of
Parole. Currently, NYTC. operates the programs, DOCS supplies
funding, and Parole provides increased opportunities for program
residents. The DSAS Bureau of Research and Evaluation continues
to evaluate the program. </p>

<p> The current program consists of two treatment units for male
inmates in one facility with 35 beds per unit (a total capacity
of 70 beds), and one treatment unit with 40 beds for women
-inmates in another facility. Each unit is staffed by a total of
seven persons, including both professionals and
paraprofessionals. Inmates selected for the programs are
recruited at Statc correctional facilities. The criteria for
selection are: history of drug abuse, at least 18 years of age,
evidence of positive institutional participation, and no history
of sex crimes or mental illness. &quot;Stay IN Out&quot; clients
are housed in units segregated from the general prison
population. They cat in a common dining room, however, and attend
morning activities with other prisoners. The optimum length of
treatment is from nine to twelve months. Most program staff are
ex-addict-offenders who are graduates of community T)Cs: they act
as &quot;role models&quot; exemplifying successful
rehabilitation. The course of treatment is a developmental growth
process with the inmate becoming an increasingly responsible
member of the program. </p>

<p> During the early phase of treatment, the clinical thrust
involves assessment of client needs and problem areas.
Orientation to the prison TC procedures occurs through individual
counseling, encounter sessions, and seminars. Clients are given
low-level jobs and granted little status. During the later phases
of treatment, residents are provided opportunities to earn
higherlevel positions and increased status through sincere
involvement in the program and hard work. Encounter groups and
counseling sessions are more in-depth and focus on the areas of
self-discipline, self-worth, selfawareness, respect for
authority, and acceptance of guidance for problem areas. Seminars
take on a more intellectual nature. Debate is encouraged to
enhance self-expression and to increase self-confidence. </p>

<p> Ilpon release, participants are encouraged to seek further
substance abuse treatment at cooperating community TCs. Extensive
involvement with a network of community TCs is central to the
program's operation. Staff and senior residents of community TCs
visit &quot;Stay IN Out&quot; on a regular basis to recruit
resident inmates for their programs. These visitors provide
inspiration since they are ex-addicts and ex-felon role models
who are leading economically and socially productive lives. </p>

<p> <b>DRUG OFFENSES ACCOUNT FOR A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF JAIL
INMATES</b> </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h1>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C.-- Drug offenses accounted for 23 percent of </p>

<p> the charges against the almost 400,000 men and women being
held in </p>

<p> local jails during 1989--up from 9 percent in 1983, the
Bureau of </p>

<p> Justice Statistics announced today. The Bureau, a component
of the </p>

<p> Office of Justice Programs in the U.S. Department of Justice,
reported </p>

<p> that the number of inmates in the nation's 3,312 local jails
grew 77 </p>

<p> percent from 1983 to 1989. More than 40 percent of that
growth </p>

<p> resulted from the increased number of persons held for or
convicted of </p>

<p> drug offenses. </p>

<p> &quot;The dramatic increase in the number of persons in jails
on </p>

<p> drug charges occurred both among those awaiting trial and
those </p>

<p> already convicted of crimes,&quot; said Bureau Director
Steven D. </p>

<p> Dillingham. &quot;And more than one-half of all convicted
jail inmates </p>

<p> said they had committed the offense for which they were
incarcerated </p>

<p> under the influence of drugs or alcohol or both.&quot; </p>

<p> The findings were drawn from a nationally representative </p>

<p> survey of 5,675 inmates held in 424 local jails. Similar
Bureau </p>

<p> surveys of jail inmates were conducted in 1972, 1978 and
1983. A jail </p>

<p> is a locally administered institution that holds people
awaiting trial </p>

<p> or already sentenced, usually for one year or less. </p>

<p> About half of all jail inmates in 1989 had been convicted and
</p>

<p> were serving time, 7 percent had been convicted but not yet
sentenced, </p>

<p> 26 percent were awaiting or on trial and 16 percent were
awaiting </p>

<p> arraignment. </p>

<p> An estimated 46 percent of the jail inmates in 1989 were on </p>

<p> probation, on parole, on bail or were in some other criminal
justice </p>

<p> status at the time of their arrest. More than three-quarters
of all </p>

<p> inmates being held in 1989 for any offense had had a prior
sentence of </p>

<p> probation or incarceration. At least a third of the inmates
were in </p>

<p> jail for a violent offense or had been previously sentenced
for a </p>

<p> violent offense. Other survey results: </p>

<p> --More than four of every 10 convicted inmates said they had </p>

<p> been using an illegal drug during the month before they
committed the </p>

<p> offense for which they were incarcerated. About one in four
convicted </p>

<p> inmates said they had used a major drug, such as heroin,
cocaine, </p>

<p> crack, LSD or PCP, in that month. </p>

<p> --Women and Hispanic prisoners were the most likely among all
</p>

<p> jail inmates to be held on drug charges--about one-third in
each </p>

<p> group. </p>

<p> --Among convicted inmates, 29 percent reported they had </p>

<p> committed their offenses under the influence of only alcohol,
15 </p>

<p> percent under the influence of only drugs and 12 percent
under the </p>

<p> influence of both. </p>

<p> --Almost one-third of all jail inmates said they had </p>

<p> participated in a substance abuse treatment program at some
time in </p>

<p> their lives--about 18 percent of the inmates had received
treatment </p>

<p> for drugs, 9 percent for alcohol and 6 percent for both. </p>

<p> --More than four of every 10 female inmates reported they had
</p>

<p> been abused at some time before their current
incarceration--33 </p>

<p> percent physically and 36 percent sexually. </p>

<p> --About 39 percent of all jail inmates had grown up in a </p>

<p> single parent household and an additional 11 percent had
lived in a </p>

<p> household without either parent. </p>

<p> --The racial and ethnic composition of local jails changed </p>

<p> between 1983 and 1989--blacks increased from 38 percent to 42
percent </p>

<p> of the inmates population, Hispanics increased from 14
percent to 17 </p>

<p> percent and the percentage of white non-Hispanics decreased
from 46 </p>

<p> percent to 39 percent. </p>

<p> --The female jail population increased from 7.1 percent in </p>

<p> 1983 to 9.5 percent in 1989. One of every four female inmates
was in </p>

<p> jail for larceny or fraud. </p>

<p> --About 11 percent of the inmates were being held for other </p>

<p> authorities--most awaiting transportation to a state prison. </p>

<p> --Among the inmates who had been sentenced to serve their
time </p>

<p> in local jails, half had received a sentence of six months of
less. </p>

<p> It is estimated that about half of the inmates sentenced to
local </p>

<p> jails would serve less than five months. </p>

materials for the Fiscal Year 1995 Drug Court Program will be
available in early 1995. </p>

<p> DATE: All comments must be received by February 24, 1995. </p>

<p> ADDRESS: All comments should be addressed to Reginald L.
Robinson, <i>Deputy Assistant Attorney</i> <i>General, </i>Office
of Justice Programs, 633 Indiana Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20531. </p>

<p> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </p>

<p> The Department of Justice Response Center at 1-800-421-6770
or 202-307-1480. </p>

<p> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </p>

<p> Overview of Title V-Drug Courts </p>

<p> Federal discretionary grants are being made available under
the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Title
V, Public Law 103-322, 108 Stat. 1796 (September 13, 1994), 42
U.S.C. 3796ii-3796ii-8 [hereinafter the &quot;Act&quot;] to
States, units of local government, Indian tribal governments, and
state and local courts for assistance with drug court programs.
The Act gives the Attorney General, and through statutory
authority contained in the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act, an authorized designee (in this case the Assistant Attorney
General for the Office of Justice Programs), the authority to
make grants to the above-mentioned entities for drug court
programs that involve continuing judicial supervision over
non-violent offenders with substance abuse problems and the
integrated administration of sanctions and services including:
(1) mandatory periodic testing for, the use of controlled
substances or other addictive substances during any period of
supervised release or probation for each participant; (2)
substance abuse treatment for each participant; (3) diversion,
probation, or other supervised release involving the possibility
of prosecution, confinement, or incarceration based on
noncompliance with program requirements or failure to show
satisfactory progress; and (4) programmatic, offender management,
and aftercare services such as relapse prevention, health care,
education, vocational training, job placement, housing placement,
and,child care or other family support services for each
participant requiring such services. </p>

<p> Section 50001 of Title V of the Act requires that regulations
be issued to ensure exclusion of violent offenders from these
funded programs. This proposed rule responds to that requirement.
To more fully develop and define the grant program and to provide
direction and guidance to potential applicants, program
guidelines, will be issued subsequent to the publication of this
proposed rule. This Supplementary Information section is
intended, in part, to elicit comment on a broad range of issues
relevant to the development and implementation of those program
guidelines. </p>

<p> <b>Statement of the Problem</b> </p>

<p> More than half of all individuals brought into the criminal
justice system have substance abuse problems. Many of these
individuals are non-violent offenders who repeatedly cycle
through the court, corrections, and probation systems without
help to change their behavior. The underlying problem of such
non-violent substance abusing offenders frustrates and inhibits
judicial effectiveness. All too often, the non-violent drug
offender faces little certainty of punishment and represents a
long-term, recurring problem for both the criminal justice system
and society. </p>

<p> In too many cases, the criminal justice system fails to
subject non-violent, drug abusing offenders to intervention
measures that provide the mix of services and sanctions necessary
to change their behavior, or if necessary, coerce abstinence.
Some courts and prosecutors, however, have cost-effcctively
addressed the problem through the use of treatment drug courts.
Their results suggest that &quot;drug courts&quot; can
significantly enhance the offender's opportunity to break the
cycle of substance abuse and crime. Those who are coming into
contact with the criminal justice system for the first time may
be particularly susceptible to effective early intervention. </p>

<p> Indeed, research and evaluation demonstrate that the
&quot;drug court&quot; approach is effective in reducing both
drug abuse and drug-related crime. The Drug Court discretionary
grant program of Title V seeks to support the development of
innovative measures that provide courts additional resources to
assure certainty of punishment for drug abusing offenders through
the integrated administration of services and sanctions,
including close supervision and coerced abstinence. </p>

<p> <b>The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994</b>
</p>

<p> The Department of Justice (Department) recognizes that no
single model exists for an effective drug court. To the contrary,
the Department believes there may be a variety of valid
approaches that deal effectively with non-violent offenders with
substance abuse problems. Consequently, the Drug Court grant
program will maintain flexibility in providing funds to support
the development of a variety of initiatives that coordinate
treatment and coerced abstinence. </p>

<p> The Department also recognizes the great diversity in the
structure and operation of state and local courts and criminal
justice systems. Hence, the Department is committed to a flexible
approach that allows jurisdictions to tailor local initiatives to
best suit their needs and local conditions. Program flexibility,
however, is<b> </b>necessarily balanced by statutory requirements
concerning the design and administration of the funded programs.
Accordingly, Drug Court programs that receive grant awards must: </p>

<ul>
    <li>exclude violent offenders from program participation; </li>
    <li>include a long-term strategy and detailed
        implementation.plan; </li>
    <li>explain the applicant's inability to fund the program
        adequately without Federal assistance; </li>
    <li>use Federal support to supplement, and not supplant,
        State, Indian tribal, and local sources of funding that
        would otherwise be available; </li>
    <li>identify related governmental or community initiatives
        which complement or will be coordinated with the
        proposal; </li>
    <li>consult with all affected agencies and insure that there
        will be appropriate coordination with all, affected
        agencies in the implementation of the program; </li>
    <li>certify, that participating offenders will receive
        continuing judicial supervision by one or more designated
        judges with responsibility for the drug court program; </li>
    <li>specify plans for obtaining necessary support and
        continuing the proposed program following the conclusion
        of Federal support; and </li>
    <li>describe the methodology that will be used in evaluating
        the program. </li>
</ul>

<p> Consistent with Congressional intent, program evaluation will
be crucial. Grant recipients will be required to cooperate with a
national evaluation team throughout their involvement with the
program. Recipients will also be required to provide for
independent evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of their
funded programs. The following issues will be especially
important in determining whether programs receiving grants under
this initiative are effective: (1) reduction in recidivism rates
of program participants, (2) maintenance of acceptable substance
abuse treatment completion rates among program participants, (3)
decreased drug use by program participants, and (4) maintenance
of a cost effective program in relation to the overall criminal
justice system. </p>

<p> <b>FY 1995 Drug Court Initiative</b> </p>

<p> The Fiscal Year 1995 Department of Justice Appropriations
Act, Public Law 103-317, has allocated $29 million for the Drug
Court grant programs. Eligibility of applicants to receive grants
will be based on requirements of the statute and these
regulations, as well as assurances and certifications specified
in detailed program guidelines and application materials that
will be available in early 1995 for the Fiscal Year 1995 Drug
Court initiative. </p>

<p> While detailed program guidelines will follow the publication
of this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department has made
some broad programmatic decisions upon which it welcomes comment.
Three types of funding will be available under this program
during Fiscal Year 1995. First, planning funding will be
available for those jurisdictions that express interest in
initiating a drug court but have not engaged in the comprehensive
planning necessary to make such a program successful. Second,
jurisdictions currently operating drug court programs may seek
funding to expand enhalace, or augment these ongoing efforts.
Finally, for those jurisdictions that have engaged (or are
currently engaged) in a comprehensive drug court planning
process, funding may be available to implement the plans their
efforts have produced. </p>

<p> <b>Call For Comments Concerning The Drug Court Initiative</b>
</p>

<p> Substance abuse-related offender case management is primarily
a state and local issue; thus, the Drug Court grant program
contemplates collaboration between federal and state and local
agencies. State and local government officials were involved in
Congressional hearings and meetings that guided the development
of this legislation and will continue to be involved as the
Department moves forward in developing this regulation,
establishing policy guidance, and implementing program
guidelines. At this time, comments are welcome regarding the
basic program design requirements described in Section 93.4 of
the proposed rule and to the entire scope of the program. </p>

<p>THE NATION'S PRISON POPULATION GREW ALMOST 9 PERCENT LAST YEAR
</p>

<p> U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE </p>

<p> ADVANCE FOR RELEASE AT 5 P.M. EDT BJS </p>

<p> WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 9, 1995 202/307-0784 </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The nation's state and federal prisons
had to find room for 83,294 more inmates last year--the second
largest annual increase in history and just 1,470 fewer than the
84,764 increase recorded in 1989. The total number of men and
women in prison last December 31 was 1,053,738--a new record.
Overall, almost 1.5 million people were incarcerated in the
United States in 1994. State and federal prisons, which primarily
hold convicted felons serving longer sentences, contained about
two-thirds of the total. Locally operated jails, which primarily
hold people awaiting trial or serving sentences of a year or
less, held the other third. </p>

<p> At the end of 1994 state prisons held 958,704 men and women
and federal prisons held 95,034 inmates. California (125,605) and
Texas (118,195) together held more than one in every five inmates
in the nation. Seventeen states, each holding fewer than 5,000
inmates, accounted for 4 percent of all prisoners. </p>

<p> Prison populations increased by at least 10 percent in 16
states last year. Texas reported the largest growth (28 percent),
followed by Georgia (20 percent). Alaska and </p>

<p> Connecticut reported fewer prisoners who had been sentenced
to more than a year. </p>

<p> The average sentence length and time served for state
prisoners has remained stable in recent years. Between 1985 and
1992, the years for which comparable data are available, half of
the state prisoners served at least 48 months. </p>

<p> In the federal system, however, the &quot;truth in
sentencing&quot; provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984
have contributed to increasing the median time served in prison
from 15 months in 1986 to 24 months in 1992. </p>

<p> The incarceration rate for prisoners sentenced to more than a
year reached a record 387 per 100,000 U.S. residents last
December 31. States with the highest incarceration rates were
Texas (636 inmates per 100,000 residents), Louisiana (530) and
Oklahoma (508). North Dakota (78) had the lowest, followed by
Minnesota (100) and West Virginia (106). </p>

<p> Since 1980 per capita incarceration rates rose the most in
the South (from 188 to 451) and West (from 105 to 333). The rate
in the Northeast rose from 87 to 285, and the rate in the Midwest
from 109 to 297. </p>

<p> In absolute numbers, violent offenders were the greatest
contributors to state prison inmate growth. Between 1980 and
1993, the number of violent offenders grew by an estimated
221,300, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) estimated using
1993 data. </p>

<p> More than a quarter of the state and federal inmates were in
prison for drug offenses (234,600 prisoners) in 1993. Prisoners
serving a drug sentence increased from 8 percent of the state and
federal prison population in 1980 to 26 percent in 1993. In
federal prisons, inmates sentenced for drug law violations were
the single largest group--60 percent in 1993, up from 25 percent
in 1980. </p>

<p> At the end of the year, states reported they were operating
between 17 percent and 29 percent over capacity, while the
federal system was operating at 25 percent over capacity. </p>

<p> Because of prison construction and the creation of new prison
beds, the ratio of the inmate population to the capacity of state
prisons has remained almost the same since 1990. </p>

<p> The average growth in the number of state and federal
prisoners sentenced to at least a year's incarceration was equal
to the need for 1,542 more beds per week in 1994. </p>

<p> During 1994 almost 5 percent of all state prisoners--48,949
inmates in 21 jurisdictions--were held in local jails or other
facilities because of prison crowding. </p>

<p> The number of female inmates grew 10.6 percent last year,
compared to an 8.5 percent increase among male inmates. On
December 31, 1994, there were 64,403 women in state and federal
prisons--6.1 percent of all prisoners. The rate of incarceration
for inmates serving a sentence of more than a year is 746 males
per 100,000 U.S. male residents, vs. 45 females per 100,000
female population. </p>

<p> Between 1980 and 1993, the number of white and black female
inmates grew at a faster pace than the number of male inmates in
either racial group. During this period the number of white males
grew 163 percent, the number of black males grew 217 percent, the
number of white females 327 percent, and the number of black
females 343 percent. An estimated 1,471 blacks per 100,000 black
residents and 207 whites per 100,000 white residents were
incarcerated in the nation's prisons on December 31, 1993. </p>

<p> The report, &quot;Prisoners in 1994&quot; (NCJ-151654), was
written by BJS statisticians Allen J. Beck and Darrell K.
Gilliard. Single copies may be obtained from the BJS
Clearinghouse, Box 179, Annapolis Junction, Maryland 20701-0179.
The telephone number is 1-800/732-3277. Fax orders to

<h2>STATE AND FEDERAL PRISON POPULATION TOPS ONE MILLION </h2>

<p> <b>U.S. Department of Justice</b> </p>

<p> <b>Bureau of Justice Statistics</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The nation's prison population exceeds 1
million for the first time in history, the Department of Justice
announced today. At the end of June, 1,012,851 men and women were
incarcerated in state and federal prisons. State prisons held
919,143 inmates and federal prisons held 93,708 inmates.
California (124,813) and Texas (100,136) together accounted for
more than one in five inmates in the country. </p>

<p> The prison population grew by almost 40,000 inmates during
the first half of 1994, the equivalent of more than 1,500 a
week--or three additional 500-bed prisons. </p>

<p> During the last 12 months the prison population expanded by
more than 71,000, the second largest annual increase ever
recorded. This growth was slightly greater than the annual growth
in the preceding 12 months (69,525) and exceeds by 11 percent the
average annual growth (63,793) during the previous five years,
that is from July 1988 to June 1993. </p>

<p> The incarceration rate of state and federal prisoners
sentenced to more than a year reached a record 373 prisoners per
100,000 U.S. residents last June. The states with the highest
incarceration rates were Texas (545 per 100,000), Louisiana
(514), South Carolina (504) and Oklahoma (501). </p>

<p> During the 12 months preceding June 30, 1994, eleven states
recorded prisoner growth rates of 10 percent or more, led by
Connecticut (20 percent), Texas (18 percent), and Tennessee (15
percent). </p>

<p> In the last decade the U.S. prison population doubled on a
per capita basis. During this 10-year period, the incarceration
rate doubled both for white inmates and black inmates. At the end
of last year (the latest available data) there were 1,432 black
inmates per 100,000 black U.S. residents and 203 white inmates
per 100,000 white residents. </p>

<p> During the first six months of 1994, the number of female
inmates grew 6.2 percent, compared to a 3.9 percent increase
among male inmates. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1994, there were 61,872 women in state and
federal prisons--6.1 percent of all prisoners. The male
incarceration rate, 719 per 100,000 male residents, was more than
16 times higher than the female incarceration rate--43 per
100,000 female residents. </p>

<p> The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) collects state and
federal prisoner data twice a year--on June 30 and December 31.
These counts are designed to provide regular updates to the
public on the number of people confined by state and federal
authority. The data have been published since 1926. </p>

<h2>THE NATION'S CORRECTIONAL POPULATION TOPS 5 MILLION </h2>

<p> <b>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</b> </p>

<p> <b>ADVANCE FOR RELEASE AT 5 P.M. EDT BJS</b> </p>

<p> <b>SUNDAY, AUGUST 27, 1995 202/307-0784</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C. -- More than 5.1 million Americans-or almost
2.7 percent of the adult population--were under some form of
correctional supervision last year, the Department of Justice
reported today. Almost three-quarters of these men and women were
being supervised in the community on probation or parole. The
others were confined in jail or prison. </p>

<p> The number of adults incarcerated or under supervision in the
community increased 3.9 percent during 1994. Since 1980 the
number has almost tripled, growing at an average annual rate of
7.6 percent. </p>

<p> At the end of last year, 2,962,000 adults were on probation
under community supervision rather than incarceration. An
additional 690,000 adults were on parole--conditional supervised
release after serving a prison term but subject to being returned
to incarceration for rule violations or other offenses.
Three-quarters of probationers and parolees were required to
maintain regular contact with a supervising agency. The other
offenders were not required to have regular contact (9 percent)
or had failed to report and could not be located (9 percent). </p>

<p> Texas had the largest number of adults on probation and
parole with more than 503,000 under such supervision, followed by
California with 370,000. At the end of 1994, more than 3.8
percent of all adults in Texas were on probation or parole. </p>

<p> Thirteen states reported that fewer than 1 percent of their
adult populations were on probation or parole. North Dakota had
the lowest probation and parole supervision rate (450 offenders
per 100,000 adults), followed by West Virginia (517), Mississippi
(552) and Kentucky (553). </p>

<p> Overall, the state and federal probation and parole
populations rose by 2.0 percent during 1994. Six states reported
increases of at least 10 percent in their probation populations,
and 11 reported similar increases in their parole populations.
Alabama, with a 14.5 percent rise in their probation population,
and Iowa, with a 27.1 percent rise in the parole population, led
the nation. </p>

<p> Twelve states and the Federal probation system reported a
decrease in the number of adults on probation, led by South
Dakota (down 6.2 percent), California (down 5.8 percent) and the
Federal system (down 6.8 percent). </p>

<p> Half of all offenders on probation in 1994 were on probation
for a felony. A quarter were on probation for a misdemeanor. One
of every seven probationers had been convicted of driving while
intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol. Almost all of the
offenders on parole (95 percent) had served a felony sentence in
jail or prison. </p>

<p> Approximately, 21 percent of the nation's probationers were
women, as were 10 percent of the parolees. </p>

<p> About 58 percent of the adults on probation were white, and
45 percent were black. Ninety percent of adults on parole were
men. Fifty-one percent of adults on parole were white, 45 percent
were black. </p>

<p> These data were collected and analyzed by Darrell Gilliard
and Allen Beck, statisticians at the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS). The NCJ number is NCJ-156432. Additional information about
Department of Justice Statistics may be obtained from the BJS
Clearinghouse, Box 179, Annapolis Junction, Maryland 20701- 1079.

<p> Drug Enforcement by Police </p>

<p> and Sheriffs' Department, 1990: </p>

<p> A LEMAS Report </p>

<p> May 1992 </p>

<p> NCJ-134505 </p>

<p> Few issues are as important in law enforcement today as how
governments at </p>

<p> all levels respond to the challenge to rid our society of
illicit drugs. </p>

<p> This report is drawn from the second triennial survey
conducted by the Law </p>

<p> Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics program.
The survey </p>

<p> included new questions about drugs seized, drug enforcement
techniques, and </p>

<p> testing of arrestees and employees. State and local law
enforcement </p>

<p> agencies have provided a national understanding of the
innovations in the </p>

<p> fight against drugs-special drug enforcement units,
interagency task </p>

<p> forces, and drug asset forfeiture programs. We salute the
departments in </p>

<p> their cooperation with LEMAS and trust that this profile will
prove </p>

<p> valuable in their assessments and planning. </p>

<p> Steven D. Dillingham, Ph.D. </p>

<p> Director </p>

<p> Drug Enforcement by Police </p>

<p> and Sheriffs' Department, 1990: </p>

<p> A LEMAS Report </p>

<p> By Brian A. Reaves, Ph.D. </p>

<p> BJS Statistician </p>

<p> In 1990, about 9,300 local police departments and 2,500
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments had primary responsibility for the enforcement of
drug laws. </p>

<p> Collectively, these agencies employed 466,000 full-time
officers, 92% of </p>

<p> all local police and sheriffs' officers nationwide. In
addition, 34 State </p>

<p> police departments, employing 43,000 officers, had primary
drug enforcement </p>

<p> responsibilities. </p>

<p> This report presents information collected from State and
local law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies with primary drug enforcement
responsibilities. It </p>

<p> includes information on types of illegal drugs seized,
operation of special </p>

<p> drug units, multi-agency task force participation, and
receipts from drug </p>

<p> asset forfeiture programs. </p>

<p> For all agencies the report also summarizes how drug testing
policies apply </p>

<p> to arrestees, applicants for sworn positions, and employees. </p>

<p> Major findings include the following: </p>

<p> *Among agencies with primary drug enforcement
responsibilities that served </p>

<p> 50,000 or more residents, over 90% of the police departments
and over 80% </p>

<p> of the sheriffs' departments operated special drug
enforcement units. </p>

<p> *Nationwide, more than 16,000 local police and sheriffs'
officers, and over </p>

<p> 2,000 State police officers were assigned full time to
special drug units. </p>

<p> *Half of local police and sheriffs' departments with primary
drug </p>

<p> enforcement responsibilities were participating in a
multi-agency drug </p>

<p> enforcement task force. These 6,500 agencies had assigned
nearly 10,000 </p>

<p> officers full time to such task forces. </p>

<p> *Among departments with primary drug enforcement
responsibilities, over 90% </p>

<p> of the police departments serving a population of 50,000 or
more, and over </p>

<p> 90% of the sheriffs' departments serving 250,000 or more
residents, </p>

<p> received money or goods from a drug asset forfeiture program.
</p>

<p> *Among the State police departments with primary drug
enforcement </p>

<p> responsibilities, 85% operated a special drug unit, 91%
participated in a </p>

<p> multi-agency drug enforcement task force, and 94% received
money or goods </p>

<p> from drug asset forfeitures. </p>

<p> *About 2 in 3 State police departments and 2 in 5 local
police and </p>

<p> sheriffs' departments reported that at least some of the
persons they </p>

<p> arrested were required to take a test for illegal drugs. </p>

<p> *A majority of State police departments and local police
departments </p>

<p> serving a population of 25,000 or more required that all
applicants for </p>

<p> sworn positions take a test for illegal drugs. </p>

<p> *About 3% of local law enforcement officers worked for
agencies that had a </p>

<p> mandatory drug testing program for regular field officers;
17% were </p>

<p> employed by agencies that had a random selection testing
program for </p>

<p> officers. </p>

<p> *Nonprobationary officers could be dismissed after one
positive test in </p>

<p> about two-thirds of local police and sheriffs' departments
and in about </p>

<p> three-fourths of State police departments. Nearly all
departments had a </p>

<p> policy specifying dismissal for two positive drug tests. </p>

<p> *Treatment alternatives were a part of the drug testing
policy for </p>

<p> employees in about half of State and local police departments
and two- </p>

<p> fifths of sheriffs' departments. Such alternatives were
generally limited </p>

<p> to the first positive test results only. </p>

<p> THE LEMAS SURVEY </p>

<p> The 1990 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics (LEMAS) </p>

<p> survey questionnaire was mailed to all 780 State and local
law enforcement </p>

<p> agencies with 100 or more sworn officers and to a sample of
2,338 agencies </p>

<p> with fewer than 100 officers. Of the 3,118 agencies receiving
the LEMAS </p>

<p> questionnaire, 2,945 (94.5%) responded. The survey used a
sampling frame </p>

<p> based on personnel data from the 1986 Directory Survey of Law
Enforcement </p>

<p> Agencies. (See Methodology for further discussion of
sampling.) </p>

<p> The local police departments included in this report are
general purpose </p>

<p> agencies operated by municipal or county governments. The
State police </p>

<p> departments included in this report are the primary general
purpose </p>

<p> agencies in all States except Hawaii, which does not have a
State police </p>

<p> department. </p>

<p> This report presents only data collected on drug-related
policies. The BJS </p>

<p> Bulletins State and Local Police Departments, 1990
(NCJ-133284) and </p>

<p> Sheriffs' Departments, 1990 (NCJ-133283) present other data
collected in </p>

<p> the LEMAS survey. </p>

<p> The first section of this report, on drug enforcement
activities, includes </p>

<p> only agencies with primary drug enforcement responsibilities.
Agencies </p>

<p> involved in drug enforcement only in a backup capacity, or
those whose </p>

<p> responsibilities are limited to traffic enforcement, jail
operation, court </p>

<p> operations or other such duties are not included. The second
section, on </p>

<p> drug testing policies, includes all local police, sheriffs',
and State </p>

<p> police departments. </p>

<p> Drug enforcement activities </p>

<p> State and local law enforcement agencies made an estimated
1.1 million </p>

<p> arrests for drug law violations during 1990, according to the
Uniform Crime </p>

<p> Reports (UCR) of the FBI. Excluding traffic violations, 1 in
every 13 </p>

<p> arrests made during the year was for a drug-related offense. </p>

<p> Local police and sheriffs' departments </p>

<p> During 1990, 77% of the Nation's local police and sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> reported they had primary responsibility for the enforcement
of drug laws </p>

<p> in areas under their jurisdiction. These 11,800 agencies
employed 466,000 </p>

<p> full-time officers, 92% of all local officers nationwide. </p>

<p> Over 9,000 local police departments, employing 96% of all
local police </p>

<p> officers, reported they had primary drug enforcement
responsibilities. </p>

<p> Nearly all of the police departments in jurisdictions of
10,000 or more in </p>

<p> population had such responsibilities. These 2,800 departments
employed </p>

<p> approximately 300,000 full-time officers. Departments in
towns with a </p>

<p> population of 2,500 to 9,999 (83%), or a population less than
2,500 (60%), </p>

<p> were less likely to have primary drug enforcement
responsibilities. These </p>

<p> 6,500 departments in smaller communities employed about
46,000 officers. </p>

<p> About 2,500 (81%) of the sheriffs' departments nationwide
reported having </p>

<p> primary drug enforcement responsibilities in 1990. Sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> located in jurisdictions with a population of under 100,000
were somewhat </p>

<p> more likely to have drug enforcement responsibilities than
those in larger </p>

<p> jurisdictions (83% versus 65%); however, the departments
serving a </p>

<p> population of 100,000 or more employed more officers than
those in smaller </p>

<p> jurisdictions (77,000 versus 42,000). </p>

<p> Local police and sheriffs' departments with primary drug
enforcement </p>

<p> responsibilities seized numerous types of illegal drugs
during the 12-month </p>

<p> period ending on June 30, 1990. Across all categories,
departments in </p>

<p> larger jurisdictions were more likely to have seized each
type of drug than </p>

<p> those in smaller jurisdictions. </p>

<p> Most of the police and sheriffs' departments serving a
population of 50,000 </p>

<p> or more seized nearly all of the types of drugs asked about
in the survey. </p>

<p> In the smallest jurisdictions, marijuana and cocaine were the
only drugs </p>

<p> seized by more than a third of all departments, and only
marijuana was </p>

<p> seized by more than half. </p>

<p> Eighty-six percent of local police depart-ments and 94% of
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments made seizures of marijuana--higher percentages
than for any </p>

<p> other drug. The percentage of departments making marijuana
seizures was </p>

<p> 94% or higher for departments in all population categories,
except for </p>

<p> sheriffs' departments serving a population of 10,000 or less
(88%) and </p>

<p> police departments serving a population of 2,500 or less
(70%). </p>

<p> According to UCR data for 1990, 30% of all arrests for drug
law violations </p>

<p> were marijuana-related. About 4 in 5 marijuana arrests were
for </p>

<p> possession, and the remainder, for offenses related to
trafficking. </p>

<p> Cocaine was seized by 72% of local police and sheriffs'
departments, the </p>

<p> second highest total percentage for any drug type. All police
departments </p>

<p> serving a population of 100,000 or more, and over 90% of
those serving </p>

<p> 10,000 to 99,999 residents, reported making seizures of
cocaine. Over 95% </p>

<p> of the sheriffs' departments serving 50,000 or more residents
reported </p>

<p> making seizures of cocaine. Only among police departments
serving under </p>

<p> 2,500 residents (39%), and sheriffs' departments serving
under 10,000 </p>

<p> residents (50%) did less than 75% of the departments in a
population </p>

<p> category report making cocaine seizures. Among police and
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments that did seize cocaine, nearly all of them
reported seizing the </p>

<p> powdered form of the drug, and a majority of them also seized
crack </p>

<p> cocaine. </p>

<p> A majority of the police departments serving a population of
25,000 or more </p>

<p> made heroin seizures, including all of those serving 500,000
or more </p>

<p> residents. More than two-thirds of the sheriffs' departments
in </p>

<p> jurisdictions with a population of 250,000 or more also
reported seizing </p>

<p> heroin. </p>

<p> Amphetamine seizures were made by 40% of all police and
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments, including more than 70% of those serving a
population of </p>

<p> 50,000 or more. More than half of the departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> 50,000 or more also reported making seizures of barbiturates,
methampheta- </p>

<p> mines, and LSD. PCP was seized by most of the police
departments serving a </p>

<p> population of 250,000 or more and the sheriffs' departments
serving 500,000 </p>

<p> or more. An aspect of the drug enforcement effort in many
jurisdictions </p>

<p> involves the operation of special drug enforcement units.
Where they </p>

<p> exist, such units are an integral part of the law enforcement
response to </p>

<p> drug trafficking and use. Since they focus directly on
conducting </p>

<p> sophisticated investigations of drug traffickers, these
special units </p>

<p> accumulate substantial knowledge about drugs in general and
about drug- </p>

<p> related activity in the community. </p>

<p> Nationwide, an estimated 3,270 local police and sheriffs'
departments were </p>

<p> operating a special drug unit during the 12-month period
ending on June 30, </p>

<p> 1990 (table 3). Overall, these agencies had over 16,000
officers assigned </p>

<p> to special drug units on a full-time basis. Included in this
total were an </p>

<p> estimated 12,715 police officers and 3,805 sheriffs'
officers. </p>

<p> Over 90% of local police departments serving 50,000 or more
residents were </p>

<p> operating a special drug unit, and 75% of all local police
officers </p>

<p> assigned to a drug unit nationwide were in one of these
departments. </p>

<p> Police departments serving 1 million or more residents had
the largest </p>

<p> special drug units, an average of 240 full-time officers
each. These 13 </p>

<p> departments accounted for a fourth of the local police
officers assigned to </p>

<p> drug units nationwide. </p>

<p> A majority (62%) of the police departments in jurisdictions
with 25,000 to </p>

<p> 49,999 residents also operated a special drug unit. Local
police </p>

<p> departments in small towns were the least likely to operate a
special drug </p>

<p> unit. About 19% of those serving a population of 2,500 to
9,999 and 5% of </p>

<p> those serving a population of under 2,500 had such a unit. </p>

<p> Among sheriffs' departments, over 90% of those serving a
population of </p>

<p> 500,000 or more and over 75% of those serving a population of
50,000 to </p>

<p> 499,999 operated a special drug unit. About 44% of the
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments serving a population of 25,000 to 49,999 operated
a drug unit. </p>

<p> In the smallest jurisdictions (under 10,000 residents), 11%
of the </p>

<p> sheriffs' departments had a drug unit. </p>

<p> The average size of special drug units in sheriffs'
departments ranged from </p>

<p> 34 full-time officers in departments serving a population of
1 million or </p>

<p> more to 1 officer in jurisdictions with fewer than 10,000
residents. </p>

<p> Many local police and sheriffs' departments operated other
types of special </p>

<p> units that were important to their drug control effort. Over
90% of large </p>

<p> police and sheriffs' departments (100 or more officers) with
primary drug </p>

<p> enforcement responsibilities operated a special unit for drug
education in </p>

<p> schools during 1990, and nearly 60% were operating a special
unit on gangs. </p>

<p> Law enforcement agencies recognize the value of coordinating
their efforts </p>

<p> to reduce drug abuse. For many police and sheriffs'
departments, this </p>

<p> coordination involves participating in a multiagency drug
enforcement task </p>

<p> force. Organizationally, such task forces often involve the
cooperation of </p>

<p> law enforcement agencies across jurisdictional boundaries and
governmental </p>

<p> levels. </p>

<p> The police and sheriffs' departments in multiagency task
forces develop </p>

<p> coordinated enforcement strategies aimed at accumulating the
evidence </p>

<p> needed to arrest, prosecute, and convict known drug
distributors. </p>

<p> Typically, these strategies involve the use of informants,
surveillance, </p>

<p> and undercover operations. They may also include complex
financial </p>

<p> investigations designed to trace drug distribution networks.
The resources </p>

<p> of special drug units often play an important role in
implementing task </p>

<p> force strategies. Multiagency drug task forces may also
attempt to reduce </p>

<p> problems associated with the illegal drug trade by including
not only law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies but also other types of government
agencies, nonprofit </p>

<p> organizations, business firms, and community groups. By
coordinating </p>

<p> education and health initiatives these task forces attempt to
reduce the </p>

<p> harm that illegal drugs do to the community. </p>

<p> Among agencies with drug enforcement responsibilities, about
half of the </p>

<p> local police departments and two-thirds of the sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> participated in a task force during the 12-month period
ending on June 30, </p>

<p> 1990. Overall, an estimated 6,500 local police and sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> participated in multiagency drug enforcement task forces
during this time </p>

<p> period. </p>

<p> Over 85% of the police and sheriffs' departments in each
population </p>

<p> category of 100,000 or more participated in a task force,
including over </p>

<p> 95% of the departments serving a population of 500,000 or
more. </p>

<p> Approximately 80% of the police and sheriffs' departments
serving a </p>

<p> population of 25,000 to 99,999, 65% of those serving a
population of 10,000 </p>

<p> to 24,999, and over 40% of those serving fewer than 10,000
residents </p>

<p> participated in a task force. </p>

<p> During the 12-month period ending June 30, 1990,
approximately 6,100 local </p>

<p> police officers were assigned to a multiagency drug task
force full time. </p>

<p> Although police departments serving a million or more
residents had the </p>

<p> most officers assigned to a task force on average (29), over
half of all </p>

<p> local police officers assigned to task forces nationwide were
employed by </p>

<p> departments serving a population of under 25,000. </p>

<p> Sheriffs' departments had about 3,500 officers assigned full
time to drug </p>

<p> task forces, ranging from an average of 10 officers per
department in </p>

<p> jurisdictions with 1 million or more residents, to an average
of 1 officer </p>

<p> per department in jurisdictions with fewer than 50,000
residents. </p>

<p> In addition to multiagency task forces, another innovation
for drug </p>

<p> enforcement in many jurisdictions is the use of drug asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> sanctions. Most States have laws that allow the government to
seize </p>

<p> convicted drug traffickers' cash, bank accounts, planes,
boats, cars, </p>

<p> homes, and other items purchased with proceeds from the
illicit drug trade. </p>

<p> State laws vary regarding the disposition of forfeited
assets. Most State </p>

<p> statutes require that outstanding liens be paid first, and
many States </p>

<p> require that all forfeited drug assets go to the State and/or
local </p>

<p> treasury. In some States, law enforcement agencies may keep
property such </p>

<p> as cars, planes, and boats for official use. In other States,
the agencies </p>

<p> can keep all property, cash, and proceeds from sales of what
is forfeited. </p>

<p> About 4,700 local police and sheriffs' departments reported
the receipt of </p>

<p> money or goods from a drug asset forfeiture program during
fiscal 1990. </p>

<p> This represented 41% of all local law enforcement agencies
with primary </p>

<p> drug enforcement responsibilities. A higher percentage of
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments (51%) than police departments (38%) had such
receipts. </p>

<p> The percentage of local police departments with asset
forfeiture receipts </p>

<p> was over 95% in jurisdictions with 50,000 to 999,999
residents. Among </p>

<p> departments serving 1 million or more residents and those
serving 25,000 to </p>

<p> 49,999 residents, about 85% received money or goods from an
asset </p>

<p> forfeiture program. Receiving money or goods from an asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> program was least likely for police departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> under 2,500 (11%). </p>

<p> About 95% of sheriffs' departments in jurisdictions with
250,000 or more </p>

<p> residents, and about 85% of those serving 50,000 to 249,999
residents had </p>

<p> asset forfeiture pro-gram receipts during fiscal 1990. In the
smallest </p>

<p> jurisdictions (under 10,000 residents), an estimated 27% of
the sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments received money or goods from an asset forfeiture
program. </p>

<p> State police departments </p>

<p> Thirty-four State police departments, employing approximately
43,000 full- </p>

<p> time officers, reported they had primary responsibility for
the enforcement </p>

<p> of drug laws. </p>

<p> Number of Full-time </p>

<p> State police sworn officers </p>

<p> departments employed </p>

<p> Total 49 52,372 </p>

<p> Departments with </p>

<p> primary responsibility </p>

<p> for drug enforcement 34 43,118 </p>

<p> All 34 of these departments reported they made marijuana and
cocaine </p>

<p> seizures during the 12-month period ending June 30, 1990
(table 6). A </p>

<p> large majority of them also seized amphetamines (94%), heroin
(91%), LSD </p>

<p> (88%), methamphetamines (88%), barbiturates (85%), and PCP
(74%). </p>

<p> Like those of local law enforcement agencies, State police
drug enforcement </p>

<p> strategies often involve the operation of special units,
participation in </p>

<p> multiagency drug enforcement task forces, and participation
in a drug asset </p>

<p> forfeiture program. </p>

<p> Twenty-nine (85%) of the State police departments that had
responsibility </p>

<p> for enforcing drug laws were operating special drug
enforcement units. </p>

<p> These 29 departments had assigned a total of 2,138 officers
to these units </p>

<p> on a full-time basis--an average of 74 officers per
department. </p>

<p> Most of these departments (82%) also operated special units
for drug </p>

<p> education in schools, and 29% of them had special units for
gangs. </p>

<p> Thirty-one of the departments (91%) participated in a
multiagency drug </p>

<p> enforcement task force during fiscal 1990. These departments
had 900 </p>

<p> officers assigned to drug task forces, an average of 29 per
department. </p>

<p> All but two of the departments (94%) responsible for drug
enforcement </p>

<p> reported they received money or goods from a drug asset
forfeiture program </p>

<p> during the year. </p>

<p> Drug testing policies </p>

<p> Local police and sheriffs' departments </p>

<p> Nearly 40% of local police and sheriffs' departments reported
that at least </p>

<p> some of their arrestees were tested for illegal drugs. Drug
testing of </p>

<p> arrestees was most likely to exist in police departments
serving a </p>

<p> population of 500,000 or more (56%) and in sheriffs'
departments serving a </p>

<p> population of 1 million or more (60%). </p>

<p> Among local police departments that reported testing of
arrestees, about 1 </p>

<p> in 8 were responsible for operation of the testing program.
In sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments with arrestee testing, about 1 in 4 operated the
testing </p>

<p> program. </p>

<p> About a fourth of both local police and sheriffs' departments
required all </p>

<p> applicants for sworn positions to submit to a drug test. The
prevalence of </p>

<p> drug testing of applicants increased with the size of the
population </p>

<p> served. Among local police departments, 80% of those serving
a population </p>

<p> of 250,000 or more required all applicants for sworn
positions to be tested </p>

<p> for illegal drugs. About 70% of those serving a population of
50,000 to </p>

<p> 249,999 and just under 50% of those serving a population of
10,000 to </p>

<p> 49,999 had such a requirement. The percentage of police
departments with a </p>

<p> mandatory drug testing policy for applicants was smallest
among those </p>

<p> serving 2,500 to 9,999 residents (25%) and those serving
fewer than 2,500 </p>

<p> residents (14%). </p>

<p> Slightly more than 40% of sheriffs' departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> 100,000 or more had a policy requiring drug testing of all
applicants for </p>

<p> sworn positions. About 30% of departments serving from 25,000
to 100,000 </p>

<p> residents had such a policy. Sheriffs' departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> less than 25,000 (15%) were the least likely to require all
applicants for </p>

<p> sworn positions to undergo tests for illegal drugs. </p>

<p> Small percentages of all local police and sheriffs'
departments had a </p>

<p> mandatory drug testing requirement for probationary officers,
regular field </p>

<p> officers, candidates for promotion, officers in drug-related
positions, or </p>

<p> civilian personnel. In every population category, less than
25% of the </p>

<p> police and sheriffs' departments had mandatory drug testing
for the above </p>

<p> personnel types, except the following: Probationary officers
and officers </p>

<p> in drug-related positions in police departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> 500,000 or more. </p>

<p> Small percentages of local police and sheriff's departments
were also using </p>

<p> random selection to test applicants or employees for illegal
drugs. An </p>

<p> estimated 2% of all departments tested applicants through
this method, and </p>

<p> the percentage of departments with random drug testing was no
more than 5% </p>

<p> for any personnel position. Random selection testing was most
common for </p>

<p> officers in drug-related positions employed by police
departments serving a </p>

<p> population of 1 million or more (36%). </p>

<p> About 10% of all local police and sheriffs' departments
required regular </p>

<p> field officers suspected of using illegal drugs to take a
drug test. The </p>

<p> percentage of departments with suspicion-based testing was
similar for </p>

<p> other types of employees. About 2% of the departments had
such a policy </p>

<p> for applicants. </p>

<p> Departments in larger jurisdictions were more likely than
those in smaller </p>

<p> jurisdictions to have a suspicion-based drug testing program.
For example, </p>

<p> among local police departments, about two-thirds of local
police </p>

<p> departments serving 250,000 or more residents authorized
testing of regular </p>

<p> field officers suspected of drug use, compared to about half
of those </p>

<p> serving a population of 50,000 to 249,999, about a third of
those serving a </p>

<p> population of 25,000 to 49,999, and a ninth of those serving
population of </p>

<p> 2,500 to 9,999. In police departments serving a population of
under 2,500, </p>

<p> roughly 1 in 30 authorized testing of regular field officers
suspected of </p>

<p> illegal drug use. </p>

<p> About 40% of the sheriffs' departments serving a population
of 1 million or </p>

<p> more had a policy authorizing testing of regular field
officers suspected </p>

<p> of illegal drug use. About 30% of the departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> 500,000 to 999,999, and 20% of those serving a population of
100,000 to </p>

<p> 499,999 had such a policy. Less than 10% of the sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> located in jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents
had a policy </p>

<p> that authorized drug testing of officers suspected of drug
use. </p>

<p> Nationwide, the local police departments that had a
suspicion-based drug </p>

<p> testing program for regular field officers employed 50% of
all local police </p>

<p> officers. The sheriffs' departments with such a testing
program employed </p>

<p> 31% of all sheriff's officers. An estimated 17% of all local
police </p>

<p> officers and 12% of sheriffs' officers worked for departments
that had a </p>

<p> random selection program for regular field officers. About 3%
of local </p>

<p> police officers and 4% of sheriffs' officers were employed by
departments </p>

<p> that had a mandatory drug testing requirement for field
officers. </p>

<p> Local police departments that tested civilian employees
suspected of drug </p>

<p> use employed 45% of all such employees nationwide. About 30%
of civilian </p>

<p> employees in sheriffs' departments worked in department with
a suspicion- </p>

<p> based testing program for civilians. </p>

<p> Civilian employees in sheriffs' departments were more likely
to be a part </p>

<p> of a random selection drug testing program than their
counterparts in local </p>

<p> police departments (9% versus 3%). About 5% of the civilian
employees in </p>

<p> local police and sheriffs' departments were subject to a
mandatory drug </p>

<p> testing requirement. </p>

<p> For comparison, the results of a 1988 survey conducted by the
Department of </p>

<p> Labor showed that 3% of private nonagricultural businesses
had a drug </p>

<p> testing program of some type, including 43% of those with
1,000 or more </p>

<p> employees. Overall, about 20% of private sector employees
worked for a </p>

<p> company with a drug testing program. (Bureau of Labor
Statistics, Survey </p>

<p> of Employer Anti-drug Programs, Report 760, January 1990.) </p>

<p> Among local law enforcement agencies with an employee drug
testing program, </p>

<p> an estimated 61% of the police departments and 69% of the
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments specified dismissal as a possible disciplinary
sanction against </p>

<p> nonprobationary officers after one positive drug test. </p>

<p> Local police officers testing positive for the first time
were most likely </p>

<p> to face dismissal as a possible sanction in larger
jurisdictions. All </p>

<p> police departments serving a population of 1 million or more
had a policy </p>

<p> specifying dismissal as a possible sanction after one
positive drug test, </p>

<p> and 83% of those serving a population of 250,000 to 999,999
had such a </p>

<p> policy. </p>

<p> Suspension was the most serious disciplinary sanction
specified for an </p>

<p> initial positive drug test in 14% of the police and sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> that tested employees for illegal drugs. </p>

<p> After a second positive drug test by a nonprobationary
officer, the </p>

<p> percentage of local law enforcement agencies specifying
dismissal as the </p>

<p> most serious disciplinary sanction increased to 93% for
police departments </p>

<p> and to 98% for sheriffs' departments. </p>

<p> Treatment was specified as a possible alternative for
nonprobationary </p>

<p> officers with positive drug test results in almost half of
the local police </p>

<p> and sheriffs' departments with a testing program. The drug
testing </p>

<p> policies of local police departments specified treatment
alternatives more </p>

<p> often than those of sheriffs' departments (49% versus 39%).
Treatment </p>

<p> alternatives were generally limited to the first offense. </p>

<p> Among police departments, treatment alternatives were most
likely to exist </p>

<p> in jurisdictions with a population of 50,000 to 249,999,
where two-thirds </p>

<p> of them had such a policy. Among sheriffs' departments, those
serving </p>

<p> 500,000 to 999,999 residents (62%) were the most likely to
have treatment </p>

<p> alternatives specified in their drug testing policy. </p>

<p> Police departments serving a population of 1 million or more
(20%) were the </p>

<p> least likely of all local law enforcement agencies to specify
treatment as </p>

<p> a possible alternative for officers who test positive for
drugs. </p>

<p> State police departments </p>

<p> Thirty-three (67%) of the 49 primary State police departments
reported that </p>

<p> at least some of the persons they arrested were being tested
for illegal </p>

<p> drugs. Four (8%) of the departments reported that they had
primary </p>

<p> responsibility for operation of the testing program. </p>

<p> Percent of departments </p>

<p> in which at least some </p>

<p> arrestees are tested </p>

<p> Total 67% </p>

<p> Agency-operated </p>

<p> program 8 </p>

<p> Not agency-operated 59 </p>

<p> Just over half (55%) of State police departments reported
they required </p>

<p> drug tests of all applicants for sworn positions. Two (4%) of
the </p>

<p> departments reported they required all regular field officers
to undergo </p>

<p> tests for illegal drugs, and five (10%) tested all officers
working in </p>

<p> drug-related positions. None of the State police departments
reported </p>

<p> having a mandatory drug testing policy for civilian
personnel. </p>

<p> Some State police departments used a random selection process
to test </p>

<p> probationary officers (12%), regular field officers (8%),
candidates for </p>

<p> promotion (8%), and officers working in drug-related
positions (10%). One </p>

<p> department (2%) had a random selection drug testing program
for applicants, </p>

<p> and two departments (4%) required civilian personnel to be
included in a </p>

<p> random selection drug testing program. </p>

<p> Although no State police departments had a mandatory drug
testing </p>

<p> requirement for civilian employees, nearly half (45%) of all
civilian State </p>

<p> police employees worked in departments that tested civilian
employees </p>

<p> suspected of using illegal drugs. A similar proportion of
sworn State </p>

<p> police employees (53%) were subject to suspicion-based drug
testing. About </p>

<p> 7% of State police officers were employed by departments with
random </p>

<p> selection testing for regular field officers and an equal
percentage worked </p>

<p> in departments with a mandatory drug testing requirement for
such officers. </p>

<p> About three-fourths (77%) of the State police departments
with a drug </p>

<p> testing program specified dismissal as a possible sanction
against </p>

<p> probationary officers after one positive drug test. After a
second </p>

<p> offense, dismissal was a possible sanction specified by 91%
of the </p>

<p> departments. </p>

<p> Half of the departments with employee drug testing specified
treatment as a </p>

<p> possible alternative after the first offense. As in local law
enforcement </p>

<p> agencies, treatment alternatives were generally not available
to State </p>

<p> police officers who tested positive for drugs a second time. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> The Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics
(LEMAS) survey </p>

<p> collects data from a nationally representative sample of the
nearly 17,000 </p>

<p> publicly funded State and local law enforcement agencies in
the United </p>

<p> States. </p>

<p> All 780 State and local law enforcement agencies in the
United States with </p>

<p> 100 or more sworn officers (as reported in the 1986 Directory
Survey of Law </p>

<p> Enforcement Agencies) received the full-length LEMAS
questionnaire. The </p>

<p> 780 self-representing (SR) agencies were supplemented by a
nationally </p>

<p> representative sample of all agencies with fewer than 100
sworn officers. </p>

<p> These nonself-representing (NSR) agencies were chosen using a
stratified </p>

<p> random sample with cells based on the type of agency (local
police, </p>

<p> sheriff, or special police), size of population served, and
number of sworn </p>

<p> officers. The 2,338 NSR agencies received a slightly
abbreviated LEMAS </p>

<p> questionnaire, which did not contain items about job
classifications, </p>

<p> residency requirements, special pay, collective bargaining,
police </p>

<p> membership organizations, special units, or written policy
directives. </p>

<p> The initial mailing of the survey questionnaire was conducted
in July 1990. </p>

<p> The pay period containing June 15, 1990, was used as the
reference date for </p>

<p> personnel-related questions and June 30, 1990, for other
questions. The </p>

<p> data were collected by the Bureau of the Census for the
Bureau of Justice </p>

<p> Statistics. </p>

<p> After two followup mailings and additional telephone calls as
needed, a </p>

<p> final total of 2,945 agencies responded to the LEMAS
questionnaire, </p>

<p> including 738 SR agencies and 2,207 NSR agencies. The overall
response </p>

<p> rate was 94.5%. The final data-base includes responses from
1,830 local </p>

<p> police departments, 840 sheriffs' departments, 226 special
police </p>

<p> departments, and the 49 primary State police departments. </p>

<p> The base weight for all SR agencies is 1. For NSR local and
special police </p>

<p> departments, the base weight is 8.128, and for NSR sheriffs'
departments it </p>

<p> is 4.09857. The final weight associated with every agency,
both SR and </p>

<p> NSR, is the product of the base weight and a factor that
adjusted for any </p>

<p> nonresponding agencies in each sample cell. This agency
nonresponse factor </p>

<p> was based on number of sworn officers for SR agencies and on
number of </p>

<p> agencies for NSR agencies. </p>

<p> Some responding agencies did not completely answer the LEMAS
questionnaire. </p>

<p> When an agency did not supply a response to an item, a donor
agency was </p>

<p> randomly selected from responding agencies in the same sample
cell. The </p>

<p> donor agency's value for the item was placed into the
nonresponding </p>

<p> agency's response field with an indicator that the value had
been imputed. </p>

<p> Complete documentation regarding sampling procedures and
non-response </p>

<p> adjustments is available upon request. </p>

<p> Because the data from agencies with fewer than 100 sworn
personnel were </p>

<p> collected from a sample, the results are subject to sampling
error. All </p>

<p> statements of comparison in this report have been tested to
ensure that </p>

<p> observed differences between values are significant at 2
standard errors </p>

<p> (the 95-percent confidence level) or higher. </p>

<h2>Systemwide Strategies To Alleviate Jail Crowding </h2>

<p> <img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> <b>U.S. Department of Justice</b> </p>

<p> <b>National Institute of Justice</b> </p>

<p> <b>January 1987</b> </p>

<p> The words &quot;jail&quot; and &quot;crowding&quot; seem
inseparable these days. A 1983 National Institute of Justice
survey of more than 1,400 criminal justice officials from all
parts of the country identified jail and prison crowding as the
most serious problem facing criminal justice systems.(1) </p>

<p> The reality of more prisoners than available beds creates a
dilemma for local justice officials. Crowded jails may compromise
public safety through a lack of space to confine those who pose
serious threats to the community. Lawsuits challenging crowded
conditions may constrain a community's ability to incarcerate, </p>

<p> A recent Bureau of Justice Statistics <i>Bulletin </i>notes
that 22 percent (134) of the Nation's 621 largest jails (those
with a capacity of more than 100) were under court order in 1984
to expand capacity or reduce the number of inmates housed, and 24
percent (150)<i> </i>were under court order to improve one or
more conditions of confinement. (2) </p>

<p> Building or expanding facilities is often necessary to house
those who must be incarcerated. The time and costs of
construction and operation of new institutions, however, argue
that other options should not be overlooked. (3) </p>

<p> For the local sheriff or jail administrator, jail crowding
creates increased prisoner and staff tensions, increased wear and
tear of facility and equipment, budgetary problems from overtime
staffing, and an inability to meet program and service standards.
Less frequently recognized are the problems crowding creates for
other justice system officials: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Judges, prosecutors, probation and parole, and other
        officials often find crowding a severe constraint in
        cases where jailing offenders appears necessary but space
        is unavailable. </li>
    <li>Prosecutors, public defenders, and pretrial services
        officers find their functions impaired by delayed access
        to inmates caused by difficulty in processing large
        numbers of offenders. </li>
    <li>Court functions overall may suffer when crowding affects
        the movement of inmates to and from scheduled
        appearances. </li>
</ul>

<p> Too often, however, agencies outside jail management are not
fully involved in efforts to cope with the problem. </p>

<p> Many jurisdictions address the symptoms of jail crowding but
leave the underlying causes unaddressed. Other jurisdictions,
however, view jail crowding as a problem that demands the
cooperative involvement of all key figures in the local justice
system. </p>

<p> Given the success of this <i>systemwide </i>approach in a
number of locations, the National Institute of Justice sponsored
development of <i>Alleviating Jail Crowding: A Systems
Perspective </i>(NCJ 99462, 1985), based on a survey of justice
system officials and programs throughout the United States. The
report stresses that while construction of new facilities may be
part of a community's solution to crowding, emphasis must also be
placed on ensuring that existing bed space is used effectively.
Accordingly, the report highlights the role of each local
criminal justice agency in ensuring the effective use of jail bed
space to prevent crime and maintain public safety. This <i>Research
in Brief </i>summarizes the full report. </p>

<p> <b>Looking at the local justice system</b> </p>

<p> Virtually every decisionmaker in the local justice system
exercises discretion that can affect the jail population.
Jurisdictions using a systemwide approach to jail crowding see
the local justice system as a screening mechanism that can be
modified to enhance the use of scarce jail space. </p>

<p> These jurisdictions develop case-processing flowcharts to
understand the details of their case-handling process from the
initial contact to final disposition. Flowchart, illustrate the
stages of the legal process, specify the points at which
decisionmaker actions affect the jail population, and identify
opportunities to alleviate crowding. </p>

<p> Understanding the local flow of cases can help policymakers
identify program and process changes to reduce crowding. Program
changes frequently involve eliminating the jailing of persons
whom a community deems inappropriate for criminal justice
processing, such as the mentally ill. </p>

<p> Process changes improve system efficiency, eliminating
case-handling &quot;catch points&quot; that unnecessarily prolong
the confinement of persons who might eventually be released
through bail, probation, or transfer to the State prison. </p>

<p> Reducing length of confinement often becomes the first focus
of population reduction, because efficiency measures are
generally less costly and more readily implemented than new
programs. Local analysis often reveals that the primary
underlying cause of crowding is excessive length of confinement
due to inefficient case processing. </p>

<p> <b>How system decisionmakers can affect jail crowding</b> </p>

<p> System studies in a number of jurisdictions have suggested,
as one judge said, &quot;a lot of little ways&quot; to halt or
reverse jail population increases without releasing serious
offenders. The following discussion highlights just a few of the
&quot;little ways&quot; available at different parts of the
system. </p>

<p> Law enforcement - Decision, surrounding local arrest
practices whether to arrest, transport to jail or </p>

<p> stationhouse, book or detain for bail setting - are critical
determinants of jail population size. Law enforcement practices
both before and after arrest can be modified to reduce jail
admissions. Jurisdictions such as San Diego County, California,
and Frederick County (Winchester), Virginia, use perhaps the most
common form of prearrest diversion through short-term
&quot;sobering up&quot; facilities for public inebriates. </p>

<p> San Diego has been successful in reducing crowding through
the use of a privately operated detoxification reception program
where inebriates must remain for a minimum 4-hour period. Though
in a largely rural area, the Winchester, Virginia, detoxification
program, operated by the Division of Court Services, has also
diverted a large number of persons from jail. </p>

<p> Similar prearrest diversion programs are in effect for
persons involved in family disputes(4) and for homeless persons
in a number of jurisdictions throughout the United States. </p>

<p> Law enforcement officials in Galveston County, Texas, have
instituted practices to divert the mentally ill-a population that
frequently makes up 10 to 20 percent of a jail's population. A
team of deputies receives special training to assist in meeting
the emergency needs of the mentally ill, thereby allowing the
agency to take them directly to a mental health facility. </p>

<p> Many agencies also use a number of postarrest practices such
as station-house release before booking, field citations, and
court-delegated authority to release suspects according to a bail
schedule to eliminate unnecessary confinement. </p>

<p> Jail administrators - Elected sheriffs or appointed jail
executives are often viewed as the managers most affected but
least powerful in dealing with jail crowding. While having little
direct control over admissions and length of confinement, jail
administrators nevertheless can help reduce crowding by assuring
ready access for pretrial release screening and bail review. </p>

<p> Quick access to detainees tends to be a common characteristic
of successful programs to reduce jail crowding. For example, the
sheriff in Mecklenburg County (Charlotte), North Carolina, allows
pretrial services staff to be present during the jail admissions
process, which gives them access to defendants and speeds
decisionmaking. </p>

<p> Individual judges often lack feedback regarding prisoners in
jail awaiting or following adjudication. Yet such information is
of interest to the court and critical to jail population
reduction. The Bexar County (San Antonio), Texas, administrator
provides data to help judges monitor the court status of
prisoners and prevent length of confinement from being extended
through oversight or inattention. </p>

<p> In some other jurisdictions, jail administrators are
delegated authority to release defendants pretrial or divert
drunk drivers to treatment centers. Other administrators help
develop nonjail pretrial-release and sentencing options or
cooperate with other jurisdictions to alleviate crowding on a
multicounty basis. </p>

<p> <b>Prosecutors </b>- Prosecutors act at more case-handling
decision points than any other officials. This gives them an
especially important role in containing jail population growth. </p>

<p> Early case screening by prosecutors reduces unnecessary
length of confinement by eliminating or downgrading weak cases as
soon as possible. Assistant prosecutors in Milwaukee County,
Wisconsin, review arrests around the clock by examining police
records and conducting meetings between complainants and
suspects. This practice enables Milwaukee prosecutors to decide
on the appropriate charge within 24 to 36 hours after arrest. </p>

<p> Prosecutors in Milwaukee also use &quot;vertical case
processing&quot; - assigning the same attorney or team of
attorneys to prosecute a case from start to finish. Though not
necessarily the case in all jurisdictions, reassigning cases from
one assistant prosecutor to another while the matter is before
the court &quot;horizontal case processing&quot; - may cause
stagnation in caseflow, increased requests for continuances, and
lengthened time to trial. </p>

<p> Prosecutor cooperation is essential for alternatives in
arrest, pretrial confinement, and sentencing. Prosecutor
participation and leadership are essential to the effectiveness
of task forces dealing with jail crowding. Since the prosecutor
&quot;owns&quot; cases on behalf of the State, others are rarely
willing to propose case-handling changes without the prosecutor's
support. </p>

<p> Recognizing that a lack of space to confine dangerous persons
is a threat to public safety, prosecutors in a number of
jurisdictions have taken an active role in reducing jail crowding
by serving on &quot;key court officials&quot; groups or chairing
jail population reduction boards. </p>

<p> <b>Pretrial services </b>- Providing background information
on defendants, release recommendations, and other pretrial
assistance can be an important component of solutions to
crowding. Pretrial services can often help merely by adjusting
staff schedules to ensure timely screening and interviews for a
maximum number of defendants. </p>

<p> In Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, for example, pretrial
services and magistrate bail setting are available 24 hours, 7
days a week. In Kentucky, pretrial staff are on call 24 hours a
day to interview persons at rested, notify judges by phone of the
prisoner's qualifications for release, and supervise the release
process if nonfinancial bail is authorized. </p>

<p> Limited release authority is delegated to pretrial services
staff in an increasing number of jurisdictions. In San Mateo
County (Redwood City), California, pretrial staff are authorized
to release misdemeanor suspects prior to their first court
appearance. Seattle, Washington, is experimenting with delegated
release on certain felony charges. </p>

<p> Many pretrial programs respond to jail population pressures
by expanding the range of release options (conditional and
supervised release, third-party custody, unsecured bail, deposit
bail) and by conducting regular bail reviews for those detained
for trial. </p>

<p> A National Institute of Justice study found that supervised
release programs in Miami, Florida; Portland, Oregon; and
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, significantly reduced the bail-held
population without significantly increasing the risk to public
safety. </p>

<p> <b>Judiciary</b> - Judges make more decisions affecting jail
population than anyone else; this often makes them leaders in
seeking jail-crowding solutions. Judges can issue summonses
instead of arrest warrants; provide guidelines authorizing direct
release by police, jail, and pretrial staff; and provide bail
setting outside normal court hours. Evaluators of the 4-year Jail
Overcrowding Reduction Project of the former Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration found that the project's most
successful sites were those with strong judicial leadership. </p>

<p> Many courts provide 24-hour bail-setting magistrates. The
King County (Seattle), Washington, District Court has a
&quot;three-tier&quot; release policy that reduces court time,
jail admissions, and length of confinement. The court established
guidelines specify the charges for which pretrial services staff
may (1) release without consulting the court, (2) release after
phoning a duty judge, or (3) make recommendations to the court in
the most serious felony cases. </p>

<p> Reducing court delay is crucial to effective use of jail
space. Bexar County, Texas, seeks to eliminate &quot;dead
time&quot; by having the court administrator work with a jail
case coordinator to identify cases in need of special attention
and processing steps that can be shortened. Each judge receives
weekly a list of prisoners awaiting indictment, trial,
sentencing, or revocation in his or her court. </p>

<p> One result is a 50-percent time saving in disposing of
misdemeanor charges and thus a significant cut in overall length
of confinement. </p>

<p> Many judges have worked to extend the range of nonjail
sentencing options, using probation supervision, </p>

<p> suspended sentences, fines, community service and
restitution, halfway house placements, and specialized treatment
facilities as true alternatives to incarceration. </p>

<p> A growing number of courts now defer service of jail
sentences, when the jail is at capacity, in cases in which jail
is believed an appropriate sentence but immediate jailing is not
essential for the community's safety. </p>

<p> <b>Defense - </b>The National Institute's field test on Early
Representation by Defense Counsel found that early screening for
indigency, defender appointment, and defendant contact can
decrease length of confinement and thus yield substantial savings
of jail space.(6) Vertical case processing in defense offices
also helps cut length of confinement. </p>

<p> In Mecklenburg County, pretrial conferences between defense
and prosecution help identify, eliminate, or downgrade marginal
cases and facilitate plea negotiation. Both offices can thus
budget staff time efficiently and lessen pretrial confinement. </p>

<p> In St. Louis, Missouri, efforts to reduce staggering defender
caseloads by appointing private attorneys in felony cases have
also reduced case disposition time, stimulated bail review, and
resulted in shorter pretrial confinement. </p>

<p> <b>Probation and parole - </b>Not only do probation and
parole agencies provide nonjail alternatives for sentencing, they
can enhance case- processing efficiency by streamlining
presentence investigation (PSI) procedures and expediting
revocation decisions. All this helps cut length of confinement. </p>

<p> In Brevard County, Florida, the jail population oversight
committee spotlighted PSI delays and worked with probation and
parole officers to cut PSI preparation time from 90 days to 30 or
35 days for jail cases. The county also cut to 24 hours the time
required for decisions on probation revocation, thus decreasing
the use of jail beds for persons on probation &quot;hold&quot;
orders. </p>

<p> <b>Outside the local level </b>- State legislation, court
rules, executive orders, and other &quot;external factors&quot;
can affect jail populations - Guidelines on diversion, bail
policy, appointment of legal counsel, sentencing practices, and
jail operation all can affect the range of solutions available. </p>

<p> Other outside factors that need to be considered in local
planning for jail use include local -demographics, availability
of State and Federal resources, public opinion and media coverage
of criminal justice issues, activities of local civic<b> </b>groups
and community organizations, and political campaigns and
referendums. </p>

<p> <b>Outside the system</b>-Organizations outside the justice
system can be instrumental in alleviating shortages </p>

<p> of jail space by providing emergency shelter, detoxification,
and treatment facilities for the mentally disturbed, public
inebriates, and drunk drivers. Many jurisdictions use local
mental health centers to provide prompt mental health
assessments, diversion, and outpatient treatment. Private
agencies in several jurisdictions provide temporary shelter for
juveniles, pretrial supervision, and community service
placements. </p>

<p> <b>Formulating solutions</b> </p>

<p> While individual parts of the system can help through such
practices as those highlighted above, one or two agencies in the
local justice system are not enough to bring about comprehensive
solutions to crowding. Jail crowding results from the actions of
many, with their decisions interacting to determine jail
admissions and length of confinement. Effectively combating
crowding requires taking into account the interactive nature of
the problem. </p>

<p> Jurisdictions that successfully implemented a systemwide
approach to jail crowding have identified as critical needs (1)
the participation of key decisionmakers in formulating solutions
and (2) detailed information on case processing and on the actual
characteristics of the jail population. </p>

<p> <b>Key decisionmaker participation - </b>Whether it is a
&quot;jail population management board&quot; or some other body,
experience in many jurisdictions argues for a forum that
encourages communication and participation by judges,
prosecutors, sheriffs, police, probation officials, and other
policymakers in developing solutions to crowding. </p>

<p> Collective involvement provides increased awareness of the
impact of one agency's actions on another and of the other
agency's procedures. Also, recommendations of a broadly
constituted planning group are more likely to gain systemwide
support. Finally, the political pragmatism that may accompany
committee action may permit some participants to support more
imaginative policies. </p>

<p> <b>Information - </b>A<b> </b>systemwide approach to jail
crowding requires improved information about jail use. In
addition to the detailed flowcharts that help assess the
timeliness of case-processing decisions and the availability of
nonjail options, planners need information on precisely who or
what type of person is in jail and why and how long they stay.
This permits administrators to learn the frequency of admissions
and the size and variation of distinct segments of the jail
population, as well as indicating sluggish case processing. </p>

<p> Statistical analysis of the population identifies symptoms of
jail crowding, greatly enhancing the ability to identify and
treat the causes. But while jail population data are valuable,
they should not overshadow case-processing information. </p>

<p> Analysis of data on the jail population might show, for
example, that persons detained before trial are released only
after 7 to 10<b> </b>days. Alone, this finding could indicate the
need for a special pretrial services program to expedite
screening and bail review. Information on caseflow, however,
might reveal the actual cause to be inefficient case processing. </p>

<p> Evaluation information is also critical to developing
effective strategies. Evaluation data should be collected and
analyzed to determine if planned modifications in decisionmaking
are being made and the resulting positive or negative
implications for crowding and public safety. </p>

<p> <b>Implementing strategies and conclusions</b> </p>

<p> Localities that take a systemwide approach to jail crowding
generally follow some important steps: </p>

<p> <b>Involve </b>all key system decisionmakers; </p>

<p> <b>Collect</b> all necessary data on jail population and case
processing; </p>

<p> <b>Identify</b>, implement, and evaluate appropriate changes
in programs or processes; and </p>

<p> <b>Inform</b> the public of system changes when initiated and
successful strategies when confirmed. </p>

<p> While many communities have taken great steps, experience has
also confirmed the complexity of the jail crowding problem and
the futility of seeking a panacea through one or two changes.
Long-term success requires a variety of solutions and, most
important, the time, patience, and attention of the entire
criminal justice community. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">From the
Director </h3>

<p> Communities throughout the Nation face the problem of jail
crowding: Having more prisoners than space to house them. Despite
construction innovations that may help cities or counties expand
their confinement capacity both more quickly and at less expense,
a host of problems, including fiscal pressures sometimes, may
indicate solutions other than construction. </p>

<p> Some consequences of jail crowding are well known: Increased
victimization and fear, decreased public confidence that
dangerous persons can be locked up, lawsuits, court-imposed
limits on the number of prisoners, damage to facilities and
equipment. Crowding increases both tension in the institution and
the strain on correctional budgets. </p>

<p> Less obvious but equally worrisome are delays in case
processing due to cumbersome access to prisoners and the limits
put on such necessary judicial options as pretrial release and
sentencing. </p>

<p> National Institute of Justice surveys have shown that
officials in law enforcement, courts, corrections, and other
parts of the justice system were virtually unanimous in naming
prison and jail crowding their number one concern. </p>

<p> Recognition of the gravity of jail crowding, however, offers
a glimmer of hope. Officials in a growing number of jurisdictions
have concluded that if each part of the local justice system does
what it can to ease crowding, the sum of all<b> </b>these small
solutions has a notable cumulative effect. </p>

<p> The separate decisions of law enforcement, judicial
prosecution, defense, pretrial services, probation, corrections,
and other officials can interact to influence the number of jail
admissions and length of confinement. Jurisdictions taking this
systemwide approach find that seemingly minor modifications in
case processing can both reduce crowding and, more important,
improve the overall administration of justice. </p>

<p> Jail crowding is a local problem that must be dealt with
locally. The National Institute of Justice hopes to contribute to
such endeavors, however, by assessing and synthesizing
information on the program and process changes that local
jurisdictions may want to consider. Without information on the
experience of other jurisdictions, informed policy decisions are
hard to come by. </p>

<p> At<b> </b>the Institute, our role is one articulated by
President Reagan and Attorney General Meese: To support, not to
direct, local responsibilities. Experience demonstrates that we
have many useful tools to deal with jail crowding. <i>This
Research in Brief </i>offers local jurisdictions their choice
among such options. </p>

<p> ADVANCE FOR RELEASE AT 5 P.M. EST </p>

<p> BJS SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1993 202-307-0784 </p>

<p> <b>20 YEARS OF MEASURING CRIME SHOWS FEWER OFFENSES OVERALL
BUT INCREASED VIOLENCE AGAINST MINORITIES AND THE YOUNG </b> </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C. -- After 20 years of asking Americans what
their actual experiences with crime have been, the Justice
Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) today identified
several long-term trends: </p>

<p> --Overall, the number of criminal victimizations dropped 6
percent since the annual National Crime Victimization Survey
began in 1973. </p>

<p> --The steepest declines are in household burglary and theft.
--Blacks are substantially more likely to be violent crime
victims than are whites. </p>

<p> --Young minority males in central cities are violent crime
victims at the highest rates the survey ever recorded. The data
are from the survey's 20th anniversary report, which noted that
more than 4.4 million interviews were conducted from 1973 through
last year. &quot;While the overall trends are positive, some
groups of Americans are disproportionately the victims of
increasing crime,&quot; observed Lawrence A. Greenfeld, the
acting BJS director. &quot;For example, last year blacks
experienced the highest per capita rates of violent crime in the
survey's history.&quot; &quot;The survey also documented the
growing ratio of violent crime,&quot; Greenfeld pointed out.
&quot;In 1973 about 15 percent of all crimes were violent
compared to 20 percent in 1992. Moreover, about a third of all
victims of violence report an injury.&quot; During the last two
decades an estimated 37 million victims were injured, and more
than one-third of those injured had no health insurance or were
not eligible for public health benefits. Among other report
highlights: </p>

<p> --Handguns are used in about 10 percent of all violent
crimes. Handgun crime rates are above the 1986 low but have not
returned to the highest rate reached in 1982. </p>

<p> --During 1991 an estimated $19.1 billion were lost directly
from personal and household crimes. </p>

<p> --Males are much more likely to be victims of violence
inflicted by strangers than by family members or other close
associates, whereas females are as likely to be hurt by family
members and close associates as by strangers. </p>

<p> --About 30 percent of all violent crimes and 25 percent of
home burglaries occur when the victim or victims are away from
home on a leisure activity. </p>

<p> --In approximately half of all female rapes the victim knew
the offender. Strangers used some type of weapon in 29 percent of
the offenses, compared to 17 percent by non-stranger rapists. </p>

<p> --In robberies during which the offender threatened the
victim before the attack, those victims who defended themselves
in some way were less likely to lose property but were more
likely to be injured than were victims who took no action. When
the offender had a handgun, the victim was seriously injured in 1
percent of the incidents in which self- protective measures were
not taken, compared to 7 percent when such action was taken. </p>

<p> --Households earning more than $30,000 annually are generally
more likely than are households in most other income categories
to experience theft of a motor vehicle, but as household income
rises, burglary rates fall. </p>

<p> --Black male teenagers (that is boys and young men from 12
through 19 years old) are more likely to be violent crime victims
than any other group of people. Their average annual rate is 113
victimizations per 1,000 residents--or almost one in nine black
teenagers. For white male teenagers the rate was 90 per 1,000--or
about one in 11. </p>

<p> --For adult black males (35 through 64 years) the violent
victimization rate was 35 per 1,000. For adult white males, 18
per 1,000; adult white females, 15; adult black females 13;
elderly (65 years or more) black males 12; elderly black females,
10; elderly white males, 6 and elderly white females, 3 per
1,000. The rate of criminal victimizations for all U.S. residents
compared to other life experiences is as follows: </p>

<p> Occurrences Yearly rate per 1,000 adults </p>

<p> Accidental injury, all circumstances 220 </p>

<p> Accidental injury at home 66 </p>

<p> Personal theft 61 </p>

<p> Accidental injury at work 47 </p>

<p> Violent victimization 31 </p>

<p> Assault (aggravated and simple) 25 </p>

<p> Motor vehicle accident injury 22 </p>

<p> Death, all causes 11 </p>

<p> Victimization with injury 11 </p>

<p> Aggravated assault 8 </p>

<p> Robbery 6 </p>

<p> Death from heart disease 5 </p>

<p> Death from cancer 3 </p>

<p> Rape (women only) 1 </p>

<p> Accidental death, all circumstances 0.4 </p>

<p> Death from pneumonia or influenza 0.4 </p>

<p> Death in motor vehicle accident 0.2 </p>

<p> Suicide 0.2 </p>

<p> Death from HIV infection 0.1 </p>

<p> Homicide and capital punishment executions 0.1 </p>

<p> The survey measures rape, robbery, assault, burglary,
personal and household larceny and motor vehicle theft. It does
not measure murder, kidnapping or commercial crimes. </p>

<p> Last year 39 percent of all these crimes were reported to
police--the highest since 1973, when it was 32 percent. The
increased reporting rate was consistent with the fact that
violent crime and motor vehicle theft have made up an increasing
proportion of total crime during the last two decades. The
highest reporting rate last year was for completed motor vehicle
theft--92 percent. The lowest was for personal larceny without

<p> DRUG DATA PRODUCED BY BJS </p>

<p> Many Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) programs produce data
on drug law enforcement, drug offenders, and drugs and crime. For
example -- * the BJS National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
asks victims of personal crimes if they believed the offenders
had been using drugs * the BJS Law Enforcement Management and
Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) program produces information on
drug-related programs of State and local police agencies </p>

<p> * the BJS National Pretrial Reporting Program (NPRP) examines
drug law violators' criminal histories and status at time of
arrest, pretrial release/detention status, trial appearance, and
disposition </p>

<p> * the BJS National Judicial Reporting Program (NJRP) compares
sentences given to drug offenders with those given to other
offenders </p>

<p> * BJS reports on Federal and State prisoners, jail inmates,
and incarcerated youth including data on their histories of drug
use and drug offenses </p>

<ul>
    <li>the BJS Federal Justice Statistics Program collects and
        publishes detailed data on drug law violators in the
        Federal justice system </li>
    <li>* the annual BJS Sourcebook of criminal justice
        statistics presents data on drug use in the general
        population and on public opinion toward drugs and
        enforcement of drug laws. </li>
</ul>

<p> Drugs and crime facts, 1994 presents the most current
information available relating to drugs and crime published by
BJS in over two dozen different reports through the end of
calendar 1994. This publication also highlights other drug data

Special Report, February 1994) examines the likelihood of
pretrial release, type of release, and pretrial misconduct of
Federal defendants, including Federal drug offenders. </p>

<p> * Women in prison (BJS Special Report, March 1994) reports on
female inmates in State prisons in 1991 including prior drug and
alcohol use, needle sharing behaviors, treatment, and prior
physical or sexual abuse of drug offenders. </p>

<p> * Comparing Federal and State prison inmates, 1991 (September
1994) describes the results of the first joint survey of
prisoners held in State and Federal prisons, including data on
the proportion of inmates incarcerated for a drug offense, prior
drug use, sentence length, prior treatment, use of a weapon, and
HIV infection. </p>

<p> * Felony sentences in the United States, 1990 (BJS Bulletin,
September 1994) compares sentencing statistics on State and
Federal courts, including the number of convictions for drug
offenses, type of sentence, sentence length, and estimated time
to be served. </p>

<p> * National Corrections Reporting Program, 1992 (October 1994)
is part of an annual series detailing the characteristics of
persons, including drug offenders, admitted to and released from
the prison and parole systems in the United States. </p>

November 1994) reports on criminal history, pretrial processing,
pretrial misconduct, adjudication, and sentencing of felony
defendants, including drug offenders, in State courts in large
urban counties. </p>

<p> * Federal law enforcement officers, 1993 (BJS Bulletin,
December 1994) reports on the number of Federal law enforcement
officers authorized to carry firearms and arrest offenders,
including Federal drug law violators. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Felony sentences in State courts, 1992 (BJS Bulletin,
        December 1994) reports on the number of felony drug
        convictions, sentence type and length, and case
        processing time for drug offenders. </li>
    <li>* Felony defendants in large urban counties, 1992
        (December 1994) describes demographic characteristics,

<p> DRUG USE BY OFFENDERS AT THE TIME OF OFFENSE </p>

<p> The BJS National Crime Victimization Survey asks victims of
the violent crimes of rape, robbery, and assault about their
perceptions of the offender's use of alcohol and drugs. In 30% of
violent crime victimizations in 1992, victims reported that they
believed their assailants were under the influence of drugs or
alcohol. In half of violent crime victimizations, the victim did
not know whether the offender was under the influence. </p>

<p> Data from BJS corrections surveys show that a quarter of
convicted jail inmates, a third of State prisoners, and
two-fifths of youths in long-term, State-operated facilities
admit that they were under the influence of an illegal drug at
the time of their offense. </p>

<p> Among jail inmates in 1989-- </p>

<p> * 44% used drugs in the month before the offense </p>

<p> * 30% used drugs daily in the month before the offense </p>

<p> * 27% used drugs at the time of the offense. </p>

<p> Jail inmates convicted of drug offenses most frequently
reported having been under the influence of drugs at the time of
their offense (39%), followed by convicted burglars (38%) and
robbers (36%). Jail inmates convicted of driving while
intoxicated (DWI) (12%), assault (14%), and homicide (18%) were
the least likely to report having been under the influence of
drugs at the time of the offense. </p>

<p> In 1991, 49% of all State prison inmates reported that they
were under the influence of drugs or alcohol or both at the time
they committed the offense for which they were currently
sentenced: 17% were under the influence of drugs only, and 14%
were under the influence of drugs and alcohol. </p>

<p> Half of the State prisoners said they had taken illegal drugs
during the month before committing the crime. </p>

<p> Among violent offenders in State prisons-- </p>

<p> * 61% said that they or their victims were under the
influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the offense </p>

<p> * 50% reported being under the influence of alcohol or drugs
at the time of the offense </p>

<p> * 30% said their victims were under the influence of alcohol
or drugs. </p>

<p> Nearly 40% of the youth incarcerated in long-term,
State-operated facilities in 1987 said they were under the
influence of drugs at the time of their offense. </p>

<p> Data from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Drug Use
Forecasting (DUF) program revealed that of a sample of adult
males arrested in 23 U.S. cities in 1993, the percent testing
positive for any drug ranged from 54% in Omaha and San Jose to
81% in Chicago. Among the 20 cities reporting data on female
arrestees, the percent of females testing positive for any drug
ranged from 42% in San Antonio to 83% in Manhattan. </p>

<p> PRIOR DRUG USE BY OFFENDERS </p>

<p> Data from BJS surveys show that 78% of jail inmates in 1989,
79% of State prisoners in 1991, 60% of Federal prisoners in 1991,
and 83% of youth in long-term public juvenile facilities in 1987
had used drugs at some point in their lives. </p>

<p> Although drug use by State prison inmates in the month before
the offense fell between 1986 and 1991, a higher proportion of
inmates reported use of cocaine or crack in 1991 than 1986. One
in three inmates who ever used drugs in the past used a needle to
inject drugs. Fifteen percent of inmates who had ever used drugs
had shared a needle at least once. </p>

<p> * any drug was 16 </p>

<p> * a major drug (including heroin, crack, cocaine, PCP, LSD,
and methadone) was 18 </p>

<p> * a major drug regularly was 20. </p>

<p> Sixty percent of jail inmates who ever used any drug reported
they had done so more than a year before their first arrest. Of
inmates who reported using a major drug regularly, 55% had not
done so until after their first arrest. </p>

<p> Almost 83% of youth in long-term, State-operated juvenile
facilities in 1987 reported use of an illegal drug in the past,
and 63% had used an illegal drug on a regular basis. The most
commonly mentioned drugs were marijuana, cocaine, and
amphetamines. </p>

<p> Among drug-using youth in long-term, State- operated juvenile
facilities, 19% said they first used drugs before age 10; 38%
reported their first use was before age 12. </p>

<p> DRUG-RELATED CRIME </p>

<p> Overall, 10% of Federal prison inmates in 1991, 17% of State
prison inmates in 1991, and 13% of convicted jail inmates in 1989
said they committed their offense to obtain money for drugs.
Twenty percent of Hispanic State prison inmates said they
committed their offense to get money for drugs, compared to 15%
of white inmates and 17% of black inmates. Twenty-four percent of
female inmates said they committed their offense to get money to
buy drugs, compared to 16% of male inmates. </p>

<p> Inmates incarcerated for robbery, burglary, larceny, and drug
trafficking most often committed their crime to obtain money for
drugs. </p>

<p> Inmates who committed homicide, sexual assault, assault, and

<p> The Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR) of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that in 1993, 5.5% of the
23,271 homicides in which circumstances were known were
narcotics- related. This includes only those murders that
occurred specifically during a narcotics felony, such as drug
trafficking or manufacturing. Those homicides that involved a
narcotics felony and a more serious felony, such as armed
robbery, were not tabulated as drug-related. </p>

<p> A study of murder cases disposed in the Nation's 75 most
populous counties in 1988 found that circumstances involving
illegal drugs, such as a drug scam or dispute over drugs,
accounted for 18% of the defendants and 16% of the victims. In 7%
of cases, victims and their killers were both at the murder scene
because of drugs. Of victims, 12% were involved with the killer
in a drug relationship. </p>

<p> DRUG LAW ENFORCEMENT </p>

<p> Federal, State, and local agencies share responsibility for
enforcing the Nation's drug laws, although most arrests are made
by State and local authorities. State and local police made an
estimated 1.1 million arrests for drug law violations in 1993,
according to the FBI. </p>

<p> As reported in the 1993 BJS Sourcebook of criminal justice
statistics-- </p>

<p> * the Federal Government seized 6,605 clandestine drug
laboratories between fiscal years 1975 and 1993 </p>

<p> * in fiscal year 1993, of the 286 labs seized, 237 (83%)
manufactured methamphetamines </p>

<p> * in 1993 the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) program
for eradicating domestic marijuana resulted in the destruction
of393 million plants in 64,132 plots, 12,397 arrests, 6,062
weapons seized, and assets seized valued at $52 million </p>

<p> * in fiscal year 1993 DEA confiscated 133,665 pounds of
cocaine, 1,590 pounds of heroin, 39 pounds of opium, 314,054
pounds of marijuana, 2.8 million dosage units of hallucinogens,
and 80.5 million dosage units of stimulants </p>

<p> * in fiscal year 1993 the DEA completed 16,690 asset seizures
valued at $680 million </p>

<p> * in fiscal year 1993 the U.S. Customs Service seized 507,249
pounds of marijuana, 175,318 pounds of cocaine, and 17.9 million
dosage units of drugs such as LSD and barbiturates </p>

<p> * in 1993 the U.S. Coast Guard confiscated 48,441 pounds of
marijuana and 32,313 pounds of cocaine </p>

<p> * in fiscal year 1993 the U.S. Postal Service made 2,193
arrests for mailing controlled </p>

<p> substances </p>

<p> * in 1992 State and Federal courts authorized wiretaps in 634
narcotics cases. </p>

<p> Drug seizure data from different Federal agencies should not
be added together because in many instances more than one agency
participated in the operations. The Federal-wide Drug Seizure
System (FDSS) reflects the combined drug seizure efforts of the
DEA, FBI, and the U.S. Customs Service within the jurisdiction of
the United States, as well as maritime seizures by the U.S. Coast
Guard. FDSS eliminates duplicate reporting of a seizure involving
more than one Federal agency. </p>

were seized in fiscal 1993 by the Federal agencies participating
in FDSS: </p>

<p> DRUG ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS </p>

<p> As reported in Federal law enforcement officers, 1993, as of
December 1993, Federal agencies employed about 69,000 full-time
personnel authorized to make arrests and carry firearms. The DEA
employed 2,813 full-time agents. These officers investigate major
narcotics violators, enforce regulations governing the
manufacture and dispensing of controlled substances, and perform
a variety of other functions in support of drug trafficking
prevention and control. </p>

<p> The FBI employed 10,075 full-time agents. These agents
investigate more than 250 types of Federal crimes. The FBI has
concurrent jurisdiction with the DEA over drug offenses under the
Controlled Substances Act. </p>

<p> According to the BJS Law Enforcement Management and
Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) program, in 1990, about 9,300
local police departments, 2,500 sheriffs' departments, and 34
State police departments, employing over 500,000 full-time
officers, had primary responsibility for drug law enforcement. </p>

<p> Drug-related law enforcement activities include making
arrests and seizing drugs as well as laboratory testing of drugs,
drug education, and drug testing of arrestees and agency
employees. Most agencies serving 50,000 or more residents
operated a special drug enforcement unit, participated in a
multiagency task force, and received money or goods from an asset
forfeiture program: </p>

<p> * Special drug units focus on conducting investigations on
drug traffickers and drug-related activities in the community. </p>

<p> * To coordinate efforts with other law enforcement agencies
to accumulate evidence, most large agencies participate in a
multiagency task force. These task forces develop enforcement
strategies such as the use of informants, surveillance, and
undercover operations. </p>

<p> * Most States have laws that allow the government to seize
convicted drug traffickers' assets, such as cash, bank accounts,
planes, boats, cars, and homes. Many State laws require that all
forfeited assets go to the State and/or local treasury upon
payment of outstanding loans. In some States, law enforcement
agencies can keep all property, cash, and proceeds from sales of
what is forfeited. </p>

laboratory testing of drugs, but only the largest municipal and
county agencies tended to have such responsibility </p>

<p> * 90% of municipal police departments with 100 or more

<p> PRETRIAL RELEASE OF DRUG DEFENDANTS </p>

<p> The National Pretrial Reporting Program (NPRP) revealed that
of persons charged with a felony drug offense in 1992 in the 75
most populous counties-- </p>

<p> * 68% were released prior to case disposition </p>

<p> * 27% were held with bail set </p>

<p> * 5% were held without bail. </p>

<p> The median amount of bail set for a person charged with a
drug offense was $5,000. Defendants charged with a drug offense
were more likely to secure release (29%) when bail was set at
$20,000 or more than those charged with a violent offense (17%),
public-order offense (18%), or a property offense (11%). </p>

<p> Of felony drug defendants released prior to the disposition
of their case, 51% were released within 1 day of their arrest,
79% within 1 week, and 93% within 1 month. </p>

<p> Of felony drug defendants released before case disposition,
27% failed to make a scheduled court appearance within 1 year.
Seventy percent of the defendants who failed to appear returned
to court by the end of the 1-year study period, while 30%
remained fugitives. </p>

<p> Sixteen percent of released drug defendants were known to
have been rearrested while on pretrial release. </p>

<p> Of all released defendants rearrested for a drug offense, 59%
were once again granted pretrial release. </p>

<p> PROSECUTION AND SENTENCING OF FEDERAL DRUG LAW VIOLATORS </p>

<p> The number of suspects prosecuted for drug offenses increased
from 7,697 in 1981 to 25,663 in 1991. U.S. attorneys declined to
prosecute 22.3% (7,814) of suspected drug offenders who were
investigated in matters closed in 1991, a lower percentage than
for offenders suspected of violent offenses (29.5%), property
offenses (48.5%), and public-order offenses (36%). </p>

<p> The number of persons convicted of violating Federal drug
laws rose to 17,349 in 1991 from 5,981 in 1981. This 190%
increase exceeded the 53% growth in U.S. district court
convictions for all Federal offenses during the same years and
accounted for over 67% of the total increase in Federal
convictions. </p>

<p> The number of defendants convicted of drug possession
offenses increased from 498 in 1981 to 1,163 in 1991 -- a 134%
increase. Drug possession convictions were 7% of all drug
convictions in 1991. </p>

<p> Drug offenses accounted for 19% of all defendants convicted
in 1981 and 35% of all defendants convicted in 1991. Drug
trafficking offenses alone accounted for 33% of all defendants
convicted in 1991. The conviction rate for drug defendants
increased from 76% in 1981 to 84% in 1991. </p>

<p> The percentage of offenders convicted of drug offenses
sentenced to prison rose from 73% in 1981 to 87% in 1991. </p>

<p> The average prison sentence for persons charged with Federal
drug violations was longer than for all other offenses except
violent crimes in 1991. </p>

<p> Public-order offenses 38 </p>

<p> Drug offenders are receiving longer sentences and are serving
a larger percentage of their sentence than in the past. The
average Federal prison sentence for drug offenses rose from 62
months in 1986 to 86 months in 1991. The average percent of
sentence served until first release increased from 60% in 1985 to
68% in 1990. Contributing to these increases are the sentencing
guidelines that went into effect in 1987 and the 1986 and 1988
anti-drug abuse laws which prescribed stiffer sentences and
mandatory minimum incarceration terms for Federal offenders. </p>

<p> In the United States in 1990 there were an estimated-- </p>

<p> * 324,235 adults arrested for drug trafficking </p>

<p> * 168,360 felony drug trafficking convictions </p>

<p> * 129,637 drug traffickers sentenced to incarceration </p>

<p> * 82,496 drug traffickers sentenced to State prison or 25 for
every 100 drug trafficking arrests. According to data from the
BJS National Prosecutor Survey Program, in 1992, 1 in 5 State
prosecutors' offices had a specialized narcotics unit. Based on
statutes enacted in the previous 3 years-- </p>

<p> * 23% of the offices prosecuted cases based on recently
enacted statutes addressing controlled substances, such as
anabolic steroids and precursor chemicals </p>

<p> * 21% prosecuted cases addressing illegal drugs in a school

<p> * 42% were white, 57% black, and 1% of other races </p>

<p> * the average age was 30 </p>

<p> * 50% were between ages 20 and 29. </p>

<p> Ninety percent of drug trafficking convictions in 1990
resulted from guilty pleas; 4% resulted from jury trials; and 4%
resulted from bench trials. </p>

<p> Drug offenders comprised a third of all persons convicted of
a felony in State courts in 1990. </p>

<p> Drug traffickers accounted for 20% of all convicted felons;
drug possessors also accounted for 13% of all convicted felons. </p>

<p> Seventy-seven percent of persons convicted of drug
trafficking in 1990 were sentenced to some kind of incarceration:
28% to jail and 49% to prison; 23% were sentenced to probation.
The average prison sentence for persons convicted of drug
trafficking was 6 years 2 months, of which the estimated time to
be served was 1 year 11 months. </p>

<p> DRUG OFFENDERS IN CORRECTIONAL POPULATIONS </p>

<p> Drug law violators make up a growing share of the prison and
jail population: </p>

<p> * drug offenders accounted for 61% of sentenced inmates in
Federal prisons in 1993, up from 38% in 1986 and 25% in 1980 </p>

<p> * the proportion of drug offenders in State prisons increased
from 9% in 1986 to 21% in 1991 </p>

<p> * the proportion of drug offenders in local jails increased
from 9% in 1983 to 23% in 1989. </p>

<p> Of State prisoners in 1991: </p>

<p> * 8% were sentenced for drug possession and 13% were
sentenced for drug trafficking </p>

<p> * women were more likely to be incarcerated for a drug
offense than men (33% versus 21%) </p>

<p> * inmates serving time for drug trafficking accounted for 3%
of inmates sentenced to life or death </p>

<p> * blacks were more likely to be serving time for a drug
offense than whites (25% versus 12%), but less than Hispanic
inmates (33%). </p>

<p> In 1991, 10% of the 57,661 juveniles detained in public
juvenile facilities were committed for drug-related offenses,
according to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention, as presented in the 1993 BJS Sourcebook of Criminal
Justice Statistics. Juveniles held in facilities, by type of

<p> The BJS 1990 Census of State and Federal Correctional
Facilities reported on drug treatment and intervention programs
for 1,024 correctional facilities. Prisons may offer many types
of drug intervention or treatment: detoxification, counseling,
education and or awareness programs, urine surveillance, and
treatment in special residential units within the facility-- </p>

<p> * Federal facilities reported they could test 33% of inmates
for drugs; State confinement facilities, 10%; and community-based
facilities, 57%. </p>

<p> * Counseling was available for 14% of inmates in Federal
facilities, 12% in State, and 48% in community-based facilities. </p>

<p> * Residential treatment program capacity was from 1% to 2% of
inmate population for all types of institutions. </p>

<p> Of all Federal inmates, 9% were enrolled in some form of drug
treatment on June 29, 1990. Among State prisoners, 14% in
confinement facilities were enrolled and 37% in community-based
facilities were enrolled. The two most common types of programs
for both Federal and State correctional facilities were education
and counseling. </p>

<p> According to data from the 1991 Survey of Inmates in State
Correctional Facilities, 43% of all inmates had participated in a
drug treatment program; 36% received their most recent treatment
while incarcerated. Group counseling was the most frequent type
of treatment program. </p>

<p> In 1991, about 57% of Federal drug offenders and 52% of drug
offenders in state prisons were tested for the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In Federal prisons, property (1.4%)
and violent (1.1%) offenders had higher positive HIV rates than
drug (0.6%) and public-order offenders (0.6%). In State prisons,
drug (3.2%) and property (2.7%) offenders had higher rates than
public-order (1.9%) and violent (1.4%) offenders. </p>

<p> Drug using offenders have a higher risk for infection with
AIDS-- </p>

<p> * 3.2% of Federal inmates and 4.9% of State inmates who used
a needle to inject drugs, tested positive </p>

<p> * 5.5% of Federal inmates and 7.1% of State inmates who
shared needles to inject drugs, tested positive. About 4% of drug
offenders in Federal prisons and 15% of drug offenders in State
prisons who had shared needles, were HIV positive. </p>

<p> DRUG ENFORCEMENT IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES </p>

<p> Data from the BJS 1990 Census of State and </p>

<p> Federal Correctional Facilities describe the various methods
used to prevent illegal entry of drugs into prisons and to stop
the use of illegal drugs by those under correctional supervision.
These methods include drug testing, questioning, patdowns,
clothing exchanges, and body cavity searches. </p>

<p> Most prison facilities required new admissions and inmates
returning from temporary release to be patted down and required
them to exchange their clothing for prison-furnished clothing. </p>

<p> Interdiction efforts were more stringent in maximum security
prisons than in medium or minimum security facilities. All
Federal maximum security prisons required clothing exchanges,
compared to 81% of Federal medium security prisons and 78% of
Federal minimum security facilities. Prison visitors are also
subjected to interdiction activities. Most visitors were
questioned verbally and were subjected to searches of their
belongings. Patdowns and body cavity searches were usually
conducted if visitors were suspected of carrying drugs or
paraphernalia. </p>

<p> To prevent drugs from being brought into facilities, prison
staff are subjected to interdiction activities, particularly when
under suspicion of drug smuggling. Staff were questioned in 45%
of Federal facilities and 23% of State facilities upon suspicion
of drug involvement. Staff were patted down on suspicion in 19%
of Federal facilities and 14% of State facilities. </p>

<p> The 1990 Census revealed that 7 out of 8 institutions conduct
urine tests on inmates to detect drug use. Of the tests conducted
between July 1, 1989, and June 30, 1990, evidence of drug use
among State prison inmates was detected in about-- </p>

<p> * 1 in 16 tests for marijuana </p>

<p> * 1 in 28 tests for cocaine </p>

<p> * 1 in 50 tests for methamphetamines </p>

<p> * 1 in 75 tests for heroin. </p>

<p> Among tests conducted among Federal prison inmates, positive
test results were found in approximately-- </p>

<p> * 1 in 100 tests for marijuana </p>

<p> * 1 in 250 tests for cocaine </p>

<p> * 1 in 250 tests for heroin </p>

<p> * 1 in 1,000 tests for methamphetamines. </p>

<p> Most facilities conducted urine tests upon suspicion of drug
use. One in five facilities systematically conducted urine tests
on all inmates at least once during their confinement. </p>

large jail jurisdictions conducted urinalysis on inmates. Of the
308 jurisdictions testing for drug use, 219 reported testing
inmates upon suspicion of drug use, 159 conducted random tests,
153 tested inmates on return from the community, and 35 tested

<p> DRUGS AND YOUTH </p>

<p> The National Institute on Drug Abuse has sponsored a survey
of high school seniors each year since 1975. As reported in the
1993 BJS Sourcebook of criminal justice statistics, of 1993 high
school seniors-- </p>

<p> * 35.3% reported having ever used marijuana/hashish </p>

<p> * 6.1% reported having ever used cocaine </p>

<p> * 1.1% reported having ever used heroin. </p>

<p> Self-reports of drug use among high school seniors may
underrepresent drug use among youth of that age because high
school dropouts and truants are not included, and these groups
may have more involvement with drugs than those who stay in
school. </p>

<p> The 1993 high school seniors were asked, &quot;How much do
you think people risk harming themselves?&quot; </p>

<p> Those students answering &quot;great risk&quot; in regular
use accounted for the following percentages-- </p>

<p> * marijuana, 72.5%, up from a low of 34.9% in 1978, but down
from 76.5% in 1992 </p>

<p> * cocaine, 90%, up from a low of 68.2% in 1977 and 1978 </p>

<p> * heroin, 88.3%, virtually stable since 1975 </p>

<p> * LSD, 79.4%, following a low of 79.1% in 1977 and a high of
84.5% in 1990. </p>

<p> Data from the National Crime Victimization Survey </p>

<p> School Crime Supplement show that in the first half of 1989,
2 out of 3 students ages 12 to 19 reported availability of drugs
at their school. </p>

<p> Availability of drugs was reported more often by-- </p>

<p> * public school students (70%) than by private school
students (52%) </p>

<p> * students in grades 9 to 12, compared to students in grades
6 to 8. </p>

<p> Similar rates of drug availability were reported by-- </p>

<p> * white students (69%) and black students (67%) </p>

<p> * students residing in cities (66%), suburban areas (67%),
and nonmetropolitan areas (71%). </p>

<p> The survey also showed that most drugs, while available, were
difficult to obtain. </p>

<p> As reported in the 1991 BJS Sourcebook of criminal justice
statistics, a 1990 national survey of fifth and sixth graders
found that-- </p>

<p> * 15% knew adults or older kids who tried or who use
marijuana; 5% knew kids their own age who tried or who use
marijuana </p>

<p> * 10% knew adults or older kids who tried or who use cocaine;
2% knew kids their own age who use cocaine or crack </p>

<p> * 90% agreed with the statement &quot;drugs bought on the
street are not safe to use&quot; </p>

<p> * 7% said they will probably have tried drugs by the time
they enter high school. </p>

<p> GANGS </p>

<p> About 6% of State prison inmates belonged to a gang prior to
incarceration, according to data from the 1991 Survey of Inmates
in State Correctional Facilities. </p>

<p> Among inmates who were gang members </p>

<p> . 81% reported past drug use </p>

<p> . 69% said they manufactured, imported, or sold drugs as a
group </p>

<p> . 92% reported their gang fought other groups. </p>

<p> Of inmates who reported belonging to a gang before entering
prison, 32% were still members at the time of incarceration. On
average, they had joined a gang at age 14. Half reported that
their gang had 60 or more members. </p>

<p> In 1991, among Federal offenders who had trafficked in,
grown, or manufactured illegal drugs or who had managed drug
money, 25% said they were a member of a group or organization
that engaged in illegal drug activities. About 11% were leaders
or middle men in a drug organization. About 9% belonged to
organizations with 11 or more members. </p>

<p> Fifteen percent of students ages 12 to 19 reported the
presence of street gangs at their school, according to 1989 data
from the National Crime Victimization Survey School Crime
Supplement. </p>

<p> Seventy-eight percent of students who reported gang presence
at their school said drugs were available compared to 66% of
students who reported gangs were not present. </p>

<p> Students at schools with gangs were more likely to fear an
attack both at school and on the way to school and were more
likely to avoid certain areas inside the school. </p>

<p> DRUG USE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION </p>

<p> According to data from the 1993 Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Administration (SAMHSA) National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse-- </p>

<p> * 77 million Americans age 12 or older (37% of the
population) reported use of an illicit drug at least once in
their lifetime </p>

<p> * 12% reported use of a drug within the past year </p>

<p> * 6% reported use of a drug within the past month. </p>

number of drug-related emergency room episodes and drug-related
deaths. </p>

<p> The SAMHSA Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) reported an
estimated 433,493 drug-related episodes in hospital emergency
rooms nationwide in 1992, an 10% increase from 393,968 in 1991. A
total of 7,532 deaths related to drug abuse were reported in 1992
by medical examiners in 38 metropolitan areas. </p>

<p> PUBLIC OPINION ABOUT DRUGS </p>

<p> As reported in the 1993 BJS Sourcebook of criminal justice
statistics, the percentage of Gallup Poll respondents describing
drug abuse as the single most important problem facing our
country peaked in 1989: </p>

<p> Drug abuse most serious </p>

<p> Date of poll problem </p>

<p> January 1985 2% </p>

<p> July 1986 8 </p>

<p> April 1987 11 </p>

<p> September 1988 11 </p>

<p> May 1989 27 </p>

<p> November 1989 38 </p>

<p> April 1990 30 </p>

<p> July 1990 18 </p>

<p> March 1991 11 </p>

<p> March 1992 8 </p>

<p> January 1993 6 </p>

<p> January 1994 9 </p>

<p> Among Gallup Poll respondents, the use of drugs was most
often mentioned as one of the biggest problems for schools in
their communities. Giving that response in 1993 were-- </p>

<p> * 14% of public school parents </p>

<p> * 9% of nonpublic school parents </p>

<p> * 17% of those with no children in school </p>

<p> * 16% of all surveyed. </p>

<p> When asked about spending for various social problems, 60% of
the respondents to a 1993 National Opinion Research Center (NORC)
Poll said this country is spending too little to deal with drug
addiction. </p>

<p> In 1990 Gallup Poll respondents were asked how best the
government should allocate its resources in its fight against
drugs: </p>

<p> * 40% said &quot;teaching young people about the dangers of
drugs&quot; </p>

<p> * 28% said &quot;working with foreign governments to stop the
export of drugs to this country&quot; </p>

<p> * 19% said &quot;arresting people in this country who sell
drugs&quot; </p>

<p> * 5% said &quot;helping drug users to overcome their
addiction to drugs&quot; </p>

<p> * 4% said &quot;arresting the people who use drugs.&quot; </p>

<p> Gallup Poll respondents were asked, &quot;What is the most
important thing that can be done to help reduce crime?&quot; In
1989, the most frequent response was to cut the drug supply
(25%), followed by harsher punishment (24%). In 1981, 3% of
respondents mentioned cutting the drug supply, while harsher
punishment was mentioned by 38% of respondents. </p>

<p> NORC has asked adults (age 18 or older) about legalization of
marijuana since 1973. In 1993, 22% believed that marijuana should
be made legal, down from a peak of 30% in 1978. </p>

<p> College freshmen have been surveyed by NORC since 1968. In
1993, 28.2% of those surveyed agreed strongly or somewhat that
marijuana should be legalized, down from a high of 52.9% in 1977
and up from a low of 16.7% in 1989. Of 1993 high school seniors--
</p>

<p> * 22.8% felt using marijuana should be legal, down from 32.9%
feeling that way in 1978 and up from a low of 14.9% in 1986 </p>

<p> * 75.5% reported worrying often or sometimes about drug
abuse, up from 65.5% in 1978 and down from 82.6% in 1990. </p>

<p> In 1990 a Gallup Poll asked what respondents felt would be
the effect of legalizing drugs: </p>

<p> Effect of legalization would increase: </p>

<p> Drug use in public schools 65% </p>

<p> The number of addicts 67 </p>

<p> The number of drug overdoses 63 </p>

<p> Drug-related crime 52 </p>

</p>

<p> This Bulletin presents counts of the Nation's prisoners at
the end of 1990. The 1990 increase of nearly 59,000 prisoners
equals a demand for approximately 1,100 new prison beds per week
nationwide. Prisons were estimated to be operating from 18% to
29% above their capacities at yearend. </p>

<p> Strong evidence exists that during the 1980's there was an
increasing probability that a convicted offender would go to
prison. The ratio of prison admissions to reported serious crimes
and arrests for serious crimes increased to levels unequalled in
almost 30 years of reporting. </p>

<p> The Bureau of Justice Statistics expresses its appreciation
to the departments of corrections in the 50 States, the District
of Columbia, and the Federal Prison System, that make it possible
for us to gather and report data on the Nation's prisoners. </p>

<p> PRISONERS IN 1990 </p>

<p> By Robyn L. Cohen </p>

<p> BJS Statistician </p>

<p> The number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of Federal or
State correctional authorities at yearend 1990 reached a record
high of 771,243. The States and the District of Columbia added
52,331 prisoners; the Federal system, 6,355. The increase for
1990 brings total growth in the prison population since 1980 to
441,422 - an increase of about 134% in the 10-year period. </p>

<p> The 1990 growth rate (8.2%) was less than the percentage
increase recorded during 1989 (13.5%), and the number of new
prisoners added during 1990 was 26,271 less than the number added
during the preceding year (84,957). The 1990 increase translates
into a nationwide need for approximately 1,100 prison bedspaces
per week, compared to 1,600 prison bedspaces per week needed in
1989. </p>

<p> Prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year (referred to as
&quot;sentenced prisoners&quot;) accounted for 96% of the total
prison population at the end of 1990, growing by 8.6% during the
year. The remaining prisoners had sentences of a year or less or
were unsentenced (like those, for example, awaiting trial in
States with combined prison-jail systems). </p>

<p> The number of sentenced Federal prisoners increased at a
faster rate than sentenced prisoners in the States during the
year (10.7% versus 8.5%). For States, the rate of increase in the
number of sentenced prisoners was lower than in 1989 (13%). </p>

<p> Among the 13,318 Federal prisoners with no sentences or
sentences of a year or less were 1,910 under the jurisdiction of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a decrease of 45 from
the number held at the end of 1989 (1,955). The number of Federal
prisoners with no sentences or sentences of less than a year
increased by 1,315 during 1990 (from 12,003 to 13,318), while the
number of sentenced prisoners increased by 5,040. </p>

<p> Total prison populations in Alaska, the District of Columbia,
Oregon, Rhode Island, and Tennessee altogether decreased by 1,675
inmates during 1990. The District of Columbia accounted for more
than half of this decline. The percentage of growth was the
highest during 1990 in Vermont (15.9%), Washington (15.4%), and
New Hampshire (15.1%). Thirteen States reported total prisoner
increases of 10% or more since yearend 1989. California's
increase of more than 10,000 prisoners during the year was the
largest gain in the number of prisoners for any single
jurisdiction. At the end of 1990, about 1 in 8 prisoners
nationwide were confined in a California institution. California
accounted for more than 17% of the increase nationwide during the
year. </p>

<p> Rates of Incarceration Increase </p>

<p> On December 31, 1990, the number of sentenced prisoners per
100,000 residents was 293, also setting a new record. Ten of the
16 jurisdictions with rates equal to or greater than the rate for
the Nation were located in the South, 4 were in the West, 1 was
in the Midwest, and 1 was in the Northeast. </p>

<p> Since 1980 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000
residents has risen nearly 111%, from 139 to 293. During this
period, per capita incarceration rates have grown most rapidly in
the Northeast, increasing by 167% (from 87 to 232) and the West,
up by nearly 163% (from 105 to 276). The per capita number of
sentenced prisoners in the Midwest climbed 119% (from 109 to
239), and the rate rose 68% in the South (from 188 to 315). The
number of sentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents
has increased 133% (from 9 to 21) over the same period. </p>

<p> Prison Populations in Western States Grow the Fastest </p>

<p> Regionally, during 1990 the percentage increase in the number
of sentenced prisoners was highest in the Western States, with a
gain of 9.2%. The number of sentenced prisoners grew by 8.8% in
the Northeast, 8.8% in the South, and 6.9% in the Midwestern
States. The sentenced Federal prison population grew by 10.7%. </p>

<p> In 13 States the percentage change in the number of sentenced
prisoners during 1990 was equal to or higher than that of 1989.
Among these jurisdictions, four had increases of at least 10%,
led by New Hampshire (15.1%), Texas (13.7%), Alabama (13.2%), and
Georgia (10.1%). </p>

<p> From the end of 1985 to December 31, 1990, net gains in the
number of sentenced prisoners have averaged about 1,000 prisoners
per week - a weekly gain of about 922 State prisoners and 75
Federal prisoners per week over the period. The largest net gains
have occurred in the South (306 inmates per week) followed by the
West (243), the Midwest (194), and the Northeast (179). During
1990 average growth in the number of sentenced State and Federal
prisoners was equal to a demand for 1,131 additional bed- spaces
per week, about 354 fewer than the average weekly growth in 1989.
</p>

<p> The sentenced prisoner population had increased in four
States by 90% or more since 1985: California (94%), Colorado
(107%), Michigan (93%), and New Hampshire (97%). California's
increase of 45,796 sentenced prisoners since 1985 accounts for
72% of the increase for the West and 19% of the increase among
all States over the period. In 1985, 10.8% of the Nation's
sentenced State prisoners were in California; in 1990, 13.7%. </p>

<p> Male Prisoner Population Growth Outpaces that of Females </p>

<p> The number of male inmates (727,398) increased at a faster
rate during 1990 (8.3%) than the number of female inmates (7.9%).
This is the first year since 1981 that the number of male inmates
has increased at a faster rate than the number of female inmates.
The rate of incarceration for sentenced males (566 per 100,000
males in the resident population) was about 18 times higher than
for sentenced females (31 per 100,000 females in the resident
population). At the end of 1990, women accounted for 5.7% of
prisoners nationwide. </p>

<p> The 1990 growth rate (7.9%) for female inmates was less than
the percentage increase recorded during 1989 (24.4%). As shown
below, the percentage change was lower in 1990 across all the
regions and at the Federal level. </p>

<p> Percent Increase in Female Inmate Population </p>

<p> 1989-90 1988-89 </p>

<p> Total 7.9% 24.4% </p>

<p> Federal 13.0 36.8 </p>

<p> State 7.2 23.1 Northeast 9.2 29.8 </p>

<p> Midwest 7.1 19.5 </p>

<p> South 7.2 23.6 </p>

<p> West 6.3 22.3 </p>

<p> In 1990, 22 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal
system had more than 500 female inmates. Among these
jurisdictions, 10 had increases of at least 10%, led by New
Jersey's increase of 17.5% (from 886 in 1989 to 1,041 in 1990).
California's increase during 1990, 502 inmates, accounted for
15.7% of the nationwide increase of 3,199. </p>

<p> Local Jails Held More than 18,000 Because of State Prison
Crowding </p>

<p> At the end of 1990, 21 jurisdictions reported a total of
18,380 State prisoners held in local jails or other facilities
because of crowding in State facilities. The number of State
prisoners held locally decreased by 3.6% over that of yearend
1989. Three States - Louisiana, New Jersey, and Virginia -
accounted for more than half of the prisoners sentenced to prison
but incarcerated locally. Five States - Arkansas, Louisiana, New
Jersey, Tennessee, and Virginia - held more than 10% of their
State- sentenced prisoners in local jails because of State
facility crowding. Overall, 2.4% of the State prison population
was confined in local jails on December 31, 1990, because of
prison crowding. </p>

<p> Prison Capacity Estimates are Difficult to Compare </p>

<p> The extent of crowding in the Nation's prisons is difficult
to determine precisely because of the absence of uniform measures
for defining capacity. A wide variety of capacity measures is in
use among the 52 reporting jurisdictions because capacity may
reflect both available space to house inmates and the ability to
staff and operate an institution. To estimate the capacity of the
Nation's prisons, jurisdictions were asked to supply up to three
measures for yearend 1990 - rated, operational, and design
capacities. These measures were defined as follows: </p>

<p> - Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by
a rating official to institutions within the jurisdiction. </p>

<p> - Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can be
accommodated based on a facility's staff, existing programs, and
services. </p>

<p> - Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners or
architects intended for the facility. </p>

<p> Of the 52 reporting jurisdictions, 32 supplied rated
capacities, 42 provided operational capacities, and 38 submitted
design capacities. As a result, estimates of total capacity and
measures of the relationship to population are based on the
highest and lowest capacity figures provided. (Twenty-six
jurisdictions reported 1 capacity measure or gave the same figure
for each capacity measure they reported.) </p>

<p> Most Jurisdictions are Operating Above Capacity </p>

<p> Prisons generally require reserve capacity to operate
efficiently. Prison dormitories and cells need to be maintained
and repaired periodically, special housing is needed for
protective custody and disciplinary cases, and space may be
needed to cope with emergencies. At the end of 1990, nine States
reported they were operating below 95% of their highest capacity.
</p>

<p> Forty-two jurisdictions and the Federal prison system
reported operating at 100% or more of their lowest capacity; 34
of these held populations that met or exceeded their highest
reported capacities. </p>

<p> Overall, at the end of 1990 State prisons were estimated to
be operating at 115% of their highest capacities and 127% of
their lowest capacities. Prisons in Southern States were found to
be operating closest to their reported capacity on each measure. </p>

<p> The Federal system was estimated to be operating at 51% over
capacity. Between 1989 and 1990, State and Federal prison
capacities were estimated to have increased by approximately
20,000-50,000 beds. At the end of 1990, prisons nationwide were
estimated to be from 18% to 29% over their capacities. </p>

<p> Prison Population Growth may Reflect Increasing Certainty of
Punishment </p>

<p> There is some evidence that during the period 1980-89 changes
in criminal justice policies have increased a criminal's
probability of being incarcerated from levels existing in prior
years. </p>

<p> Murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, and burglary are among the most serious crimes and
account for approximately half of prison commitments from courts.
In 1960 there were 62 prison commitments for every 1,000 of these
crimes reported to law enforcement agencies. During the rest of
the decade this ratio steadily declined reaching 23 in 1970 and
was relatively stable during the 1970's. Between 1980 and 1989
the ratio increased from 25 commitments per 1,000 reported crimes
to 62. </p>

<p> Similarly, between 1960 and 1970 the ratio of prison
commitments to adult arrests for the selected crimes declined
from 299 per 1,000 to 170. This ratio was relatively stable
during the 1970's, but it increased between 1980 and 1989, from
196 commitments per 1,000 adult arrests to 332. (See
Methodological note for more detail on these data.) </p>

<p> Prison-admissions-to-crime ratios for individual States
provide an alternative measure of prison use to population-based
rates. Population-based incarceration rates take into account the
number of sentenced prisoners and the size of the resident
population in a jurisdiction. The crime-based rate measures entry
into prison relative to the number of crimes reported to law
enforcement agencies during a year. </p>

<p> Between 1980 and 1989 the ratio of court commitments to
prison and reported crimes increased 148%, from 25 commitments
per 1,000 crimes to 62. Over the same period the number of prison
commitments per 100,000 adult residents went up 115%, from 80 to
172. The Northeast had the largest percentage increase in the
number of commitments relative to reported crime and experienced
the largest gain in prison commitments relative to population.
However, in both 1980 and 1989 the South had the largest number
of court commitments to prison relative to reported crime and to
population. </p>

<p> Besides the increased use of prison relative to reported
crime, arrests, and resident population, prison population has
also been affected by changes in the extent of the illegal drug
problem. </p>

<p> An estimated two-thirds of those in State prisons for a drug
offense were convicted of trafficking or manufacturing illegal
drugs. (For additional information on drug offenders in State
prisons, see Profile of State Prison Inmates, 1986, BJS Special
Report, NCJ-109926, January 1988 and Drug Use and Crime, BJS
Special Report, NCJ-111940, July 1988.) Since 1985 the number of
adult arrests for drug violations has increased by 74%, and the
number of arrests for sales or manufacturing of illegal drugs has
grown by 137%. </p>

Population counts for &quot;Inmates with over 1 year maximum
sentence&quot; include an undetermined number of &quot;Inmates
with a sentence of 1 year or less.&quot; Population totals are
actual counts; however, the male/female breakdown is an estimate
believed to be within 0.1% of the actual counts. By law,
offenders in Massachusetts may be sentenced to terms of up to 2
1/2 years in locally operated jails and correctional
institutions. Such populations are excluded from the State count
but are included in published population counts and rates for
local jails and correctional institutions. </p>

integrated system. All NPS data include, therefore, both jail and
prison populations. Tennessee. Population counts for
&quot;Inmates with over 1 year maximum sentence&quot; include an
undetermined number of &quot;Inmates with a sentence of 1 year or
less.&quot; Population counts include 1,854 males and 15 females
housed in local jails because of overcrowding of State prison
facilities and exclude 2,593 felons sentenced to serve their time
in local jails. (The State pays to house these 2,593 felons, but
the local court maintains jurisdiction.) Texas. Population counts
are based on custody data. The courts have ordered that the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice Institutional Division (TDCJ-ID)
cannot house more inmates than 95% of capacity. Approximately
2,928 beds are exempt from this rule, and the inmates in these
beds do not count toward the calculation of 95% capacity. The
population counts include all inmates within TDCJ-ID; however,
the capacity figures exclude the 2,928 exempt beds. </p>

<p> Vermont. Population counts are as of December 6, 1990. In
this State, prisons and jails form an almost completely
integrated system. However, some county and municipal authorities
do operate local lockups. NPS data include both jail and prison
populations. The counts for jail crowding include 34 male inmates
housed in local lockups. The capacity figures exclude the 34 male
inmates housed in local lockups. </p>

<p> Washington. Capacity figures exclude space in State
work-release facilities that housed 609 male and 69 female
inmates on December 31, 1990. </p>

<p> West Virginia. The female population counts are based on
custody data. Population counts exclude 87 male and 15 female
inmates housed in local jails because of overcrowding. </p>

<p> Wyoming. The operational capacity figure is the absolute
total bedspace available to Wyoming's Department of Corrections,
and it includes 60 bedspaces in community centers. </p>

<p>Prisoners in 1992 </p>

<p> Darrell K. Gilliard </p>

<p> BJS Statistician </p>

<p> The number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of Federal or
State correctional authorities at yearend 1992 reached a record
high of 883,593. The States and the District of Columbia added
50,809 prisoners; the Federal system, 8,651. The increase for
1992brings total growth in the prison population since 1980 to
553,772, an increase of about 168% in the 12-year period. </p>

<p> The 1992 growth rate (7.2%) was greater than the percentage
increase recorded during 1991 (6.6%), and the number of new
prisoners added during 1992 was 8,451 more than the number added
during the preceding year (51,009). The 1992 increase translates
into nationwide need for approximately 1,143 prison bedspaces per
week, compared to the nearly 981 prison bedspaces per week needed
in 1991. </p>

<p> Prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year (referred to as
&quot;sentenced prisoners&quot;) accounted for 96% of the total
prison population at the end of 1992, growing by 7.3% during the
year. The remaining prisoners had sentences of a year or less or
were unsenenced (for example, those awaiting trial in States with
combined prison-jail systems). </p>

<p> The number of sentenced Federal prisoners increased at a
faster rate than sentenced prisoners in the States during 1992
(15.9% versus 6.8%). These annual rates of increase were higher
than in 1991 when the Federal system grew 12.5%, and State
systems, 6.4. </p>

<p> The number of Federal prisoners with no sentences or
sentences of less than a year decreased during 1992 (from 14,912
to 14,553), while the number of sentenced prisoners increased by
9,010. </p>

<p> Prison populations in Maine, New Jersey, North Dakota,
Oregon, and Wyoming decreased during 1992. The decrease in these
5 States totaled 1,135 inmates. The highest percentages of growth
during 1992 were reported in Texas (18.4%), West Virginia
(16.2%), Nw Hampshire (15.9%), Idaho (15.5%), and Wisconsin
(15.4%). Eight States reported total prisoner population
increases of 10% or more since yearend 1991. </p>

<p> Texas' increase of 9,501 prisoners during the year was the
largest gain in the number of prisoners for any single
jurisdiction, followed by California (7,688), New York (3,874),
and Michigan (2,596). Texas accounted for about 16% of the
increase in prisonpopulation nationwide. </p>

<p> Rates of incarceration increase </p>

<p> On December 31, 1992, the number of sentenced prisoners per
100,000 residents was 329, a new record. Twelve of the 19
jurisdictions with rates greater than the rate for the Nation
were located in the South, 4 were in the West, 2 were in the
Midwest, and 1was in the Northeast. </p>

<p> Since 1980 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000
residents has risen nearly 137%, from 139 to 329. During this
period, per capita incarceration rates have grown most rapidly in
the Northeast, increasing by 198% (from 87 to 259), and the West,
up by184% (from 105 to 298). The per capita number of sentenced
prisoners in the Midwest climbed 149% (from 109 to 271), and the
rate rose 89% in the South (from 188 to 355). The number of
sentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents has
increased 18% (from 9 to 26) over the same period. </p>

<p> Prison populations in Southern States grow the fastest </p>

<p> Regionally, during 1992 the percentage increase in the number
of sentenced prisoners was highest in the Southern States, with a
gain of 7.8% (table 3). The number of sentenced prisoners grew by
6.7% in the Midwest, 5.9% in the West, and 4.6% in the Northest.
The sentenced Federal prison population grew by 15.9%. In 22
States and the District of Columbia the percentage change in the
number of sentenced prisoners during 1992 was higher than that of
1991. Among these jurisdictions, eight had increases of a least
10%, led by Texas (18.4%), Vermont (18.3%), West Virginia
(16.2%), New Hampshire (15.9%), Wisconsin (15.5%), and Idaho
(15.5%). </p>

<p> Since December 31, 1986, net gains in the number of sentenced
prisoners have averaged about 1,039 prisoners per week -- a
weekly gain of about 946 State prisoners and 94 Federal prisoners
per week over the period. The largest net gains have occurred in
te South (344 inmates per week) followed by the West (223), the
Midwest (202), and the Northeast (176). During 1992, the average
growth in the number of sentenced State and Federal prisoners was
equal to a demand for 1,103 additional bedspaces per week, abut
139 more than the average weekly growth in 1991. </p>

<p> In 1992 the 10 States with the largest prison populations
accounted for 52% of the total prison population nationwide --
California, New York, and Texas accounting for over 25%.
Louisiana had the highest incarceration rate with 478 prisoners
per 100,000 esidents. </p>

<p> Male prisoner population grows at a faster pace </p>

<p> The number of male inmates (833,184) increased at a faster
rate during 1992 (7.3%) than the number of female inmates
(50,409, 5.9%). The rate of incarceration for sentenced males
(636 per 100,000 males in the resident population) was over 18
times higher han for sentenced females (35 per 100,000 females in
the resident population). At the end of 1992, women accounted for
5.7% of all prisoners nationwide. </p>

<p> Overall, the 1992 growth rate (5.9%) for female inmates was
less than the 1991 growth rate (8.4%). The growth rate declined
in the Northeast, from 14.6% in 1991 to 1.7% in 1992, and in the
South, from 10.0% to 3.6%. These declines in 1992 offset the
highr growth rates in the Midwest and West. </p>

<p> Percent increase in </p>

<p> female inmate population </p>

<p> 1991-92 1990-91 </p>

<p> U.S. total 5.9% 8.4% </p>

<p> Federal 13.2% 12.8% </p>

<p> State 5.0% 7.8% </p>

<p> Northeast 1.7 14.6 </p>

<p> Midwest 8.2 7.6 </p>

<p> South 3.6 10.0 </p>

<p> West 7.0 .4 </p>

<p> In 1992, 26 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal
system had more than 500 female inmates. Among these
jurisdictions, 8 had increases of at least 10%, led by Colorado's
increase of 16.3% (from 453 in 1991 to 527 in 1992). The Federal
prison sstem's increase during 1992, 745 inmates, accounted for
26.4% of the nationwide increase of 2,826. </p>

<p> Local jails held more than 18,000 because of State prison
crowding </p>

<p> At the end of 1992, 21 jurisdictions reported a total of
18,191 State prisoners held in local jails or other facilities
because of crowding in State facilities (table 7). Four States,
Louisiana, New Jersey, Virginia, and Tennessee, accounted for
almost 60 of the prisoners sentenced to prison but incarcerated
locally. Four States, Louisiana, West Virginia, New Jersey, and
Mississippi, held more than 10% of their prison population
locally. Overall, 2.1% of the State prison population was
confined in local ails on December 31, 1992, because of prison
crowding. </p>

<p> Prison capacity estimates are difficult to compare </p>

<p> The extent of crowding in the Nation's prisons is difficult
to determine precisely because of the absence of uniform measures
for defining capacity. A wide variety of capacity measures is in
use among the 52 reporting jurisdictions because capacity may
rflect both available space to house inmates and the ability to
staff and operate an institution. To estimate the capacity of the
Nation's prisons, jurisdictions were asked to supply up to three
measures for yearend -- rated, operational, and design capaciies.
These measures were defined as follows: </p>

<p> Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by a
rating official to institutions within the jurisdiction. </p>

<p> Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can be
accommodated based on a facility's staff, existing programs, and
services. </p>

<p> Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners or
architects intended for the facility. </p>

<p> Of the 52 reporting jurisdictions, 38 supplied rated
capacities, 42 provided operational capacities, and 35 submitted
design capacities. As a result, estimates of total capacity and
measures of the relationship to population are based on the
highest and lwest capacity figures provided. (Twenty-four
jurisdictions reported 1 capacity measure or gave the same figure
for each capacity measure they reported.) </p>

<p> Most jurisdictions are operating above capacity </p>

<p> Prisons generally require reserve capacity to operate
efficiently. Prison dormitories and cells need to be maintained
and repaired periodically, special housing is needed for
protective custody and disciplinary cases, and space may be
needed to cope with mergencies. At the end of 1992, 11 States
reported they were operating at 95% or below their highest
capacity. Forty-three jurisdictions and the Federal prison system
reported operating at 100% or more of their lowest capacity. </p>

<p> At the end of 1992, the Federal system was estimated to be
operating at 52% over capacity. State prisons were estimated to
be operating at 118% of their highest capacities and 131% of
their lowest capacities. </p>

<p> Rise in prison population linked to changes in prison
admissions </p>

<p> Underlying the dramatic growth in the State prison population
during the 1980's were changes in the composition of prison
admissions. Since 1977 the relative sizes of the two principal
sources of admissions to prison, court commitments and returned
conditonal release violators, have changed. Court commitments
account for a decreasing share of all prison admissions: 68.0% in
1991, down from 84.3% in 1977 (table 10). As a percentage of all
admissions, those returning to prison after a conditional release
mre than doubled, from 14.5% to 30.5%. These conditional release
violators had originally left prison as parolees, mandatory
releases, and other types of releases involving communty
supervision. </p>

<p> The absolute number of conditional release violators returned
to prison grew 7-fold, from 19,617 in 1977 to 142,100 in 1991,
while the number of new court commitments nearly tripled, from
114,230 to 317,237. Overall, the increase in the number of
conditioal release violators accounted for more than a third of
the growth in the total admissions to State prisons. </p>

<p> An increasing percentage of court commitments sentenced for
drug offenses </p>

<p> In 1990, the latest year for which data are available, the
number of new court commitments for drug offenses reached a
record high, an estimated 103,800. For the first time, the number
of persons admitted for drug offenses was greater than the number
admited for property offenses (102,400), violent offenses
(87,200), or public-order offenses (26,200). An estimated 32.1%
of all new court commitments in 1990 were drug offenders, up from
11.5% in 1977 (figure 2). In 1990 an estimated 31.7% were
property offnders; 27.0%, violent offenders; and 8.1%,
public-order offenders. The increase in drug offenders admitted
to prison accounted for more than 40% of the total growth in new
court commitments since 1977. </p>

<p> Growth in the number of persons arrested for drug law
violations and an increase in the rate of incarceration for drug
offenses account for the change in the prison offense
distribution. Between 1977 and 1990, the estimated number of
adult arrests for dru law violations increased by 104.4%, from
493,300 to 1,008,300 (table 11). Compounding the impact of more
drug arrests, the rate of drug offenders sent to State prison
rose from 27 per 1,000 adult arrests for drug violations in 1977
to 103 admissions per ,000 in 1990. </p>

<p> An increasing number of arrests and a rise in the probability
of incarceration for serious crimes </p>

<p> Growth in the prison population was not solely the result of
more commitments of drug offenders. Between 1977 and 1990 the
number of persons admitted to prison for selected serious
offenses, such as murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, sexual
assault, robbey, aggravated assault, and burglary, also rose by
more than 50,000. </p>

<p> Regardless of the type of offense, the number of adults
arrested and the ratio of prison admissions to arrests increased
between 1977 and 1990. The total number of arrests for serious
crimes rose by 48.8%, from 592,400 to 881,300, while the ratio of
priso admissions to adult arrests for these crimes increased from
121 commitments per 1,000 arrests to 143. Although the prison
commitment ratio was higher in 1990 than in 1977, it changed from
year-to-year: increasing from 1978 to 1984, fluctuating between
195 and 1988, and then increasing after 1988. </p>

<p> Although the number of persons admitted to prison grew for
each of the five selected serious offenses, increases in the
number arrested for aggravated assault and in the probability of
incarceration for burglary accounted for much of the total
growth. </p>

<p> Growth in the number of arrests for aggravated assault
accounted for more than two-thirds of the total increase in
arrests for serious crimes. In 1990 an estimated 410,800 adults
were arrested for aggravated assault, up from 209,300 in 1977.
When combine with an increase in the probability of going to
prison from 32 per 1,000 arrests to 56 per 1,000, aggravated
assault accounted for nearly a third of the total increase in
prison admissions for serious offenses. </p>

<p> A rise in the prison admissions to arrest ratio for burglary
accounted for an additional 24% of the total increase in prison
admissions for serious offenses. While the annual number of
adults arrested for burglary grew by 42,000 between 1977 and
1990, thenumber of admissions to prison per 1,000 arrests
increased from 115 to 160. At least 13,000 more admissions to
prison for burglary occurred in 1990 than in 1977 because of the
higher rate of imprisonment. </p>

<p> In 1992, for the first time in its 9-year history, the Annual
</p>

<p> Survey of Jails collected information from the large </p>

<p> jurisdictions about the programs that their jails administer </p>

<p> -- boot camps, work release, alternatives to incarceration, </p>

<p> educational and treatment programs for inmates, and drug </p>

<p> testing. </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails and this Bulletin would not </p>

<p> have been possible without the generous cooperation of jail </p>

<p> administrators and staff whose facilities were selected for </p>

<p> the survey. </p>

<p> Lawrence A. Greenfeld </p>

<p> Acting Director </p>

<p> By Allen J. Beck, Ph.D. </p>

<p> Thomas P. Bonczar </p>

<p> and Darrell K. Gilliard </p>

<p> BJS Statisticians </p>

<p> At midyear 1992 local jails held an estimated 444,584 </p>

<p> persons. From July 1991 to June 1992, the number in jail </p>

<p> grew 4%, about the same rate as for the previous 12 months. </p>

<p> In 1992 overall jail occupancy was 99% of the rated capacity.
</p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails provides these findings from </p>

<p> data reported by 795 jurisdictions for 1,113 jails, about a </p>

<p> third of all jails. Local officials administer these </p>

<p> facilities which are able to hold persons for more than 48 </p>

<p> hours but usually for less than 1 year. </p>

<p> Other survey findings include: </p>

<p> *About 1 in every 428 adult U.S. residents were in jail on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. </p>

<p> *A majority of jail inmates were black or Hispanic. White </p>

<p> non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail population; </p>

<p> black non- Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non- Hispanic </p>

<p> inmates of other races, 1%. </p>

<p> *An estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. The average daily juvenile population for the </p>

<p> year was 2,527. </p>

<p> *Based on the most recent census (1988) 503 jurisdictions had
</p>

<p> an average daily population of at least 100 jail inmates. In </p>

<p> 1992, these jurisdictions operated 814 jail facilities, which
</p>

<p> held 362,217 inmates, or about 81% of all jail inmates in the
</p>

<p> country. </p>

<p> One-day counts </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the estimated number of inmates held in </p>

<p> local jails was 444,584, an increase of 4.2% over the number </p>

<p> held on June 28, 1991. About 1 in every 428 adult residents </p>

<p> of the United States was in jail on June 30, 1992. Fewer </p>

<p> than 1% of the inmates of the Nation's jails in 1992 were </p>

<p> juveniles. </p>

<p> As estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails </p>

<p> across the country on June 30, 1992. Most juveniles in </p>

<p> correctional custody are housed in juvenile facilities. (For </p>

<p> a definition of juveniles and discussion of their detention, </p>

<p> see Methodology, page 5.) </p>

<p> Since 1970 the number of jail inmates per 100,000 residents </p>

<p> has risen 120%, from 79 to 174. During the period, the </p>

<p> number of jail inmates at midyear increased more than 2 + </p>

<p> times, from 160,863 to 444,584. </p>

<p> The rates of incarceration in local jails have risen more </p>

<p> rapidly for blacks than whites. In 1984, the earliest year </p>

<p> for which data are available, the incarceration rate for </p>

<p> blacks was 339 jail inmates per 100,000 residents; by 1992, </p>

<p> the rate was 619. For whites, the rates increased from 68 to </p>

<p> 109 per 100,000. On June 30, 1992, local jails held an </p>

<p> estimated 195,200 blacks and 233,000 whites. </p>

<p> Average daily population </p>

<p> The average daily population for the year ending June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, was 441,889, an increase of 4.6% from 1991. The </p>

<p> average daily population for males increased 4.7% from the </p>

<p> number in 1991; during the same period, the female average </p>

<p> daily population increased 2.8%. The average daily juvenile </p>

<p> population for the year ending June 30, 1992, was 2,527. </p>

<p> Adult conviction status </p>

<p> At midyear 1992, convicted inmates made up 49% of all adult </p>

<p> inmates. The number of convicted inmates increased 6% since </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Convicted inmates include those awaiting </p>

<p> sentencing or serving a sentence and those returned to jail </p>

<p> because they had violated the conditions of their probation </p>

<p> or parole. From 1991 to 1992 the number of unconvicted </p>

<p> inmates increased 3%. Unconvicted inmates include those on </p>

<p> trial or awaiting arraignment or trial. </p>

<p> Demographic characteristics </p>

<p> Males accounted for 91% of the jail inmate population. The </p>

<p> adult male inmate population increased 4% from 1991 to 1992. </p>

<p> An estimated 1 in every 226 men and 1 in every 2,417 women </p>

<p> residing in the United States were in a local jail on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> White non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail </p>

<p> population; black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and </p>

<p> other races (Native Americans, Aleuts, Alaska Natives, </p>

<p> Asians, and Pacific Islanders), 1%. </p>

<p> Daily population movements </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, local jails had more than 46,000 new </p>

<p> admissions and discharges, about equally divided between the </p>

<p> two categories. Discharges include sentence completions, </p>

<p> bail, and deaths. These data exclude transfers among </p>

<p> facilities and readmissions or other departures on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, which can only be estimated to have been within the </p>

<p> range of 10,733 and 13,367. (For a discussion on reporting </p>

<p> practices, see Methodology.) </p>

<p> Occupancy </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates increased 4% from 1991, while the </p>

<p> total rated capacity of the Nation's jails rose 7%. Between </p>

<p> June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, the percentage of rated </p>

<p> capacity which was occupied fell 2 percentage points to 99%. </p>

<p> Facilities with the largest average daily populations </p>

<p> reported the highest occupancy rates. Occupancy was 114% of </p>

<p> rated capacity in facilities with an average daily population
</p>

<p> of 1,000 or more, compared to 53% in those with fewer than 20
</p>

<p> inmates. </p>

<p> Jurisdictions with large jail populations </p>

<p> Characteristics </p>

<p> In 1992 , an estimated 81% of the total annual number of </p>

<p> inmates in the Nation's local jails were housed in the </p>

<p> facilities of 503 jurisdictions, each with an average daily </p>

<p> population of at least 100 incarcerated persons at the time </p>

<p> of the 1988 Census of Jails. </p>

<p> Between June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, these jurisdictions
</p>

<p> held on average 356,471 inmates. On the day of the survey, </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, these large jurisdictions held 362,217. </p>

<p> Including an unspecified number of facilities counted as 1 in
</p>

<p> both Cook County (Chicago), Illinois, and Orleans Parish (New
</p>

<p> Orleans), Louisiana, these jurisdictions reported data on 814
</p>

<p> separate jail facilities -- 73% of all facilities surveyed. </p>

<p> Nearly half of these large jurisdictions maintained an </p>

<p> average daily population of between 100 and 299 inmates. </p>

<p> Although these jurisdictions represented 47% of all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, they held only 13% of the total annual number </p>

<p> of inmates in large jurisdictions. </p>

<p> Twenty-nine jurisdictions reported an average daily </p>

<p> population of between 2,000 and 22,220 inmates. With an </p>

<p> average of more than 4 facilities per jurisdiction, they </p>

<p> accounted for 16% of all facilities and 41% of the total </p>

<p> average daily population in large jurisdictions. </p>

<p> 25 largest jail jurisdictions </p>

<p> Within the group of jurisdictions that have an annual number </p>

<p> of inmates between 2,000 and 22,220 are the Nation's 25 </p>

<p> largest jurisdictions. These 25 jurisdictions were in 11 </p>

<p> States: 9 in California, 4 in Texas, 4 in Florida, and 1 </p>

<p> each in New York, Illinois, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Arizona,
</p>

<p> Louisiana, Maryland, and Georgia. These jurisdictions had </p>

<p> between 1 and 16 jail facilities in their systems. </p>

<p> Six of the jurisdictions had a smaller average daily </p>

<p> population in 1992 than in 1991, and six had a smaller </p>

<p> population on June 30, 1992, than on June 28, 1991. Harris </p>

<p> County (Houston), Texas, reported the largest growth during </p>

<p> the year, an increase of 4,919 inmates on the day of the </p>

<p> survey. New York City reported the sharpest decline, a </p>

<p> decrease of 2,136 inmates. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the 25 largest jurisdictions held 32% of </p>

<p> all jail inmates nationwide. The two largest jurisdictions, </p>

<p> Los Angeles County and New York City, had more than 40,700 </p>

<p> inmates, 9% of the national total. </p>

<p> Overall, the number of inmates in the Nation's 25 largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions on June 30, 1992, was 5% greater than on June </p>

<p> 28, 1991. The number of jail inmates in these jurisdictions </p>

<p> totalled 143,604, up from 132,506. </p>

<p> Inmates held for other authorities </p>

<p> Local jail jurisdictions frequently house inmates for other </p>

<p> authorities, because of crowding elsewhere or routine needs </p>

<p> of other jurisdictions, such as housing detainees pending </p>

<p> their transfer or holding convicted inmates while awaiting </p>

<p> transfer to State or Federal prison. Among the 503 </p>

<p> jurisdictions with 100 or more inmates in 1988, 425 were </p>

<p> holding inmates for other authorities in 1992. Approximately </p>

<p> 84% of these large jurisdictions had one or more jail </p>

<p> facilities holding inmates for other authorities on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992. </p>

<p> Two-thirds of the large jurisdictions were holding inmates </p>

<p> for State authorities; half for Federal authorities. </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates being held for other authorities </p>

<p> by these large jurisdictions increased by 9,063, up 23% from </p>

<p> 1991. The number of State prisoners in local jails grew the </p>

<p> most (31%), followed by the number of Federal prisoners </p>

<p> (22%). Prisoners held for other local authorities decreased </p>

<p> 26%, from 4,548 to 3,355. </p>

<p> Court orders to reduce population and improve conditions </p>

<p> At midyear 1992 more than a quarter of the 503 large </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported that 1 or more of their jail </p>

<p> facilities were under court order or consent decree to reduce
</p>

<p> the inmate population. On June 30, 1992, 131 jurisdictions </p>

<p> were under court orders to limit the number of inmates, down </p>

<p> from 135 in 1991. </p>

<p> Jail administrators in these 131 jurisdictions reported an </p>

<p> increase of 13% in their rated capacity during the year, or </p>

<p> an increase of 20,160 beds. On average these jurisdictions </p>

<p> were operating at about 105% of their rated capacities. </p>

<p> Administrators in the 372 jurisdictions not under orders to </p>

<p> reduce population or crowding reported less than 1% rise in </p>

<p> their rated capacity, and a slight increase in the occupancy </p>

<p> rate, from 104% to 105%. </p>

<p> Judges intervened most often in the operation of jails with </p>

<p> orders to reduce population or crowding, but they also cited </p>

<p> other elements of the jail facility, staff, operation, or </p>

<p> programs. Overall, 157 of the large jurisdictions were under </p>

<p> court order to limit population or to correct a specific </p>

<p> condition of confinement. Ninety-four were cited for two or </p>

<p> more conditions of confinement: </p>

<p> Nearly a third of the large jurisdictions with a facility </p>

<p> conditions. Forty-one of the 503 jurisdictions were cited </p>

<p> for the totality of conditions (that is, the cumulative </p>

<p> effect of several conditions). The most frequent condition </p>

<p> cited was crowded living units (118 jurisdictions), followed </p>

<p> by inadequate recreation facilities (62), medical facilities </p>

<p> or services (57), and staffing (53). </p>

<p> Fourteen fewer jurisdictions were under court order for </p>

<p> specific conditions of confinement on June 30, 1992, than on </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Six fewer jurisdictions were under court </p>

<p> order for administrative segregation procedures or policies; </p>

<p> three fewer for recreation; and four fewer for food service. </p>

<p> Nine more jurisdictions were cited for grievance procedures </p>

<p> or policies; eight more for staffing patterns. </p>

<p> Jail programs and alternatives to incarceration </p>

<p> In 1992, for the first time in the history of the survey, </p>

<p> jurisdictions were asked if any of their jail facilities </p>

<p> operated a boot camp or daily work release program and if any
</p>

<p> operated alternative-to-incarceration programs, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, and day reporting. </p>

<p> (Jail jurisdictions reported only for the programs that they </p>

<p> operated. Within some counties other agencies may have </p>

<p> operated similar types of programs). These programs are </p>

<p> defined as follows: </p>

<p> boot camp -- a program having a chain of command, highly </p>

<p> regimented activity schedules, drill and ceremonies, and </p>

<p> stressing physical challenges, fitness, discipline and </p>

<p> personal appearance. </p>

<p> Work-release -- a program that allows an inmate to work in </p>

<p> the community unsupervised by correctional staff during the </p>

<p> day and return to jail at night. </p>

<p> Electronic monitoring -- a program in which offenders are </p>

<p> supervised by correctional authorities outside of the jail </p>

<p> facility by use of an electronic signalling device or </p>

<p> programmed contact device attached to a telephone. </p>

<p> House arrest (without electronic monitoring) -- a program in </p>

<p> which offenders are legally ordered to remain confined in </p>

<p> their own residence except for medical reasons and employment
</p>

<p> but are not subject to any electronic surveillance. </p>

<p> Day reporting -- a program that permits offenders to remain </p>

<p> in their residence at night and weekends while reporting to a
</p>

<p> correctional official one or more times daily. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 9 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating a boot camp program. About 4% of the jail inmates </p>

<p> (1,463) in these jurisdictions with boot camps were </p>

<p> participating in the program. Among inmates in all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, fewer than half of one percent were in a boot </p>

<p> camp. </p>

<p> Daily work release programs were available to inmates in more
</p>

<p> than two-thirds of the large jurisdictions. On June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, 17,887 inmates in 359 jail jurisdictions were in a work
</p>

<p> release program. On that day, 7% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in work release programs. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 180 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating an alternative-to-incarceration program, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, or day reporting. </p>

<p> Offenders in these programs are not considered jail inmates </p>

<p> to be included in the midyear count because they are not in </p>

<p> physical custody. They do not serve time in a jail facility </p>

<p> but would if not for these programs. </p>

<p> Of the differing types of alternative programs, electronic </p>

<p> monitoring was the most widely available and had the most </p>

<p> participants (118 jurisdictions and 4,582 offenders). Day- </p>

<p> reporting programs were offered in fewer jurisdictions (43) </p>

<p> and had fewer than 2,445 participants. House arrest programs </p>

<p> without electronic monitoring were operated by 18 jail </p>

<p> jurisdictions with a total of 602 participants. Other types </p>

<p> of alternative programs, such as community service and </p>

<p> weekend reporting, were available in 57 jurisdictions. More </p>

<p> than 6,100 offenders were participating in these other </p>

<p> alternatives. </p>

<p> About three-quarters of all jail inmates in boot camps were </p>

<p> in two jurisdictions -- Tarrant County (Fort Worth), Texas, </p>

<p> and New York City. Each of these jurisdictions had more </p>

<p> inmates in a boot camp than the other seven jurisdictions </p>

<p> combined. </p>

<p> Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties in California had the </p>

<p> largest number of jail inmates in daily work release </p>

<p> programs. Each of these jurisdictions had more than 1,000 </p>

<p> work release participants. </p>

<p> Riverside County, California, stretching to the Nevada border
</p>

<p> east of Los Angeles, had the most offenders (1,435) </p>

<p> participating in some type of alternative program. Cook </p>

<p> County (Chicago), Illinois, had the second largest number of </p>

<p> participants (1,223), and Orange County, California, </p>

<p> containing Anaheim and Santa Ana, the third largest number, </p>

<p> 1,050 offenders. More than 10% of offenders under the </p>

<p> supervision of these jail jurisdictions were in an </p>

<p> alternative-to-incarceration program. </p>

<p> Drug testing </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails asked the largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions if and on whom they conducted urinalysis tests </p>

<p> for drugs. Of all large jurisdictions, 308 said that they </p>

<p> did test. Jurisdictions were more likely to test upon </p>

<p> suspicion (219 jurisdictions) than testing all inmates at </p>

<p> least once (35 jurisdictions). The number of jurisdictions </p>

<p> that tested at random or on an inmate's return from the </p>

<p> community was about the same (159 and 153, respectively). </p>

<p> Jurisdictions holding between 2,000 and 3,999 inmates were </p>

<p> more likely to have at least 1 facility testing for drugs </p>

<p> than any other group, 93%. Those jurisdictions that had from </p>

<p> 100 to 199 inmates were least likely to test, 47%. </p>

<p> Selected jail programs </p>

<p> In the 1992 survey, the 503 largest jurisdictions were asked </p>

<p> to report on inmate participation in drug treatment, alcohol </p>

<p> treatment, psychological counseling or psychiatric care, and </p>

<p> educational programs offered by their jail facilities. On </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, at least 1 jail facility in 420 of these </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported operating these types of programs. A </p>

<p> total of 127 jurisdictions reported operating all 4 types of </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> Educational programs (including literacy, basic education, </p>

<p> and GED programs) were offered in more than two-thirds of the
</p>

<p> large jurisdictions. About 9% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in an education program at </p>

<p> the time of the survey. </p>

<p> Alcohol and drug treatment programs were offered in more than
</p>

<p> half of the large jail jurisdictions. On June 30, 1992, </p>

<p> 20,100 jail inmates were receiving alcohol treatment; 18,052 </p>

<p> were receiving drug treatment. In the jurisdictions </p>

<p> operating alcohol or drug treatment programs, the inmate </p>

<p> participation rate was lower than 10%. </p>

<p> Psychological or psychiatric counseling programs were </p>

<p> provided in 212 of the large jurisdictions. More than 14,000 </p>

<p> jail inmates were participating in these programs. </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> A total of 178 large jail jurisdictions (35%) reported one or
</p>

<p> more jails with an inmate death during the year ending June </p>

<p> 30, 1992, compared to 190 (38%) the previous year . Natural </p>

<p> causes other than AIDS were the leading cause of death among </p>

<p> inmates in large jail jurisdictions (38%), followed by </p>

<p> suicide (28%). AIDS-related deaths accounted for 24% of the </p>

<p> total, injury by another person, 3%, and accidents or </p>

<p> undetermined causes, 7%. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails was the ninth such survey in </p>

<p> a series sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The </p>

<p> first was conducted in 1982. Complete enumerations of the </p>

<p> Nation's jails are conducted every 5 years. Annual surveys - </p>

<p> - which collect data on all jails in jurisdictions with 100 </p>

<p> or more jail inmates and on a sample of all other jails -- </p>

<p> are carried out in each of the 4 years between the full </p>

<p> censuses. The reference date for the 1992 survey was June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. Full censuses were done on February 15, 1978, June </p>

<p> 30, 1983, and June 30, 1988. </p>

<p> A local jail is a facility that holds inmates beyond </p>

<p> arraignment, usually for more than 48 hours, and is </p>

<p> administered by local officials. Specifically excluded from </p>

<p> the count were temporary lockups that house persons for less </p>

<p> than 48 hours, physically separate drunk tanks, and other </p>

<p> holding facilities that did not hold persons after they had </p>

<p> been formally charged, Federal- or State-administered </p>

<p> facilities, and the combined jail-prison systems of Alaska, </p>

<p> Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. </p>

<p> Included in the universe were five locally operated jails in </p>

<p> Alaska and eight jails that were privately operated under </p>

<p> contract for local governments. </p>

<p> The 1992 survey included 1,113 jails in 795 jurisdictions. A </p>

<p> jurisdiction is a county, municipality, township, or regional
</p>

<p> authority that administers one or more local jails. The </p>

<p> jails in 503 jurisdictions were automatically included in the
</p>

<p> survey because the average daily inmate population in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions was 100 or more in the 1988 census. The </p>

<p> jurisdictions with large jail populations, referred to as </p>

<p> certainty jurisdictions, accounted for 814 jails and 362,217 </p>

<p> inmates, or 81% of the estimated inmate population on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> The other jurisdictions surveyed constituted a stratified </p>

<p> probability sample of those jurisdictions whose average daily
</p>

<p> population was less than 100 in the 1988 jail census. </p>

<p> Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Two followup </p>

<p> mailings and phone calls were used to encourage reporting. </p>

<p> The response rate was 99% for all jails. </p>

<p> For the eight jails in certainty jurisdictions and the one </p>

<p> jail in a noncertainty jurisdiction not responding to the </p>

<p> survey, data were adjusted by applying the average growth </p>

<p> factor for facilities in the same stratum and region with the
</p>

<p> same type of inmates (men, women, or both sexes). </p>

<p> National estimates for the inmate population on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, were produced by sex, race, legal status, and </p>

<p> conviction status and for the average daily population during
</p>

<p> the year ending June 30, 1992, by sex and legal status. </p>

<p> National estimates were also produced for rated capacity. </p>

<p> Administrators of jails in jurisdictions with large jail </p>

<p> populations provided counts of inmates held for other </p>

<p> authorities, inmate deaths, and jails under court order. </p>

<p> Sampling error </p>

<p> National estimates have an associated sampling error because </p>

<p> jurisdictions with an average daily population of less than </p>

<p> 100 were sampled for the survey. Estimates based on a sample </p>

<p> survey are apt to differ somewhat from the results of a </p>

<p> survey canvassing all jurisdictions. Each of the samples </p>

<p> that could have been selected using the same sample design </p>

<p> could yield somewhat different results. Standard error is a </p>

<p> measure of the variation among the estimates from all </p>

<p> possible samples, stating the precision with which an </p>

<p> estimate from a particular sample approximates the average </p>

<p> result of all possible samples. The estimated relative </p>

<p> sampling error for the total inmate population of 444,584 on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, was 0.47%. </p>

<p> Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determine </p>

<p> whether statistical significance could be associated with </p>

<p> observed differences between values. Differences were tested </p>

<p> to ascertain whether they were significant at the 95-percent </p>

<p> confidence level or higher. Differences mentioned in the </p>

<p> text meet or exceed this 95-percent confidence level. </p>

<p> Measures of population </p>

<p> Two measures of inmate population are used: the average </p>

<p> daily population for the year ending June 30 and the inmate </p>

<p> count on June 30 of each year. The average daily inmate </p>

<p> population balances out any extraordinary events that may </p>

<p> render the 1-day count atypical. The 1-day count is useful </p>

<p> because some characteristics of the inmate population -- such
</p>

<p> as race, Hispanic origin, and detention status -- can be </p>

<p> obtained for a specific date, but may not be available on an </p>

<p> annual basis. </p>

<p> Population movement </p>

<p> In contrast with prior years, admission and discharge data </p>

<p> were collected for the single day, June 30, 1992, rather than
</p>

<p> for the entire year preceding the census date to improve data
</p>

<p> quality and to ease reporting burdens. Intrasystem transfers </p>

<p> within jail systems have been removed from counts of </p>

<p> admissions and discharges and included with a combined </p>

<p> estimate of transfers between jails and long-term medical and
</p>

<p> mental health facilities and readmissions/other departures. </p>

<p> Because some jurisdictions do not maintain separate records </p>

<p> for returning inmates who were on temporary transfers to </p>

<p> other facilities or readmissions resulting from weekend </p>

<p> sentences, medical appointments, and court appearances, it </p>

<p> was only possible to provide an estimate of the volume of </p>

<p> this movement. </p>

<p> Juveniles </p>

<p> State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be </p>

<p> incarcerated in adult jails and prisons under a variety of </p>

<p> circumstances. Juveniles are persons who are defined by </p>

<p> State statute as being under a certain age, usually 18 years,
</p>

<p> and who are initially subject to juvenile court authority </p>

<p> even if tried as adults in criminal court. </p>

<p> The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 </p>

<p> requires sight and sound separation from adults for those </p>

<p> juveniles not tried as adults in criminal court but held in </p>

<p> adult jails. A 1980 amendment to that 1974 act requires the </p>

<p> removal of juveniles from local jails, except those juveniles
</p>

<p> who are tried as adults for criminal felonies. The </p>

<p> proportion of juveniles who were housed in adult jails in </p>

<p> accordance with these guidelines is not available. </p>

<p> This report was written by Allen J. Beck, Thomas P. Bonczar, </p>

<p> and Darrell K. Gilliard. Corrections statistics are prepared </p>

<p> under the general direction of Lawrence A. Greenfeld. James </p>

<p> Stephan reviewed the statistics. Tom Hester edited the </p>

<p> report. Marilyn Marbrook administered production, assisted </p>

<p> by Betty Sherman, Jayne Pugh, and Yvonne Boston. Collection </p>

<p> and processing of the 1992 Jail Survey were conducted by </p>

<p> In 1992, for the first time in its 9-year history, the Annual
</p>

<p> Survey of Jails collected information from the large </p>

<p> jurisdictions about the programs that their jails administer </p>

<p> -- boot camps, work release, alternatives to incarceration, </p>

<p> educational and treatment programs for inmates, and drug </p>

<p> testing. </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails and this Bulletin would not </p>

<p> have been possible without the generous cooperation of jail </p>

<p> administrators and staff whose facilities were selected for </p>

<p> the survey. </p>

<p> BJS Statisticians </p>

<p> At midyear 1992 local jails held an estimated 444,584 </p>

<p> persons. From July 1991 to June 1992, the number in jail </p>

<p> grew 4%, about the same rate as for the previous 12 months. </p>

<p> In 1992 overall jail occupancy was 99% of the rated capacity.
</p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails provides these findings from </p>

<p> data reported by 795 jurisdictions for 1,113 jails, about a </p>

<p> third of all jails. Local officials administer these </p>

<p> facilities which are able to hold persons for more than 48 </p>

<p> hours but usually for less than 1 year. </p>

<p> Other survey findings include: </p>

<p> *About 1 in every 428 adult U.S. residents were in jail on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. </p>

<p> *A majority of jail inmates were black or Hispanic. White </p>

<p> non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail population; </p>

<p> black non- Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non- Hispanic </p>

<p> inmates of other races, 1%. </p>

<p> *An estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. The average daily juvenile population for the </p>

<p> year was 2,527. </p>

<p> *Based on the most recent census (1988) 503 jurisdictions had
</p>

<p> an average daily population of at least 100 jail inmates. In </p>

<p> 1992, these jurisdictions operated 814 jail facilities, which
</p>

<p> held 362,217 inmates, or about 81% of all jail inmates in the
</p>

<p> country. </p>

<p> One-day counts </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the estimated number of inmates held in </p>

<p> local jails was 444,584, an increase of 4.2% over the number </p>

<p> held on June 28, 1991. About 1 in every 428 adult residents </p>

<p> of the United States was in jail on June 30, 1992. Fewer </p>

<p> than 1% of the inmates of the Nation's jails in 1992 were </p>

<p> juveniles. </p>

<p> As estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails </p>

<p> across the country on June 30, 1992. Most juveniles in </p>

<p> correctional custody are housed in juvenile facilities. (For </p>

<p> a definition of juveniles and discussion of their detention, </p>

<p> see Methodology, page 5.) </p>

<p> Since 1970 the number of jail inmates per 100,000 residents </p>

<p> has risen 120%, from 79 to 174. During the period, the </p>

<p> number of jail inmates at midyear increased more than 2 + </p>

<p> times, from 160,863 to 444,584. </p>

<p> The rates of incarceration in local jails have risen more </p>

<p> rapidly for blacks than whites. In 1984, the earliest year </p>

<p> for which data are available, the incarceration rate for </p>

<p> blacks was 339 jail inmates per 100,000 residents; by 1992, </p>

<p> the rate was 619. For whites, the rates increased from 68 to </p>

<p> 109 per 100,000. On June 30, 1992, local jails held an </p>

<p> estimated 195,200 blacks and 233,000 whites. </p>

<p> Average daily population </p>

<p> The average daily population for the year ending June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, was 441,889, an increase of 4.6% from 1991. The </p>

<p> average daily population for males increased 4.7% from the </p>

<p> number in 1991; during the same period, the female average </p>

<p> daily population increased 2.8%. The average daily juvenile </p>

<p> population for the year ending June 30, 1992, was 2,527. </p>

<p> Adult conviction status </p>

<p> At midyear 1992, convicted inmates made up 49% of all adult </p>

<p> inmates. The number of convicted inmates increased 6% since </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Convicted inmates include those awaiting </p>

<p> sentencing or serving a sentence and those returned to jail </p>

<p> because they had violated the conditions of their probation </p>

<p> or parole. From 1991 to 1992 the number of unconvicted </p>

<p> inmates increased 3%. Unconvicted inmates include those on </p>

<p> trial or awaiting arraignment or trial. </p>

<p> Demographic characteristics </p>

<p> Males accounted for 91% of the jail inmate population. The </p>

<p> adult male inmate population increased 4% from 1991 to 1992. </p>

<p> An estimated 1 in every 226 men and 1 in every 2,417 women </p>

<p> residing in the United States were in a local jail on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> White non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail </p>

<p> population; black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and </p>

<p> other races (Native Americans, Aleuts, Alaska Natives, </p>

<p> Asians, and Pacific Islanders), 1%. </p>

<p> Daily population movements </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, local jails had more than 46,000 new </p>

<p> admissions and discharges, about equally divided between the </p>

<p> two categories. Discharges include sentence completions, </p>

<p> bail, and deaths. These data exclude transfers among </p>

<p> facilities and readmissions or other departures on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, which can only be estimated to have been within the </p>

<p> range of 10,733 and 13,367. (For a discussion on reporting </p>

<p> practices, see Methodology.) </p>

<p> Occupancy </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates increased 4% from 1991, while the </p>

<p> total rated capacity of the Nation's jails rose 7%. Between </p>

<p> June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, the percentage of rated </p>

<p> capacity which was occupied fell 2 percentage points to 99%. </p>

<p> Facilities with the largest average daily populations </p>

<p> reported the highest occupancy rates. Occupancy was 114% of </p>

<p> rated capacity in facilities with an average daily population
</p>

<p> of 1,000 or more, compared to 53% in those with fewer than 20

<p> Characteristics </p>

<p> In 1992 , an estimated 81% of the total annual number of </p>

<p> inmates in the Nation's local jails were housed in the </p>

<p> facilities of 503 jurisdictions, each with an average daily </p>

<p> population of at least 100 incarcerated persons at the time </p>

<p> held on average 356,471 inmates. On the day of the survey, </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, these large jurisdictions held 362,217. </p>

<p> Including an unspecified number of facilities counted as 1 in
</p>

<p> both Cook County (Chicago), Illinois, and Orleans Parish (New
</p>

<p> Orleans), Louisiana, these jurisdictions reported data on 814
</p>

<p> separate jail facilities -- 73% of all facilities surveyed. </p>

<p> Nearly half of these large jurisdictions maintained an </p>

<p> average daily population of between 100 and 299 inmates. </p>

<p> Although these jurisdictions represented 47% of all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, they held only 13% of the total annual number </p>

<p> of inmates in large jurisdictions. </p>

<p> Twenty-nine jurisdictions reported an average daily </p>

<p> population of between 2,000 and 22,220 inmates. With an </p>

<p> average of more than 4 facilities per jurisdiction, they </p>

<p> Within the group of jurisdictions that have an annual number </p>

<p> of inmates between 2,000 and 22,220 are the Nation's 25 </p>

<p> largest jurisdictions. These 25 jurisdictions were in 11 </p>

<p> States: 9 in California, 4 in Texas, 4 in Florida, and 1 </p>

<p> each in New York, Illinois, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Arizona,
</p>

<p> Louisiana, Maryland, and Georgia. These jurisdictions had </p>

<p> between 1 and 16 jail facilities in their systems. </p>

<p> Six of the jurisdictions had a smaller average daily </p>

<p> population in 1992 than in 1991, and six had a smaller </p>

<p> population on June 30, 1992, than on June 28, 1991. Harris </p>

<p> County (Houston), Texas, reported the largest growth during </p>

<p> the year, an increase of 4,919 inmates on the day of the </p>

<p> survey. New York City reported the sharpest decline, a </p>

<p> decrease of 2,136 inmates. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the 25 largest jurisdictions held 32% of </p>

<p> all jail inmates nationwide. The two largest jurisdictions, </p>

<p> Los Angeles County and New York City, had more than 40,700 </p>

<p> inmates, 9% of the national total. </p>

<p> Overall, the number of inmates in the Nation's 25 largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions on June 30, 1992, was 5% greater than on June </p>

<p> 28, 1991. The number of jail inmates in these jurisdictions </p>

<p> totalled 143,604, up from 132,506. </p>

<p> Inmates held for other authorities </p>

<p> Local jail jurisdictions frequently house inmates for other </p>

<p> authorities, because of crowding elsewhere or routine needs </p>

<p> of other jurisdictions, such as housing detainees pending </p>

<p> their transfer or holding convicted inmates while awaiting </p>

<p> transfer to State or Federal prison. Among the 503 </p>

<p> jurisdictions with 100 or more inmates in 1988, 425 were </p>

<p> holding inmates for other authorities in 1992. Approximately </p>

<p> 84% of these large jurisdictions had one or more jail </p>

<p> facilities holding inmates for other authorities on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992. </p>

<p> Two-thirds of the large jurisdictions were holding inmates </p>

<p> for State authorities; half for Federal authorities. </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates being held for other authorities </p>

<p> by these large jurisdictions increased by 9,063, up 23% from </p>

<p> 1991. The number of State prisoners in local jails grew the </p>

<p> most (31%), followed by the number of Federal prisoners </p>

<p> (22%). Prisoners held for other local authorities decreased </p>

<p> 26%, from 4,548 to 3,355. </p>

<p> Court orders to reduce population and improve conditions </p>

<p> At midyear 1992 more than a quarter of the 503 large </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported that 1 or more of their jail </p>

<p> facilities were under court order or consent decree to reduce
</p>

<p> the inmate population. On June 30, 1992, 131 jurisdictions </p>

<p> were under court orders to limit the number of inmates, down </p>

<p> from 135 in 1991. </p>

<p> Jail administrators in these 131 jurisdictions reported an </p>

<p> increase of 13% in their rated capacity during the year, or </p>

<p> an increase of 20,160 beds. On average these jurisdictions </p>

<p> were operating at about 105% of their rated capacities. </p>

<p> Administrators in the 372 jurisdictions not under orders to </p>

<p> reduce population or crowding reported less than 1% rise in </p>

<p> their rated capacity, and a slight increase in the occupancy </p>

<p> rate, from 104% to 105%. </p>

<p> Judges intervened most often in the operation of jails with </p>

<p> orders to reduce population or crowding, but they also cited </p>

<p> other elements of the jail facility, staff, operation, or </p>

<p> programs. Overall, 157 of the large jurisdictions were under </p>

<p> court order to limit population or to correct a specific </p>

<p> condition of confinement. Ninety-four were cited for two or </p>

<p> more conditions of confinement: </p>

<p> conditions. Forty-one of the 503 jurisdictions were cited </p>

<p> for the totality of conditions (that is, the cumulative </p>

<p> effect of several conditions). The most frequent condition </p>

<p> cited was crowded living units (118 jurisdictions), followed </p>

<p> by inadequate recreation facilities (62), medical facilities </p>

<p> or services (57), and staffing (53). </p>

<p> Fourteen fewer jurisdictions were under court order for </p>

<p> specific conditions of confinement on June 30, 1992, than on </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Six fewer jurisdictions were under court </p>

<p> order for administrative segregation procedures or policies; </p>

<p> three fewer for recreation; and four fewer for food service. </p>

<p> Nine more jurisdictions were cited for grievance procedures </p>

<p> or policies; eight more for staffing patterns. </p>

<p> Jail programs and alternatives to incarceration </p>

<p> In 1992, for the first time in the history of the survey, </p>

<p> jurisdictions were asked if any of their jail facilities </p>

<p> operated a boot camp or daily work release program and if any
</p>

<p> operated alternative-to-incarceration programs, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, and day reporting. </p>

<p> (Jail jurisdictions reported only for the programs that they </p>

<p> operated. Within some counties other agencies may have </p>

<p> operated similar types of programs). These programs are </p>

<p> defined as follows: </p>

<p> boot camp -- a program having a chain of command, highly </p>

<p> regimented activity schedules, drill and ceremonies, and </p>

<p> stressing physical challenges, fitness, discipline and </p>

<p> personal appearance. </p>

<p> Work-release -- a program that allows an inmate to work in </p>

<p> the community unsupervised by correctional staff during the </p>

<p> day and return to jail at night. </p>

<p> Electronic monitoring -- a program in which offenders are </p>

<p> supervised by correctional authorities outside of the jail </p>

<p> facility by use of an electronic signalling device or </p>

<p> programmed contact device attached to a telephone. </p>

<p> House arrest (without electronic monitoring) -- a program in </p>

<p> which offenders are legally ordered to remain confined in </p>

<p> their own residence except for medical reasons and employment
</p>

<p> but are not subject to any electronic surveillance. </p>

<p> Day reporting -- a program that permits offenders to remain </p>

<p> in their residence at night and weekends while reporting to a
</p>

<p> correctional official one or more times daily. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 9 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating a boot camp program. About 4% of the jail inmates </p>

<p> (1,463) in these jurisdictions with boot camps were </p>

<p> participating in the program. Among inmates in all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, fewer than half of one percent were in a boot </p>

<p> camp. </p>

<p> Daily work release programs were available to inmates in more
</p>

<p> than two-thirds of the large jurisdictions. On June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, 17,887 inmates in 359 jail jurisdictions were in a work
</p>

<p> release program. On that day, 7% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in work release programs. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 180 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating an alternative-to-incarceration program, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, or day reporting. </p>

<p> Offenders in these programs are not considered jail inmates </p>

<p> to be included in the midyear count because they are not in </p>

<p> physical custody. They do not serve time in a jail facility </p>

<p> but would if not for these programs. </p>

<p> Of the differing types of alternative programs, electronic </p>

<p> monitoring was the most widely available and had the most </p>

<p> participants (118 jurisdictions and 4,582 offenders). Day- </p>

<p> reporting programs were offered in fewer jurisdictions (43) </p>

<p> and had fewer than 2,445 participants. House arrest programs </p>

<p> without electronic monitoring were operated by 18 jail </p>

<p> jurisdictions with a total of 602 participants. Other types </p>

<p> of alternative programs, such as community service and </p>

<p> weekend reporting, were available in 57 jurisdictions. More </p>

<p> than 6,100 offenders were participating in these other </p>

<p> alternatives. </p>

<p> About three-quarters of all jail inmates in boot camps were </p>

<p> in two jurisdictions -- Tarrant County (Fort Worth), Texas, </p>

<p> and New York City. Each of these jurisdictions had more </p>

<p> inmates in a boot camp than the other seven jurisdictions </p>

<p> combined. </p>

<p> Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties in California had the </p>

<p> largest number of jail inmates in daily work release </p>

<p> programs. Each of these jurisdictions had more than 1,000 </p>

<p> work release participants. </p>

<p> Riverside County, California, stretching to the Nevada border
</p>

<p> east of Los Angeles, had the most offenders (1,435) </p>

<p> participating in some type of alternative program. Cook </p>

<p> County (Chicago), Illinois, had the second largest number of </p>

<p> participants (1,223), and Orange County, California, </p>

<p> containing Anaheim and Santa Ana, the third largest number, </p>

<p> 1,050 offenders. More than 10% of offenders under the </p>

<p> supervision of these jail jurisdictions were in an </p>

<p> alternative-to-incarceration program. </p>

<p> Drug testing </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails asked the largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions if and on whom they conducted urinalysis tests </p>

<p> for drugs. Of all large jurisdictions, 308 said that they </p>

<p> did test. Jurisdictions were more likely to test upon </p>

<p> suspicion (219 jurisdictions) than testing all inmates at </p>

<p> least once (35 jurisdictions). The number of jurisdictions </p>

<p> that tested at random or on an inmate's return from the </p>

<p> community was about the same (159 and 153, respectively). </p>

<p> Jurisdictions holding between 2,000 and 3,999 inmates were </p>

<p> more likely to have at least 1 facility testing for drugs </p>

<p> than any other group, 93%. Those jurisdictions that had from </p>

<p> 100 to 199 inmates were least likely to test, 47%. </p>

<p> Selected jail programs </p>

<p> In the 1992 survey, the 503 largest jurisdictions were asked </p>

<p> to report on inmate participation in drug treatment, alcohol </p>

<p> treatment, psychological counseling or psychiatric care, and </p>

<p> educational programs offered by their jail facilities. On </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, at least 1 jail facility in 420 of these </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported operating these types of programs. A </p>

<p> total of 127 jurisdictions reported operating all 4 types of </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> Educational programs (including literacy, basic education, </p>

<p> and GED programs) were offered in more than two-thirds of the
</p>

<p> large jurisdictions. About 9% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in an education program at </p>

<p> the time of the survey. </p>

<p> Alcohol and drug treatment programs were offered in more than
</p>

<p> half of the large jail jurisdictions. On June 30, 1992, </p>

<p> 20,100 jail inmates were receiving alcohol treatment; 18,052 </p>

<p> were receiving drug treatment. In the jurisdictions </p>

<p> operating alcohol or drug treatment programs, the inmate </p>

<p> participation rate was lower than 10%. </p>

<p> Psychological or psychiatric counseling programs were </p>

<p> provided in 212 of the large jurisdictions. More than 14,000 </p>

<p> jail inmates were participating in these programs. </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> A total of 178 large jail jurisdictions (35%) reported one or
</p>

<p> more jails with an inmate death during the year ending June </p>

<p> 30, 1992, compared to 190 (38%) the previous year . Natural </p>

<p> causes other than AIDS were the leading cause of death among </p>

<p> inmates in large jail jurisdictions (38%), followed by </p>

<p> suicide (28%). AIDS-related deaths accounted for 24% of the </p>

<p> total, injury by another person, 3%, and accidents or </p>

<p> undetermined causes, 7%. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails was the ninth such survey in </p>

<p> a series sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The </p>

<p> first was conducted in 1982. Complete enumerations of the </p>

<p> Nation's jails are conducted every 5 years. Annual surveys - </p>

<p> - which collect data on all jails in jurisdictions with 100 </p>

<p> or more jail inmates and on a sample of all other jails -- </p>

<p> are carried out in each of the 4 years between the full </p>

<p> censuses. The reference date for the 1992 survey was June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. Full censuses were done on February 15, 1978, June </p>

<p> 30, 1983, and June 30, 1988. </p>

<p> A local jail is a facility that holds inmates beyond </p>

<p> arraignment, usually for more than 48 hours, and is </p>

<p> administered by local officials. Specifically excluded from </p>

<p> the count were temporary lockups that house persons for less </p>

<p> than 48 hours, physically separate drunk tanks, and other </p>

<p> holding facilities that did not hold persons after they had </p>

<p> been formally charged, Federal- or State-administered </p>

<p> facilities, and the combined jail-prison systems of Alaska, </p>

<p> Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. </p>

<p> Included in the universe were five locally operated jails in </p>

<p> Alaska and eight jails that were privately operated under </p>

<p> contract for local governments. </p>

<p> The 1992 survey included 1,113 jails in 795 jurisdictions. A </p>

<p> jurisdiction is a county, municipality, township, or regional
</p>

<p> authority that administers one or more local jails. The </p>

<p> jails in 503 jurisdictions were automatically included in the
</p>

<p> survey because the average daily inmate population in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions was 100 or more in the 1988 census. The </p>

<p> jurisdictions with large jail populations, referred to as </p>

<p> certainty jurisdictions, accounted for 814 jails and 362,217 </p>

<p> inmates, or 81% of the estimated inmate population on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> The other jurisdictions surveyed constituted a stratified </p>

<p> probability sample of those jurisdictions whose average daily
</p>

<p> population was less than 100 in the 1988 jail census. </p>

<p> Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Two followup </p>

<p> mailings and phone calls were used to encourage reporting. </p>

<p> The response rate was 99% for all jails. </p>

<p> For the eight jails in certainty jurisdictions and the one </p>

<p> jail in a noncertainty jurisdiction not responding to the </p>

<p> survey, data were adjusted by applying the average growth </p>

<p> factor for facilities in the same stratum and region with the
</p>

<p> same type of inmates (men, women, or both sexes). </p>

<p> National estimates for the inmate population on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, were produced by sex, race, legal status, and </p>

<p> conviction status and for the average daily population during
</p>

<p> the year ending June 30, 1992, by sex and legal status. </p>

<p> National estimates were also produced for rated capacity. </p>

<p> Administrators of jails in jurisdictions with large jail </p>

<p> populations provided counts of inmates held for other </p>

<p> authorities, inmate deaths, and jails under court order. </p>

<p> Sampling error </p>

<p> National estimates have an associated sampling error because </p>

<p> jurisdictions with an average daily population of less than </p>

<p> 100 were sampled for the survey. Estimates based on a sample </p>

<p> survey are apt to differ somewhat from the results of a </p>

<p> survey canvassing all jurisdictions. Each of the samples </p>

<p> that could have been selected using the same sample design </p>

<p> could yield somewhat different results. Standard error is a </p>

<p> measure of the variation among the estimates from all </p>

<p> possible samples, stating the precision with which an </p>

<p> estimate from a particular sample approximates the average </p>

<p> result of all possible samples. The estimated relative </p>

<p> sampling error for the total inmate population of 444,584 on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, was 0.47%. </p>

<p> Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determine </p>

<p> whether statistical significance could be associated with </p>

<p> observed differences between values. Differences were tested </p>

<p> to ascertain whether they were significant at the 95-percent </p>

<p> confidence level or higher. Differences mentioned in the </p>

<p> text meet or exceed this 95-percent confidence level. </p>

<p> Measures of population </p>

<p> Two measures of inmate population are used: the average </p>

<p> daily population for the year ending June 30 and the inmate </p>

<p> count on June 30 of each year. The average daily inmate </p>

<p> population balances out any extraordinary events that may </p>

<p> render the 1-day count atypical. The 1-day count is useful </p>

<p> because some characteristics of the inmate population -- such
</p>

<p> as race, Hispanic origin, and detention status -- can be </p>

<p> obtained for a specific date, but may not be available on an </p>

<p> annual basis. </p>

<p> Population movement </p>

<p> In contrast with prior years, admission and discharge data </p>

<p> were collected for the single day, June 30, 1992, rather than
</p>

<p> for the entire year preceding the census date to improve data
</p>

<p> quality and to ease reporting burdens. Intrasystem transfers </p>

<p> within jail systems have been removed from counts of </p>

<p> admissions and discharges and included with a combined </p>

<p> estimate of transfers between jails and long-term medical and
</p>

<p> mental health facilities and readmissions/other departures. </p>

<p> Because some jurisdictions do not maintain separate records </p>

<p> for returning inmates who were on temporary transfers to </p>

<p> other facilities or readmissions resulting from weekend </p>

<p> sentences, medical appointments, and court appearances, it </p>

<p> was only possible to provide an estimate of the volume of </p>

<p> this movement. </p>

<p> Juveniles </p>

<p> State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be </p>

<p> incarcerated in adult jails and prisons under a variety of </p>

<p> circumstances. Juveniles are persons who are defined by </p>

<p> State statute as being under a certain age, usually 18 years,
</p>

<p> and who are initially subject to juvenile court authority </p>

<p> even if tried as adults in criminal court. </p>

<p> The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 </p>

<p> requires sight and sound separation from adults for those </p>

<p> juveniles not tried as adults in criminal court but held in </p>

<p> adult jails. A 1980 amendment to that 1974 act requires the </p>

<p> removal of juveniles from local jails, except those juveniles
</p>

<p> who are tried as adults for criminal felonies. The </p>

<p> proportion of juveniles who were housed in adult jails in </p>

<p> accordance with these guidelines is not available. </p>

<p> The total number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of
Federal or State correctional authorities was 1,053,738 at
yearend 1994. During the year the States and the District of
Columbia added 78,847 prisoners; the Federal system, 5,447.
Although the 1994 growth rate (8.6%) nearly equaled the average
annual percent increase since 1980, the total increase of 83,294
was the second largest yearly increase on record. </p>

<p> * California (125,605) and Texas (118,195) together held more
than 1 in every 5 inmates in the Nation. Seventeen States, each
holding fewer than 5,000 inmates, together held 4% of all
prisoners. </p>

<p> * At yearend 1994, State prisons were operating at between
17% and 29% above capacity, while the Federal system was
operating at 25% over capacity. </p>

<p> * Since 1980 the Nation's prison population more than doubled
on a per capita basis. On December 31, 1994, the number of
sentenced prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents was 387-up from
139 in 1980. </p>

<p> * States with the highest incarceration rates were Texas
(636), Louisiana (530), and Oklahoma (508). North Dakota (78) had
the lowest rate, followed by Minnesota (100), West Virginia
(106), and Maine (118). </p>

<p> * In 1993 (the latest available data), the incarceration rate
of blacks was 7 times that of whites. At yearend there were 1,471
black inmates per 100,000 black U.S. residents compared to 207
white inmates per 100,000 white residents. </p>

<p> -------------------------------------- </p>

<p> State and Federal prisons housed two-thirds of all persons
incarcerated in the United States--the other third were in local
jails. </p>

<p> The 1994 growth rate of 8.6% was greater than the percentage
increase recorded during 1993 (7.4%). The 1994 increase
translates into a nationwide need to confine an additional 1,602
inmates each week. </p>

<p> Prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year (referred to as
&quot;sentenced prisoners&quot;) accounted for 96% of the total
prison population at the end of 1994, growing by 8.6 % during the
year. The remaining prisoners had sentences of a year or less or
were unsentenced (for example, those awaiting trial in States
with combined prison-jail systems). </p>

<p> The number of sentenced Federal prisoners increased less than
that of sentenced State prisoners during 1994 (7.3% versus 8.7%).
The rate of increase slowed to about half the 1993 growth rate. </p>

<p> During 1994 prison populations increased in 16 States by at
least 10%. Texas reported the largest increase (28.5%), followed
by Georgia (20.3%), Nevada (16.0%), Virginia (14.6%), and
Wisconsin (14.1%). Three States and the District of Columbia
experienced less than 2% growth. The District had the smallest
percentage growth (.9%), followed by Oklahoma (1.4%), South
Carolina (1.6%), and Massachusetts (1.6%). </p>

<p> Fifty-six percent of the increase during 1994 was accounted
for by Texas (26,182), California (5,654), Georgia (5,642), the
Federal system (5,447), and Florida (4,091). These jurisdictions
incarcerate over 40% of the Nation's prison population. </p>

<p> * At yearend 1980, 1 in every 453 U.S. residents were
incarcerated; by yearend 1993, that figure grew to 1 in every
189. </p>

<p> * From 1980 to 1993, the total number of persons held in the
custody of State, Federal, and local jail jurisdictions grew by
about 863,000 persons. Sixty-two percent of the growth can be
attributed to the growth in number of State prisoners (533,000). </p>

<ul>
    <li>Between 1980 and 1993, the Federal prison population grew
        at faster rate (an average of 9.9% per year) than the
        combined State populations (8.2%) and the Nation's local
        jail populations (7.3%). Despite the higher growth rate,
        only 5.9% of all inmates were held in Federal prisons in
        1993, up from 4.7% in 1980. </li>
    <li>* On December 31, 1993, almost 4.9 million persons were
        under some form of correctional supervision, including
        2.8 million adults on probation and 671,000 on parole.
        The percentage distribution of the total corrections
        population was-- </li>

<p> Confinement 28.0% </p>

<p> Federal prisons 1.7 </p>

<p> State prisons 17.0 </p>

<p> Local jails 9.3 </p>

<p> Community supervision 72.0% </p>

<p> Parole 13.7 </p>

<p> Probation 58.3 </p>

<p> * Between 1980 and 1993, the number of persons under
correctional supervision increased by more than 3 million. About
19% of this increase occurred because of the growth in the State
and Federal prison populations. </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p> Rates of incarceration increase </p>

<p> On December 31, 1994, the number of sentenced prisoners per
100,000 U.S. residents was 387. Of the 14 States with rates
greater than the rate for the Nation, 11 were in the South, 2
were in the West, and 1 was in the Midwest. Four States, North
Dakota (78), Minnesota (100), West Virginia (106), and Maine
(118) had rates that were less than a third of the national rate.
</p>

<p> The District of Columbia, a wholly urban jurisdiction, held
1,583 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 residents at yearend 1994.
Since 1980 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000 residents
has risen from 139 to 387. During this period, per capita
incarceration rates rose the most in the South (from 188 to 451)
and West (from 105 to 333). The rate in the Northeast rose from
87 to 285, and the rate in the Midwest from 109 to 297. The
number of sentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 residents
increased from 9 to 30 over the same period. </p>

<p> Prison populations in Southern States grew the fastest </p>

<p> During 1994 the average growth in the number of sentenced
State and Federal prisoners was equal to a demand for 1,542
additional bed spaces per week, about 179 more than the average
weekly growth in 1993. </p>

<p> Regionally, during 1994 the percentage increase in the number
of sentenced prisoners was highest in the Southern States, a gain
of 13.1%. The number of sentenced prisoners grew by 6.2% in the
West, 5.8% in the Midwest, and 4.1% in the Northeast. In 29
States the percentage change in the number of sentenced prisoners
during 1994 was higher than that of 1993. </p>

<p> Among these jurisdictions, 16 had increases of at least 10%.
They were led by Texas (28.3%), Georgia (20.1%), Virginia
(14.9%), New Hampshire (13.9%), and Idaho (13.7%). In five States
(Delaware, Maine, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Massachusetts)
and the District of Columbia the number of sentenced prisoners
increased by less than 2%. In two States--Alaska and
Connecticut--the number of sentenced prisoners declined during
1994. Since 1989 net gains in the number of sentenced prisoners
have averaged about 1,162 prisoners per week--a gain of about
1,036 State prisoners and 125 Federal prisoners per week over the
period. The largest net gains occurred in the South (500 inmates
per week), followed by the West (213 inmates per week), the
Midwest (180 inmates per week), and the Northeast (144 inmates
per week). Texas accounted for 34% of the total growth in the 16
Southern States and the District of Columbia. California
accounted for two-thirds of the growth in the 13 Western States. </p>

<p> In 1994 the 10 States with the largest prison populations
held 55% of the total prison population nationwide, with
California, Texas, and New York accounting for nearly 30%. Texas
had the highest incarceration rate, with 636 sentenced prisoners
per 100,000 residents, followed by Louisiana (530) and Oklahoma
(508). </p>

<p> During 1994 the prison population in Texas grew the fastest,
increasing 28.5%. Over the past 5 years the State prison
population of New Hampshire grew the fastest, increasing 73.3%.
At yearend 1994 North Dakota had the lowest rate of incarceration
(78 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 residents), followed by
Minnesota (100), West Virginia (106), and Maine (118). </p>

<p> Seventeen States, each holding fewer than 5,000 inmates,
together held 4% of all prisoners in 1994. </p>

<p> The number of sentenced inmates has increased in every State
since 1989. Alaska (up 1.4% since 1989) and Maine (up 2.2%) had
the smallest percentage increases. Four other States had
increases of less than 20% in the last 5 years. Kansas had a
5-year rate of growth of 13.5%, followed by Nebraska (13.7%), New
Mexico (17.9%), and Wyoming (18.6%). </p>

<p> Female prisoner population grew at a faster pace The number
of female inmates (64,403) increased at a faster rate during 1994
(10.6%) than the number of male inmates (989,335 at 8.5%). </p>

<p> At the end of 1994 women accounted for 6.1% of all prisoners
nationwide. Relative to the number of women in the resident
population in the States in 1994, Oklahoma (with 96 female
inmates per 100,000 female residents) and Texas (with 94) led the
Nation. North Dakota (5 per 100,000) and Maine (9) had the lowest
female incarceration rates. In 1994, 28 States, the District of
Columbia, and the Federal system had more than 500 female
inmates. Among these jurisdictions, 14 had increases of at least
10%, led by the Texas increase of 27.2% (from 6,949 in 1993 to
8,839 in 1994). </p>

<p> Six States held fewer than 100 female inmates at yearend
1994. Women represented less than 4% of all prisoners in North
Dakota, Montana, and Vermont. In 1994, 7.5% of inmates in the
Federal system were female--higher than all State systems except
for Oklahoma (9.7%), Hawaii (7.7%), and Texas (7.5%). </p>

<p> Local jails held almost 49,000 prisoners because of State
prison crowding At the end of 1994, 23 jurisdictions reported a
total of 48,949 State prisoners held in local jails or
otherfacilities because of crowding in State facilities. Texas
accounted for 42% of the prisoners sentenced to prison but
incarcerated locally. Eight States--Louisiana, Texas, Virginia,
West Virginia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Tennessee, and
Idaho--held more than 10% of their prison population in local
jails. Overall, because of prison crowding, 4.6% of the State
prisoners were confined in local jails, down from 5.2% in 1993. </p>

<p> Prison capacity estimates are difficult to compare The extent
of crowding in the Nation's prisons is difficult to determine
because of the absence of uniform measures for defining capacity.
The 52 reporting jurisdictions apply a wide variety of capacity
measures to reflect both available space to house inmates and the
ability to staff and operate an institution. To estimate the
capacity of the Nation's prisons, jurisdictions were asked to
supply three measures for yearend 1994: rated, operational, and
design capacities. These measures were defined as follows: </p>

<p> Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by a
rating official to institutions within the jurisdiction. </p>

<p> Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can be
accommodated based on a facility's staff, existing programs, and
services. </p>

<p> Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners or
architects intended for the facility. </p>

<p> Of the 52 reporting jurisdictions, 38 supplied rated
capacities, 43 provided operational capacities, and 37 submitted
design capacity. As a result, estimates of total capacity and
measures of the relationship to population are based on the
highest and lowest capacity figures provided. (Twenty-five
jurisdictions reported 1 capacity measure or gave the same figure
for each capacity measure they reported.) </p>

<p> Most jurisdictions are operating above capacity Prisons
generally require reserve capacity to operate efficiently.
Dormitories and cells need to be maintained and repaired
periodically, special housing is needed for protective custody
and disciplinary cases, and space may be needed to cope with
emergencies. At the end of 1994, 13 States and the District of
Columbia reported that they were operating at or below 99% of
their highest capacity. Forty-one States, the District of
Columbia and the Federal prison system reported operating at 100%
or more of their lowest capacity. By yearend, the Federal system
was estimated to be operating at 25% over capacity. </p>

<p> State prisons were estimated to be operating at 117% of their
highest capacity and 129% of their lowest capacity. </p>

<p> Changing demographic characteristics </p>

<p> The demographic characteristics of the Nation's prison
population are changing. Since 1980 the number of female inmates
in the Nation's prisons has increased at a faster rate (up an
average 12.0% per year) than the number of male inmates (up an
average 8.5% per year.) Despite their faster population growth,
females comprised only 6% of all sentenced prisoners at yearend
1994. In 1994 the male incarceration rate, 746 per 100,000 male
residents, was more than 16 times higher than the female
incarceration rate--45 per 100,000 female residents. Increasing
percentages of State and Federal inmates are from racial or
ethnic minority groups. Between 1980 and 1993, the latest
available data, the percent of sentenced inmates who were black
rose from 46.5% to 50.8%. Relative to the number of residents in
the U.S. population, blacks at yearend 1993 were 7 times more
likely than whites to have been incarcerated in a State or
Federal prison. An estimated 1,471 blacks per 100,000 black
residents and 207 whites per 100,000 white residents were
incarcerated in the Nation's prisons on December 31, 1993. </p>

<p> The number of prisoners with sentences of more than a year
rose 616,292 between 1980 and 1993 (up 195%). The number of white
males grew 163%, the number of black males 217%, the number of
white females 327%, and the number of black females 343%. </p>

<p> The growth in the number of black male prisoners (304,800)
accounted for nearly half of the total increase during the
13-year period. </p>

<p> Hispanics, who may be of any race, are the fastest growing
minority group--increasing from 7.7% of all State and Federal
inmates in 1980 to 14.3% in 1993. During this period, the
Hispanic incarceration rate more than tripled--from 163 sentenced
prisoners per 100,000 Hispanic residents in 1980 to 529 per
100,000 Hispanic residents in 1993. At yearend 1993 nearly
139,000 Hispanics were in State or Federal prisons. </p>

<p> The total number of Hispanic inmates may actually be somewhat
larger. Because of variations in record keeping, some States are
unable to report data on Hispanic origin; other States report
estimates only; and others report only partial counts. Data from
past surveys of State inmates, which are based on inmate
self-identification during personal interviews, produce higher
estimates of the number of Hispanic inmates. </p>

<p> On December 31, 1993, nearly two-thirds of all sentenced
prison inmates were black, Asian, Native American, or Hispanic.
Growth linked to increasing numbers of inmates in prison for
violent and drug offenses </p>

<p> The distribution of the four major offense
categories--violent, property, drug, and public-order
offenses--changed dramatically in the Nation's prison population
between 1980 and 1993. As a percentage of all State and Federal
inmates, violent offenders fell from 57% in 1980 to 45% in 1993,
property offenders fell from 30% to 22%, drug offenders rose from
8% to 26%, and public-order offenders rose from 5% to 7%. </p>

<p> The rise in the number of drug offenders was the greatest
among Federal inmates. Prisoners sentenced for drug law
violations were the single largest group of Federal inmates (60%)
in 1993, up from 25% in 1980. The increase in drug offenders
accounted for nearly three-quarters of the total growth in
Federal inmates. </p>

<p> The percentage of inmates in State prison for a drug crime
also rose significantly, from 6% in 1980 to 22% in 1993. Nearly
10 times as many inmates were serving time in State prisons for
drug offenses in 1993 (186,000) as in 1980 (19,000). </p>

<p> In absolute numbers, however, the growth in State inmates was
greatest among violent offenders. Between 1980 and 1993, the
number of violent offenders grew by 221,200, while the number of
drug offenders grew by 167,000. As a percentage of the total
growth in sentenced State inmates during the period, violent
offenders accounted for 42% of the total growth, drug offenders
31%, property offenders 19%, and public-order offenders 7%. </p>

<p> Average sentence length and time served for State inmates
relatively unchanged </p>

<p> Data on prison admissions and releases collected annually in
the National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) suggest that
growth in the State prison populations has not been the result of
longer sentences. (Each year participating States provide
information on sentencing and time served for persons entering or
leaving prison. In 1993, 38 States and the District of Columbia
submitted data, accounting for nearly 93% of all admissions and
85% of all releases nationwide during the year.) Between 1985 and
1992, years in which comparable data are available, the average
(mean) maximum sentences of prisoners actually declined from 78
months to 67 months. </p>

<p> The median sentence length (the 50th percentile) of prisoners
admitted from court remained constant at 48 months. Moreover,
despite the increasing use of mandatory minimums and sentencing
enhancements during the period, the percent of inmates who
received a maximum sentence of 10 years or longer actually
declined (from 19.7% in 1985 to 17.7% in 1992). </p>

<p> The NCRP data also reveal no significant changes in the time
served by offenders released from State prison during the period.
In 1992 State prisoners released for the first time on their
current offense (that is, first releases) served an average of 22
months in prison and 5 months in jail. (Time served in jail is
the amount of time an inmate spends in jail prior to entering
State prison and is credited towards time served on the total
sentence.) The amount of time served in prison was slightly lower
in 1985 (20 months), higher in 1986 (24 months), and about the
same since 1987 (22 months). </p>

<p> These data reflect the time served by prisoners actually
released. Some prisoners will never be released but will die in
prison. Some prisoners with very long sentences do not show up
among released prisoners for many years. As a result, measures of
time served based on released prisoners tend to understate the
actual time to be served by persons entering prison. </p>

<p> Changing Federal sentencing linked to population growth </p>

<p> The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 introduced &quot;truth in
sentencing&quot; to the Federal justice system. The Act created a
commission that specified sentencing guidelines, which went into
effect in late 1987. The guidelines took into account the gravity
of the crime and the offender's criminal record. Under the
guidelines offenders convicted of Federal offenses are expected
to serve a minimum of 85% of the actual sentence. </p>

<p> After 1986 the average Federal sentence to prison for violent
crimes decreased, while overall time served increased. The result
is a rapidly growing Federal prison population. After 1986 the
average time served by persons released from Federal prison rose
from 15 months to 24 months (a 60% increase). For violent
offenses, the time served by first releases increased from 50
months to 56 months and for drug offenses, time served increased
from 22 months to 33 months. </p>

<p> The sentencing reforms also increased the likelihood of
incarceration for convicted Federal offenders. </p>

<p> Between 1980 and 1992 the number of defend-ants convicted in
U.S. district courts rose from 29,943 to 51,936, and the
percentage sent to prison increased from 46% to 75%. As a result,
the number of offenders sent to Federal prisons rose from 13,766
to 33,622--an increase of 144%. (&quot;Federal Criminal Case
Processing, 1980-90,&quot; September 1992, NCJ-136945;
&quot;Federal Criminal Case Processing, 1982-91, With Preliminary
Data for 1992,&quot; November 1993, NCJ-144526.) </p>

<p> Rise in State prison population the result of increasing
number of arrests and higher probabilities of incarceration </p>

<p> Underlying the growth in the State prison population has been
an increase in the number of arrests from nearly 8.3 million
adult arrests in 1980 to 11.6 million in 1993. Although the total
grew by nearly 41%, for some offenses the percent increase was
substantially greater: simple assault (139%), drug abuse
violations (116%), aggravated assault (86%). Compounding the
impact of more adult arrests for selected serious offenses, the
rate of sending offenders to prison rose between 1980 and 1992
(the latest year for which data are available). Except for murder
and nonnegligent manslaughter, the number of admissions to State
prison per 1,000 arrests for serious crimes rose significantly.
The likelihood of incarceration upon arrest increased 5-fold for
drug violations, increased 4-fold for weapons offenses, and
doubled for larceny/theft, motor vehicle theft, and sexual
assault other than rape. </p>

<p> As a result of the compounding nature of these factors, the
number of admissions to State prisons from court rose from
131,215 sentenced prisoners in 1980 to 318,069 in 1993, an
increase of 142%. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> National Prisoner Statistics </p>

<p> This Bulletin is based on an advance count of prisoners
conducted for the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program
immediately after the end of each calendar year. A detailed,
final count containing any revisions to the jurisdictions'
advance count will be published later. </p>

<p> Most States provide jurisdiction counts, that is, the number
of inmates under their jurisdiction on December 31, regardless of
the location of their inmates. These counts exclude inmates
housed for other jurisdictions, such as other State's inmates and
pretrial detainees, that are housed in a jurisdiction's
facilities. </p>

<p> Some States provide custody counts, that is, the number of
inmates housed in State facilities regardless of jurisdiction.
(See Jurisdiction notes.) These counts exclude inmates housed
outside of each State's prison facilities, such as inmates housed
in local jails. Custody counts are used to calculate the total
number of inmates in prisons and jails. </p>

<p> Estimation procedures </p>

<p> The offense distributions of State prisoners at yearend were
estimated for 1980, 1985, and 1990-93. To obtain estimates of the
custody populations by offense, data from inmate surveys
conducted in 1979, 1986, and 1991, were combined with counts by
offense of annual admissions and releases. The surveys provided
the basis for estimating the offense distributions of the other
years. </p>

<p> The offense distributions were estimating using forward and
backward stock-flow procedures as outlined in Correction
Populations in the United States, 1992 (January 1995,
NCJ-146413). Data from the 1979 survey were used for forward
estimates for 1980; data from the 1986 survey (conducted in March
1986) were used for 1985 estimates, 1990 forward estimates, and
1980 backward estimates; and data from the 1991 survey for 1991
estimates and 1992-93 forward estimates. </p>

<p> To obtain flow populations for each year, the offense
distributions of admissions and releases were drawn from annual
reports of the National Prisoner Statistics (1980-82) program and
the National Corrections Reporting Program (1983-92). Data from
the 1992 NCRP were used to estimate flows for 1993. </p>

<p> The offense distributions of Federal inmates are for
prisoners of any sentence length on September 30 in 1980 and
1985. Data for 1990-93 are taken from the BJS Federal justice
database. </p>

<p> Jurisdiction notes </p>

<p> Inmates housed in local jails are not considered part of the
prison population until they are admitted. Most inmates are
awaiting transfer into the prison system. An undetermined number
were held because of crowding. </p>

<p> Hawaii--Prisons and jails form one integrated system. All NPS
data include jail and prison populations. Population counts for
&quot;Inmates with over 1 year maximum sentence&quot; include

875 inmates on electronic detention. </p>

<p> Indiana--Prison population counts include 903 inmates who
were housed in local jails as of December 31, 1994, because of
crowding of State facilities. Another floor was opened in a
facility to accommodate a larger number of inmates; as a result,
capacity was increased and some crowding was reduced. </p>

<p> Iowa--Population counts are based on custody data. </p>

<p> Kansas--Population counts for &quot;Inmates with over 1 year
maximum sentence&quot; include a small undetermined number of
inmates with a sentence of less than 1 year (among those
sentenced under the Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act of 1993). </p>

<p> Kentucky--Population counts include 632 inmates who were
housed in local jails as of December 31, 1994, because of
crowding of State facilities. </p>

<p> Louisiana--The rated and operational capacities do not
include contractual work release facilities. The rated capacity
of the contractual work release facilities is 348 inmates. The
operational capacity of the contractual work release facilities
is 343 inmates. </p>

<p> Population counts include 8,064 inmates housed in local jails
because of crowding of State facilities. </p>

<p> Maine--Maine has a number of inmates serving concurrent
sentences some of which are 1 year or more and some 1 year or
less. These inmates are not included in the prison population
counts. </p>

<p> Maryland--Population totals are actual manual counts;
however, the breakdowns for sentence length are estimates. </p>

<p> Massachusetts--Population counts are based on jurisdictional
data for the first time. For this report custody counts for
December 31, 1993, were updated to jurisdictional counts.
Population counts exclude the 963 inmates housed in local jails
because of crowding of State facilities. Population totals are
actual counts, however, the male/female breakdown is an estimate
believed to be within 0.05% of the actual counts. Population
counts include 336 inmates without sentence information. </p>

<p> Michigan--Population counts are based on custody data. </p>

<p> Minnesota--Population counts include 85 inmates housed in
local jails as of December 31, 1994, because of crowding of State
facilities. </p>

<p> Mississippi--Population counts are as of December 30, 1994.
Population counts include 1,569 inmates housed in local jail as
of December 30, 1994, because of crowding. </p>

<p> New Jersey--&quot;Design&quot; capacity does not include
persons held in halfway houses (686) and persons held under the
county assistance program (846). </p>

<p> North Carolina--While population totals are actual counts,
the breakdowns for sentence length are estimates. Because of
crowding 248 male inmates were housed in local jails; another 937
male inmates were housed in private prisons out of State on a
contractual basis. The total of 1,185 male inmates are included
in the population counts. </p>

length is unknown is included in the count for &quot;Inmates with
a sentence of 1 year or less.&quot; </p>

<p> Pennsylvania--The design capacity figure increased because
several sections in different facilities opened. This State now
treats the rated, operational, and design capacity the same. </p>

<p> Rhode Island--Prisons and jails form one integrated system.
All NPS data include prison and jail populations. </p>

<p> South Carolina--Population counts include 359 inmates who
were housed in local jails as of December 31, 1994, because of
crowding of State facilities. </p>

<p> Tennessee--Population counts for &quot;Inmates with over 1
year maximum sentence&quot; include an undetermined number of
inmates with a sentence of 1 year. These counts are based on the
Department of Corrections' population report from December 29,
1994. Population counts include 1,829 inmates housed in local
jails because of overcrowding and exclude an undetermined number
offelons sentenced to serve their time in local jails. (The State
pays to house these felons, but the local court maintains
jurisdiction.) These counts are based on a jail report from
December 16, 1994. </p>

<p> Texas--Population counts for December 31, 1994, include
20,720 inmates housed in local jails because of crowding. In

<p> Utah--Population counts include 169 inmates housed in local
jails because of crowding of State facilities. </p>

<p> Vermont--Prisons and jails form an integrated system. All NPS
data include prison and jail populations. Some county and
municipal authorities operate local &quot;lockups.&quot; NPS data
include the inmates in local &quot;lockups&quot;. Population
counts for sentenced inmates include 305 who were on long-term
furlough. The rated capacity figures decreased due to the closing
of one facility for renovations. </p>

<p> Virginia--Virginia uses a base capacity method to determine
the rated, operational, and design capacity figures. Under this
method of determining capacity, only the bunks that touch the
floor are counted; top bunks are not counted. Population counts
include 4,508 inmates who were housed in local jails because of
crowding of State facilities. </p>

<p> West Virginia--Population counts are based oncustody data.
Population counts exclude 383 male and 15 female inmates housed
in county or regional jails because of crowding of State
facilities. </p>

unsentenced offenders reside in county jails. Capacities reported
exclude state work release and pre-release facilities which
housed 918 inmates on December 31, 1994. These facilities'
capacity of 1,102 inmates are not specifically reserved for State
prison inmates. These facilities are for prison inmates,
parolees, probationers, and offenders serving partial confinement
sentences. <br>

<p> The number of inmates held in the Nation's local jails on
June 30, 1994, reached a record high of 490,442. Local jails,
which are operated by counties and municipalities and
administered by local government agencies, housed about a third
of all persons incarcerated in the U.S. at midyear 1994; the
other two-thirds were in State or Federal prisons. </p>

<p> The jail population grew by 30,638 inmates between July 1,
1993, and June 30, 1994, the third largest annual increase
recorded since 1983. The 12-month increase was the equivalent of
a 6.7% rate of growth. </p>

<p> Between 1983 and 1993, when comparable statistics were
collected, the number of local jail employees grew at a faster
rate than the number of inmates. During this period, the number
of jail inmates increased at an annual rate of 7.5%, while the
number of full-time and part-time jail employees grew at an
annual rate of 10%. By midyear 1993, local jails employed an
estimated 165,500 persons. </p>

<p> Highlights </p>

<p> After a decade of record growth, the number of inmates in
local jails reached a high of 490,442 on June 30, 1994 </p>

<p> * The number of jail inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents
increased from 96 in 1983 to 188 in 1994. </p>

<p> * In 1993, 8 States had over 200 local jail inmates per
100,000 residents: Louisiana (377), Georgia (328), Texas (307),
Tennessee (282), Florida (250), Virginia (225), California (222),
and Nevada (215). </p>

<p> * Between 1983 and 1993 the number of jail inmates increased
106%; the total jail staff increased 156%; and the number of
correctional officers grew 165%. </p>

<p> * At midyear 1994 the capacity of the Nation's local jails
was 504,324 inmates, as measured by the number of beds allotted
by State or local rating officials. </p>

<p> * The jail population was 97% of rated capacity. Jail space
increased 93% between 1983 and 1994. </p>

<p> * White non-Hispanics made up 39% of the jail population;
black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non-Hispanics of
other races, 2%. </p>

<p> Factors underlying the growth in the Nation's jail population
included: </p>

<p> * an increase in adult arrests </p>

<p> * a growth in jail admissions </p>

<p> * an increased number of felons sentenced to local jails </p>

<p> * an increased number of inmates charged with or convicted of
drug offenses </p>

<p> * more inmates held in jails because of crowded State or
Federal facilities. </p>

<p> Data sources </p>

<p> The data in this report are based on results from the 1993
Census of Jails and the 1994 Annual Survey of Jails. Every 5
years the jail census collections provide detailed information on
local jail inmates, staff, facilities, and programs. Previous
censuses were conducted in 1970, 1972, 1978, 1983, and 1988.
Beginning in 1982 and in years between each jail census, a sample
of jails has been surveyed to obtain basic information on inmates
and jail capacity. These annual surveys provide national-level
estimates on fewer characteristics than the census. (See
Methodology at end.) </p>

<p> As defined in this report, jails are locally operated
correctional facilities that confine persons before or after
adjudication. Inmates sentenced to jail usually have a sentence
of a year or less, but jails also incarcerate persons in a wide
variety of other categories. </p>

<p> Jails-- </p>

<p> * receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them
awaiting trial, conviction, or sentencing </p>

<ul>
    <li>readmit probation, parole, and bail-bond violators and
        absconders </li>
    <li>* temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to
        juvenile authorities </li>
</ul>

<p> * hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to
appropriate health facilities </p>

<p> * hold individuals for the military, for protective custody,
for contempt, and for the courts as witnesses </p>

<ul>
    <li>release convicted inmates to the community upon
        completion of sentence </li>
    <li>* transfer inmates to Federal, State, or other
        authorities </li>
</ul>

<p> * relinquish custody of temporary detainees to juvenile and
medical authorities </p>

<p> * sometimes operate community-based programs with electronic
monitoring or other types of supervision. </p>

<p> Not included in the survey or census are inmates in six
States with combined jail and prison systems. At midyear 1994
these States-Alaska (except for 5 local jails), Connecticut,
Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont--held nearly 6,000
inmates who were unsentenced or had sentences of less than a
year. These inmates and the facilities that house them are
included in BJS prison statistics. </p>

<p> The 1993 Census of Jails also included, for the first time,
seven Federal facilities that perform the pretrial functions of
local jails. Data on these Federal facilities and inmates are
reported separately. (See the section on Federal jails.) </p>

<p> Local jail inmates </p>

<p> On June 30, 1994, the Nation's jails held 490,442 inmates, an
increase of 6.7% over the number held on June 30, 1993. The jail
population grew by more than 30,000 inmates during the 12-month
period, the third largest increase ever recorded. </p>

<p> Since 1983 the jail inmate population has nearly doubled on a
per capita basis. During this period, the number of jail inmates
per 100,000 residents rose from 96 to 188. At midyear 1994 about
1 in every 398 adult residents of the United States was in a
local jail. </p>

<p> An estimated 6,725 persons under age 18 were housed in adult
jails on June 30, 1994. Over three-quarters of them had been
convicted or were being held for trial as adults in criminal
court. Most juveniles in correctional custody are housed in
juvenile facilities. </p>

<p> Who is a juvenile? </p>

<p> Most, but not all, States define a juvenile as a person under
age 18 who is subject to juvenile court jurisdiction. Exceptions
usually depend on offense severity or an offender's adjudication
history. In the 1993 census and 1994 survey, to achieve reporting
uniformity, jail authorities were asked to report the number of
inmates under age 18. Of the 6,725 total in 1994, 76% were
identified as juveniles tried or scheduled to be tried as adults.
Statutes and judicial practice some- times allow youths to be
held in adult jails. Often juveniles accused of acts that are
crimes for adults may be held in local jails or police lockups,
given certain conditions: </p>

<p> * separated by sight and sound from the general population </p>

<p> * held for a limited time, typically less than 6 hours. </p>

<p> Most confined juveniles are housed in institutions specified
for them. In 1993 about 96,000 were in public and private
juvenile detention and correctional facilities. </p>

<p> The average daily population for the year ending June 30,
1994, was 479,757, an increase of 2.9% from 1993. Between 1983
and 1993, when separate counts by sex were collected, the average
daily population of female inmates grew at a faster rate (up
11.1% per year) than the average daily population of adult male
inmates (up 7.1% per year). </p>

<p> States with the largest jail populations </p>

<p> In 1993, 5 States incarcerated slightly less than half of all
local jail inmates: California (69,298 inmates), Texas (55,395),
Florida (34,183), New York (29,809), and Georgia (22,663).
Twenty-one States reported a jailpopulation that more than
doubled between 1983 and 1993, with growth ranging from 103% in
Maryland to 264% in Texas. </p>

<p> States that had the largest number of jail inmates per
100,000 residents in 1993 were Louisiana (377), Georgia (328),
Texas (307), Tennessee (282), Florida (250), Virginia (225),
California (222), and Nevada (215). States with a jail
incarceration rate less than half that of the Nation (178 per
100,000) were Iowa, Maine, and North Dakota (57), Minnesota and
Montana (81), and South Dakota (87). </p>

<p> The number of local jail inmates rose the most in the South
and the least in the Midwest. From 1983 to 1993 the inmate
population grew 135% in the South, 102% in the Northeast, 81% in
the West, and 79% in the Midwest. </p>

<p> For the Nation a declining number of jails held these
increasing numbers of inmates. In 1993 the total of 3,304
facilities was 12 fewer than 5 years before and 34 fewer than in
1983. </p>

<p> Facility size and the percentage of the inmate population
held </p>

<p> A small number of jails held a disproportionate share of the
Nation's jail inmates. About 6% of the jail facilities housed
more than half of all jail inmates on June 30, 1993. Facilities
with an average daily population of 500 or more during the annual
period ending June 30, 1993, held 53% of local jail inmates.
Facilities with an average daily population of fewer than 50
persons comprised 57% of all jails but housed about 8% of all
inmates. </p>

<p> Demographic characteristics of local jail inmates </p>

<p> Male inmates made up 90% of the local jail inmate population
at midyear 1994, down from 93% in 1983. An estimated 1 in every
212 adult men and 1 in every 2,048 adult women were held in a
local jail on June 30, 1994. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1994, a majority of local jail inmates were black
or Hispanic. White non-Hispanics made up 39% of the jail
population; black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and other
races (Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians and Alaska
Natives), 2%. </p>

<p> Relative to the number of residents in the U.S. population,
black non-Hispanics were more than twice as likely as Hispanics,
nearly 7 times more likely than white non-Hispanics, and over 9
times more likely than persons of other races to have been held
in a local jail on June 30, 1994. </p>

<p> Federal jails </p>

<p> Black non-Hispanic 215,400 691 </p>

<p> Hispanic 75,500 290 </p>

<p> Other race 7,700 74 </p>

<p> Note: U.S. resident populations were estimated. Inmate counts
were adjusted for nonresponse and rounded to the nearest 100.
Rates were based on relevant population subgroups. </p>

<p> Adult conviction status, mid-1993 </p>

<p> On June 30, 1993, the most recent date for available data, at
least half the Nation's adult jail inmates had been convicted on
their current charge. Convicted inmates include those awaiting
sentencing, serving a sentence, or returned to jail for a
violation of probation or parole. Between 1983 and 1993 the
reported number of convicted inmates more than doubled (from
107,660 to 226,600). The number of jail inmates awaiting court
disposition also doubled (from 113,984 to 228,900). </p>

<p> In 1993 female inmates were somewhat more likely than male
inmates to have been convicted. Among adult female inmates, 52%
had been convicted on their current charge, compared to 50% of
the male inmates. </p>

<p> Rated capacity and percent occupied At midyear 1994, the
rated capacity of the Nation's local jails totaled 504,324. Rated
capacity is the maximum number of beds or inmates allocated by
State or local rating officials to each jail facility. During the
12 months ending June 30, 1994, an estimated 29,100 beds were
added. Nearly a quarter of a million beds have been added since
1983. </p>

<p> As of June 30, 1994, 97% of the local jail capacity was
occupied. As measured by a ratio of the number of inmates housed
in jail facilities to the rated capacity, the percent of capacity
actually occupied may have been somewhat lower than 97%. Included
among the total jail inmates were an unknown number of inmates
housed outside of jail facilities--under electronic monitoring,
on house arrest, under other kinds of community supervision, or
temporarily in hospitals or treatment centers. </p>

<p> As a ratio of all inmates to capacity, the percent of
capacity occupied increased considerably after 1983, reaching a
record 108% in 1989 and then falling to 97% in 1993. Since 1989
rated capacity has risen by nearly 137,000 beds, while the number
of inmates has increased by 95,000. </p>

<p> In 1993 the total jail population exceeded jail capacity in
eight States and the District of Columbia. </p>

<p> Percent of jail </p>

<p> State capacity occupied </p>

<p> --------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Virginia 160% </p>

<p> South Carolina 124 </p>

<p> District of Columbia 121 </p>

<p> New Jersey 120 </p>

<p> Texas 115 </p>

<p> California 113 </p>

<p> Massachusetts 106 </p>

<p> Washington 102 </p>

<p> Pennsylvania 101 </p>

<p> In eight other States, excluding Alaska, the total jail
population was below 75% of the combined capacity of all local
jails. The lowest occupancy rates were in North Dakota (43%),
followed by Wyoming (52%), South Dakota (54%), and Montana (60%).
Between 1988 and 1993 the capacity of the Nation's local jails
increased by 40%, from 339,949 beds to 475,224. In eight States
the capacity of local jails increased by more than 60% during the
5-year period. Jails in New Hampshire and Massachusetts
experienced the largest percentage increase in capacity. During
this period the combined capacities of jails declined in the
following jurisdictions: West Virginia, Montana, and the District
of Columbia. </p>

<p> In every census year, facilities with the largest average
daily populations have reported the highest occupancy rates. In
1993 occupancy was 111% of rated capacity in jails with an
average population of 1,000 or more inmates, compared to 67% in
those with fewer than 50 inmates. </p>

<p> The 25 largest jail jurisdictions </p>

<p> In 1994 the Nation's 25 largest jail jurisdictions accounted
for 30% of all jail inmates. The jurisdictions were in 12 States:
7 in California; 5 in Texas; 4 in Florida; and 1 each in New
York, Illinois, Louisiana, Tennessee, Arizona, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Georgia, and Michigan. </p>

<p> New York City's system, with 15 institutions, had the largest
number of facilities. </p>

<p> The two jurisdictions with the most inmates, Los Angeles
County and New York City, together held more than 38,284, or 8%
of the national total. </p>

<p> Overall, the 25 largest jurisdictions on June 30, 1994, had a
total population of 149,082 inmates, 10% more than the 135,060 a
year earlier. </p>

<p> In 1994, 15 jurisdictions reported having a larger average
daily population than in 1993. </p>

<p> Dallas County, Texas, reported the largest single year
growth--2,123 inmates--and the largest growth from 1988 to
1994--5,494. Shelby County (Memphis), Tennessee, reported the
largest decrease from 1993 to 1994--1,327 inmates. </p>

<p> Local jail employees </p>

<p> Local jails employed an estimated 165,500 persons on June 30,
1993. Including all full-time and part-time, payroll and
nonpayroll staff, the total staff grew by more than 100,000
between 1983 and 1993, an increase of 156%. </p>

<p> The staff total included 117,900 correctional officers, the
employees most responsible for providing a secure environment and
for directly supervising inmates. Correctional officers comprised
about 7 in every 10 jail employees in the 3 censuses, 1983-93. </p>

<p> Characteristics of local jail staff </p>

<p> At midyear 1993 men comprised 70% of all paid jail staff and
76% of correctional officers. Excluded were nonpayroll jail
employees, such as teachers or counselors, who were paid by
agencies other than jails. </p>

<p> Between 1988 and 1993 the female staff in local jails nearly
doubled, from 25,642 to an estimated 48,000. In 1993 nearly a
third of all paid staff and a quarter of correctional officers
were women. The race and ethnic composition of jail staff
remained unchanged between 1988 and 1993. White employees made up
an estimated 71% of the payroll jail staff in 1993, including 69%
of the correctional officers. </p>

<p> Blacks comprised 22% of all employees, including 23% of the
correctional officers. Hispanics accounted for 6% of the total
paid staff and 7% of correctional officers. </p>

<p> Inmate-to-staff ratios, 1993 </p>

<p> From 1983 to 1993 the number of U.S. jail employees increased
156%, as the number of correctional officers went up 165%. Jail
staffs in the Northeast had the largest percentage
increases--more than tripling in 10 years--while those in the
Midwest had the smallest, more than doubling. The South, the
region with the largest number of jail employees, registered the
greatest regional growth (75%) from 1988 to 1993. The West, with
less than half the number of employees in the South, also had the
least growth in staff (50%). Throughout the period, 1983-93, the
jail staff in the Nation and in every region grew more rapidly
than the inmate population. In 1993 jails held 2.8 inmates per
employee. The ratio in 1993 was almost a fifth lower than the 3.4
inmates per employee in 1988. </p>

<p> As a measure of workload, the number of inmates per
correctional officer also declined, from 4.7 in 1988 to 3.9 in
1993. All four regions had decreases in inmate-to-correctional
officer ratios. The West reported the sharpest decline, from 7.1
inmates per officer in 1983 to 5.3 in 1993. The smaller
facilities had fewer inmates per correctional officer (2.4) than
did larger jails (4.6 inmates per officer in the jails with a
1,000 or more inmates). The jails that were operating with an
inmate population at least 10% over their rated capacity had an
inmate-to-correctional officer ratio almost twice that of jails
with less than 75% of capacity occupied. Jails with 91% to 110%
of capacity filled employed a correctional officer for more than
every 4 inmates. </p>

<p> Annual jail expenditures </p>

<p> Local jails throughout the United States spent a total of
slightly over $9.6 billion during the year ending June 30, 1993.
This estimated total (not adjusted for inflation) was more than
double the $2.7 billion spent in 1983. </p>

<p> Approximately 71% of all reporting facilities were able to
provide data on expenditures in 1993. These jails reported total
annual expenditures were nearly $7.8 billion; operating costs,
about $5.5 billion; and capital expenditures, $2.2 billion. </p>

<p> Gross salaries and wages, employer contributions to employee
benefits, purchases of food, supplies, contractual services, and
other current operating costs accounted for 71% of expenditures.
Construction costs, major repairs, equipment, improvements, land
purchases, and other capital outlays accounted for the remaining
29%. In 1988, operating costs made up 78% of all expenditures and
capital outlays, 22%. </p>

<p> Average operating cost per inmate </p>

<p> Excluding capital outlays in 1993, the average cost to keep
one jail inmate incarcerated for a year was $14,667. Over 10
years the cost per inmate had risen 57% from $9,360. (Adjusted
for inflation to 1983 dollars the annual cost per inmate had
decreased by 11%.) The Northeast had the highest average
operating expenditure per inmate ($22,678) and the South, the
lowest ($11,697). Excluding Alaska and the District of Columbia,
average annual operating costs per inmate by State were highest
in New York ( $29,297) and lowest in Mississippi ($7,014). </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> During the year ending June 30, 1993, 647 inmate deaths
occurred in the jurisdiction of the jail authorities who provided
data on such deaths. Although asked to report the death of
inmates under the jurisdiction of jail authorities, regardless of
where the death took place, some facilities could report only
deaths that occurred on the jail premises. In addition, about 10%
of all jails were unable to report whether any inmate deaths had
occurred in 1993. </p>

<p> In 1993 illness was the leading cause of death in local jails
(45%), followed by suicide (36%). Acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS) accounted for about 10% of reported inmate
deaths; homicide, 3%; and other causes, 6%. </p>

<p> The death rate among jail inmates fell by more than a third
between 1983 and 1993, from 232 to 149 per 100,000 inmates. While
the rate of death from illness, including AIDS, remained
relatively constant over the period, the rate of suicide declined
sharply, from 129 per 100,000 in 1983, to 85 in 1988, to 54 in
1993. </p>

<p> Federal jails </p>

<p> In 1993 the Federal Bureau of Prisons maintained a small
number of detention facilities that functioned as jails. These
were not counted among the city, county, or regional adult
detention facilities called local jails in this report. Local
facilities, however, did hold about 12,000 persons for Federal
authorities, according to data reported by 90% of all facilities.
At midyear 1993 the Bureau of Prisons operated 7 jails, holding
5,899 persons who were awaiting adjudication or serving a
sentence, usually of a year or less. </p>

<p> Inmate demographics </p>

<p> Ninety-three percent of Federal jail inmates were men, a
slightly higher proportion than in local jails (90%). Seventy-two
percent were white, 25% were black, and 3% were Asians, Pacific
Islanders, American Indians, or Alaska Natives. </p>

<p> Conviction status </p>

<p> Slightly more than half of the Federal inmates were
unconvicted and were awaiting arraignment, trial, or the
completion of their trial. </p>

<p> Facility capacity </p>

<p> The 7 Federal jails had a combined rated capacity of
3,810-the population being 155% of that capacity. The percent
occupied was about 50% higher than that of local jails of
comparable size. </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> Eight inmates died while under the jurisdiction of Federal
jail authorities during the annual period ending June 30, 1993.
Four deaths resulted from illness or natural causes, two were
suicides, and two were drug overdoses. </p>

<p> Staff </p>

<p> Seventy-five percent of Federal jail employees were male, a
higher percentage than the 70% of employees for local facilities.
A majority of the Federal jail employees were correctional
officers. </p>

<p> Overall, there were 2.9 inmates per staff member in Federal
jails, about the same as in local facilities where the ratio was
2.8 inmates per employee. However, the number of inmates per
correctional officer (5.5) was higher than in local jails with
500 to 999 inmates (4.4). </p>

<p> Expenditures </p>

<p> Federal jail expenditures totaled slightly more than $166
million during the annual period ending June 30, 1993, excluding
those at the Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, facility, in operation only a
few months at the time of the census. Gross salaries and wages,
contributions to employee benefits, purchases of food, supplies,
contractual services, and other current operating costs accounted
for 76% of expenditures. Construction costs, major repairs,
equipment, improvements, land purchases, and other capital
outlays made up the remaining 24%. </p>

<p> The average cost to house one Federal jail inmate during the
year ending June 30, 1993, exclusive of capital expenditures was
$22,773, as compared to $14,667 among local jails. </p>

<p> Factors behind the growing jail population </p>

<p> An increasing number of arrests </p>

<p> Underlying the dramatic growth of the Nation's local jail
population after 1983 was a rise in the number of arrests from
11.7 million in 1983 to 14.0 million in 1993. Over the 10-year
period, the total number of arrests grew at an annual rate of
1.8%. For some offenses the annual rate of growth was
substantially greater: simple assault (7.6%), aggravated assault
(5.8%), drug abuse violations (5.4%), and weapons violations
(3.9%). </p>

<p> The increase in arrests resulted in a growing number of
admissions to local jails. On June 30, 1993, an estimated 26,800
persons were officially booked and admitted to local jails, and
an additional 9,500 inmates were transferred in from other
facilities or readmitted after having been temporarily released.
The estimated number of new admissions totaled nearly 9.8 million
for 1993, up from an estimated 6.0 million in the annual period
ending June 30, 1983. </p>

<p> Among inmates facing felony charges, the likelihood of being
held in a local jail prior to the disposition of their case
remained nearly the same between 1988 and 1992. Based on the
biennial National Pretrial Reporting Program (NPRP) that
describes State felony defendants in the Nation's 75 most
populous counties, an estimated 37% were held awaiting
disposition in 1992. Roughly the same percentage was detained in
1988 (34%) and 1990 (35%). (Pretrial Release of Felony
Defendants, BJS Bulletins, 1988 [February 1991, NCJ-127202], 1990
[November 1992, NCJ-139560], and 1992 [November 1994,
NCJ-148818]). </p>

<p> More felons sentenced to local jail </p>

<p> The impact of more arrests and jail admissions was compounded
by a growing number of felons receiving a sentence to local jail.
Between 1986 and 1992 the number of convicted felons sentenced to
confinement in local jails almost doubled: </p>

<p> 1986-92 90% </p>

<p> Source: Felony Sentences in State Courts (1986, 1988, 1990,
and 1992). </p>

<p> Jail inmates received about the same average sentences Growth
in the local jail population between 1983 and 1993 was not the
result of longer sentences. Results from the National Judicial
Reporting Program (NJRP) indicate that between 1988 and 1992,
years in which comparable data on felons sentenced to local jails
are available, the average (mean) maximum jail sentence among
those entering jail remained constant. In 1988 and 1992 felons
sentenced to local jail received a mean sentence of 7 months.
(Felony Sentences in State Courts, BJS Bulletins, 1988 [December
1990, NCJ-126923], 1990 [March 1993, NCJ-149077], and 1992
[January 1995, NCJ-151167]). </p>

<p> Data from the 1983 and 1989 surveys of inmates in local jails
also reveal no significant changes in the sentence lengths
received by sentenced inmates overall, including felons and
misdemeanants. About 50% of the jail inmates had been convicted
and sentenced at the time of both surveys. (Profile of Jail
Inmates, 1989, BJS Special Report [April 1991, NCJ-129097]).
Between 1983 and 1989, there was an increase in the mean sentence
(from 14 months to 17 months) but no change in the median. In
both years half of the sentenced inmates had received a sentence
of 6 months or less. </p>

<p> More drug offenders incarcerated in local jails </p>

<p> The largest source of growth among inmates in local jails was
drug law violators. Based on data from inmate surveys in 1983 and
1989, the number of jail inmates charged or convicted of drug
offenses rose from 20,800 to 91,000. In 1983 about 1 of every 10
inmates were in jail for a drug offense; in 1989 nearly 1 of
every 4 were in jail for drugs. From 1983 to 1989 the increase in
the number of persons in jail for drug offenses accounted for
more than 40 percent of the total increase in the jail
population. </p>

<p> Between 1983 and 1989 the percentage of jail inmates
decreased for violent offenses (from 30.7% to 22.5%) and property
offenses (from 38.6% to 30.0%), but increased for public-order
offenses (from 20.6% to 22.8%). During this period, the total
number of inmates increased in every category: violent offenders
increased from 68,600 to 89,000; property offenders from 86,300
to 118,700; and public-order offenders from 46,100 to 90,200. </p>

<p> Although offense information for more recent years is not
available, estimates may be made using 1989 percentages. Assuming
no change in the percentage distributions, the estimated number
of drug offenders in local jails in 1993 was more than 105,800,
representing a 5-fold increase since 1983. </p>

<p> More jail inmates held for State/Federal authorities </p>

<p> The Nation's jail population also grew between 1983 and 1993
as a result of crowding in State and Federal prisons. On June 30,
1993, nearly 12% of all jail inmates were prisoners being held
for State or Federal authorities. An estimated 53,900 inmates
were held for State or Federal authorities in 1993, up from
17,281 in 1983. </p>

<p> Between 1983 and 1993 the number of inmates held for State
and Federal authorities grew at twice the rate of the inmate
population overall (212% compared with 106%). </p>

<p> Approximately 34,200 jail inmates in 1993 were in local
facilities as a direct result of crowding of State or Federal
facilities (representing 7.4% of all jail inmates). The other
19,700 inmates held for State or Federal authorities were in jail
for other reasons, such as waiting transfer or early release
(pending completion of paperwork or transportation),
participation in special programs, and special security needs. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> Census of Jails </p>

<p> The 1993 Census of Jails was the sixth in a series of data
collection efforts aimed at studying the Nation's locally
administered jails. Previous censuses were conducted in 1970,
1972, 1978, 1983, and 1988. As in previous censuses, the U.S.
Bureau of the Census collected the data for the Bureau of Justice
Statistics. </p>

<p> The 1993 census included all locally administered confinement
facilities (3,287) that hold inmates beyond arraignment and are
staffed by municipal or county employees. The census also
included 17 jails that were privately operated under contract for
local governments and 7 facilities maintained by BOP and
functioning as jails. </p>

<p> Excluded from the census were temporary holding facilities,
such as drunk tanks and police lockups, that do not hold persons
after being formally charged in court (usually within 72 hours of
arrest). Also excluded were State-operated facilities in Alaska,
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which
have combined jail-prison systems. Five locally operated jails in
Alaska were included. </p>

<p> The mailing list used for the census was derived from the
National Justice Agency List, which is maintained by the Bureau
of the Census for BJS. The census forms were mailed to 3,506
facilities on June 22, 1993. </p>

<p> Twenty-eight jails were added to the initial mail out, and
230 were deleted, resulting in a total of 3,304 facilities. </p>

<p> After extensive follow-up, including additional mail requests
and repeated telephone contacts, all jails (except those in one
jurisdiction) provided data for four critical data items--number
of inmates, average daily population, rated capacity, and sex of
inmates housed. Data on the these four items for the
nonresponding jails were imputed based on data reported in the
1994 Annual Survey of Jails. </p>

<p> Completed forms with data for all or most items were received
for 2,981 jails, resulting in a 90% response rate. These
reporting jails housed 93% of all local jail inmates on June 30,
1993. </p>

<p> Estimation procedures </p>

<p> Because there was nonresponse and incomplete data on all
census items except the four critical items, national totals had
to be estimated. The following procedures were used to estimate
totals when data were incomplete: </p>

<p> 1. Each item was first assessed for coverage and internal
consistency. For purposes of estimating the totals, extreme
values were examined and then verified by checking other census
information or calling the respondents. Detailed categories were
also checked to determine if they summed to the reported totals. </p>

<p> 2. To provide a national total, item values were summed and
then multiplied by a nonresponse adjustment factor (NAF). For
most estimates, the NAF was a ratio of the total number of
inmates in all jails to the number of inmates in jails that
reported valid data. Ratios based on inmate counts were used to
estimate the number of adults, the number of inmates by sex and
age, conviction status by sex, the number of staff by
occupational category and region (tables 11 and 13), and payroll
staff by sex and race. Ratios based on the total average daily
population were used to estimate total expenditures. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Estimates of detailed categories were further adjusted so
        that for each item the sum of the detail equaled the
        estimated total. For example, the estimated numbers of
        male and female adult inmates were ratio adjusted so that
        the final estimates summed to the total number of adult
        inmates. </li>
    <li>All estimates of inmates and staff were rounded to the
        nearest 100. Expenditures were rounded to the nearest
        million dollars. </li>
</ol>

<p> 5. All rates, ratios, and percentage distributions in this
report are based on reported data only. </p>

<p> Annual Survey of Jails </p>

<p> In each of the 4 years between the full censuses, a survey of
jails is conducted to estimate baseline characteristics of the
Nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails. The 1994 Annual
Survey of Jails is the 10th such survey in a series begun in
1982. The reference date for the 1994 survey was June 30, 1994. </p>

<p> Using information from the 1993 Census of Jails, a new sample
of jail jurisdictions was selected for the 1994 survey. A
jurisdiction is a county (parish in Louisiana) or municipal
government that administers one or more local jails. The sample
included all jails in 796 selected jail jurisdictions and 23
multijurisdiction jails. A multi-jurisdiction jail is one in
which two or more jurisdictions have a formal agreement to
operate the facility. </p>

<p> In drawing the sample for 1994, jail jurisdictions were first
stratified into two groups: single jurisdiction jails and
multijurisdiction jails. All of the multi-jurisdiction jails were
included in the survey. The remaining jurisdictions were then
further stratified into two groups: jurisdictions with jails
authorized to hold juveniles and jurisdictions with jails holding
only adults. Jurisdictions were then selected based on the
average daily population in the 1993 census. All jails in 203
jurisdictions were automatically included if the jurisdiction
held juveniles and had an average daily population of 250 or more
inmates in 1993 or if they held only adults and had an average
population of 500 or more. The other jurisdictions (593) were
then selected based on stratified probability sampling. </p>

<p> Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. After follow-up
phone calls to nonrespondents, the response rate for the survey
was 100%. </p>

<p> National estimates for the inmate population on June 30,
1994, were produced by sex, race/Hispanic origin, and age group
and for the average daily population during the year ending June
30, 1994. National estimates were also produced for rated
capacity. </p>

<p> Sampling error </p>

<p> Survey estimates have an associated sampling error because
jurisdictions with smaller average daily populations were sampled
for the survey. Estimates based on the sample survey may differ
somewhat from the results of conducting a complete census.
Different samples could yield somewhat different results.
Standard error is a measure of the variation among the estimates
from all possible samples, stating the precision with which an
estimate from a particular sample approximates the average of all
possible samples. The estimated relative sampling error for the
total inmate population of 490,442 on June 30, 1994, was 0.50%.
(See appendix tables 1 and 2.) </p>

<p> Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determine
whether differences between 1993 census counts and 1994 survey
estimates were statistically significant. All differences
mentioned in the report meet or exceed the 95-percent confidence
level. </p>

<p> Measures of population </p>

<p> Two measures of inmate population are used: the average daily
population for the year ending June 30 and the inmate count on
June 30 of each year. The average daily population balances out
any extraordinary events that may render atypical the inmate
count on June 30. The June 30 count provides data on
characteristics of inmates, such as race, Hispanic origin, and
age, that may not be available on an annual basis. </p>

<p> Juveniles </p>

<p> State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be
incarcerated in adult jails under a variety of circumstances.
Because of the differing statutes and practices, however,
accurate and comparable data on juveniles are difficult to
collect. The 1994 Annual Survey of Jails provides new and more
accurate estimates of the juvenile population. For the first
time, the survey provides estimates of the total number of jail
inmates under age 18, the number held as adults, and the number
held as juveniles. New sampling procedures were also introduced
in 1994 to minimize the standard errors of these estimates. By
stratifying jurisdictions based on the authority to house
juveniles, the precision of the juvenile counts were improved. </p>

<p> This study examines how State and Federal correctional
facilities seek to </p>

<p> stop the entry and use of illegal drugs. Based on the 1990
Census of State </p>

<p> and Federal Correctional Facilities, the report indicates
that nearly 9 in </p>

<p> 10 institutions conduct urine surveillance among the inmate
population, </p>

<p> usually on a random basis or on suspicion of use. Marijuana
and cocaine </p>

<p> were the drugs most commonly detected--in Federal facilities
about 1 in 100 </p>

<p> of the tests for marijuana and 1 in 250 tests for cocaine
were positive </p>

<p> while in State facilities about 1 in 16 tests were positive
for marijuana </p>

<p> and 1 in 28 were positive for cocaine. </p>

<p> I want to express my deep appreciation to the employees in
the 957 State </p>

<p> prisons, 80 Federal prisons, and the 250 community-based
facilities who </p>

<p> participated in the census. The 100-percent response rate is,
I believe, </p>

<p> important testimony to the utility and significance of
national data on the </p>

<p> operations of our Nation's correctional facilities. </p>

<p> 565,500 inmates for one or more illegal drugs between July 1,
1989, and </p>

<p> June 30, 1990. In State facilities, 3.6% of the tests for
cocaine, 1.3% </p>

<p> for heroin, 2.0% for methamphetamines, and 6.3% for marijuana
found </p>

<p> evidence of drug use. In Federal prisons, 0.4% of the tests
for cocaine, </p>

<p> 0.4% for heroin, 0.1% for methamphetamines, and 1.1% for
marijuana were </p>

<p> positive. </p>

<p> This report uses information provided to the Census of State
and Federal </p>

<p> Adult Correctional Facilities. Data were collected from 957
State prison </p>

<p> facilities, 250 State community-based facilities, and 80
Federal prisons </p>

<p> operating on June 29, 1990. Censuses were also conducted in
1984, 1979, </p>

<p> and 1974, but the 1990 census was the first to gather
information on drug </p>

<p> interdiction practices, drug testing of inmates and staff,
and inmate drug </p>

<p> treatment programs. </p>

<p> Other findings from the 1990 census include the following: </p>

<p> *Ninety-eight percent of State community-based
facilities--those in which </p>

<p> at least half of the residents may leave the facility
daily--tested </p>

<p> residents. All Federal prisons and 83% of State prisons
reported that they </p>

<p> tested inmates for drug use. </p>

<p> *Seventy-six percent of institutions reported testing inmates
for drugs </p>

<p> when drug use was suspected. Twenty percent tested all
inmates at least </p>

<p> once during confinement. </p>

<p> *At State confinement facilities 1.4% of tests for cocaine,
1.0% for </p>

<p> heroin, 2.3% for methamphetamines, and 5.8% for marijuana
indicated drug </p>

<p> use. </p>

<p> *At State community-based facilities 8.9% of tests for
cocaine confirmed </p>

<p> the presence of the drug, as did 2.2% for heroin, 1.1% for </p>

<p> methamphetamines, and 8.1% for marijuana. </p>

<p> *State confinement facilities that only tested inmates
suspected of drug </p>

<p> use had higher positive rates than facilities that tested all
or random </p>

<p> groups of inmates (6% for cocaine and 14% for marijuana
versus 1.5% for </p>

<p> cocaine and 5% for marijuana). </p>

<p> *State and Federal facilities used a variety of methods to
prevent drugs </p>

<p> from being brought into the institution, including
ques-tioning, patdowns, </p>

<p> clothing exchanges, and body cavity searches. </p>

<p> *At admission inmates were required to exchange clothing in
88% of the </p>

<p> Federal prisons and 59% of State prisons; inmates were patted
down in 88% </p>

<p> of Federal prisons and 78% of the State prisons. </p>

<p> *In the facilities using the most intrusive interdiction
technique, body </p>

<p> cavity searches, positive drug test results among inmates
tested were lower </p>

<p> than in facilities using other methods of interdiction. </p>

<p> *Questioning and search of belongings were widely used for
visitors to both </p>

<p> Federal and State facilities. </p>

<p> *Federal confinement facilities reported that they could
provide drug </p>

<p> treatment for an estimated 7,800 inmates; State confinement
facilities, for </p>

<p> 114,000; and State community-based facilities, for 9,400. </p>

<p> *Federal facilities were using an estimated 62% of total drug
treatment </p>

<p> capacity on June 29, 1990; State confinement facilities, 78%;
and </p>

<p> community-based facilities, 66%. </p>

<p> Introduction </p>

<p> The Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional
Facilities, conducted </p>

<p> periodically by the Bureau of the Census on behalf of the
Bureau of Justice </p>

<p> Statistics (BJS), included a new series of questions in 1990.
(See </p>

<p> Methodology on page 12 for further information about the
census and the </p>

<p> questionnaire.) This addendum--designed with the assistance
of the </p>

<p> National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Office of National
Drug Control </p>

<p> Policy--asked how facilities interdict drugs and
paraphernalia among </p>

<p> inmates, visitors, and staff and who was chosen for each
method of </p>

<p> interdiction. </p>

<p> In addition, the addendum gathered information on drug
testing policies, </p>

<p> practices, and outcomes. The questionnaire asked facilities
to estimate </p>

<p> the number of inmates in need of drug treatment programs and
the capacity </p>

<p> of currently available programs. </p>

<p> Methods of drug interdiction </p>

<p> Different facilities have a variety of policies and practices
related to </p>

<p> interdiction of drugs from inmates, visitors, and staff. </p>

<p> Facilities may physically check persons entering the
facility. Inmates may </p>

<p> be checked for drugs or other contraband when they enter a
facility for the </p>

<p> first time or reenter after an absence. The checks may be
relatively </p>

<p> nonintrusive, such as verbal questioning or pat-downs, or
more intrusive, </p>

<p> such as body cavity searches and clothing exchanges or
searches of </p>

<p> belongings. These checks may be conducted among all entering
persons, </p>

<p> random groups, or only those suspected of carrying drugs.
Many prisons may </p>

<p> use all of the approaches at different times. </p>

<p> The figure below shows a general typology for the range of
methods for each </p>

<p> type of drug interdiction. A plus sign (+) indicates the use
of a method </p>

<p> and a minus sign (-) means no reported use. Type 1
facilities, for </p>

<p> example, reported using all three methods to choose persons
for an </p>

<p> interdiction activity. Type 4 facilities reported performing
an </p>

<p> interdiction activity on all persons but not choosing random
or suspected </p>

<p> subjects. </p>

<p> Type 8 - - - </p>

<p> Interdiction activities: </p>

<p> Most prison facilities patted down inmates and required them
to exchange </p>

<p> clothes upon admission or any reentry </p>

<p> Prison facilities perform many activities to prevent drugs
and other </p>

<p> contraband from entering. Correctional authorities commonly
question </p>

<p> inmates, pat them down, require changing into
prison-furnished clothes, and </p>

<p> search body cavities. Eighty-eight percent of Federal
facilities reported </p>

<p> that they patted down new admissions and required them to
replace their </p>

<p> clothes (table 1). Seventy-eight percent of State confinement
facilities </p>

<p> and 71% of community-based facilities patted down newly
admitted inmates. </p>

<p> (Community-based facilities are those in which half or more
of the </p>

<p> residents are permitted to leave unaccompanied by staff for
work or study. </p>

<p> Because inmates regularly leave community-based facilities,
drug-related </p>

<p> problems in these facilities are different from those in
secured </p>

<p> facilities.) </p>

<p> Fifty-nine percent of State confinement facilities and 26% of
community- </p>

<p> based facilities required them to substitute prison clothes.
At least </p>

<p> three-quarters of both State and Federal facilities
questioned new </p>

<p> admissions about drugs. </p>

<p> When looking for the presence of hidden drugs, facilities
were less likely </p>

<p> to perform body cavity searches than take other interdiction
measures. </p>

<p> Sixty-one percent of Federal facilities, 45% of State
confinement </p>

<p> facilities, and 14% of State community-based facilities
reported that they </p>

<p> conducted body cavity searches among inmates at admission. </p>

<p> Institutions could apply an interdiction activity to all
inmates, to groups </p>

<p> of inmates selected at random, or to suspected drug users or
couriers. </p>

<p> Patting down new and returning inmates and requiring them to
exchange </p>

<p> clothes generally applied to all inmates (table 2). Over 80%
of Federal </p>

<p> facilities patted down all inmates and required an exchange
of clothing. </p>

<p> Almost 78% of State confinement facilities frisked all
inmates, and 57% </p>

<p> substituted prison clothes. </p>

<p> In 46% of Federal facilities and in 20% of State facilities,
body cavity </p>

<p> searches were conducted among all entering inmates. About 39%
of State </p>

<p> confinement facilities reported that a body cavity search
would be </p>

<p> conducted when the staff suspected inmates of carrying drugs.
</p>

<p> Most facilities searched the belongings </p>

<p> of visitors </p>

<p> Staff checked visitors' belongings for drugs in 93% of
Federal </p>

<p> institutions, 87% of State confinement facilities, and 76% of
the </p>

<p> community-based (table 3). Visitors were patted down for
drugs in 51% of </p>

<p> Federal prisons, 69% of State confinement institutions, and
40% of </p>

<p> community-based facilities. </p>

<p> All visitors were generally subjected to searches of their
belongings </p>

<p> (table 4). About 83% of Federal facilities and 57% of State
facilities </p>

<p> looked through the personal possessions of all visitors.
Frisking visitors </p>

<p> for drugs and checking body cavities occurred primarily if
visitors were </p>

<p> suspected of carrying drugs or paraphernalia. Five in ten of
Federal </p>

<p> prisons and 4 in 10 of State facilities patted down visitors
on suspicion. </p>

<p> About 28% of Federal Facilities and 18% of State facilities
searched body </p>

<p> cavities of visitors if the visitors were suspected of
smuggling drugs. </p>

<p> Staff were also subject to drug interdiction activities: </p>

<p> When reporting to work, staff were patted down in about half
of State </p>

<p> confinement facilities and in more than a fifth of Federal
confinement and </p>

<p> State community-based facilities (table 5). In over 50% of
Federal </p>

<p> facilities and 40% of State facilities staff were questioned.
Most </p>

<p> interdiction activities involving staff were conducted on
suspicion of </p>

<p> smuggling drugs. About 45% of Federal facilities and 23% of
State </p>

<p> facilities interrogated staff if they were suspected of drug
involvement </p>

<p> (table 6). About 19% of Federal facilities also patted down
staff on </p>

<p> suspicion, compared to 14% of State facilities. About 23% of
State </p>

<p> facilities frisked staff members at random. </p>

<p> Maximum security facilities took more stringent drug
interdiction measures </p>

<p> than other facilities </p>

<p> Staff in Federal maximum security prisons were more likely
than those in </p>

<p> medium or minimum security facilities to search body cavities
and to </p>

<p> require all inmates to exchange clothing (table 7). All
Federal maximum </p>

<p> security institutions required all inmates to put on new
prison-issued </p>

<p> clothes upon entry or reentry. Nearly 55% of Federal maximum
security </p>

<p> facilities, compared to 38% of minimum security prisons,
conducted body </p>

<p> cavity searches of all newly admitted or returning inmates. </p>

<p> In maximum security prisons staff were less likely than in
other Federal </p>

<p> facilities to question all of the inmates or to pat them
down. All inmates </p>

<p> were interrogated in 64% of maximum security prisons and
frisked in 73%, </p>

<p> while all inmates were questioned in 94% of minimum security
facilities and </p>

<p> patted down in 81%. </p>

<p> The staff in State maximum and medium security prisons were
more likely </p>

<p> than those in minimum security facilities to make all
entering or returning </p>

<p> inmates exchange clothes (over 60% of maximum or medium
security prisons, </p>

<p> compared to 47% of minimum security prisons). In nearly 1 in
5 maximum </p>

<p> security State prisons, staff searched the body cavities of
all new or </p>

<p> returning prisoners. Staff performed body cavity searches on
suspected </p>

<p> inmates in over half of State maximum security facilities. </p>

<p> State community-based facilities were less likely than State
confinement </p>

<p> facilities to search residents to interdict drugs. Staff in
about 59% of </p>

<p> State community-based facilities patted down all inmates. In
22% of </p>

<p> community-based facilities, the staff required all inmates to
change to </p>

<p> facility clothing, and in 15%, searched body cavities of
residents </p>

<p> suspected of having drugs. </p>

<p> Interpreting measures of drug testing </p>

<p> Prevalence of drug use in prisons is difficult to estimate.
Part of the </p>

<p> difficulty occurs with record keeping and reporting. A drug
test </p>

<p> determines the presence of a specific drug at a specific
level. A single </p>

<p> urine sample can be used for a single drug test or for
multiple tests for </p>

<p> different drugs. Correctional authorities were asked to
report the number </p>

<p> of tests for each drug and the number of positive tests.
However, some </p>

<p> authorities may have reported the number of urine samples
taken if their </p>

<p> records included only those figures. </p>

<p> Other difficulties in estimating the amount of drug use in
prison include </p>

<p> the following: </p>

<p> *Prisons differ in the selection of whom to test. Most
facilities do not </p>

<p> choose inmates for testing using a sample with a known
probability of </p>

<p> selection: One cannot say that the selected inmates represent
all inmates </p>

<p> in the institution. </p>

<p> * Prisons differ in what drugs they test for. Prison
authorities may not </p>

<p> suspect the use of a drug and not test for it, even though
the drug is used </p>

<p> in their facility. Other prisons may conduct repeated tests
for a drug </p>

<p> seldom used. </p>

<p> * A single urine specimen can have more than one positive
drug test from an </p>

<p> individual using multiple drugs. Describing positive rates by
type of drug </p>

<p> will overstate the number of inmates with at least one
positive test. </p>

<p> *Prisons differ in how often they test inmates. Drug testing
may be rare </p>

<p> in some prisons and frequent in others. </p>

<p> *Urine tests only detect the presence of most drugs 48 to 72
hours after </p>

<p> use, except for PCP and marijuana, which may be detected up
to 30 days </p>

<p> after use. </p>

<p> This varying span, when combined with lack of random
sampling, distorts any </p>

<p> estimation of overall drug use. </p>

<p> * Depending on various factors, the presence of
methamphetamines may not be </p>

<p> distinguished from amphetamines; therefore, the test results
for these two </p>

<p> drugs should be considered together. </p>

<p> *Prisons may differ in the types of tests used. Some types
are more </p>

<p> accurate than others, producing lower numbers of false
positives and false </p>

<p> negatives. Facilities may or may not perform confirmatory
tests, and they </p>

<p> were not asked to estimate the number of false positives and
false </p>

<p> negatives. </p>

<p> For the above reasons, drug test results in this report are
not a measure </p>

<p> of the extent of the problem in the various kinds of
facilities. Positive </p>

<p> results should be interpreted only as indicating the
percentage positive </p>

<p> for the specific tests given. </p>

<p> Testing urine for drug use </p>

<p> Most correctional facilities tested some inmates for illegal
drug use </p>

<p> About 87% of all correctional facilities tested inmates for
illegal drug </p>

<p> use (table 8). All Federal prisons, 83% of State confinement
facilities, </p>

<p> and 98% of State community-based facilities reported testing
inmates </p>

<p> between July 1, 1989, and June 30, 1990. </p>

<p> Authorities in facilities which reported data (85% of all
facilities) </p>

<p> indicated that they collected 598,000 urine specimens from
468,500 inmates. </p>

<p> When these figures are projected to all facilities, including
those which </p>

<p> did not respond to these questions, an estimated 565,500
inmates provided </p>

<p> 721,800 specimens from July 1, 1989, through June 30, 1990.
(See </p>

<p> &quot;Estimation procedure&quot; in Methodology.) </p>

<p> State minimum and medium security and community-based
facilities were more </p>

<p> likely than maximum security institutions to test inmates.
About 85% of </p>

<p> the lower security facilities and 98% of community-based
facilities tested </p>

<p> inmates, compared to 76% of the maximum security prisons. </p>

<p> Most State facilities testing inmates for drugs performed the
tests when </p>

<p> the staff suspected particular inmates of drug use; 76% of
the institutions </p>

<p> reported checking inmates based on suspicion of use.
Forty-two percent </p>

<p> tested both suspected inmates and random groups, and an
additional 14% </p>

<p> tested all inmates (type 1). Relatively few facilities (20%)
tested all </p>

<p> inmates at least once during confinement (types 1-4). </p>

<p> Most large State confinement facilities tested for drugs </p>

<p> About 92% of State prisons with a population of 2,500 or more
tested </p>

<p> inmates, compared to around 83% of facilities with fewer than
1,000 inmates </p>

<p> and 77% of facilities with a population between 1,000 and
2,499 (table 9). </p>

<p> Over half of the largest facilities tested inmates on
suspicion only. Over </p>

<p> half of facilities with a population between 250 and 2,499
tested all </p>

<p> inmates or random groups of inmates in addition to inmates
suspected of </p>

<p> drug use. About 70% of community-based facilities tested
either all </p>

<p> inmates or random groups and inmates suspected of using
drugs. </p>

<p> Almost all work release facilities tested </p>

<p> for drugs </p>

<p> About 92% of facilities that provided special work release or
prerelease </p>

<p> programs tested inmates for drugs (table 10). Ninety-three
percent of </p>

<p> facilities that separately handled offenders reincarcerated
for violating </p>

<p> some condition of their supervised release also checked
inmates for drugs. </p>

<p> Over 90% of facilities that performed &quot;other&quot;
functions, such as </p>

<p> presentence, psychiatric, or geriatric services also tested
their </p>

<p> residents. Nearly 60% of facilities for youthful offenders
tested inmates. </p>

<p> For all inmates tested, State prisons reported higher
positive rates than </p>

<p> Federal prisons </p>

<p> Nationwide, 3.1% of the tests for cocaine in the 12 months
before June 30, </p>

<p> 1990, were positive, as were 1.2% of the tests for heroin,
1.5% for </p>

<p> methamphetamines, and 5.6% for marijuana. State facilities
reported higher </p>

<p> positive rates for drug tests than Federal facilities (table
11). In State </p>

<p> institutions, 3.6% of tests for cocaine were positive,
compared to 0.4% in </p>

<p> Federal prisons. State facilities found 2.0% of the tests
showing recent </p>

<p> methamphetamine use and 6.3% showing marijuana use; Federal
prisons found </p>

<p> 0.1% and 1.1%, respectively. </p>

<p> I </p>

<p> Same percentage of State and Federal facilities reported
positive drug </p>

<p> tests </p>

<p> When facilities rather than individual drug tests are
considered, Federal </p>

<p> and State facilities were about equally likely to have found
drug use in </p>

<p> their institutions. Around 6 in 10 of both Federal and State
facilities </p>

<p> which tested for cocaine had at least one positive test. In
over 2 in 10 </p>

<p> facilities testing for methamphetamines, the use of the drug
was </p>

<p> discovered. Marijuana was detected in about 8 in 10
facilities testing. </p>

<p> Community-based facilities found higher rates of drug use
than confinement </p>

<p> facilities </p>

<p> Tests had positive outcomes for 8.9% of the cocaine tests and
8.1% of the </p>

<p> marijuana tests administered by community-based facilities,
compared to </p>

<p> 1.4% of the cocaine tests and 5.8% of marijuana tests in
confinement </p>

<p> facilities (table 12). Methamphetamines, however, were found
more often in </p>

<p> confinement facilities (2.3% tested positive) than in
community-based </p>

<p> facilities (1.1% positive). </p>

<p> Among State confinement facilities, positive test results
were highest in </p>

<p> those testing on suspicion only. </p>

<p> How inmates were selected for testing affected the rate of
positive </p>

<p> results. Those State confinement facilities testing only when
drug use was </p>

<p> suspected recorded higher rates of positive results than
other facilities </p>

<p> that tested randomly or comprehensively. When facilities
tested only on </p>

<p> suspicion of drug use, 6% of cocaine tests and 14% of
marijuana tests were </p>

<p> positive, compared to 1.5% or less for cocaine and 5% or less
for marijuana </p>

<p> when facilities tested everyone or at random. </p>

<p> The results for State community-based facilities were
opposite those of </p>

<p> confinement facilities. Testing on suspicion only produced a
lower </p>

<p> percentage of positive results than testing everyone or a
random selection. </p>

<p> In community-based facilities which tested on suspicion only,
4.8% were </p>

<p> positive for cocaine and 6.4% for marijuana; in
community-based facilities </p>

<p> using other selection methods, around 9% of tests for cocaine
and 8% for </p>

<p> marijuana were positive. </p>

<p> The percentages of positive tests were higher in large
facilities </p>

<p> Large prisons, whether Federal or State, had higher rates of
positive drug </p>

<p> tests. In Federal facilities with 1,000 or more inmates, 1.4%
of the </p>

<p> marijuana tests, 0.6% of the cocaine, and 0.6% of the heroin
tests were </p>

<p> positive (table 13). In Federal facilities holding fewer than
500 inmates, </p>

<p> the percentages were 0.5% for marijuana, 0.2% for cocaine,
and none for </p>

<p> heroin. Among State prisons, the largest facilities with
2,500 or more </p>

<p> inmates had the highest percentages of positive tests for
amphetamines, </p>

<p> cocaine, and heroin. </p>

<p> The facilities holding 1,000 to 2,499 inmates had the highest
rates for </p>

<p> marijuana and methamphetamines. Among Federal prisons, the
maximum </p>

<p> security facilities had higher rates for positive drug tests
than minimum </p>

<p> security facilities. In maximum security prisons, 2.5% of the
tests for </p>

<p> marijuana, .7% of the tests for cocaine, and 1.4% of the
tests for heroin </p>

<p> were positive. In minimum security, 0.3% for marijuana, 0.3%
for cocaine, </p>

<p> and none for heroin were positive. </p>

<p> State medium security facilities generally had higher
positive rates than </p>

<p> maximum or minimum security prisons. For each drug in medium
security </p>

<p> facilities, the percentage positive was as follows: 6.8% for
marijuana, </p>

<p> 4.2% for methamphetamines, 1.7% for cocaine, and 1.4% for
heroin. In </p>

<p> maximum and minimum facilities, the equivalent findings were
5.0% or less </p>

<p> for marijuana, 0.6% or less for methamphetamines, 1.4% or
less for cocaine, </p>

<p> and 0.8% or less for heroin. </p>

<p> Positive results from drug tests varied among facilities
performing </p>

<p> different functions </p>

<p> Facilities which confined inmates returned to custody for
parole violations </p>

<p> had relatively high percentages of positive drug tests (table
14). More </p>

<p> than 9% of tests for marijuana were positive, as were 6.2% of
tests for </p>

<p> methamphetamines, 3.5% for cocaine, and 2.9% for heroin.
Facilities </p>

<p> holding inmates who participated in work release programs or
who were </p>

<p> preparing for discharge also had relatively high positive
test rates: 7% </p>

<p> for cocaine, 6.9% for marijuana, and 1.8% for heroin. Drug/
alcohol </p>

<p> treatment in facilities was associated with relatively high
positive </p>

<p> results on tests for cocaine and marijuana use--3% for
cocaine and 7.6% for </p>

<p> marijuana. </p>

<p> Facilities handling youthful offenders generally had
relatively low </p>

<p> positive test results: 2.1% for marijuana and 1.5% for
cocaine. </p>

<p> Positive drug tests were linked to interdiction activities </p>

<p> The State confinement facilities that questioned and frisked
inmates but </p>

<p> did not exchange clothes or search body cavities had higher
rates of </p>

<p> positive drug tests than facilities doing all these measures
(table 15). </p>

<p> The tests in the facilities using less stringent measures
were 5.2% </p>

<p> positive for cocaine, 13.5% for marijuana, and 16.2% for
methamphetamines. </p>

<p> Tests in facilities performing all types of specific drug
interdiction </p>

<p> activities were 1.2% positive for cocaine, 4.6% for
marijuana, and 0.6% for </p>

<p> methamphetamines. Facilities which performed all types of
interdiction </p>

<p> activities had higher positive drug test rates than
facilities which did </p>

<p> body cavity searches and/or clothing exchanges. The
facilities doing all </p>

<p> types of interdiction may have adopted more measures as a
reaction to </p>

<p> relatively high test rates. The reported rates were from
results over the </p>

<p> 12 months before the census, while the interdiction measures
were those in </p>

<p> place on June 29, 1990. </p>

<p> Facilities that did not question, frisk, or search visitors
had the </p>

<p> following positive test results: 8.3% for marijuana and 7.4%
for cocaine. </p>

<p> Facilities that inspected visitors' belongings and searched
body cavities </p>

<p> when indicated, but did not both question and pat down
visitors, had the </p>

<p> following positive test percentages: 2.9% for heroin, 2.6%
for cocaine, and </p>

<p> 12% for methamphetamines. </p>

<p> Facilities that reported not making special efforts to
interdict the supply </p>

<p> of drugs from the staff had 2.6% positive tests for cocaine,
2.2% for </p>

<p> heroin, and 6.6% for methamphetamines. Facilities that
questioned staff, </p>

<p> patted them down, and took other actions such as drug
testing, when needed </p>

<p> had 1.0% positive tests for cocaine and 0.9% for heroin and </p>

<p> methamphetamines. </p>

<p> Drug testing of staff was highest </p>

<p> in Federal facilities </p>

<p> While 83% of Federal facilities reported they tested their
staff for drugs, </p>

<p> 42% of State confinement facilities and 32% of
community-based facilities </p>

<p> checked their employees (table 16). About 55% of Federal
confinement </p>

<p> facilities tested all staff, as did 30% of State confinement
facilities and </p>

<p> 19% of community-based facilities. </p>

<p> Seventy-six percent of Federal facilities and about 23% of
State facilities </p>

<p> tested employees, the primary staff category tested. </p>

<p> A higher percentage of Federal than State facility staff were
tested for </p>

<p> drugs. Fifteen percent of Federal facility staff were tested
compared to </p>

<p> 4% of those working in State confinement facilities and 10%
in community- </p>

<p> based facilities. </p>

<p> A positive test was grounds for dismissal </p>

<p> in over a third of facilities that tested staff </p>

<p> for drugs </p>

<p> In over a third of facilities, policies required that staff
testing </p>

<p> positive for drugs be dismissed. In over a seventh, affected
staff were </p>

<p> suspended (table 17). Sixty percent of State confinement
facilities and </p>

<p> 44% of community-based facilities referred positive drug
detection cases to </p>

<p> internal affairs. Fifty-nine percent of Federal facilities
referred the </p>

<p> case to a departmentally operated program -- generally an
employee </p>

<p> assistance counselor who could refer the employee for outside
treatment. </p>

<p> Federal facilities were more likely than State facilities to
keep their </p>

<p> staff and continue to check them for drugs or to reassign
them. Twenty- </p>

<p> four percent of Federal facilities continued monitoring staff
with drug </p>

<p> tests, compared to 10% of State confinement facilities and
12%of community- </p>

<p> based facilities. </p>

<p> Inmate/resident drug treatment programs and capacities </p>

<p> Facilities provided estimates of the number of
inmates/residents who could </p>

<p> be treated in each of their drug treatment and intervention
programs and </p>

<p> estimates of the enrollment in each program. Facilities also
estimated </p>

<p> their total capacity for drug treatment and their total
enrollment. These </p>

<p> totals were generally lower than the sum of all the
separately listed </p>

<p> programs and interventions, possibly for the following
reasons: </p>

<p> *some programs listed were not considered true drug
&quot;treatment&quot; programs; </p>

<p> *an individual program might have several of the components
listed on the </p>

<p> addendum--for example, counseling, education, and urine
surveillance--and </p>

<p> hence be counted several times in the specific listings; </p>

<p> *inmates could be participating in more than one program; </p>

<p> *facilities could have some treatment slots which could be
allocated to </p>

<p> more than one program and therefore were counted more than
once. </p>

<p> Drug treatment/intervention on June 29, 1990 </p>

<p> Among the 1,287 State and Federal facilities, 1,024 reported
their own </p>

<p> estimates of total capacity and enrollment in programs they
considered to </p>

<p> be for drug treatment. Facility capacities and enrollments
for drug </p>

<p> treatment were-- </p>

<p> Among those Federal facilities that reported, administrators
indicated that </p>

<p> on a single day the facilities could treat about 6,100
inmates and had an </p>

<p> enrollment of about 3,800. For reporting State facilities,
both </p>

<p> confinement and community-based, the estimated capacity was
90,900 and </p>

<p> enrollment was 69,900. </p>

<p> Prisons could treat an estimated </p>

<p> 131,900 inmates for drug addiction </p>

<p> If the reported capacity is projected to all prisons, Federal
confinement </p>

<p> facilities could treat an estimated 7,800 inmates; State
confinement </p>

<p> facilities, 114,000; and State community-based facilities,
9,400. (See </p>

<p> &quot;Estimation procedure&quot; in Methodology.) </p>

<p> (Treatment capacity and enrollment were estimated from the
77.7% of Federal </p>

<p> inmates in reporting facilities, 72.9% of State inmates in
reporting </p>

<p> confinement facilities, and 83.3% of State inmates in
reporting community- </p>

<p> based facilities.) </p>

<p> Federal confinement facilities had the capacity to treat for
drug abuse 14% </p>

<p> of the inmate population; State confinement facilities, 18%;
and community- </p>

<p> based facilities, 55%. </p>

<p> Prisons were treating approximately 100,200 inmates </p>

<p> If the reported enrollment figures are projected to cover all
facilities, </p>

<p> the Federal prison system was treating an estimated 4,800
inmates; the </p>

<p> State prisons, an estimated 88,700; and community-based
facilities, an </p>

<p> estimated 6,200. (See &quot;Estimation procedure&quot; in
Methodology.) </p>

<p> (Treatment capacity and enrollment were estimated from the
77.7% of Federal </p>

<p> inmates in reporting facilities, 72.9% of State inmates in
reporting </p>

<p> confinement facilities, and 83.3% of State inmates in
reporting community- </p>

<p> based facilities.) </p>

<p> Enrollment in drug treatment was below capacity) </p>

<p> Federal inmates were using 62% of the drug treatment capacity
on June 29, </p>

<p> 1990. State prisoners were using 66% of the capacity in
community-based </p>

<p> facilities and 78% in confinement facilities. </p>

<p> Many factors play a role in these utilization figures.
Inmates may refuse </p>

<p> to participate or may have already completed the program.
Inmates may not </p>

<p> qualify--too new to the institution, not near enough to the
end of their </p>

<p> sentence, rule breakers, under administrative segregation, or
in the wrong </p>

<p> custody level. Facilities also may keep some slots open to
gain </p>

<p> flexibility to deal with unexpected situations. </p>

<p> Prisons offered a variety of programs </p>

<p> Prisons may offer many types of drug intervention or
treatment: </p>

<p> detoxification, counseling, education and/or awareness
programs, urine </p>

<p> surveillance, and treatment in special residential units
within the </p>

<p> facility. Federal facilities reported they could test 33% of
inmates for </p>

<p> drugs; State confinement facilities, 10%; and community-based
facilities, </p>

<p> 57% (table 18). Counseling was available for 14% of inmates
in Federal </p>

<p> facilities, 12% in State confinement facilities, and 48% in
community-based </p>

<p> facilities. Residential treatment program capacity was from
1% to 2% of </p>

<p> inmate population for all types </p>

<p> of institutions. </p>

<p> Of all Federal inmates, 9% were enrolled in some form of drug
treatment on </p>

<p> June 29, 1990. Among State prisoners, 14% in confinement
facilities and </p>

<p> 37% in community-based facilities were enrolled. The two most
common types </p>

<p> of programs for both Federal and State correctional
facilities were </p>

<p> education and counseling. </p>

<p> Drug education programs enrolled 13% of Federal prisoners, 7%
of State </p>

<p> confinement inmates, and 25% of residents in community-based
facilities. </p>

<p> Six percent of those in Federal facilities were being
counseled, as were 9% </p>

<p> of State confinement facility inmates and 32% of those in
community-based </p>

<p> facilities. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> The 1990 Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional
Facilities was the </p>

<p> fourth enumeration of State institutions and the first of
Federal </p>

<p> institutions sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics
and conducted by </p>

<p> the Bureau of the Census. Earlier censuses were completed in
1974, 1979, </p>

<p> and 1984. </p>

<p> Census universe </p>

<p> The facility universe was developed from the Census of State
Adult </p>

<p> Correctional Facilities conducted in 1984. This list was
revised using the </p>

<p> 1990 American Correctional Association Directory and
information obtained </p>

<p> from State correctional administrators and the Federal Bureau
of Prisons. </p>

<p> The census included: prisons; prison farms; reception,
diagnostic and </p>

<p> classification centers; road camps; forestry and conservation
camps; </p>

<p> youthful offender facilities (except in California);
vocational training </p>

<p> facilities; correctional drug and alcohol treatment
facilities; and State- </p>

<p> operated local detention facilities in Alaska, Connecticut,
Delaware, </p>

<p> Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. </p>

<p> Facilities were included in the census if they: </p>

<p> *were staffed with State or Federal employees </p>

<p> *housed primarily State or Federal prisoners </p>

<p> *were physically, functionally, and administratively separate
from other </p>

<p> facilities </p>

<p> *were operational on the reference date, June 29, 1990. </p>

<p> The census also included, for the first time, 67 private
facilities that </p>

<p> were under exclusive contract by State governments to house
prisoners. </p>

<p> Specifically excluded were-- </p>

<p> *privately operated facilities that were not exclusively for
State or </p>

<p> Federal inmates </p>

<p> *military facilities </p>

<p> *Immigration and Naturalization Service facilities </p>

<p> *facilities operated and administered by local governments,
including those </p>

<p> housing State prisoners </p>

<p> *facilities operated by the U.S. Marshals Service </p>

<p> *hospital wings and wards reserved </p>

<p> for State prisoners. </p>

<p> Questionnaire administration </p>

<p> Questionnaires were mailed to facility respondents at the end
of June 1990. </p>

<p> Second and third request forms and telephone followups went
out in the </p>

<p> fall, resulting in a final response rate of 100%. </p>

<p> Definitions of community-based and confinement facilities </p>

<p> Correctional facilities were classified as community-based if
50% or more </p>

<p> of the residents were regularly permitted to leave the
facility </p>

<p> unaccompanied for work or study. These facilities included
halfway houses, </p>

<p> restitution centers, and pre-release, work release, and study
release </p>

<p> centers. Correctional facilities in which less than 50% of
the inmates </p>

<p> regularly left the facility unaccompanied were classified as
confinement </p>

<p> institutions. </p>

<p> Drug addendum </p>

<p> An addendum on drug control activities in State and Federal
facilities was </p>

<p> included for the first time in the 1990 census. Facilities
were asked to </p>

<p> provide information on the following: </p>

<p> *activities they used with inmates, visitors, and staff to
keep out illegal </p>

<p> drugs and drug paraphernalia </p>

<p> *inmate drug testing practices, including the criteria for
testing inmates, </p>

<p> the number of inmates tested in total and by specific drug,
and the number </p>

<p> positive </p>

<p> *staff drug testing, including groups and basis for testing,
number tested, </p>

<p> and procedures when tests were positive </p>

<p> *capacity and enrollment in various types of drug treatment
and </p>

<p> intervention programs. </p>

<p> Estimation procedures </p>

<p> When all prisons in the census did not provide data on
particular </p>

<p> variables, estimated figures were used where indicated. Total
figures were </p>

<p> estimated by multiplying the known or reported numbers by the
ratio of the </p>

<p> total relevant population to the reported population. All
figures were </p>

<p> estimated independently and total estimates were therefore
larger than the </p>

<p> sum of all subgroup estimates. The total population figure
used in the </p>

<p> projections varied, depending upon which figure was most
appropriate. The </p>

<p> two available population figures are the average daily
population and the </p>

<p> prison count on the reference day for the census, June 29,
1990. For drug </p>

<p> testing, table 8, the basis for estimation was the average
daily </p>

<p> population, and for drug treatment capacity and enrollment,
the basis was </p>

<p> the 1-day count. </p>

<p> Because the census was a complete enumeration, the results
were not subject </p>

<p> to sampling error. </p>

<p> Public use data tapes for each Census of Adult Correctional
Facilities in </p>

<p> the series, conducted in 1974, 1979, 1984, and 1990, are

<h2>Correctional Populations in the United States 1980 - 1993 </h2>

<p> <b>Bureau of Justice Statistics Executive Summary</b> </p>

<p> <b>U.S. Department of Justice</b> </p>

<p> <b>Office of Justice Programs</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> The Nation's correctional population jumped more than 2 1/2
times from 1980 through 1993. During 1993 approximately 2.6% of
the U.S. population--4.9 million adults--were on parole, on
probation, or in jails or prisons, an increase of 3 million
people since 1980. More than 909,000 men and women were in the
custody of State and Federal prisons, 455,500 were in local
jails, 671,000 on parole, and 2.8 million on probation: </p>

<p> --More than two-thirds of the 4.9 million persons under
correctional supervision were on probation or parole. </p>

<p> --The Nation's parole population had the fastest rate of
growth, 205% from 1980 to 1993. </p>

<p> --During the 13 years between 1980 and 1993, the probation
population grew by more than 1.7 million, larger than the
increase in any other correctional population. </p>

<p> --In 1993 nearly 1.4 million offenders were in local jail and
State or Federal prison. </p>

<p> During the 1980-92 period, the percent of black State and
Federal prisoners increased from 46.5% to 50% at a time when the
percentage of blacks in the general population increased from
11.8% to 12.4%. The Hispanic prison population doubled from 7.7%
to 14.1%, while Hispanics in the general population increased
from 6.5% to 9.5%. </p>

<p> At yearend 1992, there were 4,094 black male inmates per
100,000 black adults in the U.S. population, compared to 502
white male inmates per 100,000 adult white residents. Among U.S.
adults who neither graduated from high school nor earned a
general equivalence degree (GED), almost 6% of blacks and 1% of
whites were in a Federal or State prison serving a sentence of a
year or more. </p>

<p> The number of convicted drug offenders increased ninefold
(from 19,000 to 172,300) from 1980 through 1992. The number of
violent offenders accounted for a larger share of the growth in
the total prison population (41%, compared to 32% for drug
offenders). The total number of violent offenders in State prison
increased by nearly 200,000 during the 12-year period. </p>

<p> The number of returned parole violators and newly admitted
probation violators soared between 1980 and 1992. Almost 1 in
every 3 offenders admitted to State prisons (142,000) in 1992
were probation or parole violators, compared to 1 in every 6
(27,000) in 1980. </p>

<p> Violent offenders were more likely to be sent to prison in
1992 than they were in 1980. Relative to the number of victims of
murder, rape, robbery, or aggravated assault, the number of
violent offenders admitted to State prison increased during the
12-year period, from 18 admissions per 1,000 violent
victimizations to 27 per 1,000. </p>

<p> Between 1980 and 1992 the rate of incarceration in State and
Federal prisons more than doubled, from 139 sentenced inmates
(inmates serving 1 year or more) per 100,000 U.S. residents to
332 per 100,000. In 1992 incarceration rates were nearly 19 times
higher among adult men than among adult women (883 per 100,000
compared to 47) and 8 times higher among adult black men than
among adult white men. </p>

<p> The data are from a 188-page book published by the Bureau of
Justice Statistics (BJS) and listing the correctional populations
of each State and the Federal system. The book lists jail and
prison suicide statistics, correctional crowding, electronic
monitoring, sentence commutations, jail AIDS deaths and much
more. Single copie&quot;s of the publication, &quot;Correctional
Populations in the United States, 1992, (NCJ-146413), written by
BJS statistician Tracy L. Snell, may be obtained from the BJS

<p>COCA CULTIVATION AND COCAINE PROCESSING: </p>

<p>AN OVERVIEW </p>

<p>DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION </p>

<p>INTELLIGENCE DIVISION </p>

<p>STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE SECTION </p>

<p>SEPTEMBER 1993 </p>

<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </p>

<p>Two of the lesser understood aspects of the illicit cocaine
traffic are the </p>

<p>cultivation of the coca plant and the conversion of the coca
leaf into </p>

<p>cocaine hydrochloride (HCl). While the coca plant can be found
throughout </p>

<p>most of Latin America, varieties containing the cocaine
alkaloid (the basis </p>

<p>for cocaine HCl) are cultivated and converted primarily in
Peru, Bolivia and </p>

<p>Colombia. </p>

<p>There are two different species and several different
varieties of coca </p>

<p>plants which contain the cocaine alkaloid and these varieties
prosper under </p>

<p>quite different climatic conditions. At the same time, the
methods used to </p>

<p>cultivate and harvest coca leaf differ depending on
climate,tradition,and </p>

<p>other factors. The conversion of coca leaf into coca paste,
cocaine base, and </p>

<p>cocaine hydrochloride is also a varied process with many steps
involved and </p>

<p>many chemicals necessary. </p>

<p>THE COCA PLANT </p>

<p>It has been estimated that there are over 200 Erythroxylum
species growing in </p>

<p>the Western Hemisphere. Only 17 species can be utilized to
produce cocaine. </p>

<p>Fifteen of the 17 species contain relatively low levels of
cocaine alkaloid </p>

<p>and subsequently are not cultivated. In South America two
species and two </p>

<p>varieties within each of these species are cultivated. They
are: </p>

<p>--E. coca Species </p>

<p>var. coca </p>

<p>var. ipadu </p>

<p>--E. novogranatense Species </p>

<p>var. novogranatense </p>

<p>var. truxillense </p>

<p>These varieties are traditionally cultivated in the following
areas: </p>

<p>--Bolivia </p>

<p>E. coca var. coca </p>

<p>--Peru </p>

<p>E. coca var. coca </p>

<p>E. novogranatense var. truxillense </p>

<p>E. coca var. ipadu </p>

<p>--Colombia </p>

<p>E. novogranatense var. novogranatense </p>

<p>E. coca var. ipadu </p>

<p>E. novogranatense var. truxillense </p>

<p>The most widely grown variety of coca is E. coca var. coca
which is </p>

<p>cultivated on the eastern slope of the Andes from Bolivia in
the south to as </p>

<p>far north as central Ecuador. This area of the Andes has a
tropical climate </p>

<p>and experiences high amounts of rainfall. Coca in this region
is usually </p>

<p>grown between 1,650 and 4,950 feet in elevation. </p>

<p>E. novogranatense var. novogranatense thrives in the drier
regions of </p>

<p>Colombia and, to a lesser extent, Venezuela. It is also grown
at lower </p>

<p>elevations where the climate is generally hotter. The main
variety of </p>

<p>E.novogranatense, var. truxillense, is grown up to an
elevation of 4,950 </p>

<p>feet. The last variety, E. coca var. ipadu, is found in
southern Colombia, </p>

<p>northeastern Peru, and western Brazil in the Amazon basin. E.
coca var. ipadu </p>

<p>is primarily cultivated by Indians for their own consumption
and is not as </p>

<p>high in cocaine alkaloids as the other three. </p>

<p>It is not an easy task, even for an expert, to readily
distinguish between </p>

<p>the different varieties of coca plants. One of the ways to
identify the </p>

<p>variety is to look at the leaves. Both varieties of E. coca
(E. coca var. </p>

<p>coca and E. coca var. ipadu) have broadly elliptic leaves. The
leaf of var. </p>

<p>ipadu has a rounded apex, whereas the apex of var. coca is
more pointed. The </p>

<p>leaf of var. coca is large, thick and dark green in color. </p>

<p>The leaf of E. novogranatense var. novogranatense is pale
green with a </p>

<p>rounded apex and is somewhat narrower and thinner than the
leaf of var. ipadu </p>

<p>and var.coca. E. novogranatense var. truxillense is very
similar to var. </p>

<p>novogranatense except that it does not possess the lines
parallel to the </p>

<p>central vein of the leaf that are characteristic to so many
varieties of coca </p>

<p>plant. </p>

<p>The cocaine alkaloid content of the E. coca and the E.
novogranatense species </p>

<p>also serves to distinguish between these species and the many
other species </p>

<p>of wild coca that grow in Latin America. These other species
contain much </p>

<p>lower levels of cocaine alkaloid. The usual cocaine alkaloid
content of a </p>

<p>sample of coca leaf material is between 0.1 and 0.8 percent.
The cocaine </p>

<p>alkaloid content can go much higher, however, as was shown in
one sample of </p>

<p>coca leaf from the Chapare region in Bolivia that measured 1.2
percent. Coca </p>

<p>grown on the upper slopes of the Andes also contain more
cocaine alkaloids </p>

<p>than coca grown in low-lying areas. It is therefore believed
that the best </p>

<p>quality coca is grown at higher altitudes. </p>

<p>CULTIVATION </p>

<p>While methods of cultivating the coca plant are similar in
many ways </p>

<p>throughout Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia, there are differences
in techniques </p>

<p>because of terrain, tradition, and other factors. </p>

<p>Some coca plantations have been in existence for years. In
other areas, </p>

<p>however, such as Peru's Upper Huauaga Valley, new plantations
are being </p>

<p>established daily. A typical farmer who is preparing a field
for coca will </p>

<p>usually pick an area that slopes slightly so that water will
not drown his </p>

<p>plants. He will then begin clearing his field, normally by
cutting trees and </p>

<p>stumps and setting fire to the debris, a clearing method known
as slash and </p>

<p>bum. The felled trees are left in the field and the coca is
simply planted </p>

<p>around them. The farmer has no motivation to move the logs
since there is no </p>

<p>market for the timber. Logs are absent from the older fields
because of rot </p>

<p>or because the farmer gradually cleared his field. </p>

<p>Once the field is cleared for cultivation, the farmer can
ready his crop for </p>

<p>planting. The first step in cultivation generally begins with
the seed. Seeds </p>

<p>are usually gathered from December through March from plants
ranging from two </p>

<p>to three years in age. They are often poured into water at the
onset to </p>

<p>identify bad seeds, which will usually float to the top and
are discarded. </p>

<p>The good seeds are planted in small plots that are kept shaded
from the sun. </p>

<p>Seeds are sown about two inches apart at a depth of
approximately one half </p>

<p>inch in humus enriched soil. These seedbeds are kept well
watered and weeded </p>

<p>frequently and the seeds will usually germinate within 20 to
30 days. </p>

<p>Sometimes the seeds are presoaked in water to hasten
germination which will </p>

<p>then occur in about ten days. </p>

<p>Seedlings usually reach transplanting size in about two
months. At this age </p>

<p>they are about 12 inches tall. While the measurements vary,
seedlings </p>

<p>generally are planted in holes about a foot deep and about one
and-one-half </p>

<p>feet from each other within rows about three feet apart. </p>

<p>Another popular method of establishing new fields of E. ipadu
involves taking </p>

<p>a cutting from an established coca bush and planting it in the
ground. This </p>

<p>method (cloning) is getting more popular as it gives the
farmer a head start. </p>

<p>There are two methods of planting a cutting. One involves
sticking several </p>

<p>branches a couple of feet long into the ground. The other
method is to cut </p>

<p>three or four inch cuttings from a branch, each one with
protruding smaller </p>

<p>branches. The cutting is soaked in water a day or so and then
planted in </p>

<p>loose, fertile soil. It is reported that coca leaf can be
harvested from </p>

<p>these plants within six months and seeds develop on these
plants after one </p>

<p>year but the seeds lack embryos and are not viable. </p>

<p>A coca plant cultivated from seed will generally reach full
maturity and its </p>

<p>leaves harvested between 12 and 24 months after being
transplanted. Even </p>

<p>though coca growing in the wild has been known to reach
heights of up to 30 </p>

<p>feet, that which is cultivated is almost always pruned back to
facilitate </p>

<p>harvesting the coca leaf. Cultivated fields are usually kept
at a height of </p>

<p>three to six feet. All picking of coca leaf is done by hand.
Harvesters have </p>

<p>to be very quick in their work yet careful not to damage the
leaf buds on the </p>

<p>bush while stripping off the leaves. Leaves are said to be
ready for harvest </p>

<p>when they take on a yellowish tint and have a tendency to
crack when bent. </p>

<p>Coca leaf can be harvested between two and six times per year
depending on </p>

<p>climatic conditions. Coca growing at lower altitudes will
usually be </p>

<p>harvested more often than coca growing at higher altitudes.
The most abundant </p>

<p>harvest, sometimes accounting for about half of the total
yearly harvest, </p>

<p>takes place after the rains in March. Subsequent harvests take
place in </p>

<p>June/July and November, the normal dry season in South
America. Some </p>

<p>harvesting, however, takes place all year round. </p>

<p>When the leaves are harvested, they are put in sacks and taken
to a closed </p>

<p>room and spread out on the floor. The next day, the leaves are
taken to a </p>

<p>flat area, where they are spread in thin layers on a tarpaulin
in direct </p>

<p>sunlight and left to dry. If there is a lot of sunshine and
minimal cloud </p>

<p>cover, the drying phase can be completed in six hours. During
inclement </p>

<p>weather, it takes much longer because at the first sign of
rain the leaves </p>

<p>are gathered up and taken into shelter. If a load of coca
leaves is caught by </p>

<p>a rainstorm during drying, it could ruin the whole load. This
is because the </p>

<p>leaves will ferment if the moisture goes over 14 percent. This
tends to cause </p>

<p>a breakdown of the cocaine alkaloids. </p>

<p>After the drying phase is completed, the coca leaves are swept
into large </p>

<p>piles and left for about three days before being taken to
market and/or </p>

<p>processing facilities. The weight of packaged leaves varies
from the 100 </p>

<p>pound &quot;carga&quot; in the Bolivian Chapare, to the 25
pound &quot;arroba&quot; in Peru's </p>

<p>Upper Huallaga Valley. In Colombia, coca leaves are not
usually sold; </p>

<p>however, when dried coca leaves are sold, it is usually in
packages of 25 </p>

<p>pounds. </p>

<p>Peru </p>

<p>Peru, the world's largest source of coca, has both licit and
illicit </p>

<p>cultivation. Licit coca is cultivation by farmers registered
with the </p>

<p>National Coca Monopoly (ENACO). ENACO buys and sells it to
retailers either </p>

<p>for resale domestically, for chewing or for herbal tea, or for
export to </p>

<p>produce soft drink flavoring or pharmaceuticals. The 18,000
hectares that </p>

<p>have been registered for licit coca cultivation are centered
in the </p>

<p>department of Cuzco. </p>

<p>Illicit coca cultivation occurs primarily in the Upper
Huallaga Valley region </p>

<p>of northern Peru including the departments of San Martin,
Huanuco, and </p>

<p>Ucayali. Other areas under cultivation include the valleys of
La Convencion </p>

<p>and Lares in the department of Cuzco, and the provinces of
Huanta and La Mar </p>

<p>along the Rio Apurimac in the department of Ayachucho. There
are also smaller </p>

<p>growing areas located in the departments of Puno and Pasco. </p>

<p>The Upper Huallaga Valley is a tropical area with a mild
climate that </p>

<p>receives an average of 12.44 feet of rain during the year.
June through </p>

<p>September is the dry season when the region gets very little
rainfall. The </p>

<p>mean annual temperature is 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Coca is
usually grown here </p>

<p>between 1,980 to 2,640 feet above sea level but is sometimes
planted up to </p>

<p>6,270 feet in altitude. The soil in the Upper Huallaga Valley
is well drained </p>

<p>and rich in iron, an important element for all plant life. </p>

<p>The area surrounding Cuzco has an average rainfall of between
1.32 and 5.94 </p>

<p>feet annually which usually falls between the months of
October and April. </p>

<p>The average temperatures in this region are greater than 53
degrees </p>

<p>Fahrenheit. Coca is generally grown between 2,409 and 4,257
feet above sea </p>

<p>level. The soil is especially poor in iron content. </p>

<p>A semi-tropical climate with warm days and abundant rain fall,
between 6.6 </p>

<p>and 7.26 feet per annum, characterizes the Ayacucho area. Coca
is usually </p>

<p>grown on steep slopes which require terracing at an elevation
of between </p>

<p>1,650 and 4,290 feet. Soils in this area are red and high in
iron. </p>

<p>Bolivia </p>

<p>Bolivia is the world's second largest source of coca leaf.
There is both </p>

<p>licit and illicit coca cultivation occurring in this country
as well. In </p>

<p>mid-1988, a law became effective that made coca cultivation
illegal in most </p>

<p>of the country. The law also established legal, transitional,
and illegal </p>

<p>zones of cultivation and declared that 12,000 hectares of coca
would be the </p>

<p>amount grown to meet the traditional demand for coca. </p>

<p>There are roughly three main growing areas in Bolivia. The
three areas are </p>

<p>the Yungas de La Paz, the Chapare, and the Apolo. Coca
cultivation in the </p>

<p>Yungas de La Paz is located between the cities of Guanay and
Inquisivi, </p>

<p>northeast of La Paz on the eastern slope of the Andes.
Cultivation in the </p>

<p>Chapare occurs in the provinces of Carrasco, Chapare, and
Arani in the </p>

<p>department of Cochabamba, east of La Paz. The small area of
Apolo is in the </p>

<p>La Paz department north of the city of La Paz. </p>

<p>Nearly all the licit coca is grown in the traditional growing
areas of the </p>

<p>Yungas. The overwhelming amount of illicit coca is grown in
the Chapare where </p>

<p>it is estimated that about 75 percent of the country's coca
crop is </p>

<p>cultivated. The amount of coca grown in the Apolo is much less
than in either </p>

<p>of the two other areas. </p>

<p>Parts of the Yungas have been cultivated for hundreds of
years. Coca is </p>

<p>planted at between 4,800 and 6,000 feet in altitude on
terraced fields, </p>

<p>generally on steep slopes. Some of these fields have a slope
of more than 45 </p>

<p>degrees. The Yungas is characterized by a five-month rainy
season that runs </p>

<p>from December to April receiving about 4 feet of rainfall per
year, followed </p>

<p>by seven dry months. The soil content is poor, and this area
has suffered </p>

<p>severe erosion problems. </p>

<p>In the Chapare, the weather is continually wet and warm, with
an annual </p>

<p>rainfall averaging around 13 feet. The growing areas in this
region are </p>

<p>broad, low plains containing some hills. Coca is cultivated at
between 660 </p>

<p>and 1,650 feet above sea level where the temperature averages
around 57 </p>

<p>degrees Fahrenheit. The soil is clay based, rich alluvial
(sediment deposited </p>

<p>by flowing water). </p>

<p>The Apolo, located in La Paz department, is also a noteworthy
coca-growing </p>

<p>region of Bolivia. Coca in the Apolo region is often
interplanted with </p>

<p>coffee, a major crop in the area. Soil in the Apolo is not
suited very well </p>

<p>to coca; the longevity of a coca bush there is only from five
to eight years. </p>

<p>Coca plants in the Apolo are therefore constantly replaced. </p>

<p>Colombia </p>

<p>Colombia ranks third in worldwide coca leaf production with
all cultivation </p>

<p>being illicit. There is widespread cultivation in the eastern
plains region </p>

<p>of the Llanos which encompasses about one-half of Colombia.
The heaviest </p>

<p>areas of cultivation are located in the departments of
Putumayo, Caqueta, </p>

<p>Guaviare, and Vaupes. There is substantial expansion of the
coca crop in the </p>

<p>Bolivar department in the north-central area of Colombia as
well as areas of </p>

<p>cultivation in the south and southwest part of the country. </p>

<p>In the southern coca-growing region, the temperature averages
between 49.5 </p>

<p>and 52 degrees Fahrenheit and there is light rainfall. Coca is
normally grown </p>

<p>between 3,300 arid 6,600 feet above sea level. The soil in
this region is </p>

<p>iron rich; however, there is some erosion. </p>

<p>COCAINE PROCESSING </p>

<p>The conversion of coca leaves to coca paste, cocaine base, and
cocaine </p>

<p>hydrochloride occurs primarily in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.
Peru and </p>

<p>Bolivia are the primary locations for the conversion of leaf
to coca paste </p>

<p>and cocaine base, while Colombia is the primary location for
the final </p>

<p>conversion to cocaine hydrochloride. It is believed that both
Peruvian and </p>

<p>Bolivian traffickers have begun increasing their production of
HCI in the </p>

<p>last few years. </p>

<p>There are a number of chemicals and solvents which play vital
roles in the </p>

<p>processing of coca leaves to paste, base and HCI. Many of
these chemicals are </p>

<p>quite common; all are theoretically substitutable and all have
legitimate </p>

<p>uses making them difficult to control. </p>

<p>Coca processing can be broken down into three stages. The
first is the </p>

<p>conversion of the coca leaf into coca paste; this is almost
always done very </p>

<p>close to the coca fields to cut down on the transport of the
coca leaves. The </p>

<p>second phase is the conversion of coca paste into cocaine
base. This step is </p>

<p>usually omitted in Colombia and the process is taken straight
through from </p>

<p>paste to cocaine HCI. The final stage is conversion of base to
HCI. </p>

<p>Coca Leaves to Coca Paste </p>

<p>The conversion of coca leaf into coca paste is accomplished in
a coca paste </p>

<p>pit, or &quot;pozo. &quot; A typical coca paste pit is a very
crude structure located </p>

<p>near the harvesting site and consists of only a very few
items. Some paste </p>

<p>pits have even been reported in peasants' houses. The paste
pit is usually a </p>

<p>hole in the ground, lined with thick, heavy plastic, or may
even be a </p>

<p>55-gallon drum with the top cut out. Paste pits are often
located near </p>

<p>streams so that the processors will have a constant supply of
fresh water, </p>

<p>which is used in the first stage of processing. The process of
converting </p>

<p>leaves to paste usually takes a few days. Often, however, the
leaves will be </p>

<p>&quot;worked&quot; or &quot;stomped&quot; for only a few hours
rendering less paste than if </p>

<p>&quot;worked&quot; for several days. It is apparently
sometimes more desirable to move </p>

<p>the paste out than to get more paste per kilogram of coca
leaf. Depending on </p>

<p>the size of the pit and the amount of leaf, the whole process
will require </p>

<p>the energy of two to five workers. </p>

<p>The following recipe for coca paste is but one of many.
Recipes will differ </p>

<p>depending on where the laboratory is located. Some will opt
not to use water </p>

<p>in the first step and amounts and mixing times vary widely.
However, this </p>

<p>remains a good benchmark formula. </p>

<p>--Step 1 </p>

<p>The coca leaves are put in an above-ground container or in a
plastic lined </p>

<p>pit. An alkaline material (sodium carbonate) and water are
added to the </p>

<p>leaves. Here the alkaline material enables the cocaine
alkaloid present in </p>

<p>the leaf to be extracted into kerosene. </p>

<p>--Step 2 </p>

<p>A water immiscible solvent (kerosene) is added to water,
solution, and </p>

<p>leaves. The mixture is then agitated. Usually this is
accomplished by having </p>

<p>several people stomp on the leaves. The solvent acts to
extract water </p>

<p>insoluble cocaine alkaloids from the alkaline solution. </p>

<p>--Step 3 </p>

<p>Cocaine alkaloids and kerosene separate from water and leaves.
The water and </p>

<p>leaves are then drained off. </p>

<p>--Step 4 </p>

<p>Cocaine alkaloids are extracted from the kerosene into a
dilute acid </p>

<p>solution. Alkaline material (sodium carbonate) is added to the
remaining </p>

<p>solution which causes a precipitate to form . The acid and the
water are </p>

<p>drained off and the precipitate is filtered and dried to
produce coca paste, </p>

<p>a chunky, off-white to light brown, putty-like </p>

<p>substance. </p>

<p>Coca Paste to Cocaine Base </p>

<p>The processing of coca paste into cocaine base is more
complicated than paste </p>

<p>production, requiring more sophisticated equipment and added
skills. Cocaine </p>

<p>base can be processed at the paste facility, but base
laboratories may be </p>

<p>located away from the cultivation zones. Usually the base
laboratories are </p>

<p>located near rivers or have a clandestine airstrip located in
the vicinity to </p>

<p>facilitate both the movement of coca paste into the base
laboratory, but also </p>

<p>the movement of cocaine base to cocaine HCl laboratories. </p>

<p>As with the paste recipes, the base recipes have many
versions. This one is </p>

<p>one of the more common and a continuation of the paste recipe.
</p>

<p>--Step 1 </p>

<p>The coca paste is added to sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid
and water. The </p>

<p>paste is dissolved into the acid solution. </p>

<p>--Step 2 </p>

<p>Potassium permanganate is combined with water. This mixture is
added to the </p>

<p>coca paste and acid solution. Potassium permanganate is used
in this step to </p>

<p>extract other alkaloids and material that is undesired in the
final product. </p>

<p>In particular, potassium permanganate is used to break down
the alkaloid </p>

<p>ciscinnamoylcocaine found in large concentrations in E.
novogranatense </p>

<p>varieties. If the coca paste has a high concentration of this
alkaloid and </p>

<p>potassium permanganate is not used, then crystallization of
cocaine HCl will </p>

<p>be very difficult. </p>

<p>--Step 3 </p>

<p>This mixture is allowed to stand for about six hours. </p>

<p>--Step 4 </p>

<p>The solution is filtered and the precipitate is discarded.
Ammonia water is </p>

<p>added to the filtered solution and another precipitate is
formed. </p>

<p>--Step 5 </p>

<p>The liquid is drained from the solution and the remaining
precipitate is </p>

<p>usually dried with heating lamps. The resulting powder is
cocaine base. </p>

<p>It is common in Colombia to skip the base stage of cocaine
processing and go </p>

<p>right from coca paste to cocaine HCl. This can be accomplished
by eliminating </p>

<p>the last part of step number four in coca paste processing and
skipping to </p>

<p>step number two of the cocaine base phase where the coca paste
is added to </p>

<p>the potassium permanganate solution. </p>

<p>Cocaine Base to Cocaine Hydrochloride (HCl) </p>

<p>The final stage of cocaine processing requires even more skill
and equipment, </p>

<p>and is much more dangerous than the previously mentioned
steps. Unlike paste </p>

<p>and base processing, cocaine HCl processing calls for
expensive chemicals </p>

<p>that are harder to find and often not manufactured in the
processing country. </p>

<p>The HCl laboratory usually consists of several buildings
including </p>

<p>dormitories, eating facilities, an office, storage facilities,
and the </p>

<p>laboratory itself. Also usually found at HCl laboratories are
communications </p>

<p>operations, generators, filtering and drying equipment, and,
more recently, </p>

<p>chemical recycling facilities. The HCl laboratory will
sometimes have direct </p>

<p>access to an airstrip. </p>

<p>The following recipe is a continuation of the above two. At
this point the </p>

<p>methods of processing vary only slightly. </p>

<p>--Step 1 </p>

<p>Acetone or ether is added to dissolve the cocaine base and the
solution is </p>

<p>filtered to remove undesired material. </p>

<p>--Step 2 </p>

<p>Hydrochloric acid diluted in acetone or ether is added to the
cocaine </p>

<p>solution. The addition of the hydrochloric acid causes the
cocaine to </p>

<p>precipitate (crystallize) out of the solution as cocaine
hydrochloride. </p>

<p>--Step 3 </p>

<p>The remaining acetone/ether solvent can be discarded or
reused. </p>

<p>--Step 4 </p>

<p>Cocaine HCl is dried under heat lamps, laid out to dry with
the aid of fans, </p>

<p>or dried in microwave ovens. </p>

<p>NATURAL ENEMIES AND ERADICATION EFFORTS </p>

<p>Although the coca bush is a very strong plant and will live
for many years </p>

<p>and produce many harvests of leaf, it will do better if taken
care of, </p>

<p>fertilized, and treated with herbicides and insecticides. </p>

<p>Occasionally, a coca field will become infested with one of
the plant's </p>

<p>natural enemies. The main pests and the effect that they are
known to have on </p>

<p>the plant are discussed below. </p>

<p>The larvae of the moth Eloria Noyesi presents the most serious
threat to the </p>

<p>coca plant. This moth lives through out the coca-growing
region of South </p>

<p>America and seems to feed almost exclusively on E. coca. It
has also been </p>

<p>recorded feeding on E. novogranatense in Colombia and northern
Peru. The </p>

<p>larva will develop in about a month and will eat up to 50
leaves in its </p>

<p>lifetime. The larva will also eat the shoots of the bush that
grow out after </p>

<p>harvest. If Eloria attacks a plant repeatedly, even a strong
plant will die. </p>

<p>The moth is usually only abundant from December to April. Coca
growers are </p>

<p>using insecticides to eradicate Eloria. </p>

<p>The larvae of Eucleodora Coca, a fly, seems to cause harm only
to Trujillo </p>

<p>coca. (There have been major infestations of this insect in
the past usually </p>

<p>occuring from April to August.) The larvae spend their entire
lives on the </p>

<p>plant, feeding on the leaves and shoots . As with the Eloria,
Eucleodora is </p>

<p>being controlled with insecticides. </p>

<p>Very little is known about the effect of the leaf-cutting ant,
Acromyrmex, on </p>

<p>coca. Growers in the Upper Huallaga Valley report that serious
damage in the </p>

<p>past has been done to their coca cultivation. The damage is
often controlled </p>

<p>with the use of insecticides and flooding. The beetle,
Aegoidus Pacificus, </p>

<p>also poses a threat to Trujillo coca. The adult beetle lays
her eggs in the </p>

<p>bark of the coca plant, and the larva later burrows into the
stem of the </p>

<p>plant. This usually results in an infestation of pathogenic
fungi which is </p>

<p>ultimately responsible for the death of the coca plant. As
with the other </p>

<p>pests, the beetle can also be controlled with insecticides. </p>

<p>Most of the other insects which attack coca only do so when
there are </p>

<p>shortages of their normal food supply. Some scientists believe
that cocaine </p>

<p>and other alkaloids may present some natural defense against
most pests. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, sometimes insects such as spider mites,
grasshoppers, </p>

<p>leafhoppers, and beetles find it necessary to eat coca. </p>

<p>The coca plant is also susceptible to numerous species of
pathogenic fungi. </p>

<p>Fungi seem to present the greatest threat to a plant during
the wet season. </p>

<p>The most serious threat seems to come from a fungus called
&quot;witches broom .&quot; </p>

<p>The exact effect of this fungus on the coca plant is not clear
because of the </p>

<p>limited amount of study which has been done on this fungus
infesting coca </p>

<p>plantations. </p>

<p>Natural enemies hold hope for control of the coca plant in the
future. At </p>

<p>present, however, the most successful methods in controlling
the growth of </p>

<p>coca are herbicides and manual eradication. </p>

<p>As of early 1990, all eradication of the coca plant in Bolivia
and Colombia </p>

<p>was being done manually. The usual method has been for a team
of eradication </p>

<p>workers to go into a field and pull up the bushes plant by
plant. In Peru, </p>

<p>manual eradication of coca is often suspended because of
security reasons. </p>

<p>Prior to that time, a number of gasoline-powered cutters had
been supplied to </p>

<p>the workers making it easier and much quicker to cut the coca.
The problem </p>

<p>with this method is that sometimes the coca bush will sprout
from the stump </p>

<p>within 12 to 18 months. As such, the cutting must be made very
close to the </p>

<p>ground to insure that the plant does not sprout again. </p>

<p>A number of herbicides have been tested for use in eradicating
the coca plant </p>

<p>including hexazinone and tebuthiuron (spike) . Application of
both has been </p>

<p>deemed successful in killing the plant as long as they are
applied in the </p>

<p>correct manner and amount. Within ten to twenty days after
application of </p>

<p>hexazinone or tebuthiuron the coca bush sheds all its leaves
and usually </p>

<p>within 60 to 90 days the coca plant will be completely dead. </p>

<p>The United States is working with some South American
governments to develop </p>

<p>an herbicidal eradication program; Bolivia, however, has
prohibited the use </p>

<p>of herbicides for this purpose. </p>

<h1>DEA Congressional Testimony </h1>

<hr size="10" noshade>

<p> <em>Statement by:<br>
</em><b>Thomas A. Constantine<br>
Administrator<br>
Drug Enforcement Administration<br>
United States Department of Justice</b> <br>
<br>
<em>Before the:<br>
</em><strong>Senate Foreign Relations Committee</strong> <br>
<br>
<em>Regarding:<br>
</em><strong>International Drug Trafficking Organizations in
Mexico</strong> <br>
<br>
<em>Location:<br>
</em><strong>Dirksen Senate Office Building<br>
Room 419<br>
Washington, D.C.</strong> <br>
<br>
<em>Date:<br>
</em><strong>August 8, 1995</strong> <br>
<br>
<em>Note:</em> This document may not reflect changes made in
actual delivery. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee: I'm pleased to appear
before you today to discuss the growing role of international
drug trafficking organizations operating in Mexico and to tell
you what the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is doing to
attack these organizations that are responsible for smuggling
tons of illegal drugs across the U.S./Mexico border. <br>
<br>
Mexico is pivotal to the success of any U.S. drug strategy. Not
only do we share a common border, through which three-fourths of
the cocaine enters our country, but Mexico has long been a major
source country for heroin and marijuana. Within the last few
years, it has also become a major source country for
methamphetamine, as well as a transit country for chemicals,
especially ephedrine, used in the manufacture of methamphetamine.
<br>
<br>
My purpose at this hearing today is to talk about the drug
trafficking situation and to highlight our concerns about the
increased role of these international drug gangs operating in
Mexico. My comments will be limited to observations on
trafficking organizations and their methods of smuggling, the law
enforcement communities' efforts to work with Mexico, and an
assessment of our chances for success in decreasing the flood of
illegal drugs that enter this country each day and have a
devastating impact on the citizens on both sides of the border. <br>
<br>
<strong>A Glimpse of the Problem</strong> <br>
<br>
Mr. Chairman, an important 1989 drug seizure gave us a glimpse of
the magnitude of the problem law enforcement faces and also
illustrates just how important Mexico is to our efforts to
control illegal drugs coming into our country. In late 1989, DEA
made America's largest cocaine seizure on record (over 21.5 tons)
in Sylmar, California. <br>
<br>
This cocaine came across the border at El Paso and was trucked to
the West Coast. Drug law enforcement was encouraged by such a
huge seizure, and we were convinced that we had seriously wounded
the Colombian drug organizations by preventing such a large
amount of illegal drugs from reaching our streets. <br>
<br>
But, we realized our encouragement was premature when we analyzed
seized records. What we found was even more astounding. We
learned that during only a 3-month period, the organization had
succeeded in smuggling 55 tons of cocaine into the U.S. This
cocaine had been trucked to Los Angeles and had already been
distributed on our streets. <br>
<br>
One of the most disturbing aspects of this case is that ten years
ago, we measured drug seizures in grams and pounds. Today, we
routinely measure seizures in tons-even multitons. In January,
for example, in Pasadena, Texas, a suburb of Houston, we seized
6.5 tons of cocaine. In July, we seized over 5 tons of cocaine in
the border town of El Paso. And one of the primary reasons for
these multiton shipments of cocaine is the efficient and
mutually-rewarding relationship that has emerged between the
cocaine mafia in Colombia and the drug trafficking groups
operating in Mexico. <br>
<br>
In fact, Mr. Chairman, we estimate that the Colombian drug mafia
is using Mexico as a cocaine safe haven to store, at any one
time, as much as 70 to 100 tons of cocaine that will eventually
be smuggled across the U.S. border for distribution on American
streets. This is enough to provide a line of cocaine to every
man, woman, and child on this planet--and then some. At a
conservative estimate, this cocaine would be worth over $700
million to $1 billion on America's streets. <br>
<br>
<strong>Role of the International Drug Traffickers</strong> <br>
<br>
The fact that these traffickers have been able to accommodate the
transportation needs of the Cali cocaine mafia is not something
that happened overnight. Criminal organizations from Mexico have
had decades of practice. Traditionally, the Mexican border
economies have been significantly affected by the smuggling
activities into and out of the United States. It was these
organized smuggling organizations that rose to prominence in the
late 1960s and 1970s when marijuana trafficking presented the
potential for huge profits. <br>
<br>
During the early 1980's, most of the Colombian cocaine entered
the United States through South Florida by way of the Caribbean.
But, traffickers were forced to find new routes when U.S. drug
agencies increased enforcement action in the Caribbean and South
Florida. The Colombian drug lords naturally turned to the
trafficking groups in Mexico which had what they were looking
for: proximity to the United States, a 2,000 mile expanse of
border offering unlimited smuggling possibilities, and an already
established drug trafficking infrastructure that stood ready to
serve their needs. <br>
<br>
The drug trafficking organizations easily adapted their
operations to include cocaine trafficking, and by the mid-80's,
were well-established and reliable transporters of Colombian
cocaine. Delegating cocaine transportation to the traffickers in
Mexico was a tactical decision on the part of the Cali mafia.
With the transportation assistance of these traffickers, the
cocaine barons could now move larger bulk quantities through
Mexico which would have been logistically impossible to move by
any other means. By turning the riskiest part of the cocaine
distribution cycle (the transportation) over to these
traffickers, the Cali mafia could turn its attention to other
aspects of their cocaine enterprise. This drug trafficking
partnership has become one of both convenience and profit. <br>
<br>
One of the first traffickers to move cocaine through Mexico and
to the U.S. was Juan Ramon Matta-Ballesteros, a Honduran, who,
from the mid-'70s to the mid-'80s, was actively involved with the
Mexican Guadalajara Cartel. This was the group responsible for
the kidnapping torture and murder of DEA Special Agent Enrique
(Kiki) Camarena in 1985. The death of Agent Camarena outraged the
American public. Matta-Ballesteros has been convicted in three
separate U.S. cases and is serving a term of life imprisonment. <br>
<br>
<strong>Emerging Traffickers Coming into their Own</strong> <br>
<br>
Today, there is no question that drug traffickers operating in
Mexico have become major players in the international drug trade.
These veteran traffickers have been good students and have
learned valuable lessons from the drug experts--the Cali mafia.
They have seen the benefit (and profits) of working together in a
partnership to provide a needed transportation service to the
cocaine organizations in Colombia. Receiving payment in both cash
and cocaine, they have begun to establish their own cocaine
distribution networks and territories, stretching from the
Southwest border areas as far as New York. In effect, the Cali
mafia has been a willing partner in helping these organizations
create distribution and sales networks in the U.S. <br>
<br>
Like the Cali mafia, these trafficking organizations have
demonstrated their flexibility to change trafficking routes when
law enforcement action along any one route becomes too risky to
their business. These drug groups have also followed the lead of
their predecessors by expanding and diversifying their product
line. Sophisticated trafficking organizations based in Mexico now
manufacture methamphetamine and smuggle the precursor chemicals
necessary for its manufacture. And, perhaps most important, as
they have expanded their role in the drug trade, they have made
valuable worldwide contacts, which will be necessary as they
continue to establish themselves as important players in the
world of illegal drugs. <br>
<br>
There are a number of trafficking groups in Mexico that have
gained a firm foothold in the trafficking of drugs, but I'd like
to take a moment to describe the four major drug trafficking
organizations that work closely with the Cali mafia: <br>
<br>
<strong>Tijuana Cartel</strong> <br>
<br>
The organization sometimes referred to the &quot;Tijuana
Cartel,&quot; is headed by Benjamin Arellano-Felix and his
brother Francisco. They control most of the drugs crossing the
border on the West Coast between Tijuana and Mexicali. <br>
<br>
Feuding between this group and other organizations has become
increasingly violent. In fact, it was the feuding between the
Arrellano-Felix organization and rival drug dealers that led to
the killing of Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas-Ocampo at the
Guadalajara airport in 1993 <br>
<br>
The Arellano-Felix brothers are currently the subjects of a
nationwide manhunt by law enforcement authorities for their
involvement in the Cardinal's killing. On June 23, Mexican
authorities arrested Hector Luis Palma-Salazar, the leader of a
rival drug organization that is believed to be behind the
attempted assassinations of the Arellano-Felix brothers, as well
as the murder of Cardinal Posadas-Ocampo. Benjamin and Francisco
Arellano-Felix have both been indicted in San Diego, California,
and are DEA fugitives. <br>
<br>
<strong>The Caro-Ouintero Organization</strong> <br>
<br>
The Caro-Quintero organization is involved in the cultivation,
processing, smuggling and distribution of heroin and marijuana
and the transportation of Colombian cocaine into the U.S. This
organization was previously led by Rafael Caro-Quintero, known as
the &quot;Mexican Rhinestone Cowboy,&quot; who began his criminal
career at the young age of 12 or 13 as an apprentice to Pedro
Aviles, a notorious Mexican drug trafficker. <br>
<br>
Caro-Quintero is currently in a Mexican maximum security prison
for his involvement in the kidnaping, torture and murder of DEA
Special Agent Enrique Camarena, as well as for marijuana and
cocaine trafficking. His brother, Miguel Caro-Quintero, now runs
the organization, and is under indictment in Tucson and Denver. <br>
<br>
<strong>Juarez: Cartel</strong> <br>
<br>
One of the most notorious and powerful of these trafficking
organizations is the Amado Carrillo-Fuentes organization,
sometimes referred to as the &quot;Juarez Cartel.&quot;
Carrillo-Fuentes has been the chief transporter for the recently
arrested Cali mafia leader Miguel Rodriguez-Orejuela. <br>
<br>
Carrillo-Fuentes owns several airline companies, which enables
him to fly 727s from Colombia into Juarez, where he runs his
organization from his ranch headquarters. Increasingly, murders
in Juarez have been associated with Carrillo-Fuentes. In July,
the leader of the juvenile gangs he recruits to smuggle drugs
across the border was found shot 23 times in the head. Here in
the United States, Carrillo-Fuentes has been indicted in Miami on
heroin and marijuana charges, and in Dallas on cocaine charges. <br>
<br>
<strong>Juan Garcia-Abrego</strong> <br>
<br>
Another influential Mexican trafficker acting in concert with the
Cali mafia is Juan Garcia-Abrego, who is involved in smuggling
drugs from the Yucatan area in Mexico to South Texas and up to
New York. Juan Garcia-Abrego was recently added to the FBI's top
ten most wanted fugitives, with a $2 million reward for his
capture. This is the first time an international drug trafficker
has been included on the FBI list. <br>
<br>
This organization transports large quantities of cocaine for the
Cali mafia, as well as marijuana and heroin for other
traffickers. Garcia-Abrego pioneered deals in which Mexican
traffickers take payment in cocaine, which substantially raised
their profits, and at the same time diversified their involvement
from beyond smuggling to the role of suppliers to their own drug
distribution networks. He and his organization are notorious for
the violence they employ to further and protect their illicit
trade. <br>
<br>
He also ships bulk amounts of cash for the Cali mafia. During a
four-year period, from 1989 to 1993, $53 million was seized in
connection with the Garcia-Abrego organization. Two American
Express bankers in Brownsville, Texas, were indicted for
laundering $30 million for Garcia-Abrego, and to date, 70 members
of his organization have been prosecuted and convicted in the
U.S. Juan Garcia-Abrego has been indicted in Houston and remains
a fugitive. <br>
<br>
<strong>Expanding Influence: Cocaine and Methamphetamine</strong>
<br>
<br>
DEA is very concerned about the expanding role of drug
organizations based in Mexico which are playing an increasingly
larger role in the shipment and distribution of cocaine and
methamphetamine to the United States. <br>
<br>
<strong>Cocaine</strong> <br>
<br>
In the last few years, we've seen international trafficking
organizations make major changes in their efficiency in
transporting bulk shipments of cocaine to transporting
organizations in Mexico. Traditionally trafficking organizations
used twin-engine general aviation aircraft to transport cocaine
from Colombia to transhipment locations in Mexico and the
Caribbean. Today, however, the Cali mafia has bought passenger
jets (like 727's) gutted them, and are using them to transport
multiton loads of cocaine to the trafficking organizations in
Mexico. In March of this year, for example, a Caravelle jet
aircraft was seized in the Mexican State of Sonora, after being
abandoned by traffickers when its tires became stuck in the dirt
runway. Mexican Government forces later seized 2.8 tons of
cocaine that are believed to have been off-loaded from that
Caravelle. <br>
<br>
Law enforcement has also uncovered two tunnels built to move
cocaine from Mexico into the United States. The first was
discovered in Arizona in 1990. The second nearly-completed tunnel
was discovered in 1993 near the Tijuana Airport and led to an
unfinished warehouse in the United States. <br>
<br>
<strong>Methamphetamine</strong> <br>
<br>
U.S. law enforcement is also concerned about the growing role of
trafficking gangs operating in Mexico involved in the
methamphetamine trade. We directly attribute the increased
amounts of methamphetamine available in the U.S. to these
trafficking organizations which have replaced domestic outlaw
motorcycle gangs as the predominant methamphetamine producers,
traffickers, and distributors. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, DEA is very much aware of the problem of these
methamphetamine gangs operating in the U.S. Last summer, DEA
Special Agent Richard Fass was shot and killed in Tucson by a
methamphetamine trafficker during an undercover operation. The
ring leader of the gang responsible for Agent Fass' death has
still not been apprehended and is believed to be in Mexico. The
DEA is currently working with both the FBI and Mexican
authorities to apprehend him. <br>
<br>
In the last three years, these trafficking organizations have
virtually saturated the western United States market with
high-purity methamphetamine, known also as &quot;speed&quot;
or&quot;crank.&quot; In some areas of California, it has now
reportedly replaced cocaine as the drug of choice. With a
saturated West Coast market, these traffickers have begun to
expand their markets to the East Coast and in the South. DEA's
southern offices report a growing presence of these trafficking
groups providing methamphetamine to domestic trafficking
organizations in rural and suburban areas of Georgia, Tennessee,
Kentucky, and the Carolinas. <br>
<br>
As supplies have increased, prices have fallen, making it a cheap
alternative to cocaine. Some have called it the &quot;poor man's
cocaine.&quot; In 1991, for example, the lowest pound price
nationwide was $6,000. Today, in California, methamphetamine
sells for between $2,500 and $3,600 per pound. <br>
<br>
With increased availability, methamphamine use has increased.
According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network, the number of
emergency room episodes involving methamphetamine has increased
steadily since 1991, particularly in the West. From 1991 to 1993,
episodes more than doubled in both Los Angeles and Phoenix. <br>
<br>
The dominance of Mexico-based, poly-drug organizations in
methamphetamine trafficking is further evidence of their growing
sophistication. The smuggling skills developed while transporting
cocaine for the Cali mafia has enabled these organizations to
branch out into moving other contraband, such as precursor
chemicals, especially ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, used in the
manufacture of methamphetamine . <br>
<br>
They have established international connections in Europe, Asia
and the Far East to obtain the shipment of tons of precursor
chemicals, particularly ephedrine, to addresses in both United
States and Mexico. During 1993 and 1994, the majority of
ephedrine shipments destined for Mexico were supplied by such
diverse countries as China, India, the Czech Republic, and
Switzerland. From mid-1993 to early 1995, DEA documented the
diversion of almost 170 tons of ephedrine used in illicit
methamphetamine production. It's important to note, however, that
DEA has obtained cooperation from many of these countries to stem
the flow of chemicals going to Mexico. <br>
<br>
It's difficult to predict where this newest surge of
methamphetamine use and trafficking will lead, but we must not
assume that it has peaked. Unlike other drugs, methamphetamine is
one that these criminal organizations can control entirely from
beginning to end. They have the international contacts to obtain
the necessary precursor chemicals to make the drug. They have the
clandestine labs to process the chemicals into methamphetamine on
both sides of the border. They have expanded their distribution
networks across the nation by the use and intimidation of illegal
aliens. And, unlike their previous role as middle-men moving
cocaine and heroin, they can keep 100 percent of the profits from
their methamphetamine sales. <br>
<br>
U. S. law enforcement may be in for a difficult and violent few
years as we work to get the methamphetamine problem under
control. We've already seen &quot;meth&quot; smuggling gangs face
off against each other. Recently, in San Diego, a confrontation
between meth smuggling groups with ties to Mexico resulted in 26
homicides. There may be more bloodshed on our streets, as these
drug gangs fight to protect (and expand) their drug turf. <br>
<br>
<strong>DEA's Response</strong> <br>
<br>
In response to the threats of the Mexico-based trafficking
organizations and their surrogate drug gangs operating here in
the United States, DEA has taken a number of steps to work with
our law enforcement partners in Mexico, as well as with our
Federal, state, and local colleagues here at home. <br>
<br>
DEA has joined forces with the FBI in a Southwest Border
Initiative that targets the major Mexican trafficking
organizations for enforcement actions. Combined teams of state,
local and federal law enforcement led by DEA and FBI Special
Agents are working together with a common goal of disrupting
these gangs and bringing their leaders to justice. <br>
<br>
For the first time, the DEA, the FBI, the Department of Justice
Criminal Division, and respective U.S. Attorneys in every state
along the Southwest Border are coordinating both intelligence and
manpower resources against a common enemy--the poly-drug
trafficking organizations that are transporting increased amounts
of cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine across our
borders. Both the DEA and the FBI hold high expectations for the
success for this operation. <br>
<br>
Three new binational Border Task Forces have been established and
will focus on the four principal trafficking organizations.
Senior personnel of the DEA, FBI, and DOJ Criminal Division serve
on a U.S./Mexican Plenary Group, working to enhance our
cooperation against narcotics, money laundering, arms smuggling,
and other crimes. <br>
<br>
Mr. Chairman, in this open forum I cannot explain the specifics
of how this new initiative will work, but I would be happy to
discuss this in more detail in a closed session or a private
briefing. <br>
<br>
Our support for Mexico's drug fighting efforts is critical to
their success--and ultimately to our own. Attorney General Reno
and Mexican Attorney General Antonio Lozano-Gracia have pledged
to work cooperatively to address the problems. Hopefully, a close
and coordinated law enforcement response by our two countries
will have an impact on this growing problem. <br>
<br>
<strong>Future Threats: An Assessment</strong> <br>
<br>
There is no question that the international drug trafficking
organizations operating in Colombia and Mexico have had a direct
impact on the multiton quantities of cocaine law enforcement is
forced to deal with today. These organizations have proven to be
a serious threat to both the United States and Mexico. <br>
<br>
In recent years, as the political and economic ties between the
United States and Mexico have strengthened, a new generation of
international traffickers have been able to carve out an ever
larger share of the world's drug trade and pose a growing threat
on both sides of the border. We've seen these trafficking
organizations grow from low-level smuggling groups to
sophisticated organizations that smuggle more and more drugs of
every kind--cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and now
methamphetamine--into the U.S. They are increasingly being paid
for their transportation expertise with cocaine, a move that
could prove to be the undoing of the Cali mafia and could shift
the balance of power within the worldwide cocaine trade. <br>
<br>
Mr. Chairman, in a few years down the road, I believe it's
entirely possible that these newly emerging groups could rise to
an equal (or superior) footing with the Cali mafia. If this
happens, life as we know it in both the United States and Mexico
will change dramatically. They care little for the devasting
impact they have on the people of Mexico and the United States.
They are international criminal elements that must be dealt with.
<br>
<br>
The President of Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo, has publically stated
to the American media that drug trafficking is a threat to
Mexican national security, not only because of the crime that is
inherent in such activity, but also because of the growing wealth
that enables traffickers to corrupt police and government
institutions. <br>
<br>
As these organizations grow in wealth and sophistication, they
threaten to overwhelm the capabilities of any law enforcement
system, including Mexico. By comparison, we have a professional
law enforcement system in the United States, at the Federal,
state and local level, that promotes and encourages high
standards in recruitment, training, internal inspections,
standards of operations and accountability to electecl officials.
<br>
<br>
We have a criminal justice system that is quick to respond to
charges of unethical or corrupt actions on the part of law
enforcement. It has helped to professionalize our law enforcement
agencies and insure a continuing quest for ethics and integrity.
Despite our best efforts, unethical or illegal activities do
occasionally occur within the ranks of our law enforcement
agencies, requiring swift and decisive government action to
preserve the public's faith and trust. <br>
<br>
As a society, we provide modern and sophisticated resources to
our law enforcement agencies to combat the criminal elements
confronting them. The law enforcement institutions in Mexico do
not presently have an infrastructure similar to those in the U.S.
The development of such institutions will require a substantial
commitment of time and resources to achieve the necessary level
of professionalism. The potential exists that if this is not
done, they may be overwhelmed by the wealth and influence of the
drug organizations. <br>
<br>
We are not alone in recognizing this problem. Attorney General
Lozano has moved to have special police units report directly to
him. He has announced a plan to include reviews of all Federal
police officers and prosecutors, with mandatory drug testing, to
combat internal corruption. I cite this only to illustrate that
the Mexican government itself recognizes this is a problem. <br>
<br>
It is imperative that we work with our partners in Mexico to
blunt the influence these drug traffickers are having in both our
countries. It is also imperative that our own Federal, state, and
local law enforcement continue to work cooperatively together to
make the best use of our resources, as well as to increase our
impact on these trafficking organizations. Surely, when we speak
of tons of drugs coming across our borders and causing tremendous
damage to the health and well-being of our citizens, we are
talking of a national security threat that demands our immediate
and continuous attention. <br>
<br>
DEA is hopeful that future counterdrug efforts with Mexico will
be successful. In the past year, Mexico has instituted new
programs that include attempts to professionalize its law
enforcement institutions and increase cross-border cooperation to
address the threat of the international traffickers. The direct
and cooperative communication between Attorney General Reno and
Attorney General Lozano should be of great help in securing a
coordination of our resources to address a common problem. The
threat is serious--and it is real. <br>

<p>Needle exchange talking points </p>

<p>Origins of the University of California study </p>

<p>Former drug czar Bob Martinez and former Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) director Bill Roper decide in Summer '91 that
objective review of data on needle exchange programs (NEPs) is
needed </p>

<p>University of California (UC), Berkeley and UC San Francisco
agree to do the work </p>

<p>Study is funded by CDC through a Cooperative Agreement with
the Association of Schools of Public Health </p>

<p>Pls are Arthur Reingold (UC Berkeley) and Philip R. Lee (UC
San Francisco) </p>

<p>Lee leaves 7/1/94 to be Assistant Secretary for Health;
replaced as Pl by Peter Lurie, formerly Project Director </p>

<p>Approximate total cost of study $400,000 </p>

<p>Work begins 4/1/92 </p>

<p>3 volumes, &gt;700 pages </p>

<p>Entailed review of 2000 documents, visits to 23 programs in 15
cities in 4 countries, interviews with almost 250 individuals,
mail survey of programs not visited, mathematical modeling of
cost-effectiveness </p>

<p>Conclusions: </p>

<p>available [data] provide no evidence that needle exchange
programs increase the amount of drug use by needle exchange
program clients or change overall community levels of
non-injection and injection drug use.&quot; (page 18 of report
Summary) </p>

<p>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that it is likely that NEPs
decrease the rate of new HIV infection: (page 26) </p>

<p>1. Biologic plausibility; removing potentially infected
syringes from circulation and replacing them with clean ones must
decrease new infections </p>

<p>2. Behavioral data: 10/14 studies showed a decrease in HIV
risk behavior (the sharing of syringes) and none showed an
increase </p>

<p>3. Three- to four-fold decrease in new hepatitis B infections
[with later data this increased to seven- to eight-fold for
hepatitis B and C infection] </p>

<p>4. Mathematical models from New Haven (33% decrease in new HIV
infections) and by the UC study model (15-17% </p>

<p>Recommendations (page 27): </p>

<p>The federal government should repeal the ban on the use of
federal funds for needle exchange services.&quot; </p>

<p>Substantial federal funds should be committed to both
providing needle exchange services and to expanding research into
these programs. </p>

<p>State governments in the ten states and the District of
Columbia that have prescription laws should repeal these laws. </p>

<p>States should repeal the paraphernalia laws as they apply to
syringes. </p>

<p>Report released 9/30/93 </p>

<p>About 12,000 copies of various volumes of the report
distributed </p>

<p>The first review </p>

<p>On October 15, 1993, Joe Boufford, Principal Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Health (Lee's office), writes to CDC Director David
Satcher requesting a review of the UC report and providing
opinions and recommendations for federal action in response to
needle exchange. </p>

<p>CDC consults with NIH (NIDA), FDA, HRSA and SAMSHA (Substance
Abuse Mental Health Services Administration). Their comments are
attached as tabs to the review. </p>

<p>Conclusions: </p>

<p>The UC research team has done a careful and scientifically
sound compilation and review of all the available data on needle
exchange and the availability of needles and syringes to
injection drug users.&quot; (page 1) The UC team used stringent
scientific standards in its analysis and interpretation of the
collected published and unpublished studies ... The UC report is
the most extensive and comprehensive study of needle exchange
ever published.&quot; (page 6) </p>

<p>After reviewing several lines of evidence similar to the four
points listed above, the review concludes: Taken together, these
observations indicate that NEPs are likely to reduce HIV
transmission, even though the epidemiologic studies of NEPs do
not definitively demonstrate decreases or increases in HIV
transmission.&quot; (page 2) Several findings strongly support
the conclusion that NEPs reduce HIV transmission.&quot; (page 10)
</p>

<p>No data exists indicating increases related to NEPs in either
drug use or in the number of discarded syringes.&quot; (page 2)
We agree with the UC team conclusion that available data are
quite limited but provide no evidence of any NEP-related
increases in community levels of drug use.&quot; (page 10) </p>

<p>&quot;... we believe that the benefits of NEPs as a component
of a comprehensive HIV prevention program for drug users exceed
the theoretical risks of such programs.&quot; (page 2) </p>

<p>&quot;We conclude that the ban on Federal funding of NEPs
should be lifted to allow communities and States to use Federal
funds to support NEPs as components of comprehensive HIV
prevention programs.&quot; (page 2) </p>

<p>&quot;We also recommend that States consider the repeal of
laws requiring a physician's prescription to buy needles and
syringes and the removal of criminal penalties for the possession
of needles and syringes&quot; (page 2) </p>

<p>Fate of the first review </p>

<p>Review signed by Satcher and sent to Boufford on December 10,
1993. </p>

<p>Review has never been made public. </p>

<p>Rep. Henry Waxman obtained a copy, but only under condition
that it not be released to the public. </p>

<p>Review not disclosable under the Freedom of Information Act; a
request by San Francisco Chronicle for the review was denied
recently. </p>

<p>Only real press coverage is reference to the coverup on CNN in
August 1994 and in San Francisco Chronicle in December 1994. </p>

<p>The second review </p>

<p>In fall 1994, Brian Biles of the Office of the Assistant
Secretary for Health, wrote to CDC asking for an update on
information since the University of California Report. </p>

<p>This second review, much shorter and less expansive than the
first review, is sent to the Associate Director for HIV/AIDS
(James Curran) by the Assistant Director for Substance Abuse and
HIV Prevention (T. Stephen Jones) on November 22, 1994, and
presumably forwarded on to the Office of the Assistant Secretary
for Health. </p>

<p>The review contains the following: </p>

<p>Summary of new evidence from New York City showing a decrease
in HIV transmission among NEP clients that concludes that
although the numbers are small, the evidence is plausible.&quot;
(page 1 ). </p>

<p>Three additional studies with evidence of decreases in HIV
risk behavior (page 3). </p>

<p>No evidence of increased drug use in a San Francisco study
(page 3). </p>

<p>New data showing that the decrease in hepatitis B and C
infections associated with needle exchange is now seven- to
eight-fold. 'this study demonstrates more clearly than any
previous research that use of NEPs is associated with decreases
in blood borne infections.&quot; (Page 4) </p>

<p>Data from Montreal showing higher HIV infection rates, higher
rates of HIV risk behaviors and higher rates of new HIV infection
among NEP clients that &quot;require further study.&quot; (page
5) This finding is most reasonably interpreted as showing that
NEPs are reaching the drug users at highest risk for HIV (a good
thing). </p>

<p>No formal recommendations with respect to federal policy. </p>

<p>The existence of this review has never been made public. </p>

<p>Public health significance </p>

<p>Approximately 1/3 of all AIDS cases occur among injections
drug users, their sex partners and their children. </p>

<p>Only about 15% of injectors are in drug treatment on any given
day. </p>

<p>Over 10,000 drug users, their sex partners and their children
contract HIV each year. This is 1-2 preventable HIV infections
per hour. Needle exchange may decrease new HIV infections by 33%,
according to the New Haven mathematical model. </p>

<p>1. ISSUE </p>

<p>On October 15, 1993, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Health requested that the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) review the University of California (UC)
research report on needle exchange (executive summary at Tab A)
and provide recommendations and opinions on Federal action in
response to needle exchange to the Principal Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Health and the Surgeon General. </p>

<p>The UC report and recommendations were reviewed by CDC staff.

recommendations and opinions on Federal action in response to
needle exchange from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (Tab
B), the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA) (Tab C), the Health Services and Resources
Administration (HSRA) (Tab D), and the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) (Tab E). Comments on this report to you were
also requested from these agencies. The agencies were not asked
for final concurrence on the CDC response. The attached comments
(Tabs B-E) were provided by the Principal AIDS Coordinators of
the four agencies. </p>

<p>2. SUMMARY </p>

<p>The UC research team has done a careful and scientifically
sound compilation and review of all the available data on needle
exchange and the availability of needles and syringes to
injection drug users (IDUs). The UC team also gathered new data
through surveys of needle exchange programs (NEPs), key informant
interviews, and focus groups of IDUs. </p>

<p>NEPs are intended to decrease human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) transmission associated with injection drug use by
replacing used, potentially HIV-infected syringes with sterile
ones. They also can help IDUs obtain drug treatment and other
public health services. The emergence of more than three dozen
NEPs in the United States suggests an increasing acceptance of
these programs as part of a community response to the dual
epidemics of injection drug use and HIV infection. However, in
some communities, NEPs have been very controversial. Some law
enforcement, drug treatment, and community leaders are concerned
that these programs give &quot;the wrong message&quot; about drug
use and may reduce law enforcement agencies' ability to combat
drug use and associated violence. Other concerns are that NEPs
have not been shown to be effective in eliminating HIV
transmission and may draw scarce resources away from other,
possibly more effective, programs such as drug treatment. </p>

<p>The CDC concurs with the UC findings that (1) NEPs are
effective in removing used, sometimes HIV-contaminated needles
and syringes from circulation and replacing them with sterile
ones, (2) IDUs using NEPs decrease HIV drug-risk behaviors (e.g.,
decreased sharing of injection equipment, decreased frequency of
injection), (3) NEPs are effective in recruiting IDUs to enter
drug treatment, (4) HIV prevalence in syringes returned to NEPs
decreases, and (5) mathematical models of NEPs estimate
substantial decreases in HIV transmission among NEP clients.
Taken together, these observations indicate that NEPs are likely
to reduce HIV transmission, even though the epidemiologic studies
of NEPs do not definitively demonstrate decreases or increases in
HIV transmission. The existing epidemiologic studies are limited
in their ability to detect such changes. No data exists
indicating increases related to NEPs in either drug use or in the
number of discarded syringes. W8 endorse the UC report
recommendation that additional research and evaluation on NEPs is
a high priority to further assess the impact of these programs-s
and the relative effectiveness of various models of delivery of
NEP services. </p>

<p>Two other issues have prompted reconsideration of Federal
policy on needle exchange: (1) the magnitude of the HIV epidemic
among IDUs and the related epidemics among their sex partners and
newborns in many areas of this country and (2) the limitations of
alternative intervention options to prevent drug-related HIV
transmission (e.g., limited capacity of drug treatment available
to IDUs and limitations of bleach disinfection of injection
equipment). Based on these observations and the weight of data
presented in the UC report, we believe that the benefits of NEPs
as a component of a comprehensive HIV prevention program for drug
users exceed the theoretical risks of such programs. We conclude
that the ban on Federal funding of NEPs should be lifted to allow
communities and States to use Federal funds to support NEPs as
components of comprehensive HIV prevention programs. We recommend
that NEPs receiving Federal funds be linked to substance abuse
treatment programs and other HIV prevention services. We also
recommend that such programs be required to include evaluation
components to validate their effectiveness. </p>

<p>Increasing the ability of IDUs to obtain and possess sterile
needles and syringes should decrease HIV transmission for those
who will not or cannot stop injecting drugs. Therefore, we also
recommend that States consider the repeal of laws requiring a
physician's prescription to buy needles and syringes and the
removal of criminal penalities[sic] for the possession of needles
and syringes, while maintaining the criminal penalties on other
drug use equipment. Additional evaluation of these interventions
is crucial. </p>

<p>3. BACKGROUND </p>

<p>The substantial role of injection drug use in the HIV/AIDS
epidemic </p>

<p>One-third of reported U.S. AIDS cases are related directly or
indirectly to injection drug use[1]. A disproportionate number of
AIDS cases among people of color in the United States is related
to infection drug use. In 1992, almost half of all AIDS cases
reported among African Americans (49 percent) and Hispanics (48
percent) were directly or indirectly related to injection drug
use. </p>

<p>The majority of reported AIDS cases among women and children
in the United States are related to injection drug use. Among
adult and adolescent women reported with AIDS in this country,
nearly three-quarters (71 percent) were directly or indirectly
related to injection drug use; 50 percent of women with AIDS
reported injecting drugs and an additional 21 percent reported
sexual contact with a male who injected drugs. Two-thirds (66
percent) of children with perinatally acquired AIDS had mothers
who reported injecting drugs themselves and/or having sex with an
IDU. </p>

<p>Preventing HIV/AIDS associated with injection drug use </p>

<p>Use of drug injection equipment (especially needles and
syringes) by more than one person (often called
&quot;sharing&quot; or &quot;multiperson use&quot;) is the
primary mechanism for the spread of HIV related to injection drug
use. Sexual transmission among IDUs also occurs. Several cultural
and social factors are associated with the multiperson use of
needles and syringes and other injection equipment. However,
legal restrictions on the purchasing and possession of needles
and syringes by IDUs are central factors in the multiperson use
of needles and syringes. IDUs' access to and legal ability to
possess sterile needles and syringes are limited by a variety of
State and Federal laws, including (1) prescription laws[2], (2)
drug paraphernalia laws[3], and (3) the </p>

<p>[1]AIDS cases associated with injection drug use include AIDS
cases among a) heterosexual men and all women who report
injecting drugs, b) men who have sex with men who also inject
drugs, c) men and women who do not inject drugs but have
heterosexual relations with drug injectors, and d) newborn
children whose mothers inject drugs or have sex with male drug
injectors. </p>

<p>[2]A State law that requires a physician's prescription as a
condition for sale of needles and syringes in pharmacies (in 10
States and the District of Columbia}. </p>

<p>Federal Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control Act[4]. In
States without prescription laws, the selective refusal of some
pharmacists to sell needles and syringes to persons who might be
IDUs is an additional barrier. </p>

<p>In its July 1991 report on &quot;The Twin Epidemics of
Substance Use and HIV, n the National Commission on AIDS
recommended: &quot;Remove legal barriers to the purchase and
possession of injection equipment. Such legal barriers... limit
the availability of new/clean injection equipment and therefore
encourage the sharing of injection equipment, and the increase in
HIV transmission. </p>

<p>Prevention and treatment for drug dependency and addiction are
important HIV prevention strategies. However, only 10 to 20
percent of all drug users are in drug treatment programs at any
given time. Drug treatment capacity is not expected to increase
substantially in the near future, and the capacity will remain
smaller than that required to provide drug treatment for all who
need it and are willing to start. In addition, a substantial
proportion of IDUs are unable or unwilling to stop injecting
drugs and start drug treatment. </p>

<p>Outreach programs are another component of HIV prevention for
IDUs. In addition to providing condoms and advising drug users to
start drug treatment and to decrease drug use, since the
mid-1980s, outreach workers have advocated the use of household
bleach to disinfect drug-injection equipment (particularly
needles and syringes). In April 1993, the CDC, the Center for
Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) of SAMHSA, and the National
Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) of NIH issued an HIV Prevention
Bulletin describing the limitations of bleach disinfection of
needles and syringes and indicating that (1) sterile, never-used
needles-and syringes are-safer than bleach-disinfected,
previously used needles and syringes and (2) bleach disinfection
is useful only when there is no other safer option. In this
statement, Public Health Service (PHS) agencies clearly pointed
out the limitations of one of the few HIV risk-reduction
interventions for IDUs who share needles and syringes. </p>

<p>[3]A State (or local) law that places criminal penalties on
the possession and distribution of needles and syringes and other
equipment used in the consumption or manufacture of drugs (in 46
States and the District of Columbia. </p>

<p>[4]The Act includes needles and syringes in the list of drug
paraphernalia that cannot be transported by the U.S. Postal
Service or any other means of interstate conveyance. </p>

<p>4. LEGAL RESTRICTIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDING OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE
PROGRAMS IS THE UNITED STATES </p>

<p>Congress has included provisions in at least six laws
restricting the use of Federal funds for NEPs. For example, the
FY 1994 Appropriations Act for the Department states that
&quot;no funds appropriated under this Act shall be used to carry
out any program of distribution of sterile needles for hypodermic
injection of any illegal drug, unless the Surgeon General of the
United States determines that such programs are effective in
preventing the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use of
illegal drugs, except that such funds may be used for such
purposes in furtherance of demonstrations or studies authorized
in the ADAMHA Reorganization Act (Public Law 102-321).&quot; </p>

<p>5. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPORT (&quot;THE PUBLIC
HEALTH IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES
AND ABROAD&quot;) </p>

<p>This project was carried out by a team of researchers at the
School of Public Health of the University of California,
Berkeley, and the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the
University of-California, San Francisco. The study began in April
1992 and was supported by funds from the CDC through a
cooperative agreement with the Association of Schools of Public
Health. </p>

<p>The project staff gathered nearly 2,000 &quot;data
sources,&quot; including journal articles (475), conference
abstracts (381), reports (236), and unpublished materials (159).
Between May and September 1992, the team carried out site visits
to 15 cities (10 in the United States, -3-in Canada, and 2 in
Europe). During these site visits, structured observations of 33
needle exchange sessions were made. In addition, 110 key
informants (including NEP staff, public health officials, and
community leaders supporting and opposing the NEP) were
interviewed, and 18 focus groups of clients and non-clients of
the-NEPs (12-9 IDUs ~ participated in the focus groups or
individual interviews) were held by the UC project staff. UC
project staff obtained extensive information on the budgets of
the NEPs visited. To obtain a more complete picture of the NEPs
in the United States, the project staff conducted a postal survey
of 20 NEPs not visited. </p>

<p>The major findings of the UC study are presented in a Summary,
Conclusion, and Recommendations document (43 pages). The detailed
analysis and findings of the UC study are presented in Volume One
(519 pages). Volume Two, a city-by-city description of NEP
activities and related information from the site visits to nine
U.S. and three Canadian cities, will be available in late
December 1993. </p>

<p>Drafts of all chapters of the UC report were reviewed by a
distinguished panel of expert reviewers representing a range of
opinions on needle exchange (Dr. Mindy Fullilove, Dr. Don Des
Jarlais, Dr. Ed Kaplan, Dr. Herbert Kleber, Dr. Douglas Owens,
Dr. Beny Primm, and Ms. Beth Weinstein). </p>

<p>The UC teas used stringent scientific standards in its
analysis and interpretation of the collected published and
unpublished studies on NEPs and needle and syringe availability.
The UC report is the most extensive and comprehensive study of
needle exchange ever published. </p>

<p>6. NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA </p>

<p>The information in this section on NEPs in the United States
and Canada is derived from the UC report. </p>

<p>The first NEP to provide comprehensive services in the United
States opened in 1988 in Tacoma, Washington. As of September 1,
1993, there were at least 37 NEPs operating in 30 cities in 12
States. By June 1993, more than 5.4 million syringes had been
distributed (almost always in exchange for used syringes) by NEPs
in the United States. In calendar year 1992, U.S. NEPs
distributed more than 2.4 million syringes. </p>

<p>Needle exchange has provoked intense political debate at the
national level and in some States (e.g., California, New York)
and cities (e.g., Baltimore, New York City, Boston, Berkeley).
Nonetheless, in many cities (e.g., Seattle, Tacoma, San
Francisco, Honolulu,- New Haven), large-scale NEPs have been
established with substantial community support. In New York City,
after years of intense political debate, five NEPs were legally
opened in 1992 and now distribute about one million syringes a
year. The UC team collected U.S. public opinion polls that-at-
included questions regarding needle availability needle cleaning.
These public opinion polls indicate that approximately half of
the general public has supported harm reduction efforts,
including needle cleaning, legalization of needles sales, needle
exchange, and needle distribution. While this public support has
tended to increase over time and has been somewhat higher for
needle exchange than for needle distribution, needle exchange
remains a controversial issue. </p>

<p>Substantial variations exist among U.S. NEPs in legal status,
administrative structure, and sources of funding. Nineteen U.S.
NEPs are &quot;legal,&quot;[5] eight are
&quot;illegal-tolerated,&quot;[6] and six are
&quot;illegal-underground.&quot;[7] Six U.S. NEPs are
administered by State or local governments, six by
community-based organizations (CBOs with government sponsorship,
eight by CBOs without government sponsorship, and thirteen by
what the UC report called &quot;activist&quot; organizations.
Private donations are a major source of funding at 19 U.S. NEPs,
more than any other source of funding. Fourteen NEPs are
financially supported by foundation grants, 12 by funds from a
CBO and/or activist organization administering the NEP, 12 by
city or county government, and 4 by State governments. Fifteen
U.S. NEPs depend entirely on volunteer staff, and all but seven
NEPs use volunteers. Twenty-seven of 33 U.S. NEPs surveyed or
visited have &quot;one-for-one rules&quot; (one sterile syringe
is given out for each syringe turned in). Seventeen NEPs provide
'starter needles&quot; (one or more [usually three] syringes
provided to new NEP clients without requiring turn-in of used
syringes). Ten NEPs have limits on the number of syringes that
can be exchanged. Rules governing the exchange procedures are
generally well enforced. </p>

<p>U.S. NEPs serve ethnically diverse IDU populations that
generally reflect local ethnic and racial patterns. The mean age
of U.S. NEP clients ranges from 33-41 years with a mean duration
of drug injection ranging from 7-20 years. NEPs successfully
reach IDUs who are not enrolled in drug treatment, with studies
in the United States reporting one-third to one-half of NEP
clients having no prior exposure to drug treatment. NEP clients
are at significant risk for drug-related HIV transmission with 10
to 60 percent reporting some needle sharing and about one-third
reported sharing needles in the month preceding interview. </p>

<p>U.S. NEPs are reaching thousands of IDUs in the 30 cities in
which they operate. In addition to needle exchange, a variety of
public health services are provided on site or are available by
referral, including drug treatment, HIV counseling and testing,
primary medical care, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted
disease screening and treatment, and social services. The UC team
found that among NEPs visited with data on these activities, six
NEPs had referred more than 2,000 drug users to drug treatment
and that more than 800 drug users had started drug treatment
after referral by four NEPs. </p>

<p>[5]An NEP in a State that does not have a prescription law or
an NEP that has a specific exemption to the prescription law. </p>

<p>[6]In a state with a prescription law, an NEP which a locally
elected body (e.g., city council) has voted to support or
approve. </p>

<p>[7]In a State with a prescription law, an illegal-underground
NEP which has not been supported by a locally elected body. </p>

<p>The median annual budget of U.S. and Canadian needle exchange
programs visited is relatively low at 5169,000, with government
run programs tending to have larger budgets. Some NEPs are more
expensive because they also provide substantial additional
services such as drug treatment referrals. </p>

<p>The UC team extensively reviewed the previously published
mathematical models that estimated the impact of NEPs on HIV
transmission, and developed additional models of the
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NEPs in the United
States. These efforts, in agreement with other independent
reviews (e.g., the General Accounting Office [GAO] review),
confirmed the theoretical and technical validity of the model
used to estimate the impact of the New Haven NEP. Applied to
other cities, a simplified version of this model predicted
reductions ranging from 17 to 70 percent in new drug-related HIV
infections among NEP clients. In one of the cities, the estimated
cost-per-HIV-infection-averted by NEPs was between S3,700 and
$12,000. These estimated costs of preventing an HIV infection
compare very favorably with the costs of other lifesaving
programs and are much less than the present value of the lifetime
costs of medical care for a person with HIV infection ($119,000)
. </p>

<p>The UC report also reviews the development of NEPs in Canada,
where the federal government provided leadership and initial
funding (requiring provincial matching funds) for HIV prevention
programs for drug users, including NEPs. In Canada all NEPs are
legal, and there has been very limited community or professional
opposition to the NEPs. Since the first Canadian NEPs were opened
in 1989, the number of cities with active NEPs has steadily
increased to a total of 28 cities in early 1993. More than 2.5
million syringes were distributed through December 1992 by the
five Canadian NEPs visited by the UC team. </p>

<p>7. IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS ON DRUG USE </p>

<p>Accurate measurement of drug use patterns and numbers of drug
users in communities is technically very challenging, in part
because drug use is-an illegal activity. Therefore-, it is
extremely difficult to quantitatively assess the impact of NEPs
on community drug use. </p>

<p>The UC report provides data on both the behavior of NEP
clients and community measures of drug use. The UC report clearly
documents that substantial numbers of IDUs (both clients and
non-clients of the NEP) have been referred to drug treatment
programs, a substantial step in reducing drug use by those
individuals and in the community. The UC report presents the
results of 26 evaluations in the United States and abroad that
provide information on changes in drug-risk behavior among IDUs
who were using NEPs; 16 of the 26 were judged to be of acceptable
scientific quality. Although not definitive, the majority of
these studies found that drug-related risk behaviors for HIV
transmission were significantly reduced among NEP clients. </p>

<p>In addition, the UC team reviewed national drug use indicators
and the findings of IDU focus groups. The limited data for U.S.
cities with NEPs from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), Drug
Use Forecasting (DUF) system, and Uniform Crime Reports do not
show clear trends in patterns of drug use in those cities with
NEPs. The IDU focus groups conducted in cities with NEPs
consistently indicated that the participants believed that NEPs
would have little effect on drug use in the community. </p>

<p>We agree with the UC team conclusion that available data are
quite limited but provide no evidence of any NEP-related
increases in community levels of drug use. However, the
limitations of both available research methods and existing data
addressing this issue underline the need for continuing
evaluation and research on the impact of NEPs on drug use.
Additional evaluation and research and the development of new
research methods in this area should be a component of Federally
supported NEPs. </p>

<p>A key concern of NEP opponents is that these programs will
directly or indirectly increase drug use. Opponents view NEPs as
directly increasing drug use by providing the means (needles and
syringes) to inject drugs. They also see NEPs as indirectly
promoting drug use by appearing to condone and facilitate drug
use and thereby undermining the credibility of society's message
that using drugs is illegal, unhealthy and morally wrong.
However, no study in the United States or abroad was found that
showed that NEPs increase community drug use. </p>

<p>8. IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS ON PREVENTING HIV
INFECTION </p>

<p>A major question in the policy debate over NEPs is their
effectiveness in preventing-HIV infection among IDU-s-and-their
contacts. Several findings strongly support the conclusion that
NEPs reduce HIV transmission. First, the process of needle
exchange removes used, often HIV-contaminated, needles and
syringes from the hands of IDUs and replaces them with sterile
needles and syringes. Second, NEPs are often effective in
referring NEP client and non-client IDUs to drug treatment
programs. Third, NEP clients report decreases in their HIV drug
risk behaviors. Fourth, mathematical models of the impact of NEPs
in New Haven and other cities consistently estimate substantial
reductions (ranging from 17 to 70 percent) in HIV transmission
for the IDUs using NEPs and their sex partners and children.
Fifth, there is some evidence that hepatitis B infection is
reduced by NEPs. On the other hand, epidemiologic studies which
directly address HIV prevalence and incidence in relation to NEPs
have been methodologically weak. One case-control study (in
Amsterdam) found no protective effect of the NEP on HIV
seroconversion among IDUs. However, the Amsterdam study was not
primarily designed to test NEP effectiveness and included only a
limited number (31) of new HIV infections. We concur with the UC
conclusion that the relationship between NEPs and HIV infection
may be very difficult to determine conclusively. </p>

<p>9. REVIEW OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RECOMMENDATIONS </p>

<p>In this section, the recommendations of the UC study are
reviewed. </p>

<p>&quot;Recommendations for the federal government </p>

<p>The federal government should repeal the ban on the use of
federal funds for needle exchange services. </p>

<p>Substantial federal funds should be committed both to
providing needle exchange services and to expanding research into
these programs. </p>

<p>CDC comment: </p>

<p>Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate with the
minor modifications indicated in this section. </p>

<p>Given the significance of injection drug use in HIV
transmission in the United States, it is important to implement
NEPs as one possible component of comprehensive HIV prevention
programs for drug users. Comprehensive programs should include
increases in drug treatment, street and community outreach to
drug users, and effective school and community-based programs to
prevent initiation of drug use. The ban on Federal funding of
NEP-s should be removed-to allow States-and-communities the
option of including NEPs in comprehensive programs. NEPs will be
more readily integrated into comprehensive programs when there is
evidence of substantial local support for NEPs as indicated by
any of the following: requests for an NEP from a State or local
HIV community planning process; substantial funding for NEPs from
local and/or State government or nongovernmental organizations;
and efforts to reform the laws limiting the sale or possession of
needles and syringes. </p>

<p>The PHS should fund additional evaluations of NEPs[8] to
gather more data on the impact of these programs and to assess
the relative effectiveness of various models of delivery of NEP
services. Additional research is needed on the initiation of drug
use and drug injection and changes in community drug use,
particularly in communities with high prevalence of drug use, as
they relate to NEPs and other interventions that increase the
availability of sterile needles and syringes. PHS agencies
supporting research on NEPs should develop and promote the use of
standardized data elements, methods of data collection, and
protocols for evaluation and analysis. </p>

<p>State governments in the ten states and the District of
Columbia that have prescription laws should repeal these laws. </p>

<p>- States should repeal the paraphernalia laws as they apply to
syringes. </p>

<p>CDC comment: </p>

<p>Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate with the
modifications indicated in this section. </p>

<p>Although the major focus of the UC report was NEPs, there is
ample evidence of the importance of allowing access to sterile
needles and syringes for drug users who will not or cannot stop
injecting drugs. In the United States and other countries,
difficulty in obtaining and/or possessing needles and syringes
contributes to multiperson use of needles and syringes and
thereby to HIV transmission. NEPs can provide only a part of the
increased access to needles and syringes that is needed to
prevent HIV infection in IDUs, their sex partners and children.
Changing the prescription and paraphernalia laws would increase
IDU access to sterile needles and syringes with little or no
expenditure of public funds. </p>

<p>An ongoing CDC and Connecticut evaluation of 1992 changes in
the prescription and drug paraphernalia laws in Connecticut[9]
provides convincing evidence of the potential benefit of these
recommendations. The evaluation found (1) steady increases of
&quot;non-prescription&quot; purchases of needles and syringes
from pharmacies, (2) that IDUs reported their primary source of
needles and syringes shifted from street/black-market purchases
to pharmacy purchases and (3) that sharing (&quot;multiperson
use&quot;) of needles and syringes decreased from 52 percent
prior to the new laws to 32 percent 8 to 12 months after the new
laws were implemented. Similar increases in pharmacy purchases
and decreases in sharing of needles and syringes were found in
France after a prescription law was repealed in 1987. </p>

<p>[9]In 1992, Connecticut removed all criminal penalties for (a)
the sale, without a prescription, of up to 10 needles and
syringes and (b) the possession of up to 10 needles and syringes.
</p>

<p>The implementation of these recommendations is primarily the
responsibility of State governments. We recommend that the
Federal government and others support strong evaluation studies
of the impact of changes in these laws on drug use patterns and
HIV transmission risk behaviors. The use of standardized research
methods yielding comparable results should be encouraged. </p>

<p>&quot;Recommendations for local governments and communities </p>

<p>Local governments should enter into discussions with local
community groups to develop a comprehensive approach to
preventing HIV in injection drug users. their sex partners. and
their offspring. This approach should include needle exchange
programs and the expansion of drug treatment services. </p>

<p>Local communities should seek to further increase sterile
syringe availability by encouraging the sale, distribution. or
exchange of syringes by pharmacists.&quot; </p>

<p>CDC comment: </p>

<p>Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate. </p>

<p>The experience with implementing NEPs in the United States and
other countries indicates that NEPs are better accepted and
operate more efficiently when there is extensive community
involvement in planning how the NEP services will be provided.
NEPs should be components of comprehensive, multifaceted HIV
prevention programs for IDUs. </p>

<p>Pharmacy sale of sterile needles and syringes is-an--important
component in increasing the availability of sterile injection
equipment to IDUs. Retail pharmacies could provide widespread
access to sterile needles and syringes, especially in areas where
NEPs would be impractical (e.g., rural areas). Pharmacists are
important &quot;gate keepers&quot; for the availability of
sterile needles and syringes. Many pharmacists will need training
to realize the importance of their public health role in helping
ensure the availability of sterile needles and syringes to IDUs. </p>

<p>10 . INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF STERILE NEEDLES AND
SYRINGES </p>

<p>CDC believes that increasing the availability of sterile
needles and syringes is appropriate Federal policy for the
following reasons: </p>

<p>(1) HIV transmission associated with injection drug use is a
major contributor to the growth of the current AIDS epidemic in
the United States. Injection-related HIV transmission has caused
increases in the number of AIDS cases among women and children,
in heterosexually acquired HIV infections and in cases of
tuberculosis. </p>

<p>(2) Restrictions on access to and the possession of needles
and syringes increase the multiperson use (&quot;sharing&quot;)
of drug injection equipment that transmits HIV. </p>

<p>(3) A recent bulletin from the CDC, NIDA, and CSAT indicates
that bleach disinfection of used drug injection equipment is not
as safe as using sterile needles and syringes. Such disinfection
is recommended only when sterile needles and syringes are not
available. </p>

<p>(4) Evaluation of NEPs in the United States and other
countries indicates that these programs can provide services to
large numbers of IDUs, remove millions of used needles and
syringes from circulation, and increase access to drug treatment
and other high priority public health services. </p>

<p>(5) The preponderance of evidence indicates that NEPs diminish
HIV transmission without increasing drug use. </p>

<p>(6) Evaluation of changes in the prescription and drug
paraphernalia laws in Connecticut indicates that drug users
change their usual source of needles and syringes from street and
&quot;black market&quot; purchases to purchases -from pharmacies
and substantially decrease sharing of injection equipment. </p>

<p>We recommend that the PHS adopt a policy goal of increasing
the availability of sterile needles and syringes for IDUs. This
specific HIV prevention strategy would be one component of
comprehensive, multifaceted HIV prevention programs for IDUs. The
following activities should be considered to implement this
policy: </p>

<p>Allow Federal funding of NEPs, especially when these NEPs
would also provide their clients with access to HIV counseling
and other priority public health programs (e.g., drug treatment
and tuberculosis screening and treatment). Programs that receive
Federal funding should have substantial evaluation and/or
research components, either as part of the project or as a
separately funded activity. </p>

<p>Continue funding for research and evaluation studies of the
impact of NEPs on HIV risk behaviors and HIV infection. </p>

<p>(1) the repeal of State laws requiring a physician's
prescription for the purchase of sterile needles and syringes,
(2) the repeal of State and municipal laws and regulations making
the possession of needles and syringes a crime, and 3) the
removal of needles and syringes from the list of materials
covered by the Federal Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control Act.
Evaluations of the impact of these changes should be funded </p>

<p>Work with the professional associations of pharmacists and
pharmacies to develop policies that increase the pharmacy-based
availability of sterile needles and syringes. </p>

<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </p>

<p>THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPORT (THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT
OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS </p>

<p>How and Why did Needle Exchange Programs Develop? </p>

<p>Needle exchange programs have continued to increase in number
in the U.S. and by September 1, 1993 at least 37 active programs
exist. The evolution of needle exchange programs in the U.S. has
been characterized by growing efforts to accommodate the concerns
of local communities. increasing likelihood of being legal,
growing institutionalization, and increasing federal funding of
research, although a ban on federal funding for program services
remains in effect. </p>

<p>How do Needle Exchange Programs Operate? </p>

<p>About one-half of U.S. needle exchange programs are legal, but
funding is often unstable and most programs rely on volunteer
services to operate. All but six U.S. needle exchange programs
require one-for-one exchanges and rules governing the) exchange
of syringes are generally well enforced. In addition to having
distributed over 5.4 million syringes, U.S. needle exchange
programs provide a variety of services ranging from condom and
bleach distribution to drug treatment referrals. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Act as Bridges to Public Health
Services? </p>

<p>Some needle exchange programs have made significant numbers of
referrals to drug abuse treatment and other public health
services, but referrals are limited by the paucity of drug
treatment slots. Integrating needle exchange programs into the
existing public health system is a likely future direction for
these programs. </p>

<p>How Much Does It Cost to Operate Needle Exchange Programs? </p>

<p>The median annual budget of U.S. and Canadian needle exchange
programs visited is relatively low at $169,000, with
government-run programs tending to be more expensive. Some needle
exchange programs are more expensive because they also provide
substantial non-exchange services such as drug treatment
referrals. The annual cost of funding an average needle exchange
program would support about 60 methadone maintenance slots for
one year. </p>

<p>Who Are the IDUs who Use Needle Exchange Programs? </p>

<p>Although needle exchange program clients vary from location to
location, the programs generally reach a group of injection drug
users with long histories of drug injection who remain at
significant risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection. Needle exchange program clients in the U.S. have had
less exposure to drug abuse treatment than IDUs not using the
programs. </p>

<p>What Proportion of All Injection Drug Users in a Community
Uses the Needle Exchange Program? </p>

<p>Studies of adequately-funded needle exchange programs suggest
that the programs do have the potential to serve significant
proportions of the local injecting drug user population. While
some needle exchange programs appear to have reached large
proportions of local drug injectors at least once, others are
reaching only a small fraction of them. Consequently other
methods of increasing sterile needle availability must be
explored. </p>

<p>What Are the Community Responses to Needle Exchange Programs? </p>

<p>Unlike in many foreign countries, including Canada, proposals
to establish needle exchange programs in the U.S. have often
encountered strong opposition from a variety of different
communities. Consultation with affected communities can address
many of the concerns raised. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Result in Changes in Community
Levels of Drug Use? </p>

<p>Although quantitative data are difficult to-obtain, those
available provide no evidence that--needle exchange programs
increase the amount of drug use by needle exchange program
clients or change overall community levels of non injection and
injection drug use. This conclusion is supported by interviews
with needle exchange program clients and by injecting drug users
not using the programs who did not believe that increased needle
availability would increase drug use. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect the Number of Discarded
Syringes? </p>

<p>Needle exchange programs in the U.S. have not been shown to
increase the total number of discarded syringes and can be
expected to result in fewer discarded syringes. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect Rates of HIV drug and/or
Sex Risk Behaviors? </p>

<p>The majority of studies of needle exchange program clients
demonstrate decreased ratios of HIV drug risk behavior, but not
decreased ratios of HIV sex risk behavior. </p>

<p>What is the Role of Studies of Syringes in injection Drug Use
Research? </p>

<p>The limitations of using the testing of syringes-as a measure
of injecting drug users' behavior or behavior change can be
minimized by following syringe characteristics over time,. or by
comparing characteristics of syringes returned by needle exchange
program clients with those obtained from non-clients of the
program. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect Rates of Diseases Related
to Injection Drug Use Other than HIV? </p>

<p>Studies of the effect of needle exchange programs on
injection-related infectious diseases other than HIV provide
limited evidence that needle exchange programs are associated
with reductions in subcutaneous abscesses and hepatitis B among
injecting drug users. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect HIV Infection Rates? </p>

<p>Studies of the effect of needle exchange programs on HIV
infection rates do not and, in part due to the need for large
sample sizes and the multiple impediments to randomization,
probably cannot provide clear evidence that needle exchange
programs decrease HIV infection rates. However, needle exchange
programs do not appear to be associated with increased rates of
HIV infection. </p>

<p>Are Needle Exchange Programs Cost-effective in Preventing HIV
Infection? </p>

<p>Multiple mathematical models of needle exchange program impact
support the findings of the New Haven Model. These models suggest
that needle exchange programs can prevent significant numbers of
infections among clients of the programs, their drug an sex
partners, and their children. In almost ail cases, the cost per
HIV infection averted is far below the $119,000 lifetime cost of
treating an HIV-infected person. </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATIONS </p>

<p>Recommendations for the federal government </p>

<p>The federal government should repeal the ban on the use of
federal funds for needle exchange services. </p>

<p>Substantial federal funds should be committed both to
providing needle exchange services and to expanding research into
these programs. </p>

<p>Recommendations for state governments </p>

<p>State governments in the ten states and the District of
Columbia that have prescription laws should repeal these laws.[1]
</p>

<p>States should repeal the paraphernalia laws as they apply to
syringes.[2] </p>

<p>Recommendations for local governments and communities </p>

<p>Local governments should enter into discussions with local
community groups to develop a comprehensive approach to
preventing HIV in injecting drug users, their sex partners, and
their offspring. This approach should include needle exchange
programs and the expansion of drug treatment services </p>

<p>Local communities should seek to further increase sterile
syringe availability by encouraging the sale, distribution, or
exchange of syringes by pharmacists. </p>

<p>Recommendations for researchers </p>

<p>Descriptions of the &quot;kinetics&quot; and determinants of
needle use patterns: injection drug users sources of needles.
methods of disposal of needles, frequency of needle re-use, and
needle-sharing patterns. How do these change when a needle
exchange program or other changes in needle availability are
implemented? </p>

<p>Evaluations of &quot;natural experiments&quot; in which needle
availability laws </p>

<p>pharmacy based syringe sale, distribution, or exchange and to
identify the barriers to their participation. </p>

<p>Assessments of the effects of design features of needle
exchange programs (e.g., administering bodies, site
characteristics, opening hours, and program rules} upon process
measures of needle exchange programs (e.g., needles distributed,
drug treatment referrals discarding of needles). </p>

<p>Ethnographic and other qualitative research to assess the
factors involved in drug use initiation and in transitions
between various routes of drug use. </p>

<p>Case-control studies of the relationship between use of the
needle exchange program and acute hepatitis 8, particularly in
cities with active surveillance for the infection. </p>

<p>Large, multi-center case-control studies within existing
cohorts of injecting drug users to assess whether use of the
needle exchange program is associated with hepatitis B or HIV
seroconversion </p>

<p>Mathematical modeling using program data and behavior change
evaluations to determine which aspects of program design
determine effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. </p>

<p>[1]Prescription laws preclude the purchase of a syringe
without a prescription. limiting sterile syringe availability and
creating a risk of arrest for needle exchange program staff and
clients. </p>

<p>[2]Paraphernalia laws exist in 46 states and the District of
Columbia and preclude the possession or distribution or syringes
except for legitimate medical purposes. Conviction under a
paraphernalia law is a felony or a misdemeanor </p>

<p>Subject: Comments on the CDC's Draft Response on Needle
Exchange </p>

<p>We have reviewed the draft CDC response to the Office of the
Assistant Secretary for Health and the Surgeon General regarding
the University of California report on needle exchange. In
addition to the comments provided in our earlier review of the
report (included as Tab B in the CDC draft response), we provide
the following comments that are specific to the draft CDC
response letter: </p>

<p>1. Agency Position Issue </p>

<p>Page 1: The second paragraph implies that the NIH, along with
SAMHSA, HRSA, and the FDA, has provided &quot;recommendation for
needle exchange.&quot; This is either inaccurate or misleading.
We suggest that the wording &quot;And recommendations for needle
exchange&quot; be dropped from the sentence. </p>

<p>2. Research </p>

<p>The CDC draft response appropriately includes an emphasis on
the need for increasing research and evaluation of needle
exchange programs (NEPs) and other related aspects of HIV and
drug abuse. </p>

<p>However, in light of the reported gaps in information
concerning the efficacy and impact of needle exchange programs,
requiring evaluation to be an integral component of any federally
funded NEP becomes critical if we are to take an iterative
approach to this issue. </p>

<p>The following text changes are recommended: </p>

<p>Page 2: In the last sentence of the second paragraph the word
&quot;include&quot; should be change (sic) to
&quot;require&quot;; </p>

<p>Page 11: The first sentence of the last paragraph should be
&quot;The PHS should require substantial evaluation be part of
any federally funded NEP so as to continue to gather more data on
the impact...&quot;; and, </p>

<p>Page 15: The last sentence of the first paragraph should be
changed to read, &quot;Programs that receive Federal funding
should be required to have substantial evaluation and/or research
components, either as part of the project or as a separately
funded activity.&quot; </p>

<p>3. Agency Designation </p>

<p>Page 4: The fourth paragraph lists the CDC, CSAT and NIDA as
co-sponsors of a bleach use guidance. For parity , all agencies
should be designated. This could be achieved by indicating
CSAT/SAMHSA and NIDA/NIH, or by stating, &quot; The National
Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of
Health,...&quot; </p>

<p>Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions of
need further information. </p>

<p>SUBJECT: NIH comments on- the University of California Report,
</p>

<p>&quot; Public Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the
United States and Abroad. &quot; </p>

<p>We have reviewed the report, &quot;The Public Health Impact of
Needle Exchange Programs in the United states and Abroad, &quot;
from a research perspective, We have provided several points for
your consideration in your response on needle exchange to the
Assistant Secretary for Health: </p>

<p>1. This report is a good initial analysis of this issue and
serves as a useful starting point for further examination; </p>

<p>2. Utilizing needle/syringe exchange (NSE) programs as an HIV
prevention strategy is a complex issue. The current state of the
science with respect to this issue is neither complete nor
comprehensive, .requiring further study on this, as well as,
alternative behavioral interventions; </p>

<p>2. There are a number of significant issues and problems with
respect to needle exchange program that the data available to the
University of California have not addressed (see attached
analysis); </p>

<p>3. The report appropriately suggests a substantial federal
commitment to research in this area. Such support should include,
but should not be limited to, .funding for: 1) building
substantiai evaluation and/or research components into existing
NSEs; 2) research demonstration projects that address NSE
program: design issues; 3. research on other forms of
need~e/syringe distribution (e.g., pharmacy or vending machinP
strategies); and, 4) research on the relationships and impact of
NSEs on other prevention strategies (e.g., bleach use) and other
non-injecting at-risk populations (e.g., non-injecting drug users
who trade sex or money for drugs). In addition, until more is
definitively known and has been time tested, any NSE service
programs funded should have appropriate research and/or
evaluation components built into them as a prerequisite for
Federal funding. </p>

<p>For a more detailed analysis of the specific research issues
and questions that remain unanswered by the report, we have
attached comments on the report provided by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse. </p>

<p>Topic: Comments on University of California Report, &quot; The
Public Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United
States and Abroad&quot; </p>

<p>In general, medical/public health interventions, like
medications, may be evaluated within a framework that examines
safety, efficacy, side effects, deleterious effects and both
positive and negative interactions with other treatments or
conditions. With respect to any of the effects, questions include
what subpopulations are likely to experience the effect and how
long it is likely to last, including recommendations with respect
to the length of treatment. In fact, to the degree to which this
Report provides the equivalent of a section of the Physician's
Desk Reference(PDR) devoted to needle/syringe exchange (NSE) it
will be helpful all who are concerned with the implications of
NSEs. </p>

<p>Viewing this Report in the aforementioned framework it becomes
clear that with respect to overall &quot;effects&quot; NSE is
associated in the aggregate with reductions in self reports of
needle-related HIV risk behavior. </p>

<p>However, a major problem with the existing data examined by
the Report is the lack of sensitivity of the data to detection of
adverse effects of NSE on individuals or subpopulations and
interaction with, for example, the various modalities of drug
abuse treatment. There is no equivalent of studies that search
for individuals who purport to have experienced &quot;adverse
reactions&quot; or negative consequences or interactions that may
be attributable to participation in NSE. It is questionable
whether in the context of medications development the Federal
Government would approve and/or provide funds for a medication
for which this type of data were not available. </p>

<p>In the spirit of seeking the information that would be needed
for a complete PDR section on needle/syringe exchange, we will
review some concerns about the potential adverse impact and
interactions of NSE. </p>

<p>One major concern of critics of NSEs as an AIDS intervention
effort is the degree to which the availability of sterile
needles/syringes would server to promote drug use. While the
needle exchange studies reported from around the world from the
last two world AIDS conferences do not, and perhaps cannot, prove
that the presence and/or use of a needle exchange does not
increase drug use, there have been no reports that confirm such
an increase. However, there are a number of direct and indirect
ways in which drug use maybe promoted for individuals and
subpopulations that have not been addressed by existing data. For
example, one wonders what happens to the drug use of individuals
who seek drug treatment through an NSE and are told that there is
no slot available for them. </p>

<p>Analogous to that for needle/syringe exchange, the criticism
of the potential for increasing injection drug use was raised for
bleach distribution. This particular criticism (although not all
criticisms) with respect to bleach was, in the aggregate and
within limits, refuted by the results of the National AIDS
Demonstration Research data which is consistent with the model
that when contact is established with drug users, trust is build,
information is imparted and risky behavior is reduced, despite
the fact that safe needle use is also being assisted at the same
time(XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX). Nonetheless, the demonstration of
beneficial effects does not preclude the simultaneous existence
of deleterious effects. </p>

<p>NSEs may not be uniformly effective in acting as a bridge to
other public health services, depending on such factors as to
what degree the services are &quot;on-site&quot; versus
&quot;remote&quot; as well as &quot;immediately available&quot;
versus &quot;requiring waiting&quot;. Studies of the service
linkage process suggest that higher rates of successful
engagement with other services will be attained for those
services that are on-site and immediately available. It would be
useful to attempt to characterize users and non-users of
additional services and to delineate those factors that affect
these decisions. </p>

<p>Inconsistent of infrequent users of the NSEs may remain and be
stabilized at high risk behavior levels. With respect to the
inconsistent or infrequent users of the NSEs, it will be
important to determine the factors influencing periods of use
versus non-user. More over, looking at NSEs as an
&quot;innovation&quot; with respect to injection drug user, the
literature of models of [LINE LOST IN COPYING - Ed.] middle and
late adopters of NSEs may be useful in terms of delineating
populations with distinct patterns of motivations, risk factors
and responses to the NSEs. </p>

<p>Change or lack of change in the micro-structure, i.e.,
details, of behaviors associated with drug use may negate
beneficial effects of NSEs. In looking at drug risk behaviors, it
is important to attempt to assess whether NSEs affect rate of
sharing of cookers, cotton, water, etc. as well as such practices
as frontloading, backloading and booting. With respect to drug
risk behaviors it is thus important to examine NSE effects on
behavioral norms of (1) non-NSE-users and (2) drug using
non-injectors as well as (3) NSE users. </p>

<p>NSE users may sell paraphernalia or exchange it for drugs or
sex. In fact, the possibility should be examined that
non-injectors may use the NSEs as a source for paraphernalia that
may used in transactions with injectors. </p>

<p>The rate at which NSE users (versus NSE non-users) initiate
new injectors and influence other IDUs to utilize or not utilize
the NSE should be examined. Moreover, questions of the influence
of the NSE on injections frequency should be examined closely.
For individuals, the availability of clean paraphernalia may
remove one brake on increasing the frequency of injection. </p>

<p>Certainly, NSE effects on the number of IDUs entering drug
treatment need to be examined. However, the fate of IDUs who have
used the NSE prior to entry into drug treatment should also be
examined. NSE participants or injections drug users whose network
includes NSE participants may relapse to needle use and/or drop
out of drug treatment at a higher rate than NSE non-users. </p>

<p>NSE effects on social network may lead to problems. Since NSEs
imply a high rate of flow of IDUs through the neighborhood
surrounding the site, there may be a tendency for dealers,
operators of shooting galleries and/or crack houses and
prostitutes to relocate to the same area. If possible, these
effects and their implications should be assessed. The potential
effects of NSEs on setting up bridges between networks of IDUs in
high and low HIV seroprevalence neighborhoods should be examined.
If NSEs serve to create such bridges they would, especially
through inconsistent seropositive users, serve as conduits to
facilitate viral spread. If data are generated on local changes
in seroprevcalence and/or seroincidence over time in areas
surrounding NSEs, (including baseline levels prior to the
establishment of the NSE and changes during the growth of the
NSE), then some of these questions may be able to be addressed.
Data pertinent to the perceived effects of participation in the
NSE on the sexual, social and drug-using networks of the
individuals would also be helpful in beginning to address these
hypotheses. </p>

<p>Additional network effects may occur or existing network
effects may be potentiated if NSE sites are located close to drug
treatment programs (methadone or drug free programs), hospitals,
psychiatric facilities, homeless shelters or other facilities
that attract concentrations of individuals who are vulnerable to
initiating drug injections, relapsing to drug use or injections,
having sex with injections users or becoming victims of crime
associated with injections users. </p>

<p>As is addressed in the Report, the surveyed NSEs varied
greatly in along many parameters including estimates of the
proportions of injection drug users reached by the program, the
amount of education offered, the degree to which injection
equipment beyond needles/syringes were distributed, emphasis on
drug treatment referrals, costs, the extent of ongoing
evaluation, acceptance by the local community, legal
acceptance/tolerance, etc. These are major program design and
feasibility that could determine differences between highly
effective programs and those with a substantial negative impact.
Support for grams without consideration of these issues would be
the equivalent of support for all treatment programs in any area
in the absence of standards and quality assurance. </p>

<p>Finally, the interrelationships between NSEs and the use of
bleach need to be examined. For example, we have evidence that
even IDUs who use bleach tend to not use it effectively. Does the
existence of needles from NSEs decrease the probability that IDUs
will even attempt to use bleach if the share? Will they feel that
the needles are at least relatively safer and thus real that
bleach use is not necessary? Does the distribution of bleach
increase the probability that IDUs will share NSE distributed
needles? Are NSEs attempting to intervene in terms of education
with respect to bleach use? </p>

<p>This, of course is not an exhaustive list of questions or
issues, but is meant to represent a set of problems whose
existence has not been addressed by the data available to the
University of California study. </p>

<p>However, even in the absence of Federal Support, NSE is a
growing part of HIV prevention efforts. This Report appropriately
suggests a substantial Federal commitment to research in this
area. With respect to the funding of services, it appears
reasonable, as the Report suggests, that the ban on funding be
lifted. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, it would appear prudent in light of the
incomplete data and the aforementioned set of concerns that no
services e funded that do not included a substantial evaluation
component with appropriate instrumentation and methodologies to
identify adverse as well as beneficial contribution of these
programs to HIV and other infectious disease transmission and
drug use patterns. Perhaps as a prelude to defining standards for
Federal funding of NSE services, there should be funding for
incorporating evaluation in existing NSEs and setting up
research/demonstrations projects that address NSE program design
issues. </p>

<p>Beyond the issue of NSEs per se, the argument is made in this
Report in favor of immediate implementation of the entire variety
of interventions that increase the availability of sterile
needles/syringes, including pharmacy sales and the abolition of
prescription and paraphernalia laws. Given the stated priority of
the objective, presumably this support would extend to other
forms of needle/syringe distribution, e.g., vending machines like
those used in Europe. </p>

<p>While the objective appears reasonable, it would be helpful if
the Report addressed more of the complexities of this issue so
that sterile needle/syringes are not viewed as a &quot;magic
bullet&quot; that obviates the need to continue work on
behavioral interventions. For example, there have been extensive
observations of &quot;secondary sharing&quot; in which addicts in
groups use frontloading and backloading to distribute
&quot;cooked&quot; drugs to their syringes. In these situation if
an addict brings his/her own syringe, but has previously used the
syringe even once and engaged in &quot;booting&quot; (drawing
blood back into the syringe and reinjecting after initial
injection to make sure that any residual drug in the syringe is
used), blood may be distributed to others' syringes. Moreover,
contaminants of &quot;cookers', &quot;cotton&quot; and
&quot;rinse water&quot; may be similarly distributed. </p>

<p>Finally, all strategies for distributing needles/syringes may
not be equivalent. For example, it is questionable whether
pharmacies will provide other forms of injections equipment, HIV
education, HIV testing and counseling, referral to drug treatment
programs, on-site medical car, etc. Similarly, these service
would presumable not be available through such distribution
sources as vending machines. </p>

<p>NOTE TO: George Lewis </p>

<p>RE Comments on Needle Exchange Study </p>

<p>As you may be aware, Beny asked me to review this report
during the early of it's preparation earlier this year. While the
final summary report does reflect many of the changes we
recommended, there are several noteworthy areas which warrant
some attention. </p>

<p>Page 4, Paragraph 4. The report indicates that, &quot;although
NEPs may make referral to drug treatment an important part of
their services, they acknowledge that many IDUs, including some
in drug treatment programs, continue to inject drugs and share
injection equipment. They therefore seek to reduce the harm
associated with these practices...&quot;. While there may be some
injecting drug users in certain treatment modalities who continue
to inject drugs, the reference here implies that this practice
has more significance than the evidence warrants. More
importantly, the statement, in a somewhat convoluted fashion,
implies that referral to treatment in contrast to NEP does not
offer assurance that drug users will not inject drugs. </p>

<p>Page 11, Paragraph 5. The report notes that. NEPs vary greatly
with respect to the emphasis they place upon making referrals to
drug treatment and other public health services. This stems in
part from the desire to make the NEP &quot;user friendly&quot;,
the recognition that many active IDUs express no interest in
entering drug treatment, and the related belief that an over
emphasis on drug treatment could alienated potential NEP
clients.&quot; This assertion for which two literature references
are cited is a dangerously misleading generalization. First it is
unclear what the authors mean by &quot;user-friendly&quot;. This
implies that drug treatment is somehow not user friendly which is
clearly not the case. Secondly, the references to drug treatment
are based published papers which were published before OTI/CSAT
came into existence, a development which has had an enormous
effect on the nature and quality of national drug treatment
services. We must remember that many of staff of these NEPs are
only casually familiar with the various treatment modalities, the
behavioral characteristics of drug using populations and are
generally not qualified to make determinations about who is
interested in treatment or not. In point of fact many drug users
are not interested in treatment, enter treatment for many other
reasons, e.g. secure primary care or to take a respite from their
addiction lifestyle, other than to address their addictions. It
does not follow, even from the limited evidence provided in the
cited studies, that emphasizing or overemphasizing treatment
produces alienation. finally, the determination of who should be
referred or not should never be left to so-called perceptions of
staff regarding &quot;readiness for treatment&quot;. </p>

<p>Page 12, Conclusion. There are a number of reasons why
referrals to drug treatment are limited other than the paucity of
drug treatment slots. One important consideration which may be a
limiting factor to referrals may in fact have more to do with how
various NEPs have evolved in relation to drug treatment programs
in the same area. It is abundantly clear that these programs have
not been in philosophical agreement regarding how to address the
needs of the addict. </p>

<p>Page 13, Conclusion. I don't think there is any serious
disagreement that the cost of NEPs are substantially cheaper than
any form of treatment including methadone. It is also true that
NEP is cheaper than coronary angioplasty, renal dialysis and a
range of other health care expenditure. The reference made to
methadone seems to suggest that there is contrast, or perhaps
imply that there is tacit substitution effect. The reference made
to methadone should be deleted since its incorporation in the
context of the conclusion is largely irrelevant. </p>

<p>Page 14, Paragraph 5. Our understanding of injecting drug use
among women is not as well developed as for men. While there is
evidence which suggest that men initiate women, this is by no
means an absolute. the fact remains that there are IDU
populations of women which operate independently from those of
men. Our limited knowledge of injecting behaviors among women
clearly indicates that there may be other factors involved with
respect to injecting behavior which may make it problematic to
apply NEP directed at male IDUs to female IDUs. </p>

<p>Page 16, Conclusion. The conclusion tragically fails to
appreciate the full range of antipathy and fear which African
Americans communities have for the &quot;symbolic
sanctioning&quot; of drug abuse by endorsing NEP in their
communities. After years of &quot;Just Say No&quot;, the
perception of many leaders in these communities is that NEP
represents a step back and not forward. Irrespective of whether
this perception is valid or not, the presence of these compelling
beliefs cannot be dismissed lightly. It is insulting to these
communities, also contrary to all of our Public Health platitudes
around cultural sensitivity to dismiss these visceral community
concerns by stating that &quot;newer African American
organizations established specifically to address HIV prevention
generally support NEP as did several mayors...&quot; This
statement literally indicates that the view of traditional
leaders from the African American communities and from church
leaders can and should be ignored in favor of those who support
NEP. This statement by it's intent, fosters divisiveness and is
antithetical to efforts made by other segments of public health
including those concerned with preventing HIV disease to engage
and not alienate the African American community. </p>

<p>Page 18, Conclusion. The overall issue here is the question
which frames this section, &quot;Do NEPs result in changes in
community levels of drug use?&quot; Clearly this is very complex
question which could not be answered within the scope of the
study, but one which nonetheless warrants a poignant level of
inquiry. However, the conclusion seems to go beyond the paucity
of evidence to conclude that there is &quot;no evidence that NEPs
increase the amount of drug use by NEP clients or change overall
community levels of non-injection and injection drug use.&quot;
This convoluted logic would have us believe that if it cannot be
established that NEP has an effect on drug use, then the absence
of correlates, irrespective of methodological limitations, is
tantamount to saying it has no effect. This conclusion is further
supported by indicating that interview with NEP clients and by
IDUs not using NEP, confirmed that they did not believe that
increase needle availability would increase drug use. It is not
clear how these two groups would qualify to speculate on new
incidence, especially by younger members of the community. In
general, this ipso facto logic is not only distressing, but
raises very real questions overall scientific validity of this
report. </p>

<p>Page 21, Conclusion. Though the majority of studies cited
indicated a decreased rate of HIV drug risk behavior, the real
issue here which is not addressed are whether these behavioral
changes are sustainable overtime. While there are clearly
compelling finding of short term behavioral change, these
indications do not provide definitive conclusions regarding the
effectiveness of NEP overtime. The proper statement of this
conclusion should insert the caveat that the studies reviewed do
not conclusive evidence at this time that these behaviors are
sustained overtime. </p>

<p>We at HRSA have reviewed this very thorough report on needle
exchange programs and concur with its major finding and
recommendations. We believe that needle exchange programs
definitely have a place in what must necessarily be a
comprehensive approach to the prevention of HIV infection among
drug users. In addition, we were pleased that the report went
beyond needle exchange programs per se to discuss the need for
changes in current prescription and paraphernalia laws at the

<p>Subject: Draft Response on Needle Exchange </p>

<p>To: James Curran, M.D., M.P.H. </p>

<p>Associate Director for HIV/AIDS, CDC </p>

<p>In general we think the CDC's draft response to Jo Ivey
Boufford, M.D. concerning the University of California report on
needle exchange programs did an excellent job of covering the
salient issues. We do have a number of specific comments, which
follow: </p>

<p>page 2, paragraph 2: </p>

<p>We suggest adding a sentence to the effect that :
&quot;Substance abuse treatment programs also require substantial
funding increases in order to accommodate the needs of
individuals who decide they want to enter treatment as a result
of their involvement in needle exchange and other outreach
efforts to IDUs. </p>

<p>page 7, first paragraph: </p>

<p>We think it is important to mention the fact that needle
exchange remains an issue of special concern issue among
African-American and other minority politicians and community
leaders. Whether or not we think this concern is justified, we
need to acknowledge that it exists. </p>

<p>page 8, last paragraph: </p>

<p>We think it should be acknowledged that the degree to which
new HIV infections are reduced is strongly affected by (1) the
&quot;penetration&quot; of needle exchange in a particular city
and (2) the complexity of the drug-using populations and network
in particular communities (i.e., the number of, and kinds of
connections between, drug injection networks). </p>

<p>page 9, &quot;Impact of Needle Exchange Programs on Drug
Use&quot;: </p>

<p>Again, we think it is crucial to acknowledge and discuss the
fact that many African-American and other minority politicians
and community leaders fear that needle exchange programs condone
drug use and should be opposed on those grounds. </p>

<p>The last paragraph in this section should provide more
specific data to address this concern. </p>

<p>page 10, last paragraph: </p>

<p>The fifth sentence should read, &quot;Third, NEP clients
report decreases in their HIV drug-risk behaviors.&quot; </p>

<p>We disagree that the relationship between NEPs and HIV
infection may be impossible to study conclusively, particularly
since &quot;conclusiveness&quot; depends on the criteria being
used. This issue could be studied with several replications
(different cities or neighborhoods) to obtain better data than
now exist on this point. </p>

<p>page 11, last paragraph: </p>

<p>We suggest adding a sentence to the effect that, &quot;The CDC
should develop and foster the use of standardized data elements,
methods of data collection, and protocols for
evaluation/analysis.&quot; </p>

<p>page 12 first paragraph: </p>

<p>In the last sentence, we suggest adding the phrase,
&quot;using standardized methodologies.&quot; </p>

<p>page 15, first paragraph: </p>

<p>Again, we suggest adding to the last sentence's phrase about
the use of standardized data collection and evaluation
methodologies. </p>

<p>We appreciate the opportunity to review this response. </p>

<p>Office of the Associate Director for HIV/AIDS </p>

<p>To: Associate Director for HIV/AIDS </p>

<p>Re: Request for Update on Needle Exchange Studies and Laws
Related to Needle and Syringe Sale and/or Possession </p>

<p>1. Background </p>

<p>The following information is provided in response to the
request of Brian Biles, Office of the Assistant Secretary for
Health, for an update on (a) studies of needle exchange programs
(NEPs) since the 1993 release of the University of California
(UC) three-volume, 700 page report on NEPs[1] and (b) recent
developments related to laws related to NEPs and possessions
and/pr sale of syringes. </p>

<p>2. New York City NEP evaluation reported at 1994 APHA
Conference </p>

<p>* At the 1994 American Public Health Association (APHA)
Conference, Dr. Don Des Jarlais presented and estimate of an
approximate 50% reduction in rates of new HIV infections among
injecting drug users (IDUs) using NEPs in New York City (NYC). </p>

<p>* This estimate was based on several small follow-up studies
of HIV incidence among IDUs using NEPs compared to HIV incidence
among IDUs in a vaccine preparedness cohort and cohort studies in
methadone maintenance.[2] A manuscript based the APHA oral
presentation is being prepared. Until this study is more fully
described, it is difficult to assess the basis for this estimate
of NEP impacting NYC. However, although the numbers are small,
the estimate is plausible. </p>

<p>3. Legal aspects of needle exchange, possession, and sale of
syringes </p>

<p>* In 1993 and 1994, three states (Maryland, Massachusetts, and
Rhode Island) enacted laws authorizing pilot NEPs; two states
(Connecticut and Hawaii) enacted laws expanding existing NEP
legislation. </p>

<p>* In September 1994, the Mayor and City Council o Los Angeles
declared a &quot;local state of emergency.&quot; The declaration
was based on &quot;... finding that an emergency in connection
with the AIDS epidemic and the transmission of HIV through
contaminated needles does exist, and that this emergency
threatens to cause extraordinary loss of life.&quot;[3] This
state of emergency was used as a basis for authorizing support
for &quot;responsible&quot; NEPs. </p>

<p>* In 1993 and 1994, similar declarations of states of
emergency have been made in nine other California cities and
counties - Alameda, Berkeley, Marin, Oakland, Salinas, San
Francisco, Santa Clara, Sonoma, and West Hollywood. </p>

<p>* A major reason for NEPs is the existence of several laws
that restrict the purchase, distribution, and possession of
syringes. These laws include &quot;prescription laws,&quot; under
which a prescription is required to purchase syringes and
&quot;drug paraphernalia laws,&quot; which establish felony
and/or misdemeanor criminal penalties for the possession and/or
distribution of syringes for nonmedical purposes. About nine
states have prescription laws and more than 40 states have drug
paraphernalia laws. In 1993, Maine repealed its prescription law.
</p>

<p>* In 1992, Connecticut partially repealed it drug
paraphernalia and prescription laws. The new laws allow purchase
of as many as 10 syringes without a prescription and possession
of as many as 10 syringes without a medical condition. A CDC and
Connecticut Health Department evaluation of the impact of these
new laws found that IDUs reported substantially less multiperson
use (&quot;sharing&quot;) of injection equipment. Also, after the
change in the laws, more than 80% of Connecticut pharmacies sell
syringes without a prescription and, for drug injectors, there
was a dramatic shift from &quot;black market&quot; sources of
syringes to purchases in pharmacies[4]. </p>

<p>4. Limitations of bleach disinfection and recommendation to
use sterile syringes </p>

<p>Several studies published in a special section of the July
1994 &quot;Journal of AIDS&quot; indicate that while bleach
disinfection can reduce the HIV transmission risk of IDU reuse of
syringes, it is not as safe as using a new, sterile syringe. The
following quotation summarizes the argument: </p>

<p>We reiterate that IDUs who cannot stop injecting drugs should
use sterile needles and syringes; ideally only once and then
safely dispose of them. IDUs should be told never to re-use
injection equipment that had been previously used by someone
else.... If one re-uses injection equipment, consistent and
thorough cleaning of equipment with disinfectants, such as
full-strength household bleach for longer rather than shorter
periods of time, should decrease, but may not eliminate the HIV
transmission risk[5]. </p>

<p>The following sections present additional information on NEPs
that has become available since the release of the UC report. </p>

<p>5. Decreases in HIV risk behaviors among NEP clients </p>

<p>The following data from San Francisco and New York, cities
with high volume NEPs, indicate decreases in HIV risk behaviors
reported by NEP clients: </p>

<p>* Decrease in needle-sharing rates associated with increased
use of the NEP among street recruited San Francisco IDUs[6]. </p>

<p>* Reduction in needle-sharing rates among IDUs attending NEPs
in New York City[7]. </p>

<p>* Reductions in the proportions of IDUs attending drug
detoxification programs in New York City who injected with a use
syringe and who lent used syringes to others, associated with the
opening of NEPs in that city. </p>

<p>6. No evidence of an increase in drug use in San Francisco, a
city with a high-volume NEP </p>

<p>The San Francisco NEP opened in 1987. It is a now one of the
highest volume NEPs in the United States; 343,888 syringes were
exchanged during the Spring of 1992. The following data come from
repeated surveys (from 1988 to 1992) of IDUs in San Francisco: </p>

<p>* The median number of injections decreased from 1.9 per day
in the Fall of 1987 to 0.7 per day in the Spring of 1992.[6] </p>

<p>* The mean age of IDUs in the repeated surveys in San
Francisco increased from 36 years in the Spring of 1987 to 42
years in the Spring of 1992[6]. </p>

<p>* The proportion of San Francisco IDUs reporting that they
first injected drugs in the previous year decreased from 3.0% in
the Spring of 1989 to 1.1% in the Spring of 1992[6]. </p>

<p>Taken together, the last two finding suggest that significant
numbers of persons have not begun injecting drugs in a city with
a high-volume NEP. </p>

<p>7. Increase in estimated reduction of HIV incidence among IDUs
using the New Haven NEP </p>

<p>Earlier estimates derived from mathematical models indicated
that the rate of HIV infection among clients of the NEP in New
Haven, CT, was reduced by 33% by their use of the NEP. Updated
estimates from that model suggest that the reduction is more than
40%[9]. </p>

<p>8. Lower incidence of hepatitis B and C among IDUs using the
Tacoma NEP </p>

<p>A study of hepatitis B and C among IDUs in Tacoma, Washington,
using multivariate analysis to adjust for the demographic
characteristics of the IDUs found that, compared with nonusers of
the NEP, IDUs who had ever used the Tacoma NEP were seven times
less likely to become infected with hepatitis B and eight times
less likely to become infected with hepatitis C[10]. This study
demonstrates more clearly than any previous research that use of
NEPs is associated with decreases in blood -borne infections. </p>

<p>9. Substantial entry in to drug treatment of New Haven NEP
clients </p>

<p>Between September 1992 and July 1993, 112 of 596 NEP clients
(19%) in New Haven entered drug treatment. In addition, 205 IDUs
who did not exchange syringes were referred to drug treatment by
the NEP[11]. </p>

<p>10. Substantial IDU utilization of high-volume NEPs </p>

<p>One issue about NEPs is how much they will be used by IDUs.
Studies from tow cities with high-volume NEPs, New York City and
San Francisco, indicate that substantial proportions of IDUs
surveyed report use of the NEPs. </p>

<p>* Des Jarlais reported data indicating that in 1993 nearly
half (46%) of IDUs surveyed in New York City had used an NEP[2]. </p>

<p>* Surveys of IDUs in San Francisco in the Spring of 1992 found
that 45% &quot;usually&quot; obtained their syringes from the San
Francisco NEP[6]. </p>

<p>11. Increasing Number of NEPs in the United States </p>

<p>The UC report found at least 37 active NEPs in the United
States as of September 1993. As of October 1994, an estimated 70
NEPs were in operation in the United States[12]. </p>

<p>12. Support from the general public for NEPs for AIDS
prevention </p>

<p>In the first national opinion poll on NEPs, a 1994 national
telephone survey of 1,001 people, the majority (55%) of
respondents favored &quot;Implementing needle exchange programs
to reduce the spread of diseases such as AIDS.&quot;[13] </p>

<p>13. Support for federal funding of NEPs from the National
Academy of Sciences </p>

<p>A study on AIDS behavioral research published in 1994 by the
Institute of Medicine, described NEPs as &quot;highly
promising&quot; and called for the lifting of the ban on the use
of federal funds for NEP services. &quot;The weight of evidence
suggests that needle exchange does more good than harm,&quot;
concluded the authors[14]. </p>

<p>14. High HIV seroconversion among Montreal IDUs </p>

<p>The highest levels of HIV seroprevalence among IDUs in Canada
have been reported from Montreal. Bruneau reports from the St.
Luc IDU cohort that among 850 IDUs recruited 1989-1993, the half
(54%) reporting use of a Montreal NEP had higher HIV
seroprevalence (18.2% vs. 5.6%) compared with nonattenders. Among
the 507 IDUs with multiple visits to the study site, the
seroconversion rate was higher (11.6 vs 3.5 per 100 person-years
[p&lt;0.0001]) among IDUs using NEP[15]. </p>

<p>A study of incarcerated IDUs found that IDUs using a Montreal
NEP reported higher rates of HIV risk behaviors (vs. IDUs who did
not use a NEP). Montreal NEP attenders were more likely than
non-attenders, to have same sex partners, to work in the sex
industry, to report injecting with needles used by an
HIV-infected IDU, and re-use borrowed injection equipment without
cleaning[16]. </p>

<p>The higher HIV seroprevalence, HIV seroconversion, and HIV
risk factors among IDUs attending the Montreal NEP require
furthers study. </p>

<p>15. Comments and conclusions </p>

<p>Since the 1993 release of the UC report: </p>

<p>* The number of U.S. NEPs has increased, and more states and
localities have approved NEPs by legislation or declaration of
sates of emergency; </p>

<p>* In communities with high-volume NEPs, substantial
proportions of IDUs report using the NEP; </p>

<p>* Biological evidence suggests decreases of bloodborne virus
transmission among NEP clients, with the evidence stronger for
hepatitis than HIV; </p>

<p>* There is additional evidence that in most cities with NEPs,
NEP clients have lower rates of HIV risk behaviors; and </p>

<p>* Higher HIV seroconversion rates among IDUs using the
Montreal NEP were documented and must be further investigated. </p>

<p>Appendix IV </p>

<p>Legal Barriers to Federal Funding of Needle Exchange Programs </p>

<p>EXCERPTED FROM March 1993 report by General Accounting Office
(GAO), titled &quot;NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS -- Research Suggests
Promise as an AIDS Prevention Strategy. </p>

<p>Since 1988, Congress has passed at least six laws (in addition
to the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration
(ADAMHA) Reorganization Act of 1992) that contain provisions
prohibiting or restricting use of federal funding for needle
exchange programs and activities. These provisions are contained
in: </p>

<p>the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health
Amendments Act of 1988; the Health Omnibus Programs Extension of
1988; </p>

<p>the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of
1990; and the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services,
and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts of 1990,
1991, and 1993 (the Appropriations Act of 1992 did not contain
such a provision). </p>

<p>The Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health
Amendments Act of 1988 required states, as a condition for
receiving ADAMHA block grant funds under title XIX of the PHS
Act, to agree that funds would not be used to carry out any
programs of distributing sterile needles for the hypodermic
injection of any illegal drug or distributing bleach for the
purpose of cleansing needles for such hypodermic injection
....&quot; </p>

<p>This provision was repealed by the ADAMHA Reorganization Act
(1992). </p>

<p>The Health Omnibus Programs Extension of 1988 authorizes funds
and programs aimed at combating the AIDS epidemic and preventing
its transmission. Among other things, the act authorizes grants
and contracts through the Director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases to assist public and nonprofit
private entities in conducting research and training in advanced
diagnostic, prevention, and treatment methods for AIDS. These
grants may be used to operate demonstration projects in long-term
monitoring and outpatient treatment of HIV-infected individuals.
The act also authorizes funds for AIDS education. Additionally,
the Director of the National Institutes of Health is to establish
projects to promote cooperation among public health agencies and
with private entities in research concerned with the diagnosis,
prevention, and treatment of A[DS. The act provides further: </p>

<p>None of the funds provided under this Act or an amendment made
by this Act shall be used to provide individuals with hypodermic
needles or syringes so that such individuals may use illegal
drugs, unless the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service
determines that a demonstration needle exchange program would be
effective in reducing drug abuse and the risk that the public
will become infected with the etiologic agent for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.&quot; </p>

<p>The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of
l990 (42 U.S.C.  300ff et seq.) authorizes grants to localities
disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. The act
prohibits use of funds made available under this Act, or an
amendment made by this Act . . . to provide individuals with
hypodermic needles or syringes so that such individuals may use
illegal drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and
Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts of l990 and
1991 contained identical prohibitions regarding needle exchange
programs (section 520 of P.L. 101-166 and section 512 of P.L.
101-517). The provision stated: </p>

<p>None of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be used to
carry out any program of distributing sterile needles for the
hypodermic injection of any illegal drug unless the President of
the United States certifies that such programs are effective in
stopping the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use of
illegal drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>In contrast, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human
Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act
of 1993, states in section 514 of the General Provisions&quot;: </p>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no funds
appropriated under this Act shall be used to carry out any
program of distributing sterile needles for the hypodermic
injection of any illegal drug unless the Surgeon General of the
United States determines that such programs are effective in
preventing the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use of
illegal drugs, except that such funds may be used for such
purposes in furtherance of demonstrations or studies authorized
in the ADAMHA Reorganization Act (P L. 102-321).&quot; <br>

<p> Introduction </p>

<p> The Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control held a </p>

<p> 2day hearing in the 2d session of the 100th Congress to </p>

<p> examine the legalization of all illicit narcotics. </p>

<p> These informational hearings, entitled &quot;Legalization of </p>

<p> Illicit Drugs: Impact and Feasibility,&quot; were held in </p>

<p> response to public debate that began in early 1988, after </p>

<p> the mayor of Baltimore told a Washington, DC meeting of </p>

<p> the U.S. Conference of Mayors that existing U.S. drug </p>

<p> policy had failed. The mayor suggested legalization and </p>

<p> decriminalization as possible approaches to solving the </p>

<p> problem. </p>

<p> The hearings were designed to consider the seriousness of </p>

<p> a variety of legalization proposals that had been offered </p>

<p> by drug policy observers who, after the Baltimore mayor's </p>

<p> call for a look at legalization, stepped up their own </p>

<p> criticisms of U.S. antidrug policy. In effect, they </p>

<p> pronounced the symbolic war on drugs lost. </p>

<p> Now that the hearings have been completed, and testimony </p>

<p> has been studied and restudied, the committee, led by </p>

<p> Chairman Charles B. Rangel and Ranking Member Benjamin </p>

<p> Gilman, has produced a list of findings resulting from the </p>

<p> many hours of testimony. </p>

<p> The findings are not for any specific legislative purpose. </p>

<p> Instead, they are intended solely as an advisory to any </p>

<p> Members of the U.S. Congress and the public as to what the </p>

<p> committee believes was established by the proceedings. </p>

<p> How the Hearings Evolved </p>

<p> In the spring of 1988, Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke was </p>

<p> speaking to his colleagues at the U.S. Conference of </p>

<p> Mayors annual meeting on crime and drugs. During the </p>

<p> speech, Mayor Schmoke surprised the gathering when he </p>

<p> suggested that elected officials should consider the </p>

<p> legalization or the decriminalization of illicit drugs in </p>

<p> response to America's escalating drug crisis. </p>

<p> In his speech, Mayor Schmoke criticized America's current </p>

<p> antidrug approach as a wasteful proposition bent too far </p>

<p> toward law enforcement and not far enough toward treatment </p>

<p> and rehabilitation of drug addicts. Recalling his days as </p>

<p> a prosecuting attorney, Mayor Schmoke cited what he viewed </p>

<p> as the miniscule impact of arrests and convictions of drug </p>

<p> traffickers and drug users on the overall drug problem. </p>

<p> Schmoke's comments were the proverbial &quot;shots heard
around </p>

<p> the world,&quot; as few, if any, public officials had treaded
</p>

<p> into such politically explosive waters before on the </p>

<p> sensitive narcotics issue. </p>

<p> Select Committee Chairman Rangel (D-NY) responded almost </p>

<p> immediately to Mayor Schmoke's legalization calls. </p>

<p> Chairman Rangel decried the notion as stemming from </p>

<p> frustration and exhasperation with the Nation's </p>

<p> mushrooming drug crisis. Chairman Rangel contended in </p>

<p> interviews and opinion articles that legalization would be </p>

<p> a tactical error in the war on drugs that would quite </p>

<p> possibly lead to a nation full of drug addicts. </p>

<p> Throughout the ensuing months after the hearing was </p>

<p> announced, people on both sides of the issue began </p>

<p> tangling publicly over the question. An informal national </p>

<p> debate had begun, and many looked toward the hearings </p>

<p> scheduled by Chairman Rangel as a final commentary on the </p>

<p> subject at least for the time being. </p>

<p> in calling for the hearings, Chairman Rangel expressed a </p>

<p> desire to get to the heart of suggestions being proposed </p>

<p> by legalization proponents. Although pro-legalization </p>

<p> advocates claimed they were simply calling for a debate on </p>

<p> the issue, Chairman Rangel impressed upon them that they </p>

<p> should come forward with specific plans and proposals, </p>

<p> rather than just debate the subject. Chairman Rangel made </p>

<p> a special plea with public officials suggesting </p>

<p> legalization or decriminalization to come forward with </p>

<p> specifics to satisfy the burden of their responsibility to </p>

<p> the American public. </p>

<p> Throughout the debate, Chairman Rangel asked legalization </p>

<p> advocates a series of questions in order that they might </p>

<p> clarify their positions. Among them: </p>

<p> (1) has anybody ever considered which narcotic and </p>

<p> psychotropic drugs might be legalized? </p>

<p> (2) would we allow all drugs to become legally sold and </p>

<p> used, or would we select the most abused few, such as </p>

<p> cocaine, heroin, and marijuana? </p>

<p> (3) who would administer the dosages-the State or the </p>

<p> individual? </p>

<p> (4) what quantity of drugs would each individual be </p>

<p> allowed to get? </p>

<p> (5) what about addicts, would we not have to give them </p>

<p> more in order to satisfy their craving, or would we give </p>

<p> them enough just to whet their appetites? </p>

<p> (6) what do we do about those who are experimenting? Do </p>

<p> we sell them drugs, too, and encourage them to pick up the </p>

<p> habit? (7) furthermore, will the government establish tax- </p>

<p> supported facilities to sell these drugs? </p>

<p> (8) would we get the supply from the same foreign </p>

<p> countries that support our habit now, or would we create </p>

<p> our own internal sources? </p>

<p> (9) would there be an age limit on purchases, as is the </p>

<p> case with alcohol? </p>

<p> (10) how many people are projected to become addicts as a </p>

<p> result of legalization? </p>

<p> (11) what about pilots, railroad engineers, surgeons, </p>

<p> police, cross-country truckers and nuclear plant employees </p>

<p> who want to use marijuana and cocaine during off-duty </p>

<p> hours? </p>

<p> (12) what about crack cocaine as a legalized drug? Would </p>

<p> we want to legalize something as harmful and as </p>

<p> destructive to our youth as this? </p>

<p> Legalization: A Recurring Theme </p>

<p> The legalization debate seems to rise to the surface when </p>

<p> the drug crisis reaches alarming levels, as it has </p>

<p> recently. The drug issue eventually moved to the top of </p>

<p> the list of Americans' concerns during 1988, given the </p>

<p> spate of news stories on the growing influence of the </p>

<p> narcotics trade in everyday lives. </p>

<p> Throughout the year, there were revelations from the </p>

<p> Select Committee on Narcotics and other congressional </p>

<p> committees about the suspected involvement of some foreign </p>

<p> leaders in the drug trade. Americans were also bombarded </p>

<p> by reports of the increased prevalence of deadly, </p>

<p> addictive crack cocaine; growing gang involvement in the </p>

<p> narcotics trade; a tripling of cocaine imports to the </p>

<p> United States in the 1980's; a significant rise in drug- </p>

<p> related violence sparked by tension between warring </p>

<p> traffickers and by street dealers bent on attention- </p>

<p> getting retaliatory tactics. </p>

<p> At the time of the hearing, one major news poll revealed </p>

<p> that the American public was more concerned about the </p>

<p> crisis of illegal drugs than about any other issue- </p>

<p> including the budget deficit. </p>

<p> The ABC News polling data also indicated that Americans </p>

<p> were wary of legalization, Nine out of ten opposed </p>

<p> legalizing all drugs and about 50 percent of the </p>

<p> respondents feared drug use would rise under legalization. </p>

<p> In a Gallup survey released 2 months prior to the hearing, </p>

<p> about 75 percent of those surveyed were opposed and nearly </p>

<p> 70 percent felt that legalization would aggravate the </p>

<p> Nation's drug problem. </p>

<p> Through the years, advocates of legalization have favored </p>

<p> an end to existing drug laws, often using the end of </p>

<p> Prohibition in the 1930's and the end of organized crime's </p>

<p> involvement in the illegal liquor trade as an example in </p>

<p> making their case. </p>

<p> Chairman Rangel, on the other hand, asked of legalization </p>

<p> advocates in 1988: What drugs would we legalize? Who </p>

<p> would manufacture and distribute them? In what </p>

<p> neighborhoods would they be sold and marketed? Would </p>

<p> crack cocaine be legalized in a legalization scheme? </p>

<p> Would there be age and quantity limits on purchases? How </p>

<p> much would we give addicts, enough to satisfy their </p>

<p> craving? </p>

<p> Other opponents of the legalization theory suggested that </p>

<p> in addition to a potential meteoric rise in addictions, </p>

<p> there is no guarantee that the black market for drugs </p>

<p> would close down, especially if restrictions are placed on </p>

<p> purchase quantity and on the quality of various narcotic </p>

<p> substances. </p>

<p> Overview of the Proceedings </p>

<p> Thursday and Friday, September 29 and 30, 1988, were 2 </p>

<p> significant days in the 100th Congress regarding the drug </p>

<p> issue. In those 2 days, a total of 34 witnesses </p>

<p> representing Congress, law enforcement, government, </p>

<p> academia, and various drug-related interest groups </p>

<p> testified before the Select Committee on Narcotics on </p>

<p> legalization. </p>

<p> By the time the hearing commenced, the legalization issue </p>

<p> had gained such national exposure that the proceedings </p>

<p> were carried live over public television and public radio, </p>

<p> and was covered by a large contingent of print media. At </p>

<p> this point and time in 1988, legalization was a very </p>

<p> important topic to many Americans concerned about the </p>

<p> worsening drug crisis. </p>

<p> In addition to the announced lineup of witnesses, several </p>

<p> Members of Congress who do not serve on the Select </p>

<p> Committee on Narcotics offered testimony on the subject. </p>

<p> Representative Carroll Hubbard (D-KY) and Representative </p>

<p> Roy Dyson (D-MD) both told the panel that the Nation's </p>

<p> drug crisis had become more than just a problem in urban </p>

<p> America. In rural areas served by both those Members, </p>

<p> there has been a noticeable increase in narcotics-related </p>

<p> problems. Representative Benjamin Cardin (D-MD) warned </p>

<p> about the confused messages that would be sent to the </p>

<p> youth if drugs were legalized. Representative Kwesi Mfume </p>

<p> (D-MD) also outlined his opposition, but said that more </p>

<p> attention should be given to demand reduction. </p>

<p> Following is a summary of the statement of each witness. </p>

<p> The summary is intended to capture the essence of what the </p>

<p> witness presented to the panel in his or her opening </p>

<p> statement, and is not a verbatim translation of the actual </p>

<p> testimony. </p>

<p> Findings </p>

<p> 1. The ideas and recommendations of pro-legalization </p>

<p> forces remain varied and wide ranging. There is no </p>

<p> commonly agreed upon approach that should be taken to </p>

<p> legalize illicit narcotics. </p>

<p> 2. The American public remains largely opposed to the </p>

<p> notion of legalizing illicit drugs. </p>

<p> 3. There is no data to support the theory that </p>

<p> legalizing illicit drugs would result in less crime, more </p>

<p> affordable narcotics or decreased drug experimentation, </p>

<p> abuse or addiction. </p>

<p> 4. There is no agreement on the types of currently </p>

<p> illicit drugs that should be considered for </p>

<p> legalization. </p>

<p> 5. No definitive information exists that would show how </p>

<p> America's youth would be affected by legalization, whether </p>

<p> positively or negatively. </p>

<p> 6. There should be a stepped up effort to look at the </p>

<p> expansion of treatment and rehabilitation resources around </p>

<p> the country. </p>

<p> 7. The Federal war on drugs must devote more resources </p>

<p> to curbing drug trafficking and abuse in major U.S. </p>

<p> cities. </p>

<p> 8. Narcotics law enforcement efforts need to be </p>

<p> improved, especially in major U.S. cities) </p>

<p> 9. Training for the staff of drug abuse treatment </p>

<p> centers needs to be expanded and improved. </p>

<p> 10. Federal drug abuse policies need more input from </p>

<p> residents of major American cities and not just from </p>

<p> governmental leaders,police chiefs, and substance abuse </p>

<p> professionals. </p>

<p> 11. The burden of proof regarding the benefits of drug </p>

<p> legalization must be placed on the advocates of such a </p>

<p> policy. Until the proponents of drug legalization can </p>

<p> demonstrate that the benefits of such a policy outweigh </p>

<p> the risks to health and drug-related violeiiee, drug </p>

<p> legalization should be rejected. </p>

<p> 12. American schools should continue to convey the </p>

<p> message that drug abuse is against the law, harmful to </p>

<p> health, and a detriment to optimal academic performance. </p>

<p> 13. Employee assistance programs [EAP's] in government </p>

<p> and industry must be strengthened to help employees and </p>

<p> their families deal effectively with drug abuse, </p>

<p> 14. We have not yet begun to fight the war. </p>

<p> Consequently, legalization should not be considered an </p>

<p> alternative. </p>

<p> Summary of Statements by Members of Congress </p>

<p> CHAIRMAN CHARLES B. RANGEL (D-NY), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROT. </p>

<p> Legalization has been widely discussed in academic </p>

<p> settings, and on radio and TV talk shows. But this is the </p>

<p> first time in a long time the issue has made its way to </p>

<p> the Congress. </p>

<p> Most of those who have been advocating legalization have </p>

<p> been calling for either a debate, a discussion or a </p>

<p> consideration. But after an advance reading of some of </p>

<p> the testimony, it does not appear that any of the </p>

<p> witnesses are truly'advocating legalization. </p>

<p> Some are saying legalization ought to be discussed because </p>

<p> the war on drugs is being lost with law enforcement. But </p>

<p> the Nation has yet to declare a real war on drugs. </p>

<p> For 8 years, the Congress has met resistance to antidrug </p>

<p> efforts. The Reagan administration has shied away from </p>

<p> providing funds to State and local governments so that </p>

<p> they can fight the war on drugs. </p>

<p> How can we say we have a war on drugs when a total of </p>

<p> 2,800 DEA men and women are dedicated to fighting the war </p>

<p> on drugs at the Federal level? </p>

<p> Some legalization proponents are calling for a greater </p>

<p> educational and rehabilitative commitment, but we do not </p>

<p> even have a single federally run rehabilitation program. </p>

<p> Some say we must do more with drug education, but so far </p>

<p> we have only had slogans like &quot;Just Say No&quot; and
&quot;Zero </p>

<p> Tolerance.&quot; </p>

<p> No opium or coca leaves are grown in this country, yet the </p>

<p> Secretary of State never utters his contempt for the </p>

<p> nations where these poisons are grown. </p>

<p> Legalization proponents must be prepared to discuss their </p>

<p> ideas and recommendations in detail. </p>

<p> HON. LAWRENCE COUGHLIN (R-PA), RANKING MINORITY MEMBER, </p>

<p> SELECT COMMITTEE: ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Having a hearing on legalization could send a wrong </p>

<p> message to America's young people that drugs are OK. </p>

<p> Having a discussion could be a copout in the war on drugs. </p>

<p> The hope is that the hearing will not be interpreted as an </p>

<p> indication that legalization is being suggested. </p>

<p> To quote the attorney general of Pennsylvania, Leroy </p>

<p> Zimmerman, &quot;In Philadelphia, over 50 percent of the
child </p>

<p> abuse fatalities involved parents who heavily used </p>

<p> cocaine. Cheaper, legal cocaine would result in more </p>

<p> children dying and more babies being born addicted.&quot; </p>

<p> HoN. BENJAMIN A. GILMAN (R-NY), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Drug kingpins are Continuing to cash in on America's </p>

<p> insatiable appetite for illicit drugs. These </p>

<p> multinational criminal syndicates have built evil empires </p>

<p> from the drug trade. </p>

<p> The power of the drug trade threatens the authority of </p>

<p> governments worldwide. Colombia, for example, is </p>

<p> virtually under siege from the traffickers, </p>

<p> When the narcotics trade recently offered the Colombian </p>

<p> people the money to pay off the nation's foreign debt, the </p>

<p> people refused, resisting the financial temptation and </p>

<p> opting to take the moral high ground. </p>

<p> Those calling for legalization in America are seeking to </p>

<p> compromise the same values and morals that remain at stake </p>

<p> in Colombia. They are looking to cut a deal with the drug </p>

<p> trade. </p>

<p> Legalization would not put an end to the international </p>

<p> cartels, who would figure out ways to adapt and penetrate </p>

<p> the U.S. market. It would not end drug-related crime, as </p>

<p> many addicts on the street would continue to commit </p>

<p> criminal acts because of impaired judgment and instability </p>

<p> from illicit drug use. </p>

<p> It is hoped that fresh, new ideas will emerge from the </p>

<p> hearings that will make the Nation more effective in the </p>

<p> war on drugs. </p>

<p> HON. FORTNEY H. (PETE) STARK (D-CA), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> In New York and Oakland, only about 10 percent of the </p>

<p> cocaine and heroin addicts are able to be treated for </p>

<p> their addictions. In both cities, people seeking drug </p>

<p> treatment are required to wait at least 6 months for </p>

<p> treatment. Drug-related crime has skyrocketed as a result </p>

<p> of a lack of treatment slots. </p>

<p> Legalization is not the answer. We must find a way to </p>

<p> treat the drug abuser. </p>

<p> I am introducing a bill to provide treatment for addicts </p>

<p> seeking help. The bill would be financed through the </p>

<p> Social Security Programs' disability insurance provisions </p>

<p> and utilize a Medicare-like payment principal for </p>

<p> outpatient and inpatient services. </p>

<p> HoN. JAMES H. SCHEUER(D-NY), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The ultimate copout in the war on drugs is to stand pat </p>

<p> with the current ineffective drug control policy. Pumping </p>

<p> more resources into a transparently failed system would be </p>

<p> an admission of defeat in the war on drugs. </p>

<p> Our system has totally failed. If seizures, arrests, and </p>

<p> convictions are going up, then so is violence and </p>

<p> addiction. We must end the preoccupation with the </p>

<p> criminal justice aspect of the problem and focus more on </p>

<p> education and treatment. </p>

<p> A new system and a new strategy would involve changing </p>

<p> people's behavior. We have successfully changed attitudes </p>

<p> and behavior on alcohol and tobacco consumption. </p>

<p> The question is, How do we reduce the demand for drugs? </p>

<p> We need to examine the costs and benefits of police </p>

<p> crackdowns. We have to address a broad spectrum of </p>

<p> options and put substantially more resources into those </p>

<p> programs that really work. </p>

<p> HON. CARDISS COLLINS (D-IL), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Drugs have been a problem for many years. It is one of </p>

<p> the greatest public evils in the United States. </p>

<p> The present administration has demonstrated a profound </p>

<p> lack of understanding on the drug issue. The First Lady </p>

<p> has told us to &quot;Just Say No,&quot; while the President
has said </p>

<p> no to an effective policy to rapidly eradicate drug crops </p>

<p> from society. </p>

<p> It seems incontrovertible that the immediate effect of </p>

<p> legalization would be rampant drug use. This would occur </p>

<p> for at least a short period, as the lion that has been </p>

<p> held captive for many years would be let out of the den. </p>

<p> Even if legalization were to have the desired effect, it </p>

<p> would not work until the lion became accustomed to the new </p>

<p> liberties. That could be a very long time, and the Nation </p>

<p> could not afford to wait. </p>

<p> Legalization could lead to a legal and constitutional </p>

<p> quagmire, in which the newly legal rights of individuals </p>

<p> must be merged with the obligation to protect society. </p>

<p> HON. DANIEL K. AKAKA (D-HI), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The issue is not whether we ought to sanction the use of </p>

<p> drugs, but whether legalization can break the stranglehold </p>

<p> that drugs have had on our communities. </p>

<p> We have contended that drugs affect all of us, not just </p>

<p> users and pushers. That has never been more apparent than </p>

<p> it is today. </p>

<p> HON. FRANK J. GUARINI (D-NJ), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Legalization is not the cure for the Nation's drug </p>

<p> problems. It is the wrong policy, and it sends the wrong </p>

<p> signal. It sends the signal to the drug lords that the </p>

<p> Nation has lost, and they have won. It tells America's </p>

<p> youth that the U.S. Government says yes to drugs. </p>

<p> People should be motivated so that they don't need drugs. </p>

<p> They need to be given something to believe in. A sense of </p>

<p> purpose and a spirit of idealism need to be renewed in </p>

<p> America. Hope and dreams should replace despair and </p>

<p> hunger. </p>

<p> There should be a dialog on the issue, as it may in the </p>

<p> long run contribute to bringing an end to the drug crisis. </p>

<p> HoN. DANTE B. FASCELL (D-FL), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The fight against drugs must focus on interdiction, </p>

<p> education, and rehabilitation. We just passed an oninibus </p>

<p> drug bill in the House, but no matter how vigorously we </p>

<p> attack the problem, we must key on reducing demand. </p>

<p> The issue should be discussed, and all views should get a </p>

<p> fair hearing. But legalization and decriminalization are </p>

<p> not the solutions to the drug problem. </p>

<p> A clear connection has been established between crime and </p>

<p> drugs. While many individuals commit crimes to get drugs, </p>

<p> others who commit crimes are found to have used illicit </p>

<p> drugs just prior to the commission of the crime. </p>

<p> Legalization will compound the situation because drugs </p>

<p> will be easier to obtain. It sends a misguided and </p>

<p> contradictory signal. </p>

<p> If drugs were legalized, how would we be able to tell our </p>

<p> kids to stay off drugs? How can we urge other countries </p>

<p> to work with us in interdiction and eradication efforts? </p>

<p> We must increase aid to State and local law agencies. </p>

<p> Efforts must be concentrated on interdiction, demand </p>

<p> reduction, and on rehabilitation and education. </p>

<p> HON. WILLIAM J. HUGHES (D-NJ), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> I am very much opposed to legalization. This view comes </p>

<p> after reflecting on 24 years as either a prosecutor or a </p>

<p> Member of Congress. </p>

<p> Where in the entire world has legalization worked? </p>

<p> Witnesses would do well to indicate this to the committee </p>

<p> in testimony. Also, indicate to the committee how the </p>

<p> profits are going to be removed from the drug trade under </p>

<p> legalization. The black market will not be eliminated. </p>

<p> Policies of recent years are workable if they are followed </p>

<p> with the proper commitment. To date, the commitment has </p>

<p> not been made in terms of effort and resources. </p>

<p> The Nation's strategy is good. Many of the provisions in </p>

<p> the omnibus drug bill advance us in the right direction. </p>

<p> Once the Nation gets serious about the problem, we will </p>

<p> begin to turn the corner. </p>

<p> HoN. SOLOMON P. ORTIZ (D-TX), SELECT COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p> NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> Drugs take away the God-given gift of human potential that </p>

<p> we all have. Illegal drugs are damaging our children, our </p>

<p> communities and our Nation as a whole. None of this would </p>

<p> change under legalization. </p>

<p> The question of legalization is not one of economics or </p>

<p> money or the black market. </p>

<p> The position of those who advocate legalization is </p>

<p> recognized. But when reasonable people discuss </p>

<p> unreasonable proposals, it is a sad commentary on the </p>

<p> impact that illegal drugs have had on society. </p>

<p> HoN. KWEISI MFUMF (D-MD), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> I am extremely opposed to the concept of legalization. </p>

<p> However, it is important that the debate take place. </p>

<p> Both sides in the debate agree on one thing: Illicit drugs </p>

<p> are tearing our Nation apart. It is estimated that some </p>

<p> 23 million Americans use illicit drugs once monthly. A </p>

<p> total of 6 million of these people use cocaine. Young </p>

<p> people in the United States use illicit drugs more than </p>

<p> their counterparts in any other nation of the world. </p>

<p> Proponents argue that legalization would remove the profit </p>

<p> motive. That may very well be, but drug use is driven by </p>

<p> demand and that's where more attention needs to be focused </p>

<p> nationally. </p>

<p> History shows that drugs made legal for adult consumption </p>

<p> cannot be kept out of the hands of children. Under </p>

<p> legalization, more children and young people would </p>

<p> experiment with drugs, as is the case with alcohol. It </p>

<p> has been estimated that about 75 percent of all drug users </p>

<p> become addicted. </p>

<p> Proponents often point to England and Holland as models </p>

<p> for a legalization proposal. But the concept has not </p>

<p> worked in either of those two countries. The policy of </p>

<p> legalized heroin had to be discontinued in England as the </p>

<p> number of heroin users increased and the black market </p>

<p> continued to thrive. In Amsterdam, Holland, where </p>

<p> marijuana is legal, crime and hard drug use remains a </p>

<p> problem. </p>

<p> An additional consideration is the threat of babies born </p>

<p> to drugaddicted mothers. That probably would be </p>

<p> exacerbated under legalization. So would other problems, </p>

<p> such as car and train accidents and corruption. </p>

<p> The U.S. focus on eliminating the drug problem should </p>

<p> expand beyond the one-dimensional effort to stop the </p>

<p> supply. More focus should be placed on demand reduction, </p>

<p> specifically treatment and rehabilitation. </p>

<p> If the United States is fighting a war on drugs, the </p>

<p> battlefields are not in Colombia and Bolivia, but rather </p>

<p> in our schools and our communities. </p>

<p> HON. MICHAEL OXLEY (R-OH), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE AND CONTROL </p>

<p> The idea of legalization should not even be dignified with </p>

<p> a 2-day hearing by the committee. </p>

<p> Consideration of the notion of legalization sends a bad </p>

<p> message to the rest of the Nation and to the rest of the </p>

<p> world. America's teenagers who may be considering </p>

<p> experimenting with drugs may see that legalization is </p>

<p> being considered and think that it is now OK to use drugs. </p>

<p> Legalization is unacceptable in a civilized society. </p>

<p> My hope for an outcome to the hearings is that the book on </p>

<p> legalization will be closed once and for all. </p>

<p> HON. Tom LEWIS (R-FL), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS </p>

<p> ABUSE </p>

<p> AND CONTROL </p>

<p> It is contradictory that those committed to fighting drugs </p>

<p> have agreed to give a hearing to the legalization issue. </p>

<p> Making drugs more affordable and more available could be </p>

<p> detrimental to society. Particularly objectionable is the </p>

<p> view of legalization advocates that the government itself </p>

<p> can make a profit from the drug trade. </p>

<p> Legalizing drug profits and making dealers out of the </p>

<p> government and private citizens is appalling. </p>

<p> HON. CARROLL HUBBARD, JR. (D-KY) </p>

<p> The urban drug problem is well known. But the war on </p>

<p> drugs needs to be fought in rural America, as well. The </p>

<p> drug problem is acute and serious in outlying areas. </p>

<p> In my own congressional district, in western Kentucky, the </p>

<p> U.S. Customs Service is aware of the severity of the drug </p>

<p> problem. They and the Drug Enforcement Administration </p>

<p> know of contraband-carrying flights from Colombia and </p>

<p> Mexico that arrive at our rural airports. These small </p>

<p> airports are safer for drug dealers than flying into </p>

<p> places like New Orleans and Miami. </p>

<p> I hope that the Congress will be able to lead the public </p>

<p> and our government away from legalization. I hope that </p>

<p> those who are proposing legalization would realize that </p>

<p> more people would experiment with drugs under Such a plan. </p>

<p> In my district, even the schools are not immune to the </p>

<p> drug trade. At a grand jury hearing last December in </p>

<p> Bowling Green, I testified that there were individuals </p>

<p> selling drugs to Western Kentucky University students. My </p>

<p> wife and I received death threats as a result of my </p>

<p> testimony, in which names were revealed. </p>

<p> Like others, I wonder what we can do to increase education </p>

<p> about drug abuse, and move as a nation toward a spiritual, </p>

<p> rather than chemical, dependence. </p>

<p> HON. ROBERT GARCIA (D-NY) </p>

<p> Legalization poses dangerous repercussions for the Nation. </p>

<p> It cannot be risked. It could not be sustained. </p>

<p> The legalization proposal comes at a time when public </p>

<p> opinion toward drug abuse is beginning to take a turn for </p>

<p> the positive, and after the House has just passed major </p>

<p> antidrug legislation to improve on the 1986 antidrug bill. </p>

<p> Given the problems we continue to experience with tobacco </p>

<p> and alcohol, the risks of legalization are just too great. </p>

<p> The biggest concern about legalization is the effect that </p>

<p> it would have on America's youth. Legalization would </p>

<p> result in the widespread use of drugs, especially among </p>

<p> youth. The greatest impact would be felt in minority </p>

<p> communities and in the inner city. </p>

<p> As long as there are drug users who cannot afford drugs </p>

<p> legally, there will be a black market. Unless we legalize </p>

<p> all drugs-including crack, PCP, LSD-and unless we make </p>

<p> them universally available, there will be crime. </p>

<p> Legalization fails to take into account whether special </p>

<p> restrictions would have to be placed on pilots, law </p>

<p> officers, truck drivers and others in hazardous </p>

<p> occupations. It also fails to consider the spread of AIDS </p>

<p> through intravenous drug use. </p>

<p> HON. Roy DYSON (D-MD) </p>

<p> Legalization is a foolhardy and reckless proposal that </p>

<p> would have a negative impact on the family. </p>

<p> The drug problem has filtered down to rural America. In </p>

<p> one of the counties located in my district, the number of </p>

<p> drug offenses rose 114 percent from 1986 to 1987. </p>

<p> Activists like Timothy Leary, Alan Ginsberg and Jerry </p>

<p> Rubin 20 years ago advocated that drug use was okay and </p>

<p> should be accepted as a form of escapism from the rough </p>

<p> times of the real world. But over the past 20 years, we </p>

<p> have seen the personal and financial ruin that drug use </p>

<p> brings about. </p>

<p> Under legalization, America would become enslaved to </p>

<p> drugs. Decriminalization is simply a backdoor way of </p>

<p> legalizing narcotics. </p>

<p> Legalization would send a bad message. It would increase </p>

<p> drug use and addiction. It would result in the </p>

<p> expenditure of billions of additional dollars in health </p>

<p> care costs and in lost productivity. </p>

<p> We must begin teaching our children at an early age about </p>

<p> the dangers of harmful drugs. Though education must play </p>

<p> a vital role in our antidrug efforts, we must still </p>

<p> initiate stiff sanctions against those who grow, use and </p>

<p> sell illicit narcotics. </p>

<p> HoN. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN (D-MD) </p>

<p> In a survey of my Third Congressional District (portions </p>

<p> of Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Howard County), 69 </p>

<p> percent of the respondents oppose legalization and </p>

<p> decriminalization. </p>

<p> A war on drugs cannot be won unless the profit is taken </p>

<p> out of the drug trade. But decriminalization is not the </p>

<p> way to accomplish that. </p>

<p> Constituents are saying that our discussions on the </p>

<p> national drug debate should also take into account the </p>

<p> damage from other harmful substances, such as alcohol and </p>

<p> cigarettes. </p>

<p> More money should be focused on establishing effective </p>

<p> treatment and education programs if a real war on drugs is </p>

<p> going to be waged. </p>

<p> What is needed is a comprehensive approach combining </p>

<p> foreign and domestic policy sensitive to the urgency of </p>

<p> interdiction efforts, stricter enforcement, more resources </p>

<p> to educate our youth to the dangers of drugs and treatment </p>

<p> programs without waiting lists. </p>

<p> Summary of Testimony From Thursday, September 29, 1988 </p>

<p> MAYOR KURT L, SCHMOKE, BALTIMORE </p>

<p> America needs to reexamine its current drug policy. The </p>

<p> Nation is spending about $10 billion annually to enforce </p>

<p> drug laws that are catching only a fraction of the </p>

<p> violators. </p>

<p> The drug problem in America is defined in two components: </p>

<p> addiction and crime. Law enforcement is unable to resolve </p>

<p> either of these two problems and actually has worsened the </p>

<p> crime problem. The black market is a result of the </p>

<p> manufacture and sale of cocaine being criminalized and </p>

<p> profits from drug sale-, are enormous because the </p>

<p> substances cannot be obtained legally. </p>

<p> Nationwide, there were 750,000 drug arrests in 1987 and </p>

<p> Baltimore had 12,000 drug arrests, yet both represent only </p>

<p> a fraction of the drug violators. Prisons and jails are </p>

<p> packed with drug offenders, One-third of all Federal </p>

<p> prisoners are incarcerated on drug offenses. </p>

<p> Cigarettes kill hundreds of thousands, but no move has </p>

<p> been made to make them illegal. Antismoking campaigns and </p>

<p> other </p>

<p> Neither PCP nor LSD should be legalized. But a </p>

<p> maintenance system involving designated hospitals should </p>

<p> be implemented for cocaine and heroin abusers, with the </p>

<p> opportunity for abusers to enroll in a treatment program </p>

<p> aimed at reducing the intake of either of these drugs down </p>

<p> to zero. </p>

<p> MAYOR EDWARD I. KOCH OF NEW YORK CITY </p>

<p> Mayor Schmoke's proposal to maintain heroin and cocaine </p>

<p> addicts is not new. The concept has been tried in Great </p>

<p> Britain, and it has failed. Addiction and crime both rose </p>

<p> as a result of doctorprescribed drug maintenance in that </p>

<p> country. </p>

<p> Legally received cocaine could be turned into the </p>

<p> derivative crack by mixing in baking soda or some other </p>

<p> base in the heating process. This would be a </p>

<p> surreptitious way for crack addicts to obtain their fix if </p>

<p> cocaine and heroin were legalized and prescribed. </p>

<p> Organized crime still, would play a role in drug </p>

<p> production and distribution for those who are either </p>

<p> underage or cannot get the amount and quality they desire. </p>

<p> In Great Britain, 84 percent of the government-registered </p>

<p> addicts during that country's heroin maintenance program </p>

<p> were discovered to be using other drugs illicitly. </p>

<p> With a population of 240 million people and about 6 </p>

<p> million regular drug users in that group, drugs still </p>

<p> remain unacceptable and drug users remain a sizable </p>

<p> minority in the Nation. If legalization were to go into </p>

<p> effect, there would be a gradual acceptability that would </p>

<p> lead to an increase in users. </p>

<p> There is little distinction between decriminalization and </p>

<p> legalization, and both are bad ideas that should be </p>

<p> opposed. </p>

<p> MAYOR DENNIS CALLAHAN OF ANNAPOLIS, MD </p>

<p> The most compelling argument for not supporting the notion </p>

<p> of legalization comes from the problems our society </p>

<p> currently experiences with alcohol. According to the </p>

<p> Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina, alcohol </p>

<p> abuse costs America about $117 billion annually in </p>

<p> medical, property, productivity and other losses. Of this </p>

<p> amount, only about $2,5 billion related to law enforcement </p>

<p> costs while the rest concerned accidents and other </p>

<p> problems associated with the abuse of alcohol. </p>

<p> Even marijuana should not be legalized. Advocates for </p>

<p> legalizing only this drug claim an overdose of it would </p>

<p> only put the user to sleep, but they could be asleep while </p>

<p> at the controls of a locomotive or another vehicle. </p>

<p> In Alaska, marijuana can be grown legally on private plots </p>

<p> and it can be consumed on the premises. A survey of </p>

<p> 250,000 high school students done by the Atlanta-based </p>

<p> organization, Parents' Resource Institute, indicates that </p>

<p> about one in five of those surveyed admitted to smoking </p>

<p> marijuana. About one in two of those surveyed in Alaska </p>

<p> admitted to smoking marijuana. It appears that the </p>

<p> sanctioning of marijuana use has contributed significantly </p>

<p> to the much higher usage figure in this State compared to </p>

<p> the rest of the Nation. </p>

<p> HoN. JACK LAWN, ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT </p>

<p> ADMINISTRATION </p>

<p> Drugs are not bad because they are illegal. Instead, </p>

<p> drugs are illegal because they are bad, and legalization </p>

<p> advocates are missing the point in blaming drug laws for </p>

<p> the crime and violence that has resulted from the Nation's </p>

<p> drug crisis. </p>

<p> The problems that we continue to experience with legalized </p>

<p> alcohol use provide strong evidence that legalization </p>

<p> would be a bad idea. Greater availability results in </p>

<p> greater use and greater abuse. </p>

<p> The National Council on Alcoholism reports that one of </p>

<p> every three American adults contends that alcohol has </p>

<p> brought them family trouble. About 100,000 10- and 11- </p>

<p> year-olds reported getting drunk once weekly in 1985, and </p>

<p> about 100,000 deaths a year in the United States can be </p>

<p> attributed to alcoholism. Of that number, 23,000 are </p>

<p> killed on highways and cirrhosis of the liver is the </p>

<p> sixthleading cause of death in America. </p>

<p> The United States is signatory to the Single Convention on </p>

<p> Drugs of 1961, and to the Convention of Psychotropic Drugs </p>

<p> of 1971. Both these treaties require the country to </p>

<p> establish and maintain effective controls on illicit </p>

<p> substances. The sanctity of these treaties and U.S. </p>

<p> credibility in the international right against drug abuse </p>

<p> would be severely damaged if these substances were </p>

<p> legalized. </p>

<p> Legalization would adversely affect.young people and the </p>

<p> crime rate. The American public has said in recent </p>

<p> opinion polls that it opposes legalization. </p>

<p> Legalization is a simple answer to a complex problem. The </p>

<p> answer in fighting the drug crisis comes from focusing </p>

<p> more on demand reduction efforts. </p>

<p> ARTHUR C. &quot;CAPPY&quot; EADS, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD,
NATIONAL </p>

<p> DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, 27TH </p>

<p> JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, BELTON, TX </p>

<p> The whole notion of legalizing drugs ignores the reason </p>

<p> why drugs were made illegal in the first place. They are </p>

<p> bad for the user, the community and society as a whole. </p>

<p> Drug use often translates into child neglect and abuse, </p>

<p> runaways, molestation and other crimes and maladies that </p>

<p> result from individuals being under the influence of </p>

<p> drugs. </p>

<p> It is wrong to assume that funding for enforcement versus </p>

<p> funding for treatment and rehabilitation are distinctly </p>

<p> different, and that they are competing categories, as both </p>

<p> areas must be adequately funded for an effective antidrug </p>

<p> strategy. Effective treatment programs are essential in </p>

<p> sentencing drug offenders, while sanctions against drug </p>

<p> use are critical components of a treatment and prevention </p>

<p> strategy. </p>

<p> We have yet to implement in the United States, a full- </p>

<p> scale attack on the drug problem combining law </p>

<p> enforcement, treatment and prevention efforts into an </p>

<p> effective strategy. </p>

<p> HON. STERLING JOHNSON, JR., SPECIAL NARCOTICS PROSECUTOR, </p>

<p> NEW YORK CITY </p>

<p> Calls for legalization are borne from frustration with an </p>

<p> inadequate response from the executive branch of the </p>

<p> government. Unfortunately, not one single piece of </p>

<p> antidrug legislation has come from the executive branch of </p>

<p> the government. The only major antidrug legislation has </p>

<p> come from Congress. </p>

<p> It is improbable that heroin addicts could be </p>

<p> maintained, as Mayor Schmoke contends. If an addict's </p>

<p> habit is maintained at a certain level, over time the </p>

<p> level of that addict's habit will rise. The black market </p>

<p> would remain in existence under legalization. Further, </p>

<p> the matter of whether doctors, pilots and other people in </p>

<p> sensitive occupations would be allowed to use legal drugs </p>

<p> must be examined closely. </p>

<p> Legalized drugs will not stop crime, and the experience </p>

<p> with prescribed heroin in Great Britain provides evidence </p>

<p> that a downward trend in crime is not necessarily the case </p>

<p> of lessened restrictions on drug use. </p>

<p> Finally, the concept of free needles, which is supported </p>

<p> by Mayor Schmoke and also New York Citv Mayor Koch, is a </p>

<p> bad idea. It sends out erroneous signals that conflict </p>

<p> with any and all efforts to put an end to the use of </p>

<p> harmful illicit drugs. </p>

<p> JERALD VAUGHN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL </p>

<p> ASSOCIATION OF CHIEFS OF POLICE </p>

<p> The IACP represents more than 15,000 top-level law </p>

<p> enforcement executives in the United States. The group is </p>

<p> unequivocally opposed to drug legalization. </p>

<p> Overcrowded jails and prisons and loaded court dockets </p>

<p> indicate success, rather than failure, of law enforcement </p>

<p> in the battle against illicit drugs. Money is not being </p>

<p> wasted on law enforcement, as only 3 percent of all </p>

<p> expenditures at the Federal, State and local level involve </p>

<p> the civil and criminal justice system. A total of 1.4 </p>

<p> percent of Government spending goes toward the provision </p>

<p> of law enforcement services, and less than 1 percent of </p>

<p> the Federal budget is earmarked for law enforcement. </p>

<p> Less than 500,000 law enforcement officers are assigned to </p>

<p> protect more than 245 million American citizens, and the </p>

<p> lead antidrug agency has just 3,000 officers. </p>

<p> The IACP, in conjunction with the Justice Department, the </p>

<p> Bureau of Justice Assistance and DEA, called together law </p>

<p> enforcement authorities from all levels for five drug </p>

<p> strategy sessions in 1987. A major finding from those </p>

<p> sessions was that crime could be reduced through </p>

<p> cooperative community strategies. This information was </p>

<p> produced in manual form. </p>

<p> The United States has seen fit to protect Americans from </p>

<p> substances that may be harmful through the regulation of </p>

<p> the sale and distribution of these products. There has </p>

<p> lieen little complaint about the infringement on </p>

<p> individual rights in the process. It is understood that </p>

<p> these products-meats, milk, prescription drugs, serums and </p>

<p> vaccines-are regulated because the manufacturer alone </p>

<p> cannot be depended upon to put the interests of the </p>

<p> consumer ahead of the interests of profit. </p>

<p> Legalization is not a realistic option. At best, it is a </p>

<p> last resort when all else has truly failed. </p>

<p> WILLIAM CHAMBLISS, PH.D., PROFESSOR, GEORGE WASHINGTON </p>

<p> UNIVERSITY </p>

<p> The drug trade was estimated at about $1 billion a year 50 </p>

<p> years ago in 1938. Today, it is valued at somewhere </p>

<p> around $130 billion, which is larger than the gross </p>

<p> national product of most nations in the world and many </p>

<p> multinational corporations, </p>

<p> Drug profits remain essential to the survival of organized </p>

<p> crime. Churning out these profits and protecting them </p>

<p> involves engendering corruption of law enforcement </p>

<p> authorities, and this remains an ongoing goal of organized </p>

<p> crime, which remains a hazard of trying to stop the flow </p>

<p> and use of drugs by criminalizing it. </p>

<p> Because of the level of poverty and other factors, it is </p>

<p> impossible to expect a complete end to the drug trade even </p>

<p> if police were able to arrest each and every drug pusher </p>

<p> tomorrow. The costs of enforcing drug laws outweighs the </p>

<p> benefits, </p>

<p> A new drug policy should first take into account that </p>

<p> marijuana should be considered separately from such </p>

<p> substances as cocaine and heroin. States that have </p>

<p> decriminalized marijuana have had positive experiences as </p>

<p> a result. </p>

<p> Although the experiment with prescribed heroin in Great </p>

<p> Britain has not been totally successful, it is more </p>

<p> successful than what the United States has experienced </p>

<p> with criminalized heroin. Both heroin and cocaine should </p>

<p> be legalized and dispensed by medical professionals. </p>

<p> DR. CHARLES R. SCHUSTER, PH.D., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL </p>

<p> INSTITUTE </p>

<p> ON DRUG ABUSE </p>

<p> NIDA is strongly opposed to the legalization of illicit </p>

<p> narcotics. </p>

<p> First, there are a series of questions-including the many </p>

<p> posed by Chairman Rangel-that must be answered before we </p>

<p> can even begin to consider something as complicated as </p>

<p> legalization. For example, the pharmacological effects of </p>

<p> cocaine differ so that it is impossible to consider how </p>

<p> much would be considered enough, or a legal limit. </p>

<p> Second, there appears to be an attitude readjustment </p>

<p> occurring regarding drug abuse. According to the latest </p>

<p> national high school survey on drug abuse, drugs are being </p>

<p> seen by this group as more dangerous and there is a </p>

<p> reporting of more self-abstention from illicit drug use </p>

<p> than in other recent high school surveys. </p>

<p> In the 1980 survey, 11 percent of the respondents reported </p>

<p> daily marijuana use. The 1986-87 survey indicated that </p>

<p> figure had dropped to 3.3 percent. </p>

<p> As attitudes among adults and teenagers change, so will </p>

<p> behavior. What is also needed are more good treatment </p>

<p> programs, since we know that effective treatment works. </p>

<p> DR. ARNOLD TREBACH, PH.D., FOUNDER, DRUG POLICY INSTITUTE </p>

<p> America would be better off if all drug laws were removed </p>

<p> today. Americans are at their best when they negotiate </p>

<p> settlements, and at their worst when arguments are pushed </p>

<p> to the wall. </p>

<p> It is absolutely essential that we remove laws restricting </p>

<p> use of marijuana and heroin for medicinal purposes. It is </p>

<p> also important to begin viewing drug addicts from a </p>

<p> different perspective. We should be more concerned about </p>

<p> getting them treatment rather than branding them </p>

<p> criminals. This would include some form of maintenance, </p>

<p> which is admittedly controversial. </p>

<p> There should be limited experimentation with recreational </p>

<p> drugs. The 1973 Nixon Commission on Marijuana and Drug </p>

<p> Abuse as well as the 1982 report of the National Academy </p>

<p> of Sciences suggest an attempt at limited </p>

<p> decriminalization or legalization. </p>

<p> ADM. JAMES WATKINS, U.S. NAVV (RET.), CHAIRMAN, </p>

<p> PRESIDENT'S </p>

<p> AIDS COMMISSION </p>

<p> An emerging problem stemming from rampant drug abuse is </p>

<p> that of AIDS. One of the conduits of the deadly HIV virus </p>

<p> that leads to AIDS is contact with an individual who is an </p>

<p> abuser of drugs intravenously. </p>

<p> The IV drug abusers make up only 25 percent of all AIDS </p>

<p> victims, but about 70 percent of heterosexual native </p>

<p> citizens have contracted the disease from contact with an </p>

<p> intravenous drug abuser. About 70 percent of perinatal </p>

<p> AIDS cases involve a parent who is either an IV drug </p>

<p> abuser or who has a sexual partner who abuses drugs </p>

<p> intravenously. </p>

<p> More treatment is needed for IV drug abusers. There are </p>

<p> some 1.2 million IV drug abusers in the United States, but </p>

<p> only about 148,000 are in some form of treatment at any </p>

<p> given time. </p>

<p> What is needed is a full-scale effort that addresses both </p>

<p> supply and demand. </p>

<p> During its time as functioning body, the President's AIDS </p>

<p> Commission heard testimony regarding the use of needle </p>

<p> exchange programs. The overriding opinion of many black </p>

<p> leaders who testified at an inquiry held in New York City </p>

<p> is that IV drug abuse is killing the black community. </p>

<p> However, these same leaders were opposed to needle </p>

<p> exchange programs, and view them as a copout answer to a </p>

<p> very serious problem. They are considered the first step </p>

<p> to full-fledged legalization. </p>

<p> The most important thing that can be done to lick the drug </p>

<p> problem is to help young people avoid using drugs in the </p>

<p> first place. </p>

<p> DR. TOD MIKURIYA, M.D., PSYCHIATRIST, BERKELEY, CA </p>

<p> It is good to see an increase in public awareness about </p>

<p> the dangers of alcohol and tobacco and about the </p>

<p> increasing tendency to classify them as drugs of abuse. </p>

<p> While we focus heavily on the problems of drugs like </p>

<p> cocaine and crack, very little attention has been paid to </p>

<p> the problems caused by poisoning from alcohol and tobacco. </p>

<p> We need to move closer to acceptance of these substances </p>

<p> as dangerous drugs. </p>

<p> A comprehensive proposal regarding drug use in America </p>

<p> would encompass the following six points: </p>

<p> (1) The removal of product liability exemptions for </p>

<p> alcohol. </p>

<p> (2) The removal of price supports for tobacco. </p>

<p> (3) The establishment of a drug users' cooperative. </p>

<p> (4) The legalization of home cultivation of cannabis. </p>

<p> (5) The disallowance of searches of citizens' homes </p>

<p> without a warrant. </p>

<p> (6) A testing of those who test others for drug use. </p>

<p> JOHN GUSTAFSON, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, NEW YORK DIVISION OF </p>

<p> SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES </p>

<p> Our agency oversees about 400 local treatment and </p>

<p> prevention programs, with a capacity to treat 46,000 </p>

<p> people and to provide counseling services to another </p>

<p> 17,000. </p>

<p> About 22 percent of New York's population has abused some </p>

<p> type of substance within the last 6 months. Half of this </p>

<p> number abuses drugs on a regular basis. More than 600,000 </p>

<p> people art- considered non-narcotic substance abusers and </p>

<p> about 260,000 are narcotics addicts. </p>

<p> The social and health consequences of legalization would </p>

<p> be too great. Legalization advocates are ignoring the </p>

<p> seductive properties of drugs like cocaine, which </p>

<p> laboratory tests show leave the user craving for more. </p>

<p> While alcohol Prohibition may have been a law enforcement </p>

<p> failure, it was a success healthwise. During the 1920's, </p>

<p> alcohol-related mental illness declined significantly, but </p>

<p> shot back up after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. </p>

<p> From 1917 until 1921, New York State made narcotics </p>

<p> available through clinics. But that practice was </p>

<p> discontinued after it was discovered that many people were </p>

<p> supplementing their legal supply with drugs purchased from </p>

<p> the black market. This is a lesson for those considering </p>

<p> legalization today. </p>

<p> We cannot overlook the impact that legalization would have </p>

<p> on health and health care systems. Many illicit drugs </p>

<p> lead to chronic health problems for users, and this </p>

<p> problem would be pronounced under legalization. </p>

<p> STEVEN WISOTSKY, PROFESSOR OF LAW, NOVA UNIVERSITY </p>

<p> An independent national commission should be set up to </p>

<p> take a fresh look at U.S. drug policy. Such a commission </p>

<p> should have two fundamental goals: To reduce drug abuse, </p>

<p> and to reduce the social problems stemming from the </p>

<p> existence of the black market illicit drug trade. </p>

<p> A clear definition should be reached and agreed upon in </p>

<p> terms of what &quot;the drug problem&quot; in America is. Is
it </p>

<p> drug use in general? Is it drug use by children and </p>

<p> teenagers? Is it drug use that proves to be injurious to </p>

<p> others or to the drug users themselves? Is it the black </p>

<p> market and the events associated with that market in terms </p>

<p> of crime and violence? </p>

<p> Detailed studies and polls should be conducted to </p>

<p> determine how drugs should be legalized. This should be </p>

<p> along the lines of marketing surveys done to prepare for </p>

<p> the sale and distribution of other products. </p>

<p> For example, focus groups can be set up, and groups of </p>

<p> individuals-such as prison volunteers serving life </p>

<p> sentences-can be used for tracking the effects of certain </p>

<p> drugs and also for gauging the addictive qualities of </p>

<p> narcotics. </p>

<p> Among the priorities of drug control should be the </p>

<p> protection of children, the protection of the safety and </p>

<p> health of the public and the preservation of individual </p>

<p> liberties in the process. </p>

<p> The real moral high ground in finding a Solution to the </p>

<p> drug crisis is one that will allow responsible, competent </p>

<p> adults to have the freedom of choice so long as they do </p>

<p> not intrude on the rights and privileges of others. No </p>

<p> drug control policy should affront the Constitution. </p>

<p> DR. MITCHELL ROSENTHAL, M.D., PRESIDENT, PHOENIX HOUSE, </p>

<p> NEW YORK, NY </p>

<p> Drug legalization would increase drug use and would </p>

<p> further aggravate all the destabilizing influences that </p>

<p> plague societv today. </p>

<p> Addiction to illicit drugs has an enormous impact on the </p>

<p> character, behavior and values of the abuser. While just </p>

<p> as many cigarette smokers have become dependent on that </p>

<p> product, the number of cocaine users, the power of cocaine </p>

<p> addiction and the amounts that addicts would use if it </p>

<p> were readily available and less expensive is ignored by </p>

<p> those pushing legalization. </p>

<p> Illicit drug use rapidly diminishes one's ability to lead </p>

<p> a normal, productive life. Drug abuse causes self- </p>

<p> destructive behavior, lowering the self-esteem and </p>

<p> creating the potential for violent, antisocial behavior. </p>

<p> Projections that drug use would double or even triple </p>

<p> under legalization should be taken seriously. The </p>

<p> greatest increase would come from those between the ages </p>

<p> of 12 and 21 years old. Projections of drug-related </p>

<p> deaths post-legalization range from 100,000 to 500,000. </p>

<p> The social order will suffer. Drug users are generally </p>

<p> irresponsible people whose deviant behavior ranges from </p>

<p> destroying relationships to inability to lead productive </p>

<p> work lives to crime. All of these possibilities will be </p>

<p> raised with legalized drugs. </p>

<p> We can realistically expect to overcome the drug crisis </p>

<p> with a shifting public attitude and a stronger effort to </p>

<p> enforce drug laws on the street. </p>

<p> ETHAN NADELMANN, PH.D., ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, PRINCETON </p>

<p> UNIVERSITY </p>

<p> Neither legalization nor decriminalization should be </p>

<p> considered a surrender. They are the policies that drug </p>

<p> dealers fear most. </p>

<p> What is legalization? It is a model of analysis. It is a </p>

<p> cost benefit analysis of current policies. We have to </p>

<p> look at our policy and costs and compare to other systems </p>

<p> and figure out which has the most benefits for the money- </p>

<p> What is the drug problem? This must be defined before </p>

<p> going further. In the 1920's, people did not talk of
&quot;the </p>

<p> alcohol problem.&quot; Instead, they separated the problem
into </p>

<p> one of crime--the Al Capone types and their influence on </p>

<p> the consumption of alcoholand into another category of </p>

<p> alcohol abuse. It was decided that Prohibition was not </p>

<p> worth the costs, even if it reduced abuse to a degree. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, today the drug problem is not separated as </p>

<p> such and &quot;the drug problem&quot; is defined as both
crime and </p>

<p> abuse. </p>

<p> We will not be able to move forward until we make the </p>

<p> distinction as was made with alcohol in the 1920's. </p>

<p> Nearly 20 percent of all State and local resources go to </p>

<p> fighting drugs, In Washington, DC, more than half the </p>

<p> people in jail are there on drug-related charges, and the </p>

<p> figure in New York City is about 40 percent. </p>

<p> SUE RUSCHE, NATIONAL DRUG INFORMATION CENTER, FAMILIES IN </p>

<p> ACTION </p>

<p> It is important that the perspective of families be </p>

<p> included in the national debate on legalization. </p>

<p> In looking at both the alcohol and cigarette industries </p>

<p> they spent more on advertising in the previous year than </p>

<p> Congress appropriated to fight the drug crisis. We do not </p>

<p> need any more legal industries of this sort amassing large </p>

<p> profits in selling their products to our children and to </p>

<p> ourselves. </p>

<p> Some legalization proponents make the argument that </p>

<p> alcohol is legal and is not sold to young people. But </p>

<p> alcohol sales to minors are routine as sales clerks fail </p>

<p> to ask for identification or look the other way when </p>

<p> obviously underage young people make an alcohol purchase. </p>

<p> If we cannot expect the alcohol and tobacco industry to </p>

<p> prevent sales to minors, then how can we expect a cocaine </p>

<p> or opiate industry from doing the same? </p>

<p> At the very least, illicit drugs are as harmful as alcohol </p>

<p> and tobacco. Fewer people die from them than from alcohol </p>

<p> and tobacco because fewer people use them, and fewer </p>

<p> people use them because they are illegal. There are 18 </p>

<p> million marijuana users compared to 116 million alcohol </p>

<p> users; and there are 6 million cocaine users compared to </p>

<p> 60 million tobacco users. </p>

<p> Alcohol and tobacco are leading killers in the United </p>

<p> States. We do not live with alcohol and tobacco, we die </p>

<p> with them. It would take two walls like the Vietnam </p>

<p> Memorial shrine in Washington, DC to memorialize all those </p>

<p> killed by alcohol in a year. It would take 7 to 10 walls </p>

<p> to cover all those who die from tobacco. </p>

<p> Some say taxes from drugs sales could go toward treatment </p>

<p> and education, but no money from the sale of alcohol and </p>

<p> tobacco ever goes toward education and treatment for those </p>

<p> problems. </p>

<p> Legalization would not eliminate profits- They would </p>

<p> simply be shifted from the drug traffickers on the street </p>

<p> to the people who run legitimate businesses. </p>

<p> It is unreasonable to think that drug use would not </p>

<p> increase under legalization. A total of 11 States have </p>

<p> decriminalized marijuana. From 1972 to 1978, in those </p>

<p> States, marijuana use, as a result of the </p>

<p> decriminalization, rose 125 percent among young adults, </p>

<p> 130 percent among high school seniors, 200 percent among </p>

<p> older adults and 240 percent among teenagers. </p>

<p> We are beginning to see drug use drop off in this country. </p>

<p> We would like to see the Congress create a National Drug </p>

<p> Corps similar to the Peace Corps, where parents and </p>

<p> children could be trained to give I or 2 years of service </p>

<p> fighting drug abuse in their communities. </p>

<p> Summary of Testimony From Friday, September 30,1988 </p>

<p> DR. DAVID F. MUSTO, M.D., DRUG HISTORIAN, YALE UNIVERSiry </p>

<p> Around the turn of the century, drugs such as cocaine, </p>

<p> heroin and morphine were legally sold and consumed in the </p>

<p> United States, Consumption of these drugs reached a peak </p>

<p> around 1890 to 1900. </p>

<p> Because of the high rate of consumption and the effects </p>

<p> these then-legal narcotics were having on individuals and </p>

<p> families, America moved toward enacting laws and controls </p>

<p> that have led to today's drug laws. </p>

<p> We are currently experiencing our second epidemic with </p>

<p> cocaine. The first occurred around the mid 1880's, when </p>

<p> this drug was made available in 14 different forms. One </p>

<p> could smoke it, rub it on in a salve, inject it, or even </p>

<p> sniff it. </p>

<p> Cocaine's image as the &quot;All-American tonic&quot; ended
around </p>

<p> 1900, when it came to be known as the most dangerous drug </p>

<p> in the country. The first congressionally passed </p>

<p> legislation regulating cocaine was in 1914, and was called </p>

<p> the Harrison Narcotics Act. </p>

<p> A key to reducing the demand for drugs will be a changing </p>

<p> of the public's attitudes. </p>

<p> Those supporting a look-see at legalization must be </p>

<p> reminded that there are many things in our society that we </p>

<p> do not attempt a look-see because we know in advance it is </p>

<p> bad and would lead to worse problems. One of them, for </p>

<p> example, is racial discrimination. We ask for laws </p>

<p> restricting it because we know it is bad. </p>

<p> Ending the drug crisis will be a very gradual thing. It </p>

<p> cannot be done in just 2 or 3 years. Drug use in America </p>

<p> peaked around 1979, and at that time there was a call for </p>

<p> legalization. </p>

<p> The argument for legalizing cocaine in the 1970's was that </p>

<p> cocaine was a harmless drug unless misused. Today, the </p>

<p> argument is that legalizing it will remove the criminal </p>

<p> influence. We now see cocaine as bad in itself, and this </p>

<p> is a tremendous attitude turnaround that can be used as a </p>

<p> foundation for a further decline in cocaine usage. </p>

<p> DR. DALE MASI, PROFESSOR, SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK AND </p>

<p> COMMUNITY PLANNING, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND </p>

<p> The workplace cannot afford the legalization of illicit </p>

<p> drugs. </p>

<p> In previous testimony before the Select Committee on </p>

<p> Narcotics Abuse and Control, my position was that there </p>

<p> was a dramatic need for an increase in industry drug </p>

<p> programs in this country. That need is greater today: </p>

<p> (1) A majority of illicit drug users are in the </p>

<p> workplace. </p>

<p> (2) Alcohol is the primary drug of abuse in the </p>

<p> workplace. </p>

<p> (3) Prescription drugs are the second largest drug of </p>

<p> abuse in the workplace. </p>

<p> (4) The most recent surveys indicate that 19- to 25-year- </p>

<p> olds are the biggest abusers of cocaine, with 25- to 30- </p>

<p> year-olds being the second largest group. If cocaine is </p>

<p> legalized, it would outdistance both alcohol and </p>

<p> prescription drugs as the most abused drug in the </p>

<p> workplace. </p>

<p> Drug abuse in the workplace translates into escalating </p>

<p> health insurance bills. In addition, it contributes to </p>

<p> the problems of absenteeism, sick leave, accidents, other </p>

<p> rising health costs and more worker compensation claims. </p>

<p> More emphasis will have to be placed on companies </p>

<p> educating workers about the dangers of drug abuse, as has </p>

<p> been the case with tobacco. Few companies, a study by </p>

<p> Cook and Harrell shows, have drug education promotion </p>

<p> programs. The IBM Corp. stands out as a model for the </p>

<p> rest of the industry in the country. </p>

<p> Schools of medicine, social work and psychology today </p>

<p> rarely require that students take a course in alcohol or </p>

<p> drug addiction. Fewer schools of psychology require a </p>

<p> course in drug addiction than was the case in 1950. The </p>

<p> council on social work education, the accrediting arm for </p>

<p> such schools, does not even require that such courses be </p>

<p> taught for master's and social work candidates. </p>

<p> We need employee assistance programs that concentrate on </p>

<p> reaching employees early. New funds are needed for </p>

<p> meaningful programs, especially outpatient services. </p>

<p> DR. LAWRENCE BROWN, M.D., CLINICAL INSTRUCTOR, DEPARTMENT </p>

<p> OF MEDICINE, HARLEM HOSPITAL CENTER AND THE COLLEGE OF </p>

<p> PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS </p>

<p> Legalization advocates seem to be motivated by two </p>

<p> arguments, One is that current response to the drug crisis </p>

<p> has been shamefully inadequate. Number two, legalization </p>

<p> appears to represent a reasonable alternative to the </p>

<p> current response. </p>

<p> Our current policy on drug abuse can be addressed from two </p>

<p> angles. We can look at it either from the perspective of </p>

<p> those who use drugs, or from the perspective of the </p>

<p> consequences of drug use. </p>

<p> A most common problem of those admitted to Harlem Hospital </p>

<p> for treatment of kidney failure and in need of dialysis is </p>

<p> prior drug abuse. </p>

<p> Our approach to drug abuse as a nation is that we continue </p>

<p> to view it as a stigma, rather than the public health </p>

<p> problem that it truly is. </p>

<p> It is ridiculous that so little of the educational </p>

<p> training involves the study of drug abuse, Professional </p>

<p> and health professional schools should be encouraged to </p>

<p> try to include drug abuse studies in their curriculums. </p>

<p> Existing drug treatment facilities must be improved as </p>

<p> well. The least attractive facilities are often allocated </p>

<p> for outpatient drug treatment services. An expansion of </p>

<p> treatment capability must focus on both quality and </p>

<p> quantity. </p>

<p> The legalization debate provides the country with an </p>

<p> excellent opportunity to reassess Federal drug policy. </p>

<p> These discussions will far exceed their potential if they </p>

<p> are used to chart a bold new course in responding to </p>

<p> America's drug crisis. </p>

<p> DAVID BOAZ, VICE PRESIDENT FOR PUBLIC POLICY AFFAIRS, CATO </p>

<p> INSTITUTE, WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> Alcohol did not cause high crime rates in the 1920's. </p>

<p> Prohibition of alcohol was the problem. With today's drug </p>

<p> crisis, it is not the drugs, but rather the prohibition of </p>

<p> these drugs that are causing problems with crime and </p>

<p> violence. </p>

<p> There are six ways in which drug laws impact negatively on </p>

<p> society: </p>

<p> (1) Drug laws drive up the price. Users are forced to </p>

<p> commit crimes to support their habits. Prohibition pushes </p>

<p> some prices as much as 100 times higher than normal. Some </p>

<p> experts say half the crime in major cities results from </p>

<p> drug prohibition and many policemen will say the same </p>

<p> thing if they were free to express themselves honestly. </p>

<p> (2) Drug laws cause corruption. The extraordinary </p>

<p> profits become an irresistible temptation to policemen. </p>

<p> (3) Buyers are forced to come in contact with criminals, </p>

<p> unlike those who purchase alcohol without the help of </p>

<p> criminal,q because it is no longer illegal. </p>

<p> (4) Intense law enforcement forces the creation of </p>

<p> stronger, more potent drugs. Crack, for example, is a </p>

<p> result of drug prohibition. </p>

<p> (5) Civil liberties are abused under drug prohibition. </p>

<p> (6) A final negative result of drug prohibition is that </p>

<p> it leads to futility. In the case of today's drug crisis, </p>

<p> the drug war simply is not working. </p>

<p> GLORIA WHITFIELD (RECOVERED DRUG ADDICT), VOCATIONAL </p>

<p> REHARILITATION SPECIALIST, REHABILITATION SERVICES </p>

<p> ADMINISTRATION) DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT, </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> As a rehabilitation specialist in drug and alcohol abuse, </p>

<p> it is frightening to consider what the caseload would be </p>

<p> if drugs were legalized. </p>

<p> How can anyone with any insight or perception believe that </p>

<p> legalizing drugs would be the answer to the drug crisis? </p>

<p> If the main reason to legalize drugs is to remove the </p>

<p> profit from the criminals and drug traffickers, then it is </p>

<p> also saying that the U.S. Government &quot;wants a piece of
the </p>

<p> action.&quot; Uncle Sam would become the biggest dope pusher
of </p>

<p> all time. </p>

<p> Generations of young Americans are dying from drug abuse. </p>

<p> Minds and motivation are being destroyed. Families are </p>

<p> being destroyed. America is being weakened. </p>

<p> Legalization could not be accomplished without having to </p>

<p> rely on imports. Small, drug-producing countries would </p>

<p> soon become superpowers and nations with gross national </p>

<p> products inflated by cocaine and heroin production would </p>

<p> have access to nuclear warheads. </p>

<p> Fraudulent prescriptions are already a big business in the </p>

<p> United States. </p>

<p> The future for America would be very dim under </p>

<p> legalization. Medical schools, laws schools and other </p>

<p> institutions of higher learning would not touch students </p>

<p> who use drugs, even if they were legal, because it is </p>

<p> known that drug users are a detriment to themselves. </p>

<p> Under legalization, there would not be enough hospitals to </p>

<p> take care of everybody. Doctors and nurses would be in </p>

<p> demand like never before. Long lines of dope fiends </p>

<p> waiting for a fix or a hit would replace the winos in the </p>

<p> streets. </p>

<p> Those favoring legalization are being insensitive. </p>

<p> Legalization is a further step toward the perpetuation of </p>

<p> evil influence over society, rather than a positive step </p>

<p> toward resolving some of the criminal problems in society </p>

<p> like poverty, insufficient health care, and insufficient </p>

<p> education. </p>

<p> America should wage a real war against drugs, using any </p>

<p> means necessary to prevent it from entering our ports and </p>

<p> coming across our borders. </p>

<p> RICHARD KAREL, JOURNALIST </p>

<p> Across the board legalization is not the answer to the </p>

<p> drug crisis that plagues the country today. More </p>

<p> dangerous drugs should continue to be prohibited, while </p>

<p> less dangerous narcotics be made legally available. </p>

<p> During the time that America was under alcohol </p>

<p> Prohibition, Great Britain was attacking the alcohol </p>

<p> problem through a combination of higher taxes, rationing </p>

<p> and limited hours of distribution. When the Volstead Act </p>

<p> was repealed, alcohol abuse rose in the United States </p>

<p> while Great Britain had already began experiencing a </p>

<p> leveling off of alcohol use. Alcohol abuse has remained </p>

<p> relatively low since. </p>

<p> Recent Studies indicate a decrease in cirrhosis of the </p>

<p> liver in the United States despite alcohol being a legal </p>

<p> substance. With tobacco, limited restrictions and </p>

<p> education have cut sales of this product to minors. </p>

<p> Prohibition is neither necessary nor advisable for either </p>

<p> of these products. </p>

<p> The focus should be on keeping dangerous drugs like crack </p>

<p> and PCP away from children, and on preventing clinically </p>

<p> controlled drugs from being diverted. This would provide </p>

<p> a moral justification for the antidrug activities of law </p>

<p> enforcement. </p>

<p> PAUL MOORE, DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR, THE SCOTT NEWMAN CENTER, </p>

<p> Los ANGELES, CA </p>

<p> The Newman Center unequivocally opposes drug legalization. </p>

<p> The more time spent debating the issue, the more </p>

<p> credibility it receives. </p>

<p> Time should be spent developing more sound policies </p>

<p> regarding treatment, rehabilitation and prevention. </p>

<p> Society seems to be hooked on hyped miracle solutions that </p>

<p> look good but would not work. </p>

<p> Drugs, drug abuse and the associated crime are all </p>

<p> symptoms of deeply rooted problems in our society. Drugs </p>

<p> did not invent poverty, broken homes, latchkey children, </p>

<p> greed or the human desire for a quick- 'ix. Drugs did not </p>

<p> contribute to the general breakdown of moral and ethical </p>

<p> values. Without drugs, these problems would not disappear </p>

<p> and with drugs they are pronounced. </p>

<p> There is a perception that the drug problem can be </p>

<p> sanitized through legalization, giving residents of </p>

<p> ghettos and barrios all they want so long as they refrain </p>

<p> from committing crimes against the rest of society. </p>

<p> The threat of legalization is that it stands to send a </p>

<p> whole new set of mixed messages to America's youth. Drugs </p>

<p> already have a glamorous image. </p>

<p> If drugs were legalized, the gains from national efforts </p>

<p> of the past decade-such as a decrease in consumption and a </p>

<p> change in attitude of the Nation's youth-would be lost. </p>

<p> MARVIN MILLER, MEMBER, BOARD OF DIRECTORS, NORML, </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> Drugs are a problem and they create a tremendous strain on </p>

<p> the Nation's financial resources. </p>

<p> It is commonly known that there are no funds available for </p>

<p> desperately needed educational and training programs. The </p>

<p> underground narcotics trade is being allowed to run </p>

<p> rampant and control the marketplace. It controls purity </p>

<p> as well. All iirugs are, being treated as if they are the </p>

<p> same. </p>

<p> A combined total of $10 billion is spent annually on State </p>

<p> and Federal antidrug efforts. Most of this expenditure </p>

<p> goes for enforcing marijuana possession laws. About 40 </p>

<p> percent of all drug arrests relate to marijuana. Of the </p>

<p> 40-percent figure, 9 of 10 cases involve simple </p>

<p> possession. </p>

<p> There are some 50 million marijuana smokers in the United </p>

<p> States. They are otherwise law-abiding citizens who pay </p>

<p> taxes and are productive. </p>

<p> The Nation's $10 billion antidrug budget allots only about </p>

<p> 5 percent for education programs. No money exists for </p>

<p> national education or treatment programs. </p>

<p> NORML has put together a bill to make marijuana available </p>

<p> legally as a controlled and regulated substance. </p>

<p> An administrative law judge has ruled that marijuana is </p>

<p> the most benign substance known to man. It is not </p>

<p> addictive. It does not generate violence. </p>

<p> The Nation should look at new ways to battle the drug </p>

<p> crisis. Not every drug can be legalized, yet at the same </p>

<p> time, 50 million marijuana using Americans should not be </p>

<p> branded criminals. </p>

<p> RAY WHITFIELD (RECOVERED DRUG ADDICT), DRUG ABUSE </p>

<p> CONSULTANT, WASHINGTON, DC </p>

<p> Legalization is not a positive proposal. It is based on </p>

<p> what may be a false assumption, that legalization is a </p>

<p> proposal intended to reduce drug abuse. </p>

<p> Drug-related murders would not necessarily decrease as a </p>

<p> result of legalization. Drug-related murder should take </p>

<p> into account drug related death, which is less glamorous, </p>

<p> but also a tragic consequence of drug abuse. </p>

<p> Many in our society have turned to drug abuse simply </p>

<p> because they are hopeless and helpless. Drugs ease the </p>

<p> pain of their reality. Many people have lived lives much </p>

<p> worse than what the criminal justice system can mete out. </p>

<p> The Nation's Government has been duplicitous in dealing </p>

<p> with the drug crisis. While Government does not </p>

<p> officially sanction drug use, it has pushed policies that </p>

<p> contribute to it-such as the lack of antidrug education </p>

<p> and treatment centers in ghettos during the 1940's, 1950's </p>

<p> and 1960's, and the closing of the only two Federal </p>

<p> treatment centers in Lexington, KY and Texas. </p>

<p> Drugs generally have not been considered a national </p>

<p> problem so long as there was the perception that it was a </p>

<p> problem of minoritics and poor whites. Middle and upper </p>

<p> income individuals, meanwhile, generally have looked at </p>

<p> cocaine as a suitable, nonaddictive drug. </p>

<p> Now that cocaine and its negative consequences have </p>

<p> reached suburbia, it is a national problem. This is </p>

<p> duplicity. </p>

<p> Drug abuse is not the root problem. It is a very </p>

<p> destructive symptom of other maladies. </p>

<p> SENAT0R JOSEPH GALIBER, NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY </p>

<p> In the last 20 years or so, little or nothing has happened </p>

<p> in terms of solving the Nation's drug crisis. </p>

<p> I introduced a bill in the State assembly earlier this </p>

<p> year to set up a commission to study legalization and </p>

<p> decriminalization in the State of New York. </p>

<p> America has always been the noble experiment on freedom </p>

<p> that other nations around the world have looked to as an </p>

<p> example. But now, out of frustration, Americans are </p>

<p> beginning to espouse violations of freedoms and civil </p>

<p> liberties as the answer to this frustration. </p>

<p> Drug trafficking must be eliminated through the </p>

<p> legalization of narcotics. </p>

<p> Responsible officials are suggesting arming our police </p>

<p> with more powerful weapons. They have suggested shooting </p>

<p> down suspicious planes. They have called for a doubling </p>

<p> of agents and resources, martial law and the death penalty </p>

<p> for drug traffickers. </p>

<p> We fail to realize the coexistence of two separate </p>

<p> problems regarding the Nation's drug crisis. There is </p>

<p> drug abuse and there is drug trafficking. It is the </p>

<p> trafficking that causes shootouts, raids, deaths and </p>

<p> injuries. If all drugs were legalized right now and given </p>

<p> away free, then the traffickers would cease coming in </p>

<p> immediately. The profit would be gone. </p>

<p> Drug abuse would not be eliminated under legalization, but </p>

<p> the horrible problems associated with the drug trade would </p>

<p> be gone. </p>

<p> The questions posed by Chairman Rangel can be answered in </p>

<p> the context of the alcohol industry: </p>

<p> Question. What narcotics and drugs would be legalized? </p>

<p> Answer. All. </p>

<p> Question. Who would be allowed to buy these narcotics? </p>

<p> Would there be an age limit? </p>

<p> Answer. The same limitations as those for purchasing </p>

<p> alcohol. </p>

<p> Question. Would we sell drugs to people who just want to </p>

<p> experiment and encourage them to pick up the habit? </p>

<p> Answer. We would sell drugs in the same fashion and with </p>

<p> the same restrictions as the selling of alcohol. </p>

<p> Question. Where would these drugs be sold? </p>

<p> Answer. In the same places and under the same controls as </p>

<p> alcohol, </p>

<p> Question. Where would we obtain our supply of these legal </p>

<p> drugs? </p>

<p> Answer. In the same way that there are manufacturers of </p>

<p> alcohol. </p>

<p> Do you for one minute think the tobacco industry has not </p>

<p> put together long ago contingency plans to produce </p>

<p> marijuana cigarettes when legalization becomes a reality? </p>

<p> Question. Would private industry be allowed to </p>

<p> participate in this market? </p>

<p> Answer. Of course. In the same way as in alcohol. </p>

<p> Question. If drugs would become legal, would we allow </p>

<p> pilots, railroad workers and nuclear plant employees to </p>

<p> use them? </p>

<p> Answer. Do we permit them to use alcohol? </p>

<p> Question. If drugs were legalized, how would we back up </p>

<p> our argument with our children and youth that drugs are </p>

<p> harmful? </p>

<p> Answer. In the same way that we do with alcohol. </p>

<p> The Volstead Act, which made liquor illegal, created </p>

<p> violence, warfare, bloodshed, corruption, illicit dealers </p>

<p> and sellers on a sale that was unprecedented until now. </p>

<p> Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past by continuing </p>

<p> to escalate a war which is totally unnecessary. </p>

<p> ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF HON. LARRY SMITH OF FLORIDA </p>

<p> Legalization will not alleviate the drug problem. Drugs </p>

<p> such as heroin and cocaine destroy both the mind and the </p>

<p> body. The new form of cocaine known as crack or rock is </p>

<p> highly addictive. Legalizing drugs would be the same as </p>

<p> admitting that we, as a people and society, cannot control </p>

<p> our actions and prefer self-destruction. Who among us </p>

<p> wants the U.S. Government to be in the business of </p>

<p> distributing cocaine, heroin, PCP or any other killing, </p>

<p> brutalizing substance? </p>

<p> Very few people believe that legalized drugs would reduce </p>

<p> the impact of drug abuse on society. Such a proposal </p>

<p> might eliminate some of the existing criminal element </p>

<p> involved in drug trafficking, but it would not stop </p>

<p> somebo4y (whether the government, tobacco companies, or </p>

<p> pharmaceutical companies) from profiting from the human </p>

<p> misery associated with drug use and abuse. </p>

<p> If we would not legalize drugs for juveniles (and we would </p>

<p> not), a flourishing market would still exist to sell to </p>

<p> them illegally. What about crime? If we distribute or </p>

<p> make legal drugs that cloud the mind or remove </p>

<p> inhibitions, does anyone believe that there will be less </p>

<p> crime? Does anyone believe that people who are on only a </p>

<p> fixed ration of free or legal drugs will not want more and </p>

<p> that someone will sell it to them illegally? And that to </p>

<p> pay for those extra&quot; drugs the drug users will not
commit </p>

<p> crimes? </p>

<p> Congress should do everything it can to eliminate drug </p>

<p> trafficking and drug abuse. The task will not be easy, </p>

<p> but that does not mean that we cannot try to alleviate </p>

<p> this devastating problem. Legalization would be the easy </p>

<p> way out, but it would not solve the underlying problem. </p>

<h1>The Anaheim Park Ordinance </h1>

<p> In our continuing effort to bring to you the news on this
issue, we ran across the following item. It seems that the city
of Anaheim, California (Disneyland, USA) decided to pass an
ordinance banning anyone who had ever been convicted of a drug
offense from visiting a public park. I could go on for hours
describing all the reasons this is a really dumb idea, but let it
suffice to say that the ordinance was repealed after the local
probation officers complained that their office was right across
from a park and the ordinance would mean that many of the people
they had to deal with would have no place to sit while waiting
for their appointments. </p>

<p> Just another outstandingly dumb approach to the drug problem.

<h1>DRUGS AND THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY </h1>

<p>[Page: E2111] </p>

<p><b>HON. GERALD B.H. SOLOMON OF NEW YORK</b> </p>

<p>in the House of Representatives </p>

<p>Thursday, October 6, 1994 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, it was recently brought to my
attention that drug legalization advocates are using the
electronic information superhighway to organize the legalization
movement and share information on drug use. The information
superhighway was certainly not created to propagate such
misinformation and the criminal activity associated with it. This
use was brought to my attention by drug legalization opponents
who use the information superhighway everyday in their vocations.
</p>

<p>Apparently, the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws recently entered remarks which I personally made
in opposition to drug legalization on this House floor as an
example of `rabid, right-wing prohibitionist propaganda.' Because
I believe, along with 95 percent of America, that the use of
illicit drugs is wrong, I was singled out as an enemy of drug
users. </p>

<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, I am honored. The use of illegal drugs in
an anathema to the social and moral fabric of our Nation.
President Reagan's and President Bush's `War on Drugs ' was
premised on the belief that society was better served and
protected if our Nation universally and actively opposed drug
use. This program worked as planned. The use of cocaine,
marijuana, heroin, and most other illegal drugs declined. Our
Nation's young children and teenagers who grew up during the
1980's were told and made aware of the evils and the hardships
associated with drug use. I fear for the kind of message the
children growing up in the 1990's are receiving. Pro-drug use and
legalization messages on the information superhighway through
Internet are wrong. </p>

<p>I was appalled to learn that this information even includes
such things as tips on growing marijuana and ways to evade law
enforcement. As more and more Americans jump onto this latest
technological advancement, more and more citizens will have
access to this ill-advised information. For example, the
information superhighway is now available in most elementary and
secondary schools and in many American homes. Now elementary
students like my own grandson can obtain valuable information
about an obscure nation in the South Pacific during a social
studies class and then flip a screen to discover the glories of
drug use and criminal activity. </p>

<p>Drug legalization advocates from all over the country are
using this universal technology to further their movement and
deceive more Americans. As Congress reviews this very important
technology during the 104th Congress, the use of this service by
pro-drug organizations and individuals for the propagation of
this ilk must be addressed. As a nation founded on the freedoms
of speech and press, the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness must not be trampled by the disease of illegal drugs
.<br>

HOLLAND HAS INCREASED CRIME AND ADDICTION </font></a></p>

<p>[Page: E499] </p>

<p><b>HON. GERALD B.H. SOLOMON OF NEW YORK</b> </p>

<p>in the House of Representatives </p>

<p>Thursday, March 2, 1995 </p>

<p><b>A Note to Readers: </b>If you want some current
information, direct from Europe, to compare with Mr. Solomon's
statements here, take a look at <a
href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~mlap/">DrugText Europe</a>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, let me commend to you the following
article written by a distinguished doctor and chairman of the
International Drug Strategy Institute, Eric A. Voth, M.D. Dr.
Voth advocates retaining tough drug laws to guard against rising
crime and experimentation. Citing Holland as an example, the
legalization of drugs has resulted in greatly increased crime and
addiction. The only way to combat the increase of drug use in
this country is to stand firm against recent attempt by prodrug
groups to mute public awareness. These groups attempt to disguise
the dangers of drug abuse and consequently jeopardize future
generations. </p>

<p>REPEATING HISTORY'S MISTAKES </p>

<p>The international drug policy debate rages regarding decisions
whether to fundamentally change drug policy toward legalization
or decriminalization of drug use, or to remain with restrictive
policies. If we examine two examples of softening of drug policy,
we will find ample reason to continue with restrictive policy. </p>

<p>In the mid to late 1970's during the Carter administration,
drug policy visibly softened. Several states decriminalized
marijuana, and in fact Alaska legalized marijuana. Drug policy
`specialists' in their infinite wisdom supported the flawed
concept called `responsible use' of drugs as a way that users
could maintain personal use of drugs and avoid the ravages of
addiction and physical problems. </p>

<p>Permissive drug policy originated with organizations like the
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. President
Carter's drug policy advisor Peter Bourne, as well as others like
Arnold Trebach, Mathea Falco, Peter Reuter, Mark Kleiman helped
to press for the lenient policy. </p>

<p>Interestingly, during that time the use of marijuana and other
drugs drastically increased. Use also increased in adolescents
despite the fact that drugs never become legal or decriminalized
for that age group. The use of marijuana among high school
students in Oregon during decriminalization was double that of
the national average. National averages of marijuana use among
high school seniors increased to 50% of seniors having used in
the previous year, and 10.7% used daily. </p>

<p>Ultimately, parents began to object to the rampant use of
drugs , especially marijuana, among their children. In the early
1980's the `parents' anti-drug movement began. Because of the
drastic failure of lenient drug policies, steady pressure was
exerted at national and local levels for restrictive drug
policies. A huge national wave of high quality research,
grassroots prevention organizations, and tightening of drug laws
began. </p>

<p>Predictably, the use of drugs among `recreational' users
dropped. High school seniors use of marijuana dropped to 23% of
seniors using within the last year and 2% using on a daily basis.
The use among hard addicts did not drop. Strangely the cry has
been sounded by some that the drug war did not work. That outcry,
however, was almost exclusively being sounded by individuals who
favored legalization or decriminalization back in the 1970's. The
same individuals who called for soft policy in the earlier era
are calling for the new harm reduction policy today. Hidden
within such policy is the intent to gain decriminalization of
drugs . </p>

<p>Holland has decriminalized drugs and tried harm reduction.
Since the softening of drug policy there, shootings have
increased 40%, robberies 62%, and car thefts 62%. This experiment
which was meant to decrease organized crime has resulted in an
increase in organized crime families from 3 in 1988 to 93 today. </p>

<p>The number of registered marijuana addicts has risen 30% and
the number of other addicts has risen 22%. </p>

<p>The major difference between today and the 1970's is that the
prolegalization effort is more organized and better funded. The
millionaire Richard Dennis from Chicago has given millions to the
drug legalization effort. Billionaire George Soros has given $6
million to the Drug Policy Foundation to help seek legalization
of drugs . He created the Open Society Fund which in turn funds
Mathea Falco's Drug Strategies organization. Steadily, these
groups put a happy and acceptable face on the idea of drug
legalization or decriminalization. </p>

<p>Their public relation campaign has softened public attitudes.
Moves such as full page ads in national newspapers suggesting
alternatives to drug policy are examples. Organized efforts at
such ideas as hemp as a fiber alternative, medical marijuana,
needle exchanges, therapeutic LSD, and others pervade the media.
The Internet is bristling with pro-drug talk groups discussing
recent drug experiences and how and where to obtain drugs . </p>

<p>In the face of these facts, the holdovers from the 70's drug
policy makers are still asking for lenient drug laws. A
substantial number of today's addicts started their use under the
lenient policies of the 1970's. We have had our experience with
decriminalization, and it is time that we recognize it and put
that concept to bed. </p>

<p>The only hope for drug policy is a concerted effort of drug
prevention which upholds the notion of no drug use, drug
interdiction, and drug treatment. If we soften our hold on an
already vexing problem, we will lose the war. </p>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986</b> </p>

<hr>

<h2>Overview of America's Habit </h2>

<p>This is the final report from President's Commission on
Organized Crime. It contains material on the nature, scope and
extent of organized crime, particularly as it relates to drug
trafficking, money laundering, and labor racketeering. </p>

<p>The President's Commission on Organized Crime </p>

<p>The President's Commission on Organized Crime was established
by Executive Order 12435 July 28, 1983. The Executive Order
directs the Commission to: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Make a full and complete national and region-by-region
        analysis of organized crime; </li>
    <li>Define the nature of traditional organized crime as well
        as emerging organized crime groups, the sources and
        amounts of organized crime's income, and the uses to
        which organized crime puts its income; </li>
    <li>Develop in-depth information on the participants in
        organized crime networks; </li>
    <li>Evaluate Federal laws pertinent to the effort to combat
        organized crime; </li>
    <li>Advise the President and the Attorney General with
        respect to its findings and actions which can be
        undertaken to improve law enforcement efforts directed
        against organized crime; </li>
    <li>Make recommendations concerning appropriate
        administrative and legislative improvements and
        improvements in the administration of justice; </li>
</ul>

<p>and </p>

<ul>
    <li>Report to the President from time to time as requested,
        and to submit its final report by March 1, 1986. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Commission is authorized to issue subpoenas for the
testimony of witnesses and the production of information, to
issue orders compelling testimony over a claim of the privilege
against self-incrimination, and to seek the assistance of the
Department of Justice in applying for writs of habeas corpus ad
testificandum or judicial orders requiring testimony or the
production of information before the Commission. In addition, the
Commission may obtain, use, and disclose electronic surveillance
data obtained by law enforcement agencies under Title III of the
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, and other
information from Federal departments and agencies under the Bank
Secrecy Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, as well as from
financial institutions under the Right to Financial Privacy Act. </p>

<p>In the discharge of its responsibilities, the Commission has
prepared this report on organized crime's role in drug
trafficking and drug abuse. Based on the totality of the evidence
before it, the Commission has concluded that drug trafficking and
abuse together constitute the single most serious organized crime
issue confronting this Nation. </p>

<p>Therefore, in contrast to the other subjects covered in the
remainder of it's final report, this topic is treated in a
separate volume. The research and drafting on this report was
performed on the Commission's behalf by Chief Investigator Manuel
Gonzalez (FBI). Research assistants Abigail Johnson and Mary
Karol, Deputy Counsel Kevin McEnery, Investigator Thomas Sheehan
(DEA), and Contract Consultant Susan Mellody, under the
supervision of Deputy Executive Director Rodney G. Smith. </p>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter I The Impact of the Drug Trade </h2>

<p>Drug trafficking is the most serious organized crime problem
in the world today. The drug trade generates billions of dollars
for organized crime each year, imposing incalculable costs on
individuals, families, communities, and governments worldwide.
But drug trafficking is only part of a broader, unified
phenomenon, which also includes the illicit use of drugs. It is
drug users who finance organized crime through their drug
purchases, and it is they who must accept responsibility for the
broad range of costs associated with the drug industry. </p>

<p>Drug abuse ruins individual lives, drains billions of dollars
each year from American society, and erodes the nation's quality
of life. The violence and corruption that are an integral part of
organized crime drug trafficking take the lives of American and
foreign officials and private citizens, undermine drug control
efforts, and threaten entire governments. To the extent that the
stability of friendly nations is threatened, particularly in this
hemisphere, our own national security is jeopardized. The impact
of organized crime and drug trafficking on society thus has
far-ranging consequences, from the mental or physical destruction
of the individual drug user to questions of national security. </p>

<p>This Commission has found drug trafficking to be the most
widespread and lucrative organized crime activity in the United
States. According to this Commission's survey of local law
enforcement agencies, marijuana, cocaine, and dangerous drug
trafficking are the three primary activities of organized crime
groups, as defined by local agencies, nationwide. Drug
trafficking accounts for almost 38 percent of all organized crime
activity across the country and generates an income estimated to
be as high as $110 billion. </p>

<p>A concept fundamental to this report is the dual nature of the
drug phenomenon: drug supply and drug demand are mutually
dependent aspects of a single global problem. All strategic and
tactical evaluations in this report have been arrived at in this
context, and it is imperative that the planning undertaken by
this government and its allies be performed within the same
framework. The gaps that now exist between strategists who seek
to reduce supply and planners who want to reduce demand must be
closed. The situation confronting us is a crisis both nationally
and internationally. Our response can be no less than national
and international mobilization. As this report sets out in
detail, the menace of drugs is not restricted to a particular
segment of society, but is now of a scope and severity that is a
threat to our national security and therefore a legitimate
national security issue. </p>

<p>The appropriate response must therefore involve our entire
society, not just our law enforcement and health professionals.
Parents, educators, employers, the legal profession, financial
institutions, the military, and the diplomatic and intelligence
communities must all recognize that we are in a national
emergency. </p>

<p>Military strategists have warned and painful national
experience confirmed that a war must not be fought without a
clear notion of the victory sought. In this war on drugs - a
phrase worn by use but nevertheless the only accurate description
of what must be done - this Commission has adopted a definition
of victory: the dramatic reduction, if not complete elimination,
of drug abuse in this society. The ultimate goal is a distant
one, to be sure, requiring patience, determination and vision. No
less an objective is acceptable. Short fixes, compromises, and
resignation are a breach of faith with ourselves, our children,
and generations to come. </p>

<p>Just as we must clearly define victory, so must we identify
the enemy. Here again, there is no room for compromise. We must
unite against drugs themselves, and anyone who is their ally.
Producers, refiners, smugglers, and sellers, all those we know as
&quot;traffickers,&quot; are obvious targets. It is our
obligation to look further and recognize that those among us -
friends, relatives, colleagues, and other &quot;respectable&quot;
people - whose small, personal drug purchases at the base of the
consumption pyramid are the driving force behind the traffickers'
assault on this country. It is the consumer's dollars that come
together to finance the organized crime drug trafficking
described in this report, and it is thus their responsibility and
ours to confront this truth. This means an end to tolerance of
drug use at every level of society. </p>

<p>While all drug trafficking, by its nature, requires some
degree of organization, it is essential for the purposes of this
report to identify the threshold at which the organization
inherent in drug trafficking can be distinguished from organized
crime drug trafficking. The Commission's definition of organized
crime, which sets out the six characteristics of organized crime
groups, is helpful in making this distinction. These
characteristics are: continuity, structure, defined membership,
criminality, violence, and power as its goal. These elements,
together with a reliance on the &quot;buffer&quot; that this
Commission has found to be an integral part of organized crime,
are common to the world's most notorious trafficking
organizations. </p>

<p>This report examines the organized crime groups that traffic
in illicit drugs. To the extent necessary to grasp the dynamics
of worldwide drug traffic, it also details the nature of the
drugs themselves. It describes the array of enforcement agencies
currently in place, analyzes their various strategies and
tactics, and presents specific recommendations for more effective
anti-drug efforts. </p>

<p>In the portion of this report devoted to efforts to reduce the
supply of illicit drugs, &quot;Supply Strategies,&quot; it is
clear that our law enforcement and other government agencies,
particularly on the Federal level, are deployed with a degree of
determination, imagination, and resource commitment unparalleled
in American history. This government must continue to pursue
strategies to reduce supply with all possible vigor, or it is the
government's obligation to do all within its power to protect its
citizens, no matter how formidable the foe. Nevertheless, if the
demand for illicit drugs continues at its present voracious
level, improvements in the area of reducing supply will continue
to be slow, expensive, infrequent, and too often only temporary. </p>

<p>This report places great emphasis on the need for complete
national resolve in this area and for that resolve to be
translated into fully coordinated governmental action.
Compartmentalization and parochialism, which have been far too
common in past efforts, must be brought to an end. In this
regard, we are at a particularly propitious moment in history.
The slow and painful evolution of our strategy has finally
achieved a centralized authority for our national effort: the
National Drug Enforcement Policy Board. Not just another advisory
body, this Board is a true congregation of every component of our
national government's anti-drug effort. It provides the means for
achieving a thoroughly coordinated national attack on every
aspect of drug trafficking and abuse. It is vital that the Policy
Board move effectively, thoughtfully and decisively, but it is
most urgent that it move. Indecisiveness are signals in
themselves, the wrong signals, to drug traffickers, users,
concerned parents, health and social planners, and even foreign
governments. Perhaps most critically, indecisiveness and delay
are the wrong signals to those U.S. governmental agencies that
must choose where anti-drug efforts will fall on the list of
competing priorities in a time of hardening fiscal austerity. By
action, not mere promises, the Policy Board must send the proper
message: we are in a fight for our lives, and every agency must
arrange its priorities accordingly. </p>

<p>Our strategies to reduce supply will require not only
dedication, but patience and objectivity. The war against drugs
will not be won until individuals stop using them. Strategies to
reduce supply can do no more than hold the line against illegal
drugs while public attitudes and private choices change. That is
not to say that our enforcement strategies should not be
aggressive and persistent. On the contrary, this report makes
clear that there is much in this area that is being done and
should continue, and much more that might be done. Many of the
specific recommendations in this report are devoted to this
theme. What is necessary at the outset, however, is an
understanding that such efforts must not be judged by an
unrealistic standard. As long as this society is willing to
provide its enforcement agencies scarcely more than a penny for
every dollar our citizens squander on illicit drugs, it has no
right and no reason to expect more. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the curse of drug abuse will be broken, but only
by a nationwide dedication to persistent and unyielding assaults
on both supply and demand. The supply is already under siege by
our enforcement, diplomatic, and intelligence communities.
Because an end to consumption is our ultimate goal, it is a
concerted and direct attack on demand that must be mounted. </p>

<p>Illicit drugs are an attack upon the integrity, character, and
health of the individual. Although discussions of drugs are often
framed in terms of costs to society and society's responses, the
fact is that individuals, not societies, take drugs. It is the
individual user who finances all of the violence, corruption, and
degradation that this report describes. The powerful,
sophisticated, and thoroughly evil organized crime drug
trafficking groups described herein are a reflection of nothing
more than our self-destructiveness. It is as a result of
individual acts of will that such groups came to be and are
sustained, and it is by individual acts of will that they will
finally be defeated. <br>

<h2>Chapter II Portrait of Drug Production and Use </h2>

<p>Cocaine Scope of the Problem </p>

<p>Once considered a fashionable drug for the wealthy, cocaine
and its deleterious effects are now beginning to be better
understood. In the past scientists made a clear distinction
between physical and psychological drug dependence, but the
health and social consequences of cocaine use have demonstrated
that the two courses lead to the same end: cocaine, like other
addictive drugs, ruins lives and kills. Widely available across
the United States, cocaine is now used by individuals of all
socioeconomic groups. The cocaine industry generates an estimated
$11 billion in illicit income annually, and it is growing.
Cocaine production, importation to the United States and
consumption have all increased significantly in recent years. The
cocaine industry is fueled by the approximately 25 million
Americans who have tried cocaine, of which five to six million
use it at least once per month. Of the regular users, it is
estimated that almost half may be considered addicted. Although
the total number of users appears to have leveled off in the last
few years, cocaine consumption has increased 12 percent between
1983 and 1984, from 50-68 metric tons to 55-76 metric tons. As
cocaine consumption has increased, so too have more dangerous
forms of use of the drug and the deleterious effects associated
with it. Cocaine-related deaths increased 77 percent from 1983 to
1984 and cocaine-related emergency room visits increased 51
percent. Requests for treatment for cocaine use have increased
600 percent during the past three years. In 18 states, cocaine is
reported as the primary drug of abuse for clients in treatment
facilities. There is no indication that without a comprehensive
effort at reduction of both the supply of and demand for cocaine,
the increases in cocaine use or its deleterious medical and
social effects will subside in the near future. From a law
enforcement perspective, the consequences of this tolerance and
addiction are the intense, steady and increasing demand for the
product, which generates vast revenues for organized crime.
Today's Cocaine User </p>

<p>The cocaine industry is sustained by the appetite of the
cocaine user. With the possible exception of marijuana, cocaine
is used by a wider demographic cross-section of society than any
other controlled substance. Facts demonstrate that the popular
belief that cocaine use is restricted to the wealthy is a myth.
For example, a study of 6,406 males arrested for serious crimes
and processed in New York City's Manhattan Central Booking police
office in 1984 reveals that 42 percent tested positively for
cocaine in their system, the drug most frequently detected. The
use of cocaine in combination with other drugs appears to be
increasing. Fifty-nine percent of the cocaine-related deaths in
1984 involved other drugs, particularly alcohol, heroin and PCP.
In addition, more dangerous routes of cocaine administration are
now being used. Use of &quot;speedballs,&quot; injections of
heroin and cocaine, which are often lethal, increased 37 percent
from 1983 to 1984. Smoking of coca paste and base, forms of
consumption with particularly dangerous health consequences, have
also increased. Surveys of cocaine users demonstrated there is no
&quot;typical&quot; cocaine user. Results of a 1983 survey of
callers to the national 800-COCAINE hotline indicate that the
average caller was a 31-year old, white, middle class male with
at least some college education and a job with an annual salary
exceeding $25,000. Results of the 1985 survey of callers to the
hotline reveal that more women, minorities and adolescents called
than just two years earlier, and 73 percent of callers in 1985
reported an income of less than $25,000 per year. While almost
half of the calls to the hotline in 1983 came from the northeast,
calls were fairly evenly geographically distributed in 1985. Just
as it has spread geographically and to different socioeconomic
groups, cocaine use has increased among certain age groups. Most
alarmingly, an increase in adolescent use of cocaine has been
reported in the 1984 and 1985 surveys of drug use among high
school seniors. The surveys found that current use of cocaine
among respondents climbed from 4.9 percent in 1983 to 5.8 percent
in 1984, and to 6.7 percent 1985. According to the surveys,
annual and lifetime use of cocaine also increased. Health
Consequences of Cocaine Use One reason that use of cocaine is so
widespread is because of the properties of the drug itself.
Cocaine is derived from the leaves of the coca plant
(Erythroxylon coca) and has been identified by Dr. Donald Ian
MacDonald, administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental
Health Administration, as one of the most powerfully addictive
substances known to man. Cocaine is a stimulant traditionally
used to produce euphoria. Other initial effects, however,
typically include excitation, increased alertness, insomnia, loss
of appetite, increased heart rate, increased respiration and
increased blood pressure after even one use. Death can also
result from first time use as discussed below. Repeated use of
cocaine can cause chronic fatigue, convulsions, depression,
irritability, loss of sex drive, memory problems, nasal bleeding,
paranoia, severe headaches, increased body temperature and death.
These symptoms are neither theoretical nor infrequent. Chronic
cocaine use causes tolerance, withdrawal symptoms and addiction.
Tolerance is evidenced by the fact that chronic cocaine users
need to increase their dosage of cocaine to achieve the same
effects as lower dosages. As dosage increases, the effect of
cocaine use become more pronounced. According to cocaine
researcher Dr. Reese T. Jones, &quot;The existence of a true
withdrawal syndrome following cocaine use seems compelling.&quot;
This syndrome includes &quot;depression, social withdrawal,
craving, tremor, muscle pain, eating disturbance,
encephalographic changes and changes in sleep patterns.&quot; </p>

<p>The addictive nature of cocaine and its toxicity have been
documented in both animal studies and human experience. According
to the results of a study reported in the July 5, 1985 issue of
the Journal of the American Medical Association, 90 percent of
rats self-administering cocaine intravenously died within 30
days, while the mortality rate for rats self-administering heroin
was only 36 percent. The study found that rats using cocaine lost
up to 47 percent of their body weight, ceased grooming themselves
and deteriorated in general health. Several rats experienced
seizures, but immediately self-administered more cocaine after
the cessation of convulsions. The study concludes that in regard
to human cocaine use: As the intake of cocaine increases and the
concentration of this compound becomes greater (through the
availability of higher-purity drugs, by IV injections or by
'free-basing') the number of fatalities associated with cocaine
abuse is likely to increase. Hundreds of fatalities each year are
associated with cocaine use. According to Dr. Mark Gold, director
of research at Fair Oaks Hospital in New Jersey: &quot;We have no
way of predicting who'll die from the drug and who won't. It
could be a regular user or it could be a first-time user.&quot;
Although overdose is the primary cause of cocaine deaths, death
can also result after a regular cocaine user takes the same
amount of the drug that he usually takes. This phenomenon is
known as &quot;kindling&quot; and is not well understood by
scientists. According to Miami's Deputy Chief Medical Examiner
Dr. Charles Wetli, &quot;What was a safe dose one day becomes a
fatal dose the next.&quot; The precise cause of cocaine-related
deaths, regardless of dosage, include respiratory failure,
cerebral hemorrhage, cardiac arrest or seizures. Because cocaine
increases blood pressure and heart rate, individuals with
cardiovascular problems are at particular risk. Cocaine's
tendency to induce convulsions also creates special risks for
epileptics. Death by cocaine is often preceded by anxiety,
hallucinations, high body temperature and seizures. One common
myth about cocaine is that addiction and death cannot result from
intranasal use, or &quot;snorting,&quot; which is the most common
route of administration. While cocaine deaths are usually
associated with intravenous use, coroners have documented cases
of death from intranasal use of cocaine. One particular danger
associated with intravenous use of cocaine, or any drug, is
infection. Hepatitis and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS) have both been associated with intravenous drug use.
Cultivation The cultivation, refinement and trafficking necessary
to bring cocaine from the fields of South America to the streets
of the United States obviously requires organization. Coca bushes
are grown primarily in the South American countries of Peru,
Bolivia and Colombia. The plants are first harvested as early as
18 months after planting, and can usually be harvested from three
to four times annually for up to 20 years. The cultivation of
coca has increased significantly in recent years, primarily as a
result of the cultivation of new coca plants and the maturation
of previously existing coca plants. Notwithstanding increased law
enforcement pressure in Colombia, the tremendous profits
associated with cocaine trafficking have encouraged the spread of
coca cultivation throughout the region. Processing In a
relatively simple chemical process, coca leaves are converted
first to cocaine paste, then base, then cocaine hydrochloride
(HCl), the form of coca most commonly abused in this country. The
conversion of leaf to paste to base usually occurs near the
cultivation site. The dried leaves are first moistened in an
alkaline solution and then soaked in kerosene. The kerosene is
removed leaving a cocaine precipitate. This in turn is filtered,
producing a paste. The paste is dissolved in a solution of
sulfuric acid and then potassium permanganate. This mixture is
then filtered, ammonium hydroxide is added and the precipitate
that forms is coca base. Traditionally, base has been smuggled
out of Peru and Bolivia by small aircraft or boats to Colombia,
where most of the refining from base to HCl takes place. In
numerous cocaine laboratories in the jungles of Colombia, coca
base is transformed into pure cocaine HCl by adding ether and
acetone, and filtering this mixture, which is then dried. To
produce one kilo of pure cocaine, approximately 500 kilos of coca
leaves are needed. The pattern of processing and transshipment is
somewhat different from that of cultivation. In the area of
refining and smuggling cocaine, it is estimated that 75 percent
of the drug available in the United States comes from Colombia,
15 percent from Bolivia, 5 percent from Peru and 5 percent from
Ecuador, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. However, these figures are
subject to frequent changes because of the mobility of drug
traffickers. For example, while most of the conversion to HCl
takes place in Colombia, and other South American countries, an
increasing number of cocaine laboratories are being seized in the
United States. Six such laboratories were seized here in 1982, 11
in 1983, 21 in 1984 and 25 during the first half of 1985. Reasons
for this trend include increased law enforcement in Colombia and
the increasing cost of ether and acetone in Colombia. The cost of
these chemicals has increased as a result of controls imposed by
the Colombian government on their importation and sale and a
concerted effort initiated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration to disrupt the supply of chemicals essential in
the cocaine refinement process. A 55-gallon drum of ether now
costs approximately $7,000 in South America, while the same
amount costs only $500 to $600 in the United States. Further,
acetone and ether are widely available for commercial purposes in
the United States, making control of their illicit use much more
difficult than it has been in South America. </p>

<p>Heroin </p>

<p>Scope of the Problem </p>

<p>Traditionally viewed as the &quot;hardest drug,&quot; heroin's
reputation is well-earned. Although there are fewer heroin
addicts than users of other illicit drugs, more deaths and
emergency room visits are associated with heroin than with any
other drug. Heroin's &quot;worst drug&quot; status has also
developed because of the crime generally associated with heroin
use, a stereotype of the heroin addict as an inner-city street
dweller who commits crimes as his sole means of support, the fact
that heroin is most often used intravenously, the dramatic
addiction and withdrawal symptoms associated with use of the
drug, and the relatively quick and generally lethal effects of a
heroin overdose. </p>

<p>The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates there were
490,000 heroin addicts and users in 1981. It is estimated that
thousands more individuals use heroin occasionally, but are not
included in this number. While the addict population has remained
relatively steady since 1979, indicators of heroin consumption
and effects have increased in recent years. Annual heroin-related
deaths reached 1,046 in 1984, a 31 percent increase from 1983.
Emergency room visits involving heroin use increased 55 percent
from 1981 to 1984, with 10,901 such visits in 1984. This
represents a decrease from the 11,028 emergency room visits in
1983. Estimated heroin consumption increased 55 percent from 1981
to 1984, with 5.97 metric tons of heroin consumed in 1984. As a
result of increased heroin purity and increased use of the drug
in combination with other drugs, the number of heroin addicts and
the number of deaths and emergency room visits associated with
heroin use should be expected to increase. </p>

<p>Heroin is thus an extremely valuable commodity for organized
crime: in fact, an ounce of pure heroin is approximately ten
times more expensive than an ounce of gold. Heroin users provide
organized crime with billions of dollars each year: it is
estimated that illegal income from heroin sales in the United
States totaled $6.12 billion in 1982. </p>

<p>The Heroin Addict </p>

<p>Historically, data collection and law enforcement experience
support the view that heroin use has been an urban phenomenon,
confined in large part to minority populations. One recent study
of black inner-city heroin users across the country suggests the
extent of heroin's grip in those areas: </p>

<p>Because of the regular availability of heroin and the
structure of the relationship of intercity residents to society,
the heroin lifestyle has become firmly established as an
alternative lifestyle for Black youngsters. </p>

<p>Such studies typically reveal a portrait of the heroin addict
as an unemployed, minority male with little education who commits
crime to support his habit: A 1985 study of heroin users in East
and Central Harlem found the following: 75 percent were male; 55
percent were black and 44 percent Hispanic; 36 percent were under
30 years of age; 61 percent had less than 11 years of education;
and 81 percent were unemployed. The annualized crime rate for
these heroin users was 1,075 crimes per person. Crimes committed
by heroin addicts includes property crime, violent crime and drug
offenses. </p>

<p>While regular use of heroin is generally addictive, there
appears to be a group of users, known as &quot;chippers,&quot;
who are able to use heroin occasionally over a long period of
time without becoming addicts. In his study of heroin, Stanford
University professor John Kaplan maintains: </p>

<p>It is now clear that there exists a sizable population of
non-addicted but regular heroin users who seem well integrated
into society and in many ways indistinguishable from the rest of
the population. </p>

<p>Recently a new group of heroin users has emerged that includes
both addicts and non-addicts. These are the &quot;middle
class&quot; users, who are involved with heroin as a result of
their cocaine habits. In order to counteract the effects of heavy
cocaine use, many began to use heroin intranasally, and
eventually became addicted to the drug. Dr. Forest Tennant,
director of a number of drug abuse clinics in the Los Angeles
area, observes: </p>

<p>As cocaine use increases, we're seeing more addicts because
heroin is the strongest neutralizer around for cocaine toxicity .
. . And we're not talking about gang members and derelicts. I'm
treating people who pay their union dues, go to the PTA, take
their kids to Little League. We've even got a program for
executives. </p>

<p>Health Effects of Heroin Use </p>

<p>While narcotics serve an essential medicinal purpose as
analgesics, or painkillers, they are often abused. Heroin, the
most abused opiate, is derived from the opium poppy (Papaver
somniferum). Heroin is generally used intravenously, the most
efficient and dangerous route of administration.
&quot;Speedballs,&quot; injections of heroin mixed with cocaine,
are particularly dangerous. Heroin can also be used
subcutaneously, called &quot;skin-popping.&quot; All of these
intravenous forms of use are associated with AIDS and hepatitis,
as discussed earlier. In addition, heroin can be smoked or used
intranasally. </p>

<p>Heroin is a particularly dangerous drug because of the ease
with which a user can overdose, A lethal dose of heroin is only
10 to 15 times a normal dose. According to Dr. Donald C. Thomas
III, former director of emergency care at the District of
Columbia General Hospital: </p>

<p>Heroin numbs you to pain, gives you a euphoria, takes you away
from reality, makes you slower and changes appetites . . . The
real problem for an addict is that the threshold between the dose
of heroin that gives that effect, as opposed to the dose that
will kill him by suppressing respiratory or cardiac centers in
his brain, is very narrow. </p>

<p>Multiple overdose deaths sometimes result from one
&quot;batch&quot; of heroin. In March 1985, for example,
according to local press accounts, 8 people died and 14 were
hospitalized in a few days in Washington, D.C., after injecting
some particularly potent heroin. Seven months earlier, 10 people
died in Washington within 8 days in a similar incident. It is
striking evidence of the drug's overpowering influence that this
risk of sudden death apparently poses no deterrent to the
seasoned user. As expressed by one heroin addict: </p>

<p>A true, full-blown drug addict would follow a morgue wagon to
its origin of overdose to obtain that substance. </p>

<p>Cultivation </p>

<p>Heroin entering the United States is produced from opium
poppies, which are harvested in Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan
(Southwest Asia, the Golden Crescent); Burma, Thailand and Laos
(Southeast Asia, the Golden Triangle); and Mexico. In 1984, an
estimated 51 percent of United States heroin came from Southwest
Asia, 32 percent from Mexico and 17 percent from Southeast Asia. </p>

<p>From 1983 to 1984 illicit opium production decreased in
Southwest Asia. This change resulted from decreased figures for
opium production in Afghanistan caused by adverse weather
conditions and a change in the methodology used to estimate opium
production in Afghanistan. While total opium production for
Southwest Asia decreased in 1984, significant production
increases were noted in Southeast Asia and Mexico. </p>

<p>Opium poppy cultivation has begun to appear in the United
States as well. During a Federal raid in August 1985, more than
4,000 opium plants were discovered in Vermont, Washington,
Michigan and California. Although officials of the Drug
Enforcement Administration believe this opium was used for
smoking, the potential for domestic heroin production exists. </p>

<p>While America's heroin addict population has remained
relatively stable, the problem of heroin addiction in Europe has
increased significantly in recent years. According to a 1984
United Nations report: </p>

<p>The drug abuse and trafficking situation in Western Europe is
grim and deteriorating . . . Western Europe remains seriously
affected by heroin abuse which is a major public health problem. </p>

<p>The number of heroin addicts in the opium producing and other
countries is also significant. </p>

<p>There is a greater sense of the need for international
cooperation on the problem of drugs, in part because drug
producing nations are now feeling the effects of drug abuse, with
which the industrialized world has dealt for decades. This
development is critical if drug control efforts, including crop
eradication, interdiction and drug education, are to be
successful. </p>

<p>Processing </p>

<p>The production of heroin begins after the petals of the opium
poppy flower have fallen. Several incisions are then made in the
seed pod from which sap oozes. The sap dries, darkens and becomes
gummy, and is scraped from the pod. This dried sap is raw opium.
Each pod can be incised up to five different times. </p>

<p>To produce one kilogram of heroin, a precipitating agent is
added to 10-12 kilograms of opium. This mixture is pressed,
leaving one kilogram of morphine base. This base is treated with
acetic anhydride, which yields one kilogram of heroin. In another
production method, poppies are allowed to mature and dry.
Alkaloids are then extracted from these plants leaving poppy
straw concentrate, which is sold in a brownish powder form. </p>

<p>Marijuana </p>

<p>Scope of the Problem </p>

<p>According to the most recent National Survey on Drug Abuse,
which was conducted in 1982, 50-60 million Americans,
approximately 20-25 percent of the entire population, have tried
marijuana; and 20 million people use the drug at least once per
month. Marijuana use has been widespread in this country for the
last two decades. Both the number of users and the duration of
marijuana's popularity indicate that marijuana use is firmly
entrenched in American society. </p>

<p>Although some surveys indicate that the number of marijuana
users has been declining recently, levels of use remain
significantly higher than for any other illicit drug. The
National Survey on Drug Abuse indicates a decline in marijuana
use for some age groups. Yet the survey shows that in 1982, 11.5
percent of 12-17-year-olds and 27 percent of 18-25 year olds used
marijuana at least once per month. The study indicates a slight,
but steady, increase in marijuana use among people over age 25.
In 1977, 3.3 percent reported monthly marijuana use, compared
with 6.0 percent in 1982. According to the survey of high school
seniors conducted each year by the University of Michigan
Institute for Social Research, marijuana use among high school
seniors peaked in 1978, when 37 percent of these students
reported monthly use of marijuana and 11 percent reported daily
use of the drug. By 1984 these figures had dropped to 25 percent
and 5 percent respectively. However, this decline in marijuana
use ended in 1985 when 26 percent of the survey respondents
reported monthly marijuana use. </p>

<p>Marijuana consumption and the number of marijuana-associated
emergency room visits have remained relatively steady in recent
years. In 1984 Americans consumed an estimated 7,800-9,200 metric
tons of marijuana, as compared with 8,000-9,600 metric tons in
1983. Use of marijuana in conjunction with other drugs,
particularly PCP, diazepam and cocaine, increased in 1984. </p>

<p>The Marijuana User </p>

<p>Marijuana is probably used by a wider demographic
cross-section of American society than any other drug. This
widespread use was recognized by the 1972 National Commission on
Marihuana [sic] and Drug Abuse: </p>

<p>The stereotype of the marihuana [sic] user as a marginal
citizen has given way to a composite picture of large segments of
American youth, children of the dominant majority and very much
part of the mainstream of American life. </p>

<p>While it appears that marijuana, like other drugs, is most
commonly used by those between the ages of 18 and 25, its use is
by no means confined to that age group. One analysis of marijuana
use found that: </p>

<p>Marijuana is now found at the Friday afternoon brainstorming
sessions of a New York publishing house. In the cabs of long-haul
trucks. In the office of a president of a cosmetic firm. Even, it
is alleged, among executives of major American banks. </p>

<p>According to the 1982 National Survey on Drug Abuse, 23
percent of 16 and 17 year olds, 8 percent of 14 and 15 year olds,
and 2 percent of 12 and 13 year olds used marijuana at least once
per month. Surveys have indicated marijuana use in children as
young as nine years old. </p>

<p>Health Effects of Marijuana Use </p>

<p>Marijuana includes any part of the plant Canabis sativa. In
addition to marijuana, the following forms of cannabis are also
abused: hashish, a resin of the plant; hashish oil, a liquid
concentrate derived from cannabis; and sinsemilla, from the
female cannabis plant. </p>

<p>The effects of marijuana use have been the subject of
exaggeration and misunderstanding for decades. In 1936, for
example, the film &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; portrayed those
effects as instant violence and insanity. In 1972 the National
Commission on Marihuana [sic] and Drug Abuse embraced the
opposite extreme: </p>

<p>No conclusive evidence exists of any physical damage,
disturbances of bodily processes or proven human fatalities
attributable solely to even high doses of marijuana . . . [The]
few consistently observed transient effects on bodily function
seem to suggest that marihuana [sic] is a rather unexciting
compound of negligible immediate toxicity at the doses usually
consumed in this country. </p>

<p>Both views have been refuted by medical evidence gathered
since the early 1970's. Today marijuana is described as &quot;the
most chemically complex of all commonly used illegal drugs.&quot;
Marijuana contains 421 known chemicals, which when smoked are
combusted into more than 2,000 chemical compounds. Marijuana is
variously classified as a stimulant, depressant and hallucinogen
because its effects vary among users. </p>

<p>Those chemicals found only in cannabis are called
cannabinoids. The primary intoxicant in marijuana is
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The concentration of The in
marijuana has steadily increased over the last decade as a result
of improved agricultural techniques. Analysis of marijuana
samples indicates that the average percentage of The in marijuana
has increased from .7 percent in 1973, to 3.1 percent in 1982, to
5.6 percent in 1983. The potencies have been reported as high as
14 percent in domestically produced sinsemilla. </p>

<p>Since 1967 when the first intensive government research
program on marijuana began, over 7,000 scientific papers have
been published on the subject. Contrary to the findings of the
1972 National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, adverse
physical and psychological effects associated with marijuana use
have been demonstrated. The measurement of long-term effects of
marijuana use are at present problematic because marijuana
smoking has been prevalent in the United States for only
approximately 15 to 20 years, shorter than the latency period for
many marijuana-related diseases. In the case of tobacco it was
not until after 50 years of heavy use that there was ample
evidence to issue warnings about its effects. </p>

<p>Despite the common public perception that marijuana is less
harmful than tobacco, scientific evidence indicates that
marijuana, in fact, causes substantially more adverse health
effects, due in part to the properties of the drug itself and the
manner in which it is smoked. Marijuana is not filtered, as are
most tobacco cigarettes, and marijuana smoke is generally inhaled
more deeply and held in the lungs longer than tobacco smoke.
Marijuana smoke has been found to contain many of the same
chemicals as tobacco smoke; indeed it has 50 percent more of
cancer-causing hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. </p>

<p>According to the American Lung Association, marijuana smoking
harms the lungs and may cause bronchitis, emphysema and lung
cancer. Evidence supporting this conclusion has been building for
a number of years. For example, a 1976 study reported that
examinations of human lung tissue &quot;have found malignant
cellular changes after shorter periods of exposure to marijuana
smoke than to tobacco smoke.&quot; One comprehensive review of
marijuana projects that: </p>

<p>Starting in the latter 1980's, we predict an increase in the
rate of lung cancer among middle-aged people, representing the
marijuana epidemic that began in the mid-sixties. Those smoking
both tobacco and marijuana are most at risk. </p>

<p>Marijuana use can also adversely affect both male and female
reproduction. Marijuana use by pregnant women is particularly
dangerous and has been linked to lowered birth weight, fetal
abnormalities and nervous disorders in offspring. These adverse
physical effects are magnified because cannabinoids, being fat
soluble, collect in the fatty organs of the body, such as the
testis or ovaries, brain and liver. This is of particular concern
because marijuana is used by a large population of young people
whose lungs, reproductive organs, and other parts of their bodies
are still maturing and are particularly vulnerable to the adverse
effects of drugs. </p>

<p>In addition to these physical effects of marijuana use,
several psychological and behavioral effects have also been
associated with the drug. These behavioral changes have been
called &quot;the amotivational syndrome.&quot; Although lack of
motivation may often precede marijuana use, many clinicians have
concluded that: </p>

<p>Motivational effects are directly related to use and . . .
following cessation of marijuana use normal motivation may
return. </p>

<p>In addition to the effects of marijuana on motivation,
marijuana use has been found to affect short-term memory,
concentration, and logical thinking. A 1982 report concerning the
impact of marijuana use on education concludes that: </p>

<p>Every element of learning is incompatible with either the
acute intoxication or the chronic mental change that marijuana
use can bring. </p>

<p>A 1980 study reported that use of marijuana 20 times or more
per month is &quot;positively correlated with absenteeism and
poor school achievement among high school seniors.&quot; These
conclusions are particularly disturbing given the fact that tens
of thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands, of adolescents
use marijuana every day. </p>

<p>A final concern in this area, marijuana's role as a
&quot;gateway&quot; to subsequent use of more dangerous drugs,
cannot be categorized as either physical or psychological. While
many beliefs about marijuana have been proven wrong by subsequent
research, this concept has been affirmed. This
&quot;gateway&quot; theory does not indicate that marijuana use
will definitely lead to the use of other drugs; however,
according to a review of marijuana studies conducted by the
Department of Health and Human Services, </p>

<p>Statistically, there is little question that use, particularly
heavier use, is associated with a likelihood of experimentation
with other drugs. </p>

<p>Synthetic Drugs </p>

<p>Scope of the Problem </p>

<p>Many illicit drugs do not occur naturally. Unlike cocaine,
heroin and marijuana, which are derived from plants, synthetic
drugs are produced solely from chemicals. These synthetic drugs
include stimulants, depressants and hallucinogens, known as
dangerous drugs; synthetic narcotics, such as methadone; and
controlled substance analogs, often called &quot;designer
drugs.&quot; A controlled substance analog has a chemical
structure similar to a controlled substance, and is designed to
produce a similar effect. </p>

<p>Use of synthetic drugs is widespread in the United States.
More than six million Americans used synthetic drugs for
non-medical purposes in 1982. Over 2.5 million people abused
depressants, approximately 2.8 million abused stimulants, and
almost 1 million abused hallucinogens. Consumption of
&quot;dangerous drugs&quot; increased 15 percent between 1983 and
1984, from an estimated 2.66 billion dosage units to 3.06 billion
dosage units. The greatest increases were associated with
methamphetamine and phencyclidine (PCP). Methamphetamine-related
emergency room visits increased 20 percent from 1983 to 1984, and
deaths associated with both amphetamine and methamphetamine also
increased in 1984. </p>

<p>Statistics regarding the use of controlled substance analogs
are difficult to compile. This is because the use of these
substances is a relatively new phenomenon, and medical examiners
have generally failed to identify controlled substance analogs as
a cause of death. Despite these difficulties, one synthetic
analog has been responsible for the deaths of at least 100 people
on the West Coast. While most of these deaths occurred in
California, many law enforcement authorities fear that production
and use of controlled substance analogs might spread across the
country because of the ease of production and large profit margin
associated with these drugs. This spread has already occurred in
at least one instance: drug treatment program directors in
California, Florida, New York, Texas and Virginia have reported
cases of use of the controlled substance analog MDMA. </p>

<p>Synthetic Drug Users </p>

<p>While synthetic drugs are used for a wide range of medicinal
purposes, they are also widely abused by individuals from all
socioeconomic groups. According to a 1978 study of individuals in
treatment for stimulant and/or depressant drug abuse, 68 percent
were men, 61 percent were white, 20 percent black and 19 percent
of another ethnicity, 59 percent were unemployed, 77 percent had
previously been treated for drug abuse, 59 percent were 25 years
of age or older, and 46 percent had less than a twelfth grade
education. </p>

<p>While most people associate heroin use with crime, a 1982
study by the RAND Corporation found violent crime to be committed
most often by multi-drug users, particularly those using
combinations including dangerous drugs. Certain synthetic drugs
are particularly associated with crime. A study of all arrestees
in Washington, D.C., from May 1984 to April 1985 found that PCP,
an hallucinogen, is the drug most often detected in these
arrestees. An average of over 30 percent of all adults arrested
in Washington, D.C., during this period tested positive for PCP
use. A study of almost 5,000 male arrestees in New York City in
1984 found that 12 percent of those arrested had PCP in their
bodies. </p>

<p>Health Effects of Synthetic Drug Use </p>

<p>Tolerance to stimulants develops quickly. Because of the
&quot;crash,&quot; or depression, followed by stimulant use,
users tend to take stimulants more often in order to compensate
for or avoid the post-stimulant letdown. Stimulant users are
subject to a vicious cycle in which they must take depressants at
night to be able to reverse the stimulant's effects. Stimulants
can cause physical dependence and death. Withdrawal is
characterized by depression, fatigue and excessive sleep, which
may last for several days. Other withdrawal symptoms, including
anxiety and thoughts of suicide, may last for weeks or months. </p>

<p>Depressants can also cause tolerance and physical dependence.
Abuse of depressants is marked by impaired judgment, slurred
speech and loss of motor coordination. Depressants are
particularly dangerous when used in combination with alcohol or
other drugs. Heavy use of depressants can cause a weak, rapid
pulse, shallow respiration, coma and death. </p>

<p>Hallucinogens alter mood, and, in large doses, cause delusions
and hallucinations. This impaired judgment can lead a user to
physically harm himself or others. &quot;Flashbacks,&quot; in
which the user has a brief recurrence of the psychedelic effects
of hallucinogens, sometimes occur long after the drug is used.
Tolerance and psychological dependence can also result. PCP,
often called &quot;Angel Dust,&quot; is one of the most dangerous
and widely abused hallucinogens. Reactions to PCP are
unpredictable and include euphoria, depression, anxiety or panic.
PCP use is associated with extremely violent behavior, including
assault, rape, and murder. Feelings of omnipotence sometimes lead
a PCP user to suicidal behavior, including walking in front of
moving vehicles or jumping out of windows. </p>

<p>Controlled substance analogs are designed to mimic the effects
of various drugs and are particularly dangerous because of their
toxicity. One synthetic analog, 3-methyl fentanyl, is up to 1,000
times more potent than morphine. According to Dr. Robert J.
Roberton of California's Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs,
&quot;You could kill 50 people with the amount that fits on the
head of a pin.&quot; </p>

<p>Fentanyl analogs, the most commonly abused controlled
substance analogs, produce a feeling of euphoria similar to that
associated with heroin use. These drugs also produce respiratory
depression and muscle rigidity. MPTP, which is a synthetic analog
of the narcotic meperidine, causes brain damage, Parkinson's
disease and death. Although Parkinson's disease usually strikes
people in their fifties and sixties, people of various ages, who
have used MPTP, have contracted the disease, which causes slowed
movement, tremors, rigidity, dementia and death. The neurological
damage associated with use of MPTP is irreversible. </p>

<p>Drug Abuse Fuels Drug Trafficking </p>

<p>Drug abuse in the United States is a problem of vast and
growing proportions Millions of Americans use cocaine, heroin,
marijuana, or synthetic drugs, or combinations of these drugs.
Consumption of cocaine and dangerous drugs has increased recently
as have the deleterious health effects associated with then. The
downward trend in marijuana use which began in 1979 appears to
have ended at least temporarily in 1985. </p>

<p>Particularly dangerous forms of drug use have increased during
the last few years. Use of &quot;crack,&quot; coca base which is
smoked and which has been called the most potent, addictive, and
cheapest form of cocaine, has become prevalent in the New York
City area. Use of &quot;designer drugs,&quot; some of which have
caused Parkinson's disease, have been blamed for over 100 deaths.
There is evidence of a link between intravenous drug use and the
contraction of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). </p>

<p>Drug abuse affects much more than the individual drug user; it
also impacts on families, communities and entire governments. The
taint of drugs has reached into virtually every aspect of
American life, from public safety to the integrity of
professional sports. These problems and the full range of massive
government and private responses discussed in this report,
including increased education and enforcement efforts, expanded
intelligence and interdiction programs, and diversions of
military resources, costing billions of dollars, is the direct
result of a single cause: the destructive self-indulgence of
individual drug purchasers. Each time a drug user buys cocaine,
heroin, or other drugs, he makes a contribution to organized
crime. Such contributions are the sole sustenance of the
violence, corruption, illness and death that trafficking groups
bring to this and other societies. </p>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter III Part 1: Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime </h2>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>Drug trafficking is the most widespread and lucrative
organized crime operation in the United States, accounting for
nearly 40 percent of this country's organized crime activity and
generating an annual income estimated to be as high as $110
billion. Large trafficking organizations dominate the illicit
drug market. These groups include the &quot;families&quot; of
America's La Cosa Nostra, as well as an array of more recently
identified crime groups such as the Sicilian &quot;Mafia,&quot;
outlaw motorcycle gangs and groups based in the Nigerian and
Colombian communities. While La Cosa Nostra has historically been
involved in narcotics trafficking, newer organizations, in many
ways quite different from La Cosa Nostra, now play a major role
in the drug trade. Generally, these newer groups develop solely
around drug trafficking operations and are activity-specific,
dependent only on drug-related criminal activity for income. They
tend to be more fluidly organized than La Cosa Nostra, and are
not as self-contained but are marked by a degree of violence and
corruption unsurpassed by any other criminal activity. </p>

<p>Organized crime groups involved in drug trafficking, however,
share a central feature with other organized crime groups in that
they consist of a core criminal group and a specialized criminal
support designed to facilitate illicit activity. This
&quot;core/support&quot; configuration is one this Commission has
found to be common to all organized crime groups today. </p>

<p>Cocaine Trafficking </p>

<p>America's cocaine supply at present originates exclusively in
South America. Coca is cultivated principally in Peru, Bolivia,
Colombia and Ecuador, and conversion laboratories have been
located in Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela. Other South American
and Caribbean countries serve as transshipment sites. All phases
of the cocaine trade, including cultivation, processing and
distribution have expanded since 1984, and the industry shows no
signs of diminishing despite the fact that cocaine supply already
exceeds consumer demand. </p>

<p>Control of the cocaine industry has traditionally been
maintained by a cartel of Colombian traffickers. Colombian groups
are the largest, wealthiest, most sophisticated organizations
trafficking in cocaine. A key to their domination of the market
has been their control of the processing laboratories used to
convert coca grown traditionally in Bolivia and Peru. Export of
the drug to the United States has also been handled almost
exclusively by Colombian trafficking organizations. While
Colombians currently control an estimated 75 percent of the
cocaine distributed to the United States, their domination has
been lessened recently both by the Colombian government's
imposition of severe restrictions on the importation of chemicals
essential to cocaine processing and by the destruction of cocaine
processing sites throughout Colombia by government authorities.
In 1984 three major Colombian conversion laboratories were
discovered and destroyed: at Tranquilandia, the largest facility,
ten metric tons of cocaine and 10,000 barrels of processing
chemicals were seized. In total, Colombian authorities
confiscated 16 metric tons of cocaine in 1984, a 600 percent
increase from the 2.5 metric tons seized in the previous year.
The pressures on cocaine traffickers were compounded in that year
by the Colombian government's decision to extradite drug
traffickers to the United States, and by the subsequent issuance
of warrants for the arrest of several major traffickers. </p>

<p>Intensified Colombian law enforcement measures have had
significant impact on trafficking operations. The initiatives
have prompted many traffickers to seek refuge in other South
American countries, and in some cases to relocate their
processing laboratories. These incidents have resulted in a
geographic dispersal of cocaine processing and export activities,
most notably to Bolivia and Peru. While it appeared initially
that activity in these countries was sponsored and overseen by
Colombian traffickers, increasing evidence suggests that groups
in both countries are becoming self-sufficient. Such
developments, however, remain an exception to the prevailing
Colombian dominance. </p>

<p>Despite the spread of cocaine activity through South America,
Colombian groups have left little room in the cocaine trade for
small-scale smugglers. While some independent operators and
smaller smuggling groups occasionally work independently of the
Colombian cartel, most are tied to the larger organization in at
least a contractor relationship. </p>

<p>The Colombian Connection: Origins </p>

<p>The Colombian involvement in U.S. cocaine trafficking can be
traced to the influx of Cuban citizens to South Florida after the
Castro Revolution in the early 1960's. Some of the Cuban-settled
communities became bases for the continuation of established
Cuban organized crime networks known as the &quot;Cuban
Mafia.&quot; The Cuban Mafia had been a major distributor of the
cocaine in Cuba, where the drug has long been accepted as a
social luxury, and thus had existing connections with South
American cocaine trafficking organizations. At first, the Florida
Cuban Mafia factions imported only enough cocaine to satisfy
members of their own community, but by the mid-1960's, they began
to import greater quantities of the drug in an effort to expand
distribution and increase profit. By 1965 Colombians supplied
nearly 100 percent of the cocaine moving through the Cuban
networks. Colombians refined the drug and Cubans trafficked and
distributed it in the United States. The system worked for a
time, but the Colombians increasingly desired control of the
entire operation. Through the late 1960's and early 1970's they
became more involved in cocaine production, and increased their
trafficking role. By 1978 Colombian traffickers had cut all ties
with the Cubans and assumed the dominant role they now play in
supplying cocaine to the American market. </p>

<p>Colombian groups have continued to control the U.S. cocaine
market through the 1980's for a number of reasons.
Geographically, Colombia is well-positioned both to receive coca
from Peru and Bolivia and to export the processed drug to the
United States either by air or by sea. In addition, the country's
vast central forests effectively conceal clandestine processing
laboratories and air strips, which facilitate the traffic.
Perhaps most importantly, the Colombians have a momentum by
benefit of their early involvement in the cocaine trade. They
have evolved from small, disassociated groups into
compartmentalized organizations and are sophisticated and
systematized in their approach to trafficking cocaine in the
United States. Further, groups in the Colombian population in the
U.S. provide traffickers access to this country and often serves
as a distribution network for Colombian cocaine. </p>

<p>The Colombian Organization </p>

<p>The major Colombian trafficking organizations are structured
to control each intermediate step required in processing and
exporting cocaine. Like traditional organized crime groups, they
are built of interdependent and essential component
&quot;divisions,&quot; each with a specialized area of
responsibility. Different members act as laborers, processors,
transporters, financiers and enforcers. In addition,
organizations generally supplement their regular membership with
criminal support of affiliates who perform services on a fee
basis. Few members of any organizational division are aware of
the others involved in the enterprise, and trafficking bosses are
well-insulated and protected by their organizations. </p>

<p>Organization laborers and processors prepare cocaine for U.S.
consumption. Most laborers in the cultivation phase are Peruvian
or Bolivian peasants who cultivate and harvest coca in remote
areas of the Eastern Andes, then process the coca leaves to base
in nearby villages. The growers are allied in small, independent
groups, but are typically financed, overseen, and protected by
members of a larger Colombian organization. </p>

<p>Processed coca base is usually flown on light aircraft from
the mountain villages to Colombian processing facilities by those
members of the Colombian organization responsible for
transportation. The planes land at clandestine airstrips, often
simple mud runways, located near the processing laboratories. The
laboratories vary widely in size, ranging from crude
small-quantity operations to large, sophisticated complexes, and
can be found both in Colombia's jungle and urban areas. </p>

<p>Coca base is typically processed to cocaine hydrochloride in
the laboratories, then bagged and taped into kilogram packages,
which are sometimes coded to indicate a particular United States
destination. The packages are loaded into duffle bags or burlap
sacks, then moved by the transportation group to a &quot;stash
house,&quot; a storage facility usually located near a seaport or
a clandestine airstrip. The cocaine is held at the stash house
until it is exported from Colombia. </p>

<p>Colombian trafficking organizations currently export an
estimated 62 percent of the cocaine they process on private
aircraft. The remaining 38 percent is shipped on ocean vessels or
smuggled on commercial air carriers. Most shipments are smuggled
out of Colombia from the country's northern coastal region, the
Guajira peninsula. Principal smuggling centers include the cities
of Santa Marta, Barranquilla, Cartagena, and Medellin. In
addition, a significant percentage of processed cocaine leaves
Colombia from airstrips located near larger processing facilities
in the jungles. </p>

<p>Typically, Colombian organizations oversee each cocaine
shipment from cultivation through wholesale transactions in the
United States. Retail and street-level sales are handled by a
variety of smaller groups and individuals in this country. </p>

<p>The money generated by the wholesale cocaine transaction is
maintained for the organization by financial experts familiar
with international banking, who are responsible for laundering,
banking and investing drug profits, and for assuring that a
portion of the drug profit is returned to Colombia for
reinvestment in the organization's cocaine enterprise. The
cartel's own financial experts are supported by a complement of
bankers, lawyers and other professionals in the United States,
who play a crucial role in facilitating these transactions. </p>

<p>Colombian trafficking organizations, like other organized
crime groups, rely on &quot;enforcement&quot; through violence
and intimidation to protect their inventory and profits.
&quot;Enforcement&quot; occurs both in Colombia and in the United
States and includes the collection of debts owed to the
organization and the elimination of interference from
competitors, informants and law enforcement officials. </p>

<p>Pilots: The American Affiliates </p>

<p>Cocaine is ordinarily smuggled from South America to the
United States for major trafficking organizations by American
citizens acting as mercenary pilots. Recruits include
ex-military, commercial and private pilots, and in some cases,
unlicensed aviators. The speed, mobility and evasive capabilities
of air transport have made it the preferred node of shipment
among Colombian traffickers, and many have built airstrips either
near their processing centers or along the coastlines to permit
the fast direct export of cocaine. On Colombia's north coast
alone, over 150 clandestine landing strips and three
international airports facilitate smuggling activities. </p>

<p>Individual pilots are generally responsible for purchasing or
leasing transportation vehicles and hiring flight crews.
Obtaining a plane for purchase seldom presents any difficulty,
since many aircraft are regularly advertised for sale in a number
of trade periodicals. One popular journal, Trade-a-Plane, is
published three times each month and advertises thousands of
aircraft available for sale in each issue. Planes are also
available for purchase at numerous government auctions of seized
properties. These events often allow traffickers to repurchase
aircraft, which they were previously forced to forfeit. </p>

<p>Because traffickers attempt to ship the largest possible
quantities of cocaine to the widest range of destinations in the
United States, the aircraft selected for smuggling generally
represent the optimum balance between range and cargo capacity.
The most popular of these are conventional light twin engine
planes, such as the Piper Aztec, Piper Navajo and the Cessna 400
series. Most such planes can transport about a ton of cocaine
over a range of about 1,800 miles and can stay airborne for 11
and one hours with standard fuel systems. Larger airplanes such
as DC-3 aircraft are common on shuttle flights between the United
States and various transshipment points; the fastest aircraft are
always preferred when available. </p>

<p>To maximize range and capability, smuggling planes are often
outfitted with auxiliary fuel systems. These auxiliary systems
may be attached to the outside body of the aircraft or the wing,
but must be inspected and approved by the Federal Aviation
Administration each time the outfitted aircraft prepares for
flight. A favored auxiliary system for cocaine traffickers is the
collapsible rubber fuel &quot;bladder,&quot; which may be placed
in the plane's fuselage, and simply folded up or thrown away
after the fuel contained within is used. The space occupied by
the bladder on the trip to Colombia can be utilized for cocaine
transport on the return journey. Bladders are, under all
circumstances, prohibited by Federal law. </p>

<p>Although the legitimate need for auxiliary fuel systems is
very limited, the systems are well-advertised and readily
available. One trafficker told the Commission he purchased
bladders and other long-range fuel systems regularly, always
paying the seller with &quot;suitcases full of cash.&quot; He
claims his cash was never questioned or refused. </p>

<p>Traffic From Colombia to the United States: The Hydra's Head </p>

<p>Smugglers use a vast number of both air and sea trafficking
routes to transport cocaine from South America to the United
States. The most commonly travelled routes are through the
Windward Passage between Cuba and Haiti, through the Yucatan
Channel between Mexico and Cuba, and through the Mona Passage,
bordered by the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. </p>

<p>Traditionally, 90 percent of the cocaine shipped by these
routes has entered the United States at points along the Florida
coast; traffickers now, however, more frequently deliver
shipments to all the States along the Gulf Coast and elsewhere
throughout this country. Cocaine traffic also now runs directly
from Colombia's west coast to California and other western
states. These shifts are perceived as a response by traffickers
to increased law enforcement pressure in South Florida,
specifically to the intensified efforts of the South
Florida/Caribbean Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.
The theme is a common one: as law enforcement closes off one
point of entry to drug traffickers, traffickers develop many new
points of entry as replacements. </p>

<p>Air Shipment </p>

<p>Nearly two-thirds of the cocaine exported from South America
to the United State is transported by general aviation aircraft.
Planes of all sizes, ranging from small turbo-prop craft to large
C-123 cargo transport planes, are used for drug shipment. Small
aircraft, which cannot carry adequate fuel to allow direct flight
from Colombia to the United States, must refuel at transshipment
points between the two countries. These contact points are
indispensable, and are located throughout Central America, the
Dominican Republic, Cuba, the Bahamas and Puerto Rico.
Transshipment points may be simply refueling stations, or may be
bases or stations equipped to allow cocaine off-loading and
repackaging. From the transshipment points, cocaine is generally
ferried to the United States by small planes or boats. </p>

<p>Mexico has gained popularity as a transshipment point since
1980. Although coca cultivation has not been observed in Mexico,
an estimated 10 to 20 percent of the cocaine exported to the
United States currently transits that country. Three Mexican
transshipment patterns are typical. First, Mexican traffickers
obtain cocaine in South America, transport it to Mexico, then
traffic the drug overland into the United States. Second,
Colombian or American couriers travel by commercial aircraft from
South America to Mexico, then cross the border into this country.
Finally, Colombian or North American traffickers use Mexico's
numerous clandestine airstrips, especially in Yucatan, for
refueling and for loading purposes; the smuggling plane in use
may continue directly into the United States, or the shipment may
be broken into smaller loads, then trafficked overland by Mexican
organizations. The majority of cocaine shipped through Mexico is
transported to the United States by car, truck or bus, but a
significant amount is smuggled aboard small aircraft. The Mexican
groups, formerly limited primarily to trafficking heroin and
marijuana, have eagerly expanded their role as middlemen between
Colombian traffickers and American consumers. </p>

<p>Maritime Shipment </p>

<p>An estimated 18 percent (15 tons in 1984) of the cocaine
trafficked into the United States is exported from South America
by sea vessel. All types of ships are used for smuggling, from
small high-speed cigarette boats to large commercial cargo
carriers. Colombians dominate maritime cocaine smuggling, and
most shipments depart that country's north coastline, which
features three major seaports and countless debarkation ports for
smaller craft. Approximately one-half of the cocaine exported by
sea is concealed in commercial vessels, and a smaller percentage
is shipped in private boats which are frequently outfitted with
special compartments designed for drug storage. Small amounts of
cocaine are also often shipped on with marijuana on
non-commercial smuggling vessels. </p>

<p>Maritime trafficking routes have shifted significantly in the
past five years, primarily in response to increased law
enforcement surveillance. While a major portion of the maritime
traffic formerly flowed directly into South Florida, traffickers
now increasingly use the longer eastern routes through the
Caribbean to the Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts, as well as
direct routes to the U.S. west coast. These routes make smuggling
more expensive for traffickers, since they require larger
vessels, larger crews and more sophisticated electronic
equipment. </p>

<p>Case Study: Devoe Airlines </p>

<p>Devoe Airlines was a scheduled commuter air service operating
between Miami and smaller Florida cities during the early 1980's.
Owned by Miami pilot Jack Devoe, the business was essentially a
front for a Colombian drug trafficking operation, which included
regular large quantity marijuana and cocaine smuggling. In total,
8 to 10 contract pilots employed by Devoe were involved in over
100 trafficking flights over a five year period and carried
roughly 7,000 pounds of cocaine from South America to the United
States. Jack Devoe estimates that his flying organization grossed
millions of dollars each month during peak smuggling periods. </p>

<p>Devoe's trafficking pilots initially travelled non-stop routes
between the United States and Colombia, but developed a
transshipment point on Little Derby Island in the Bahamas for
purposes of &quot;security . . . [and] police protection&quot; in
the 1980's. Devoe hired six to eight employees to work as needed
at the island base to unload and repackage drug shipments. There
was no interference from Bahamian law enforcement at the Little
Darby base &quot;as long as the payments [to officials] were on
time.&quot; </p>

<p>Typically operating mid-size turbo-prop aircraft, Devoe pilots
departed for Colombia either from the base at Little Derby Island
or from Florida airports. Their route took them through the
Windward Passage generally to Colombian locations about 60 miles
south of the equator. In the early stages of the operation,
landings were made at official Colombian airports including the
airfields at Santa Marta and Riohacha. In at least one instance,
cocaine was openly loaded onto the smuggling aircraft at Riohacha
airport. In the early 1980's Devoe shifted landings to
clandestine jungle airstrips maintained by the organization's
cocaine supplier, Pepe Cabrera. This system streamlined the
trafficking process by eliminating transport of the cocaine to an
airport. The cocaine shipment was loaded directly onto the
aircraft near the strip, where the plane was simultaneously
prepared for the return flight. </p>

<p>Generally, Devoe pilots returned to the United States within
one day. Their preferred return route extended along the
Colombia/Venezuela border, over Haiti, and to the Bahamian base
on Little Derby Island. There, cocaine was sealed into the wing
fuel tanks of a small aircraft and flown directly into South
Florida for delivery to the cartel's representative there. </p>

<p>The Devoe organization's methods for avoiding interdiction
between South America and the United States were relatively
simple and typical of such smuggling operations. A Devoe pilot
learned the frequencies of DEA surveillance aircraft on one
occasion by &quot;acting like a helicopter buff&quot; inspecting
a DEA Cobra pursuit helicopter parked near the Devoe hangar.
Inside the helicopter the pilot copied the frequencies from a
clipboard hanging on the instrument panel. As the pilot explained
to the Commission: </p>

<p>By [subsequently] using our scanner and our knowledge of the
frequencies in use, we could monitor the activities of DEA planes
. . . we could learn not only the activities of the planes, but
also go up and check the plane out. By learning what types of
aircraft DEA was using we could plan our own strategy more
effectively . . . </p>

<p>Devoe also regularly sent &quot;cover-flight&quot; aircraft
ahead of the smuggling planes along the trafficking route to
monitor DEA and Customs Service surveillance patrols by radio.
These planes, which carried no drug cargo, were also used to
decoy pursuit aircraft. Once in the United States, Devoe strategy
for clearing Customs inspection was to: </p>

<p>&quot;. . . act normally and file a flight plan, come in and
land, and let them inspect the airplane . . . Customs inspectors
were far less interested in a lengthy examination of my plane if
I came in on a Sunday afternoon in the middle of the televised
football game. If the Dolphins were playing, that was even
better.&quot; </p>

<p>Using these tactics, Devoe Airlines was able to complete over
100 trafficking flights from Colombia without interference from
law enforcement authorities. </p>

<p>Case Study: Barry Seal </p>

<p>Adler Berriman Seal, a former TWA 747 captain, flew cocaine
from Colombia to the United States for over seven years during
the late 1970's and early 1980's. Seal was recruited as a
trafficking pilot by a personal friend who worked for the
Colombian cocaine trafficking organization headed by Jorge Ochoa,
and eventually worked directly with that organization's
leadership. </p>

<p>Initially, Seal flew direct trafficking flights between
Louisiana, and Colombia. He piloted a number of different
smuggling aircraft, the largest of which was a Vietnam-vintage
C-123 capable of holding tons of packaged cocaine. Seal always
departed and returned to his Louisiana base at night to reduce
chances of interdiction. His typical route took him over the
Yucatan Peninsula (not over the more heavily patrolled Yucatan
channel) and directly over Central America to the eastern tip of
Honduras, then south to any one of a number of airstrips and
airports in north central Colombia. </p>

<p>According to Seal, the Ochoa organization paid Colombian
officials bribes of $10,000 to $25,000, per flight for a
&quot;window,&quot; i.e., a specific time, position and altitude
designated for the smuggling flight's penetration of the
Colombian air space. If this payment was not made, the aircraft
was susceptible to interception by Colombian authorities. Seal
generally arrived in Colombia at dawn. His aircraft was loaded
with cocaine and refueled within an hour, sometimes within
fifteen minutes; and he returned immediately to the United
States. </p>

<p>Seal used two fairly simple techniques to avoid interdiction
on his return trip to the United States: both were effective
because of the heavy helicopter traffic running between the Gulf
Coast States and the hundreds of oil rigs located off shore.
First, when he reached the middle of the Gulf on his return trip,
Seal slowed his aircraft to 110-120 knots and was thus perceived
by monitoring radar as a helicopter, not a plane. Secondly, at a
distance of about 50 miles off the United States coast, he
dropped the aircraft to an altitude of 500-1000 feet in order to
co-mingle with the helicopter traffic, and thereby arouse even
less suspicion. </p>

<p>Once in United States airspace, Seal proceeded to prearranged
points 40 to 50 miles inland. The points were mapped out in
advance with Loran C, a long-range navigational instrument.
Further inland, he was generally joined by a helicopter. The two
aircraft proceeded to a drop zone, where the helicopter hovered
close to the ground. Seal then dropped the load of cocaine from
the airplane on a parachute; the helicopter picked up the load
from the drop zone and delivered it to waiting automobiles, which
eventually moved the cocaine to Miami. Seal proceeded to land his
drug-free aircraft at any nearby airport. </p>

<p>Seal was well paid for his services. He claims his top fee for
smuggling a kilogram of cocaine was $5,000; an average load was
300 kilograms. His most profitable single load netted him $1.5
million. He was never apprehended in connection with this
operation. </p>

<p>Specialized Electronics: The Smuggler's Edge </p>

<p>Like many trafficking pilots today, both Seal and Devoe relied
on sophisticated electronic equipment to maintain and secure
communications within their organization and to monitor law
enforcement surveillance efforts. Most devices used, while
expensive, are readily available in the United States, and
trafficking organizations, of course, fund the purchase of any
equipment that will facilitate their operations. Seal, for
example, once spent over $200,000 cash on communication and
surveillance equipment for the Ochoa cocaine trafficking
organization here in the United States in a two-day period.
Payments for this type of equipment are almost always made in
cash - sometimes suitcases full of cash - and are rarely refused.
</p>

<p>The communication devices most commonly used by traffickers
include state of the art radio equipment, communication
scramblers, pocket pagers and encrypting devices. The equipment
is used to prevent law enforcement interception of communication
between traffickers. A scrambler, for example, attaches to an
ordinary radio, and &quot;scrambles&quot; the normal radio
frequency with a number of different codes. Only someone with a
receiver coded to the particular scrambler frequency can decipher
the transmitted message; the transmission is unintelligible to
all other receivers. Digital encryption devices are used to send
messages in code, and are often secured so that they can be
accessed only after a security number is punched directly into
the device. The security feature allows only members of the
trafficking organization, who know the access code, to send or
decipher coded messages. The speed with which a digital message
is transmitted precludes radio tracking, at least by traditional
triangulation. </p>

<p>Among the other specialized devices used by traffickers to
detect and avoid law enforcement surveillance are radar
altimeters, beacon-interrogating digital radar, position tracking
equipment and long-range navigation instruments. Latest
generation night vision goggles are also frequently used by
traffickers flying at low altitudes in darkness. The strap-on
goggles intensify any available light by a factor of 50,000 and
greatly reduce a smuggler's risk of interdiction by allowing him
to fly his aircraft without lights. </p>

<p>The Combined Effort </p>

<p>A number of independent Colombian trafficking organizations,
among them the largest and most powerful operations, work in
collaboration on individual smuggling ventures. As described by
DEA special agent Michael Fredericks, the resulting organization
is fluid: </p>

<p>There is a level of organization that may involve . . . a
handful of people at the top. . . Below that level . . . there
are many workers who move between one organization and another. .
. It seems that in the Colombian organizations, a laboratory
operator may work for 1 [specific] trafficker . . . and not even
be aware of it simple because of the levels of insulation. </p>

<p>At the time of the preparation of this report, three men,
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria, Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasques, and
Carlos Enrique Lehder-Rivas, were reported to control the most
significant trafficking organizations in Colombia. Known as
&quot;Los Grandes Mafiosos&quot; in the Colombian press, each
directs a separate organization, but the organizations work in
concert and exchange personnel and equipment in various instances
to maximize efficiency and profit. The resulting cartel system
affords these traffickers numerous advantages, among them control
over the price and the quality of Colombian cocaine, greater
access to smuggling and processing equipment, and a wide variety
of methods by which to avoid law enforcement. </p>

<p>A chart detailing a temporary cooperative venture based in
Medellin, Colombia, between the Pablo Escobar organization and
the Jorge Ochoa organization was confiscated from a mid-level
trafficker involved in the operation, and was provided to the
Commission by the Drug Enforcement Administration (Figure 2). As
diagrammed, the Escobar and Ochoa organizations combined and
divided the trafficking responsibilities typically completed by a
single organization. The same component parts - labor,
processing, transportation, finance and enforcement - were
carried over from the individual organizations, with the Escobar
group taking responsibility for production activities, and the
Ochoa group handling enforcement and finances. </p>

<p>Colombia Cracks Down </p>

<p>Through the 1970's cocaine traffickers operated throughout
Colombia with little interference, and in fact with considerable
support from the Colombian government. The situation changed in
April 1984 when drug traffickers assassinated Colombia's Minister
of Justice, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. Lara's assassination came two
months after he authorized a raid on a major cocaine processing
plant known as Tranquilandia in Southeastern Colombia's Llanos
region, which resulted in the destruction of over $1 billion
worth of cocaine. Following Lara's assassination, Colombian
President Belisario Betancur Cuartas declared a &quot;war without
quarter&quot; on all drug smugglers and signed extradition orders
for a number of known major traffickers. President Betancur also
shifted trafficking trials to Colombia's military courts,
increased eradication and interdiction efforts within his
country, and increased regulation of those chemicals necessary
for processing coca base into cocaine. </p>

<p>President Betancur's actions have had important ramifications
both for traffickers and for other South and Central American
governments. When the intensified Colombian programs became
effective, a number of major traffickers, among them Escobar,
Lehder and Ochoa, went into hiding and moved their processing
operations to neighboring countries. In 1984 processing
laboratories as well as stockpiles of essential conversion
chemicals were discovered and destroyed in Panama, Venezuela,
Mexico and Canada. Evidence suggests that significant processing
activity is now also taking place in Nicaragua and Brazil. The
Colombian regulation of ether and other essential precursor
chemicals has resulted in an increase in cocaine processing
activity in the United States: 21 processing laboratories were
discovered and destroyed in South Florida in 1984 as opposed to
11 in 1983. </p>

<p>In March 1985 despite his status as a fugitive, Carlos Lehder
appeared on Colombian television, filmed live from a jungle
clearing by a Spanish film crew. Lehder used the television
opportunity, which he had arranged, to appeal to the Colombian
revolutionary organizations to participate in the &quot;cocaine
bonanza . . . the arm of the struggle against America.&quot; He
also characterized cocaine as the &quot;Achilles heel of American
imperialism.&quot; Lehder disappeared into the jungle after the
interview and remains at large, presumably in the remote jungles
of Colombia. </p>

<p>Heroin Trafficking </p>

<p>Traditional Organized Crime: La Cosa Nostra and the French
Connection </p>

<p>Heroin trafficking in this country first became big business
in the 1920's, when organized criminals based in New York City's
Jewish community began to control the importation and
distribution of the drug. By the late 1930's, La Cosa Nostra
joined the Jewish groups in the heroin enterprise, importing the
drug from France, Asia and the Mideast. When these sources became
inaccessible during World War II, Mexico became the major U.S.
heroin supplier. </p>

<p>After the war, La Cosa Nostra took control of America's heroin
market, this time importing most of its drug supply from Italian
refineries. When the Italian government banned the manufacture of
heroin in the early 1950's, La Cosa Nostra traffickers were
forced to look to other sources. A new system was quickly
devised, by which Turkish morphine base was refined to heroin in
Marseilles, then shipped to Montreal or Sicily. Organized crime
groups located in these transshipment points then sent the heroin
directly to the United States. This arrangement, popularly known
as the &quot;French Connection,&quot; allowed La Cosa Nostra to
monopolize the heroin trade from the 1980's through the early
1970's. During the peak French Connection years, the LCN
controlled an estimated 95 percent of all of the heroin entering
New York City, as well as most of the heroin distributed
throughout the United States. </p>

<p>The La Cosa Nostra heroin monopoly lasted until 1972, when
under diplomatic pressure from the United States, Turkey banned
opium production and the French Connection collapsed. Amsterdam
replaced Marseilles as the center of European heroin traffic, and
Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami joined New York City as major U.S.
distribution centers. Other trafficking groups rose to compete
with the LCN for heroin dollars in New York City and throughout
the country. </p>

<p>Source Country Traffickers: Mexico </p>

<p>In the five years after the collapse of the French Connection,
Mexico became the major source of U.S. heroin. Mexico's rise was
logical: the country contains extensive regions suitable for both
opium cultivation and refining and shares a lightly guarded 2,000
mile border with the United States. Mexicans could manufacture
heroin and smuggle it into the United States with little risk of
detection. This simplified trafficking system resulted in
increased Mexican heroin availability in the United States. </p>

<p>For generations, opium has been grown in remote areas of
Mexico's Sierra Madre Mountain states of Durango, Sinaloa and
Chihuahua. Culiacan, on the western side of the Sierra Madre, and
Durango to the east, developed in the 1970's as major production
centers for heroin destined for U.S. distribution. Trafficking
organizations are now entrenched in these areas, and are involved
in all phases of the heroin manufacture and distribution process.
Opium gum is collected by peasants in isolated mountain areas and
is transported by mule or carried by hand to nearby mountain
villages. Typically, village middlemen sell the opium to a drug
trafficking organization boss, who moves drugs to an
organization-held laboratory for processing to heroin. Mexican
couriers then transport the heroin to the members of the
trafficking organization in the United States. The major Mexican
heroin trafficking organizations supplying heroin to America are
generally extended familial organizations, but loyal workers
sometimes are given status as &quot;quasi-family&quot; members of
the groups. The organizations work to eliminate competition and
to control as completely as possible all aspects of the heroin
trade. Members act as opium cultivators, village middlemen, and
heroin brokers and distributors. In the United States, the
organization typically controls distribution from the wholesaler
to the retail distributor, but has little or no involvement in
street distribution. This is seen as an unnecessarily risky and
low-profit aspect of the business, and is left to outsiders. </p>

<p>Violence is an integral part of Mexican trafficking.
Organization members provide cultivators with semi-automatic and
automatic weapons to protect their crops; weapons are used
throughout the trafficking system to eliminate informants, and to
intimidate competitors and law enforcement officials. Corruption
of Mexican police officials is well-documented and is essential
to the smooth operation of the Mexican trafficking organizations.
</p>

<p>In 1984, Mexican traffickers provided 32 percent share of the
heroin consumed in the United States. The figure is expected to
rise over the next several years due to the continued devaluation
of the peso and improved agricultural technology. </p>

<p>Case Study: The Herrera Family </p>

<p>Since the early 1970's the Jamie Herrera-Navarres organization
has been a major heroin smuggling power operative between Mexico
and the United States. The Herrera organization is a
confederation of families related by blood and marriage, although
some non-family members have been accepted into the group over
time. Older family members process opium and morphine base,
younger members handle the drug sales and shipments in Mexico and
in the United States. The Herrera organization is now estimated
to have 3,000 to 5,000 members, a significant portion of whom are
naturalized American citizens and illegal aliens residing in this
country. </p>

<p>Despite the 1978 conviction and incarceration of Jamie
Herrera, and several key family members, the organization remains
active. In July 1985, 135 persons in the United States,
comprising eight separate Herrera-related distribution rings,
were indicted in Chicago on drug trafficking charges. These
Herrera groups allegedly trafficked heroin and marijuana from
Mexico through El Paso to a middleman in Texas. From Texas, the
drugs were shipped to Chicago, then distributed throughout the
country. This Herrera enterprise, only a small fragment of the
total organization, is estimated to have had gross annual profits
of over $200 million. The arrests are expected to have a
significant effect on the Herrera organization, if only on a
temporary basis. </p>

<p>Source Country Traffickers: Southeast Asia </p>

<p>Mexican heroin production decreased in the late 1970's due to
enforcement, eradication and poor weather conditions. By 1980,
Mexico provided only 25 percent of the heroin consumed in the
United Stated, down from a peak level of 80 percent in 1975. At
the same time, heroin production in Southeast Asia accelerated
dramatically. By 1976, the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; of Burma,
Thailand and Laos supplied more than a third of the heroin
consumed in the United States; Mexico supplied the remainder.
Golden Triangle heroin first gained popularity with American
servicemen stationed in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War
because it was readily available, inexpensive, and considerably
more pure than Mexican heroin. After the war, Golden Triangle
heroin was exported to the United States in increasing amounts. </p>

<p>Nearly 90 percent of the Golden Triangle opium is currently
produced in Burma. Two-thirds of this crop is produced in the
northeast area of the country, where control is shared by the
Burmese Communist Party (BCP) and the Shan United Army (SUA).
Both groups were at one time political insurgent organizations
but are now almost entirely devoted to obtaining profit for the
production, smuggling and sale of heroin base. They derive
considerable income from &quot;taxes&quot; and fees they levy on
opium growers and heroin producers and traffickers. This income
is used to purchase weapons, to be utilized not in furtherance of
political goals, but for protection of each group's narcotics
enterprise. Traditionally, the two groups have coexisted
peacefully: the BCP has acted as the major opium supplier in
Southeast Asia and the SUA has been the area's major refiner and
trafficker. The BCP has recently become involved in refining and
distribution activities, and the organizations are currently in
conflict. </p>

<p>Opium and morphine base produced in northeastern Burma
transported by horse and donkey caravans to refineries along the
Thailand-Burma border for conversion to heroin and heroin base.
Most of the finished products are shipped across the border into
various towns in North Thailand and down to Bangkok for further
distribution to international markets. In the past major ethnic
Chinese traffickers in Bangkok have controlled much of the
foreign sales and movement of Southeast Asian heroin from
Thailand, but a combination of law enforcement pressure,
publicity and a regional drought has significantly reduced their
role. As a consequence, many less-predominant traffickers in
Bangkok and other parts of Thailand now control smaller
quantities of the heroin going to international markets. </p>

<p>Although Thailand is the primary transit center for Southeast
Asian heroin destined for international markets, alternate
trafficking routes are increasingly utilized as a result of
Thailand's sustained enforcement actions. Some opium, morphine
base, and heroin base are moved South through Burma to southern
Thailand and Malaysia for conversion to heroin in laboratories
along the Thailand/Malaysia border. Refined heroin is also
trafficked from Burma to India, then to the West. </p>

<p>Heroin from Southeast Asia is most frequently brought to the
United States by couriers, typically Thai and U.S. nationals and
Hong Kong Chinese, traveling on commercial airlines. California
and Hawaii are the primary U.S. entry points for Golden Triangle
heroin, but small percentages of the drug are trafficked into New
York City and Washington D.C. While Southeast Asian groups have
had success in trafficking heroin to the United States, they
initially had difficulty arranging street level distribution.
However, with the incarceration of Asian traffickers in American
prisons during the 1970's, contacts between Asian and American
prisoners developed. These contacts have allowed Southeast Asian
traffickers access to individuals and organizations distributing
heroin at the retail level. </p>

<p>Chinese organized crime groups, known as Triads, located
primarily in Hong Kong, and their U.S. counterparts, Tongs, are
positioned to participate in Southeast Asian heroin traffic, but
the extent of their activity in these enterprises is not known at
the present time. These organizations provide Asians direct
access to criminal groups in the United States, and could
potentially assume a significant role in U.S. heroin trafficking
activities. Currently, there are major Triad organizations in New
York, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, and Toronto. </p>

<p>Source Country Traffickers: Southwest Asia </p>

<p>Opium production in Southeast Asia was significantly reduced
in the late 1970's and early 1980's due to a prolonged drought.
This decrease, along with the unstable political climate in the
region caused by the fall of the ruling governments in South
Vietnam and Laos, resulted in a reduction of Southeast Asian
heroin exports to the United States. During this period, opium
production in the Golden Crescent area of Southwest Asia,
comprising the common border regions of Pakistan, Afghanistan and
Iran, markedly increased. In 1979 the Golden Crescent became the
primary U.S. heroin source. Southwest Asia continues to be this
country's major supplier: over one-half of the heroin entering
the United States in 1984 originated as opium in the Golden
Crescent. </p>

<p>The surge in Golden Crescent heroin exports to the United
States can be attributed to a number of factors. Opium has always
been grown in the region, but traditionally, opium grown in
Afghanistan and Pakistan was shipped directly to Iran to supply
that country's one million opium addicts. The situation changed
dramatically after the 1980 fundamentalist revolution in Iran, as
political and social instability allowed greatly increased
domestic opium production and curtailed the demand for opium from
Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Iranian market was further closed
to outsiders by the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which
blocked several of the traditional smuggling routes into Iran. </p>

<p>Concurrent with the reduction in Iranian demand for
non-domestic opium, growers in Afghanistan and Pakistan harvested
record crops. The opium crop in Pakistan alone increased by 400
percent between 1974-1979, from 200 to 800 metric tons.
Consequently Pakistani and Afghan traffickers learned to refine
their opium into heroin, and sought new markets for their
product, mainly in Western Europe and the and the United States. </p>

<p>Southwest Asian opium is grown in remote mountain areas and
generally is transported to crude laboratories in the
Pakistan/Afghanistan border areas. Most of the refineries are
located in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province or
Afghanistan's Nangarhai Province; many are clustered in the area
of the Khyber Pass. Refined heroin leaves Pakistan via several
routes: through Baluchistan to Iran and beyond; by sea through
Karachi to Bombay and on to the Arabian Gulf States or Europe;
overland through the Lahore area enroute to transit points in
India; or by air through Islamabad or Karachi. </p>

<p>Southwest Asian heroin is typically smuggled into the United
States concealed in legitimate shipments of air and sea cargo,
such as textiles or sports equipment manufactured by Pakistani
companies, or it is carried by air couriers. Couriers generally
travel on commercial carriers, and many have connections with
airline crews and station managers. The international postal
system is also commonly used to ship heroin from Pakistan
directly to the United States in sealed newspapers and
periodicals. </p>

<p>Golden Crescent heroin is trafficked into the United States by
a variety of narcotics organizations. The following is an
overview of some of the more significant groups involved in the
Southwest Asian heroin trade. </p>

<p>Pakistani Traffickers </p>

<p>Pakistani nationals are responsible for trafficking a
significant percentage of Golden Crescent heroin in the United
States, especially in the Northeast. The Pakistanis do not have a
sophisticated retail sales network in the United States and
typically rely on family or Pakistani friends in this country to
distribute drugs. They also have relied on black trafficking
organizations in Los Angeles, Detroit and New York, and with
Italian organized crime in New York City. One Pakistani
distribution system was described in testimony before this
Commission by a Pakistani national who was incarcerated for his
involvement in a distribution network. The Commission witness has
relatives living both in Lahore, Pakistan, and in the United
States; he was a resident of Houston, Texas and was employed as
an engineer while involved in heroin trafficking. In the heroin
operation, a family member in Lahore sent couriers to JFK airport
in New York with heroin concealed in false-bottom luggage. From
JFK, the couriers traveled &quot;in transit&quot; to La Guardia,
then on to Toronto. Because of their &quot;in transit&quot;
status, Customs Service officials did not search the travelers in
the United States, and Canadian Customs inspection was not
difficult to clear. </p>

<p>In Canada, traffickers often held a particular heroin shipment
for three to six months, until appropriate distribution contacts
were established and it was certain that law enforcement
officials were not aware of the shipment. At that time,
distribution contacts traveled by automobile to Toronto, picked
up a portion or all of the heroin shipment, and drove the heroin
into the United States without Customs interdiction. This
particular network supplied heroin to Seattle, Houston, San
Francisco, New York and Las Vegas. The contacts were all related
by blood or marriage. </p>

<p>Pakistanis also rely on the international postal system to
move drugs from Southwest Asia to the United States. In July
1983, for example, U.S. Customs officials at JFK Airport seized
one kilogram of heroin concealed in rolled newspapers destined
for Pakistani nationals residing in New York. The package had
been sent from the United Arab Emirates. Two other packages, each
containing one-half kilogram of heroin, were mailed to Berkeley,
California from the same source. Rolled newspapers and magazines
can conceal up to one kilogram of heroin and are generally sealed
in plastic. Drugs are also sent through the mail concealed in
shipments of textiles, clothing and other durable goods. </p>

<p>Lebanese Traffickers </p>

<p>A portion of Golden Crescent heroin passes through Lebanon en
route to the United States, thus affording Lebanese nationals an
opportunity to become involved in the trafficking activity. A
significant percentage of the heroin exported from Lebanon leaves
via Damascus International Airport. </p>

<p>In the United States, trafficking by Lebanese nationals is
especially prevalent in the Northeast. In one network,
non-Lebanese couriers primarily from Canada traveled to Damascus
and Beirut to pick up heroin which they then transported to
Houston, Detroit and New York via commercial carrier. Heroin was
concealed in false-bottom luggage and inside photo albums. The
heroin was transferred to Lebanese nationals living in Toronto
and Ontario, Canada, and in various cities in the United States.
Some of the money generated from the sale of this heroin was
laundered in banks in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. </p>

<p>India </p>

<p>A proportion of the heroin traditionally distributed abroad
through the Pakistan cities of Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta is
now being shipped through Bombay and New Dehli. Traffickers
smuggle Southwest Asian heroin into India along the Indo-Pakistan
border and transport it overland to the Indian cities; Southeast
Asian heroin is brought into Bombay and Calcutta by sea and
overland routes. Bombay, Calcutta and New Dehli are now major
staging, shipping and trafficking centers for heroin smuggled to
the West. Trafficking activity is frequent at Perlane Airport in
Dehli and at Bombay's Sahar International Airport, and Indian
harbors and airports are used by Pakistani, Afghan and Indian
traffickers as points of embarkation to Western destinations. </p>

<p>West Africa. </p>

<p>In the past three years, West African countries, especially
Nigeria, have been documented as transshipments centers for
Golden Crescent heroin. Nigerian couriers based in Lagos travel
to Pakistan to obtain heroin, then continue on commercial flights
to their final destinations, or return to Nigeria to repackage
the narcotics into smaller amounts for smuggling to the West. </p>

<p>A number of loosely associated Nigerian heroin trafficking
organizations have connections both with suppliers in Pakistan
and with retailers in Western Europe and the United States.
Typically, Nigerian couriers travel directly to Karachi on
commercial aircraft and purchase heroin in that city, but some
couriers continue to Peshawar to make their purchases. Couriers
return to Nigeria transiting other countries in Africa and
Europe. A different group of couriers, usually students or poor
residents of Lagos, traffic the drugs to Europe or the United
States. </p>

<p>Couriers typically enter the United States directly through
JFK airport in New York although in some cases, they come to this
country via cities in Europe and Canada. Drugs are concealed in
body cavities, and in false-bottom suitcases. </p>

<p>After the heroin arrives in the United States, it is sold only
to one or two American distributors in a given area. Distribution
networks are most active in New York City and Washington, D.C.
and are operative in Los Angeles, Houston and Boston. DEA reports
that individuals in nearly every community of Nigerian nationals
in the United States has some link to heroin traffickers and
couriers. Profits from heroin sales are laundered through banks
in the United States in Britain. </p>

<p>The Post-French Connection LCN </p>

<p>Traditional organized crime continues to play a significant
role in this country's heroin trade through the 1980's. The LCN's
long established connections with criminal organizations in
Sicily facilitate the movement of heroin from Europe to the
United States, and while Sicily is no longer a major refinery for
heroin, the country is a major transshipment center for Southwest
and Southeast Asian heroin. Sicilian organizations supply LCN
affiliates with heroin; LCN networks either distribute the drug
themselves or sell it in large quantities to major distributors. </p>

<p>The LCN As A Supplier: The Nicky Barnes Operation </p>

<p>Black criminal groups have controlled some percentage of
heroin traffic in New York City since the 1940's. Their influence
increased significantly in the early 1970's, after the French
Connection. The first major independent black trafficking
organization, a group of over one hundred distributors and
couriers, was headed by Charles Green. The Green organization
imported heroin and cocaine from South America and distributed
the drugs throughout New York City during the late 1960's. Green
was arrested in 1970, control of this heroin network passed to
Frank Matthews. Matthews was brought in to the heroin business by
Louis Cirillo, a major LCN associate, and was continually
supplied with LCN heroin. </p>

<p>Leroy &quot;Nicky&quot; Barnes succeeded Matthews in 1971.
Under his leadership, the organization controlled heroin sales
and manufacture throughout New York State into Canada and
Pennsylvania. The Barnes operation was well-organized and
lucrative. By 1976, Barnes had at least seven major lieutenants
under his direction; each of them controlled a dozen mid-level
distributors, who in turn supplied up to forty street-level
retailers. Barnes at all times remained well insulated from the
daily trafficking activities, and maintained a wealthy lifestyle.
He owned five homes, a Mercedes, a Maserati, several Lincolns,
Cadillacs and Thunderbirds, and hundreds of suits and coats. He
estimates that his total trafficking income was at least several
million dollars. </p>

<p>Barnes joined with six other major New York dealers to form a
heroin cartel called the &quot;Council&quot; in the mid 1970's.
Members of the Council pooled funds to purchase multi-kilo
amounts of heroin, worked to ensure a consistent supply of the
drug in their distribution area, combined their
&quot;cutting&quot; and distribution networks in certain cases,
and often used a common sources for diluents, weapons,
automobiles and other resources. The Council had specific
&quot;departments&quot; which arranged legal services, security
and enforcement, and financial services including money
laundering. </p>

<p>Barnes' most significant source of heroin, to whom he directed
other Council members, was LCN associate &quot;Natty&quot;
Madonna. Despite Barnes' assertion and belief that the Council
worked completely independently of the Mafia, through the Madonna
connection, LCN heroin was prevalent in Harlem traffic from 1972
to 1976. </p>

<p>The Asian-LCN Links </p>

<p>La Cosa Nostra actively seeks out Asian nationals as
connections to heroin sources in Southeast Asia. In testimony
before the President's Commission on organized crime, Franklin
Liu, a veteran Hong Kong clothier, explained how he was recruited
as a courier for a New York La Cosa Nostra family involved in
heroin trafficking. Liu, who held a legitimate four year business
visa which allowed him to travel without restriction, was first
contacted by Antonio Turano, a reputed member of the Sicilian
Mafia, in connection with Turano's money laundering operations.
In one instance, Turano brought Liu a suitcase filled with
$400,000 cash, and requested that Liu wire the money to a bank in
Zurich. Turano met with Liu in Milan in the course of the
operation to make certain that the money had been wired without
incident. </p>

<p>At a later date, after Liu had successfully participated in a
number of money laundering operations, Turano asked Liu if he had
any connections to drug traffickers in the Far East; Liu did not.
Turano arranged a connection, and agreed to pay Liu $5,000 for
every kilo of heroin he trafficked into the United States. Liu
was subsequently contacted by Turano's agent, a Thai woman, and
arranged to meet her at a hotel in New York City. When they met,
each held half of a one dollar bill given to them by Turano as
identification. Liu gave the woman his car keys; the next day she
returned the car with heroin in the trunk and requested a payment
of $40,000 in cash and a $60,000 bank check. When Liu went to
collect the money from Turano, he found that Turano had been
arrested. Liu was subsequently arrested and convicted on charges
of conspiracy to import heroin in connection with this case. </p>

<p>The Pizza Connection </p>

<p>During the late 1970's and early 1980's members of La Cosa
Nostra in the United States allegedly cooperated with the
Sicilian Mafia in a drug trafficking conspiracy which resulted in
the importation of heroin worth over $1.6 billion into the United
States. In April, 1984, 38 individuals were indicted on charges
related to the trafficking operation, popularly known as the
&quot;Pizza Connection.&quot; The network that developed to
facilitate the traffic in this enterprise was reputedly one of
the largest heroin importation operations in history, and used
pizza parlors throughout this country to distribute heroin
smuggled from Southeast and Southwest Asia via Sicily to the
United States. Additional heroin that was trafficked through this
system was produced in laboratories operating in Sicily. </p>

<p>According to the indictment in the case, the &quot;Pizza
Connection&quot; heroin network relied upon a faction of the New
York Bonanno organized crime family headed by Salvatore Catalano
to distribute the heroin in this country. In turn, the heroin
business of this Bonanno crime faction was tied directly to
organized criminal groups in Sicily, the rest of Italy,
Switzerland, Spain, and Brazil. Direct evidence of the existence
of the network was first obtained in 1980 when couriers were
observed transferring enormous amounts of cash through investment
houses and banks in New York city to Italy and Switzerland. Tens
of millions of dollars derived from heroin sales in this country
were transferred overseas in this fashion, apparently in
violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. </p>

<p>Investigations related to the &quot;Pizza Connection&quot;
case have revealed that factions of the Sicilian Mafia operate in
the United States independently of the American La Cosa Nostra.
While the two groups apparently cooperate on certain ventures
such as the &quot;Pizza Connection&quot; heroin importation
operations, they appear to be distinct and separate organizations
under different leadership. </p>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter III Part 2: Marijuana Trafficking </h2>

<p>Marijuana trafficking presents both unique opportunities and
significant disadvantages for the smugglers who provide the drug
to American consumers. The volume of demand for marijuana
precludes domination of the market by any group of traffickers
and allows a constant influx of small-scale and mid-size
operators as limited suppliers. These smaller groups are in large
part able to enter the market because of marijuana's
comparatively low wholesale cost. While an investment of tens of
thousands of dollars is required for entry into the U.S. heroin
or cocaine traffic, a capital investment of less than $10,000 is
generally sufficient in the marijuana trade. Finally, although
marijuana is supplied to U.S. consumers by growers in Colombia,
Mexico and Jamaica, nearly one-sixth of the U.S. supply is
domestically grown. Because significant amounts of the drug are
cultivated in all 50 States, American traffickers need not travel
to a foreign source country for a marijuana supply. </p>

<p>While the barriers to entry in the U.S. marijuana traffic are
relatively low, marijuana sales generate a small profit in
comparison to other illicit drugs. This is primarily because
marijuana, unlike heroin or cocaine, in not diluted or
&quot;cut&quot; in the intermediate phases of trafficking, but is
sold in much the same form at the wholesale and retail levels.
Marijuana is bulky and difficult to transport in high-profit
quantity: the profit generated from the retail sale of 700 pounds
of commercial Colombian marijuana could most probably be equalled
from the retail sale of one kilogram of diluted cocaine. Finally,
trafficking marijuana implies increased risks of interdiction
because the bulk of the drug makes it most visible to law
enforcement authorities. </p>

<p>Despite the relative ease with which small-scale traffickers
can enter the marijuana market, only large criminal organizations
have the resources and connections necessary to generate large
profits from marijuana trafficking. Many of these groups deal in
other drugs in addition to marijuana, and are organized to
facilitate the movement of any drug to the United States with
minimal interference from law enforcement authorities. Their size
allows group control of all aspects of a trafficking venture from
cultivation through the wholesale transaction, thus eliminating
middlemen, decreasing costs and maximizing profit. Unlike smaller
operations, the major trafficking groups have the capital
required to purchase the large vessels, trucks, or planes
necessary for smuggling high profit multi-ton quantities of
marijuana. A final advantage is their willingness to use violence
and corruption, the tools traditionally associated with organized
crime, to ensure the success of smuggling ventures. </p>

<p>Historical Context </p>

<p>From the 1930's through the mid-1970's, Mexican growers and
traffickers supplied nearly all of the marijuana consumed in the
United States. Most shipments of the drug were smuggled into this
country by car or truck; a small percentage was transported by
air. The Mexican monopoly ended in 1975, when in a joint venture,
U.S. and Mexican authorities increased marijuana interdiction and
eradication efforts in major Mexican cultivation regions and
along the U.S. borders. Paraquat, a potent herbicide toxic to
humans, was used widely in the eradication program, and
contaminated much of the Mexican crop. Despite the interdiction
efforts, a portion of the tainted marijuana was successfully
smuggled into the United States, and many Americans who smoked
the drug subsequently suffered adverse health consequences.
Eradication and interdiction of the Mexican crop, compounded by
the American marijuana smokers' reluctance to purchase a
potentially paraquat-tainted drug, resulted in a simultaneous
decrease in the availability of and the demand for Mexican
marijuana. By 1979 Mexico supplied only an estimated 11 percent
of the marijuana available in the United States and by 1981 that
figure dropped to 4 percent. </p>

<p>Concurrent with the commitment of more manpower and resources
to marijuana eradication and interdiction efforts in Mexico,
authorities in Jamaica, which was the source of the 10 percent of
the American supply not originating in Mexico, mounted a similar
campaign. The Jamaican initiatives significantly reduced
marijuana production and trafficking in that country, and
virtually eliminated Jamaica from the American marijuana trade
for a number of years. </p>

<p>During the mid-1970's America's two marijuana supply sources,
traffickers in Mexico and Jamaica, had only small amounts of the
drug available for export. The resulting vacuum was swiftly
filled by Colombian criminal groups, who for years had been
involved in smuggling all manner of contraband. Through the late
1960's these groups increased cultivation of marijuana in remote
regions of the Guajira Peninsula and began to develop systems to
facilitate the transport of multi-ton quantities of the drug to
the United States. At the same time, many Colombian groups were
establishing themselves as major operators in the cocaine trade:
the organizational structures, trafficking routes and corrupted
officials necessary for cocaine ventures often proved equally
useful for marijuana trafficking. </p>

<p>Once the Colombians established a position as marijuana
traffickers, their role in the traffic expanded rapidly. By 1975
airstrips capable of handling heavy 4-engine planes with the
capacity to hold one ton of marijuana were common along the
Guajira Peninsula. Loading facilities for
&quot;motherships,&quot; large vessels capable of transporting
tons of marijuana, dotted the coast. By the early 1980's a
Congressional committee estimated that between 15 and 60 thousand
tons of marijuana were exported from that country to the United
States each year. </p>

<p>In 1985 Colombia remains the major supplier of U.S. marijuana,
but the Colombian share of the market has declined significantly
since 1980. This decrease is attributed to increased eradication
in Colombia and to accelerated interdiction along major
trafficking routes. Colombia's reduced production has been offset
by increased cultivation and trafficking both in Mexico and
Jamaica. Mexico, now ranked second in world marijuana production,
could become the leading producer in 1986, given a Mexican bumper
harvest and continuing eradication in Colombia. </p>

<p>This short history of marijuana trafficking demonstrates that
law enforcement pressure in a particular cultivation area is
compensated by production and trafficking increases elsewhere.
Trafficking organizations are positioned in all major source
countries to handle increased volume when opportunities present. </p>

<p>Trafficking Today: Colombia </p>

<p>Colombia supplied 42 percent of the marijuana consumed in the
United States in 1984. The major percentage of this traffic was
controlled by large Colombian criminal organizations. </p>

<p>Although the Colombian marijuana crop is cultivated in several
regions of the country, the largest production occurs along the
Guijara Peninsula. Colombian traffickers purchase marijuana from
growers, and sometimes provide protection and additional
financing for cultivation. Crops are harvested twice each year,
with the largest harvest occurring in the fall. The harvest
pattern directly affects the level of marijuana trafficking
activity between Colombia and the United States; trafficking is
naturally heaviest after the fall harvest. </p>

<p>Nearly 90 percent of the marijuana exported from Colombia is
shipped to the United States by sea; almost all the remainder is
transported on general aviation aircraft. Both maritime and air
traffic are primarily concentrated along Colombia's north coast,
although some percentage of the traffic is centered along the
country's Pacific coast. </p>

<p>The major portion of Colombian marijuana is shipped to the
United States on large motherships. These ships are typically
fishing vessels or freighters and can hold tons of marijuana; a
100-foot mothership can transport SO tons and a 400 foot
mothership can ship over 100 tons of the drug. These ships,
generally owned or at least controlled by Colombian trafficking
organizations, remain at sea or in selected Colombian ports until
a shipment is prepared for export and transported to a beach site
along the Colombian coast. There are more than 100 such sites
along the north coast from Barranquilla to Portete, all which are
linked by a network of roads, trails and airstrips to the major
growing areas. When preparations are complete on shore, the
mothership moves into a prearranged loading point typically
one-half to 3 miles offshore. Small boats then ferry bales of
marijuana from shore to the mothership; loading of many tons may
be accomplished within an hour. Motherships are nearly always
loaded at night to decrease risks of detection. </p>

<p>The loaded motherships generally either sail from the Guajira
coast directly to the southeastern United States or to Caribbean
transshipment points, where cargo is off-loaded for future
pickup. Traffickers use the same maritime routes popular with
cocaine traffickers; the Windward Passage between Cuba and Haiti,
the Yucatan Channel between Mexico and Cuba, and the Mona
Passage, bordered by the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, are
most frequently traveled. From these routes American ports along
the Gulf of Mexico and the east coast are accessible to
smugglers. In addition, a small percentage of Colombian ships now
sail directly to the U.S. west coast. </p>

<p>Those motherships that approach the U.S. coast typically hover
50-100 miles offshore in international waters. There, they are
met by small ships, typically purchased or rented shrimp boats,
which off-load and ferry the drug shipment to shore. While
traffickers traditionally made no attempt to conceal bales of
marijuana, either on motherships or on off-loading vessels,
increased law enforcement surveillance has recently prompted
smugglers to hide their drugs in secret compartments or in empty
or false fuel tanks. </p>

<p>The Colombian trafficking organization normally oversees the
cultivation and export of marijuana only through the off-loading
procedure. Off-loading is accomplished by &quot;service
providers&quot; who never actually own the marijuana, but who
merely collect a fee for its safe transfer. Once on the U.S.
shore, the drug shipment is delivered to a distributor, who in
turn supplies lower level dealers. The traffic below the
wholesale distributor level is vast and not well-understood. </p>

<p>Motherships that do not travel to the United States generally
transit the Bahamas and/or the Caribbean. In both regions
marijuana traffickers can either transfer shipments from
motherships to smaller crafts, which sail to the United States,
or they can unload and store shipments at island storage bases.
Use of island transshipment points has increased as law
enforcement efforts have intensified along the southeastern U.S.
coast. Rampant official corruption in a number of island nations
facilitates this traffic. </p>

<p>An estimated 3 percent of the marijuana shipped from Colombia
to the United States by sea is transported on commercial vessels.
Typically, marijuana is concealed in containerized cargo, but in
some instances crewmen or cruise ship passengers have been
directly implicated in trafficking the drug. In terms of
quantity, cargo shipment provides great opportunities for
traffickers and presents a decreased risk of interdiction. </p>

<p>Air Shipment </p>

<p>An estimated 10 percent of the marijuana smuggled from
Colombia to the United States reaches this country via general
aviation aircraft or commercial air shipment. Non-commercial air
shipment of marijuana parallels the Colombian air trafficking
patterns common in cocaine smuggling. Many of the same air routes
and transshipment points are used; the same airstrips are
accessible along the north coast of the country, and the same
methods used to avoid law enforcement interference are
applicable. Smugglers use both smaller twin engine aircraft and
larger four-engine planes for marijuana transport. When air
transport allows faster shipment, it limits export quantities and
increases the likelihood of interdiction. </p>

<p>A small portion of the marijuana exported from Colombia is
shipped by aircraft, then air-dropped over sea or land for pickup
and further shipment to the United States. Most airdrop activity
occurs in the Bahamas, but an increasing number of drops have
been intercepted in the Yucatan Peninsula, Jamaica, Haiti, the
Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Medium-size to large twin
engine aircraft are typically used for air-drop operations. </p>

<p>In addition to trafficking marijuana to the United States or
transshipment points, Colombian organizations sell marijuana
directly to non-Colombian traffickers, who assume responsibility
for the shipment in Colombia. The buyers then traffic the drug
into the United States using maritime and air shipment systems
similar to the Colombian methods. </p>

<p>Mexico </p>

<p>Mexican marijuana production nearly doubled from 1983 to 1984,
positioning Mexico as the second leading supplier of the drug to
the United States. An estimated 20 percent of the marijuana
available for consumption in the United States originates in or
transits Mexico, and that figure is expected to increase with a
bumper harvest in 1985. PEA analysts predict that this increased
production, with concomitant eradication and interdiction
successes in Colombia, could make Mexico the top American
marijuana source in 1985. </p>

<p>Although marijuana is grown in nearly every state in Mexico,
heaviest cultivation occurs in the northern and western states of
Sonora, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Oaxaca and Cuerra. As in Colombia,
crops are harvested twice each year, with the largest harvest in
the fall. Cultivation occurs both in small open fields and in
well-maintained, hundred-acre sites. Growers are typically
overseen and financed by larger trafficking organizations. </p>

<p>Harvested marijuana is prepared for shipment near the
cultivation fields. Mexican marijuana is transported to the
United States by primarily overland methods, although aircraft
are also used to smuggle drugs across the border. Overland
shipments are typically concealed in automobile trucks, false
truck beds, camper tops and tanker trunks. The larger trucks
commonly haul multi-ton quantities: U.S. officials at El Paso,
Texas, seized nearly 6.5 tons of marijuana from a tanker truck in
February 1984, and nearly 30 tons from a cargo truck in March of
that year. In addition, suitcases of marijuana are often
forwarded on commercial bus lines to destinations beyond border
checkpoints for subsequent pick-up. </p>

<p>Air shipments generally run between private Mexican airstrips
and clandestine runways or drop spots in the southwestern United
States. Single engine aircraft are popular with Mexican smugglers
because they can land on open fields, roadways and rough landing
strips common on both sides of the border, and typically carry
about 1,500 pounds of marijuana. While few details are available
concerning marijuana air shipment, the great assortment of
airstrips on both sides of the border suggests a significant
volume of air traffic. A 1977 survey, for example, detected
nearly 3,000 airstrips in Mexico; one-half of them were
concentrated in ten major clusters. About 600 strips lie along
the United States border and are ideally positioned to serve
either as launching sites for flights into the United States or
as refueling stops for flights en route to this country from
southern Mexico. Strips in the other clusters most likely serve
as refueling and transshipment points for aircraft traveling
between South America and the United States. A large number of
airstrips in the southeastern United States serve as landing
sites for the Mexican flights. </p>

<p>Larger Mexican criminal organizations appear to control a
significant portion of the marijuana traffic between Mexico and
the United States. Many groups are active in both cocaine and
heroin smuggling as well as marijuana trafficking. The central
organizations are generally controlled by members of one extended
family, but often include non-family members in lower positions.
Like other trafficking groups, the Mexicans rely consistently on
an essential criminal support of attorneys, bankers and other
professionals, both in Mexico and in the United States. </p>

<p>Prominent among the larger Mexican organizations are the
groups headed by Jamie Herrera Navarres, Rafael Caro Quintero,
Ernesto Fonesca and Miguel Felix Gallardo. These groups
collaborate in smuggling ventures, much as the major Colombian
cocaine trafficking organizations work in concert to maximize
resources and profits. In one recent instance, for example, a
consortium of traffickers led by Caro Quintero cultivated
hundreds of hectares of marijuana at five separate large-scale
sites throughout the state of Chihuahua. All fields were
landscaped, fertilized and well-irrigated, demonstrating the
Mexican traffickers' knowledge of high-tech agricultural
techniques. The cultivation sites, along with eight associated
processing camps, were seized by Mexican authorities in November
1984. The seizures netted 10,000 metric tons of whole marijuana,
or an estimated 1,900 to 2,400 tons of net marketable marijuana.
In this single operation, officials confiscated 8 times more
marijuana than Mexican and American authorities at the time
believed was produced annually throughout Mexico. The seizure
raised serious questions both about the magnitude of drug traffic
between Mexico and the United States and about continuing
official corruption throughout Mexico. It seems highly unlikely
that an operation the size of the Chihuahua system could develop
or function without earlier detection by authorities. </p>

<p>Jamaica </p>

<p>Jamaica, from 1980 to 1984 this country's second leading
marijuana supplier, provided 14 percent of the United States
market share in 1984, trailing Colombia's 42 percent and Mexico's
20 percent contributions. Jamaican traffickers, much less highly
organized than their counterparts in Colombia and Mexico,
supplied about 1800 metric tons of marijuana, as well as smaller
amounts of sinsemilla and hashish oil to United States consumers
in 1984. </p>

<p>The greatest portion of Jamaican marijuana is transported to
the United States by general aviation aircraft, although some
maritime shipment also occurs. Over 70 island airstrips, one-half
of which are clandestine, facilitate the air traffic, which
commonly includes shipment by single engine and light to heavy
twin engine aircraft. Jamaican marijuana shipments are typically
either flown directly to United States landing sites or are
air-dropped to small pleasure craft in waters near the Bahamas. </p>

<p>Multi-ton marijuana shipments are occasionally transported to
the United States on small motherships, pleasure craft and cruise
ships. A small percentage of Jamaican marijuana exported to the
United States is concealed in containerized cargo on commercial
maritime vessels. </p>

<p>The United States Crop </p>

<p>The United States is currently a significant marijuana source
country: about 12 percent of the marijuana consumed in the United
States in 1984 was domestically cultivated. The largest crops are
grown in Hawaii, California, and Oklahoma, but there is now some
production in every State. Growers can be landowners, but are
typically squatters who operate independently or in small groups.
They cultivate their crops in Federal fields, forested land,
private clandestine plots or greenhouses, scattering plants next
to trees or amid legitimate crops to avoid detection. Planting on
Federal land offers growers the advantage of anonymity and
shields them from recently enacted laws which authorize seizure
of their property or other assets. Many plots, including those on
Federal parkland are wired with devices, such as punji sticks,
fish hooks hung at eye level, and trip wires attached to guns and
boulders, designed to ensure the security of the crop. Growers
are often armed and violent. </p>

<p>There is presently no evidence of a highly developed
distribution system for the domestic marijuana crop in the United
States. It appears that numerous smaller organizations traffic
the drug between states and that some individual growers supply
larger criminal organizations in major cities nationwide. These
organizations, which include both La Cosa Nostra groups and
trafficking specific groups, distribute domestic and imported
marijuana to brokers, retailers, and street-level dealers. The
extent of their control of the U.S. market is uncertain but
estimated to be significant. </p>

<p>The Role of the LCN </p>

<p>In 1967 Federal officials reported that the LCN was not
significantly involved In trafficking marijuana. Low profit was
thought to be the primary disincentive to La Cosa Nostra
involvement; in addition, the large and loosely structured market
was thought to be unattractive and uncontrollable. In the late
1960's the United States marijuana supply was exported almost
exclusively from Mexico. Entry into the trafficking business
required little capital and a simple border crossing, and thus
attracted many small and independent operators. When Colombia
became the major United States marijuana supplier in the early
1970's, however, the LCN was provided with a more controllable
source. Concurrent with this production shift, the United States
demand for marijuana and the retail price level for the drug
steadily escalated, prompting some LCN families to become
involved in trafficking marijuana. For a short period, this
activity proved to be a high profit/low risk enterprise for
traditional organized crime. Additionally, trafficking marijuana
carried little of the social stigma associated with trafficking
heroin or cocaine. </p>

<p>As the following case study demonstrates, marijuana
trafficking has increased the vulnerability of some organized
crime families and has led to a number of significant LCN
arrests. </p>

<p>Case Study: The Cleveland Connection </p>

<p>In the mid-1970's, Carmen Zagaria, a Cleveland drug dealer,
began to buy wholesale marijuana by the pound and sell it at
retail in one ounce bags. He rapidly expanded his business in the
course of a few years and developed a network of suppliers,
couriers and distributors. Although the business prospered
generally, Zagaria lost a substantial investment in one foiled
drug transaction in 1979 and borrowed money from Angelo Lonardo,
the reputed underboss of the Cleveland LCN Licavoli family. In
return for the loan, the Licavoli family assumed control of the
Zagaria operation. </p>

<p>Under Lonardo's oversight, the Zagaria enterprise expanded
rapidly. By 1980 the organization was buying 400-800 pounds of
marijuana per week and had incorporated over 20 couriers. PCP,
LSD, cocaine and hashish were added to the traffic. </p>

<p>The methods used by Zagaria were simple. His couriers flew to
the southeastern United States, usually to Florida via commercial
airline, and established contact there with a Zagaria supplier.
Suppliers included both LCN affiliates and non-LCN dealers.
Couriers picked up large marijuana shipments, paid for them in
cash, and drove the drugs back to Cleveland in rental cars. In
Cleveland the shipments were stored in stash houses, then
distributed to a network of wholesalers and retailers. The
Zagaria enterprise was a high-volume multimillion dollar
operation; in a single 10-day period in 1980 the group brought
3,000 pounds of marijuana to Cleveland from Atlanta. </p>

<p>In the course of his trafficking business Zagaria was involved
in numerous crimes, including murder. In 1982 he was convicted of
selling seven pounds of marijuana and 21 grams of cocaine and was
sentenced to 10-30 years in prison. Zagaria became a Federal
informant and though never a member of the Licavoli family
himself, provided sufficient testimony about family activities to
bring the leadership before a grand jury. In 1983 Angelo Lonardo
and five other Licavoli associates were convicted and
incarcerated without possibility of parole for numerous crimes,
including conspiracy to distribute marijuana. </p>

<p>Other Drugs </p>

<p>Millions of Americans abuse a number of licit and illicit
drugs other than heroin, cocaine and marijuana; these include
stimulants, synthetic narcotics, hallucinogens, and depressants.
Most popular among these dangerous drugs are diazepam (Valium),
methamphetamine and PCP. In addition, controlled substance
analogs known commonly as &quot;designer drugs,&quot; have gained
popularity with users since 1980. </p>

<p>Dangerous drugs are available to the consumer from three major
sources. Many of the drugs are approved for medical use in the
United States, and reach the illicit market through a variety of
diversion methods. A significant portion of the United States
supply of certain drugs, notably amphetamines and diazepam, is
diverted from licit channels in foreign countries and smuggled
into the United States. Finally, it is estimated that all the PCP
and chemical analogs, nearly all the methamphetamine and about 80
percent of the injectable amphetamine available on the illicit
market in 1984 were produced in clandestine United States
laboratories. </p>

<p>Only certain areas of the traffic in dangerous drugs clearly
reflect organized crime involvement. Most notably, the traffic
appears to be dominated nationwide by outlaw motorcycle gangs.
According to the Commission's survey of local law enforcement
officials, these gangs control nearly 40 percent of the
&quot;dangerous drug&quot; traffic in the United States. While
these gangs have traditionally been active in trafficking a wide
variety of illicit drugs, they have developed the technology to
manufacture methamphetamine and PCP, and have been a major force
in the wholesale and resale distribution of these two drugs
nationwide. </p>

<p>The major outlaw motorcycle gangs traffic dangerous drugs
within separate territorial boundaries: the Hell's Angels control
the West Coast trade, the Outlaws dominate the Midwest and parts
of the east coast, the Bandidos control the Southwest, and
Eastern Seaboard States are dominated by the Pagans. Officials
are uncertain of the total membership of the four groups, but
estimate that nearly all the U.S. traffic in PCP, and up to
three-fourths of the illicit methamphetamine traffic falls under
their control. </p>

<p>The Hell's Angels, the oldest of the four groups, first became
involved in drug distribution in the late 1960's. Initially, the
group trafficked marijuana, heroin, cocaine, seconal, PCP,
amphetamines and methamphetamines. In the early 1970's the
organization recruited a chemist to manufacture methamphetamine
and to instruct other organization members in the procedure.
Hell's Angels' activity shifted as their production of
methamphetamine increased and within a short period of time, the
organization dominated west coast methamphetamine manufacture and
distribution. </p>

<p>In the eastern United States, the Pagan's gang leadership also
recruited chemists and gained control of the methamphetamine and
PCP markets from Florida to New England. Pagan drug activity is
centered in the Philadelphia/ South New Jersey area; several
Pagan-controlled processing centers and small laboratories are
located in the region. It is known by law enforcement officials
that Pagan gang members have frequently cooperated in joint
ventures with the Philadelphia Bruno organized crime family,
especially in methamphetamine and PCP manufacture and
distribution. Officials believe that the Bruno leadership
regularly finances a portion of Pagan drug activities in return
for a percentage of the drug profits and enforcement and
protection services. In addition, it appears that the Pagans and
the Bruno family have arranged to divide control of the
methamphetamine and PCP markets in certain territories and that
the two groups coexist and cooperate in these regions. </p>

<p>Case Study: The Pagan/Bruno Relationship. </p>

<p>Between 1977 and 1981 both the Pagan motorcycle gang and the
Bruno organized crime family were active and competitive
distributors of methamphetamine throughout the mid-Atlantic
states. Both groups obtained P2P, an essential chemical in
methamphetamine production, from Ronald Raiton, the major
supplier of the chemical in the eastern United States. Raiton
supplied P2P directly to Ronald Kownacki, a businessman closely
aligned with the Pagan leadership, and to Ronald Martorano, a
Bruno family associate. Though Kownacki and Martorano both
operated in the Philadelphia area, their laboratories and
clientele were distinct. </p>

<p>Kownacki paid the Bruno family a $10,000 fee for every gallon
of P2P he purchased from Raiton. He sold the methamphetamine he
produced to Pagan Walter &quot;Buckets&quot; Jozwiak, who cut the
drug and distributed it to Pagan mother club members in New
Jersey, Delaware and Philadelphia. Martorano distributed his
methamphetamine through Bruno family channels. </p>

<p>In 1980 Kownacki was assaulted and robbed by two Bruno
associates, who claimed they were collecting a debt owed to the
Bruno family. They stole a significant amount of gold from
Kownacki, which he maintained belonged to the Pagans. In February
1981 a number of Pagans confronted members of the Bruno family
and demanded that the gold be returned. The Bruno associates
refused, but agreed to meet with the Pagans to negotiated
possible joint ventures in trafficking methamphetamine and PCP.
Finally in 1982 the Pagans and the Bruno family agreed that each
group would control methamphetamine and PCP markets in separate
territories and that competition between them in these areas
would cease. In 1983 after the agreement, the estimated street
value of the Pagan PCP and methamphetamine operations was $15.5
million. </p>

<p>Organized crime involvement in trafficking dangerous drugs
other than methamphetamine and PCP in the United States is not
well-documented. La Cosa Nostra appears to be active in
trafficking methaqualone from Colombia through Florida to major
United States cities, but the scope of their interest in this
market is not known. Mexican traffickers have smuggled
significant quantities of diazepam, methaqualone and amphetamine
into this country for at least ten years. A major portion of the
illicit methaqualone traditionally available in this country was
trafficked to the United States by Colombian organized crime
groups; however, international controls adopted by virtually all
major producing and exporting countries have led to worldwide
shortage of the drug. </p>

<p>The DEA currently reports that organized crime is not now
involved in the production or distribution of controlled
substance analogs, &quot;designer drugs.&quot; Given the enormous
profit potential of these substances, however, and the relatively
simple manufacturing processes required in their production, the
formulation and distribution of controlled substance analogs
would seem to be an endeavor perfectly suited to organized crime.
</p>

<p>Drug Trafficking, Terrorism, and Insurgency </p>

<p>Drug trafficking organizations in many areas of the world
coexist and cooperate with political insurgent groups and
terrorists. Their typical relationship is mutually beneficial:
traffickers supply terrorists with American currency and weapons
in return for protection and assistance in smuggling activities.
While terrorists and insurgents do not currently control
significant portions of the drug trade, the profit potentially
realized from even isolated drug transactions could provide
sizable revenues for a militant cause. Terrorists and insurgents
funded through drug trafficking could very conceivably become
powerful enough to disrupt governments in a number of countries
presently allied with the United States, and thus pose a serious
threat to this country's national security. </p>

<p>The role of terrorists and insurgents in drug trafficking has
expanded greatly since the early 1970's as drug trafficking has
spread across the world. At that time, heroin traffic was
controlled by North American organized crime groups working with
Sicilian suppliers in the French Connection, marijuana was
supplied to the United States almost exclusively by Mexican
trafficking organizations, and cocaine traffic in this country
was insignificant. Heroin now reaches North America from Europe,
the Middle East, Mexico and Southeast Asia. Marijuana is
trafficked to the United States by Colombian and Caribbean based
groups as well as by Mexicans, and cocaine from nearly every
country in South America satisfies a still-increasing demand for
the drug throughout this country. </p>

<p>At the same time, the expanded United States market for
illicit drugs has swelled the profit from trafficking to enormous
proportions, and attracted terrorist and insurgent groups to this
activity. In addition, this source of funding serves the
ideological purposes of many groups. As explained by terrorism
expert Michael Ledeen: </p>

<p>Running drugs is one sure way to make big money in a hurry.
Moreover, the directions of the flow are ideologically
attractive. Drugs go to the bourgeois countries, where they
corrupt and where they kill, while the arms go to pro-Communist
terrorist groups in the Third World. </p>

<p>The links between terrorist and insurgent groups and
traffickers are most substantial in drug source countries,
including Colombia, Peru, Burma and Thailand. In Colombia, four
major insurgent organizations work in collaboration with cocaine
traffickers. The oldest, largest, and best-equipped of these
groups is the Revolutionary Armed Force of Colombia (FARC), which
is the armed wing of the Colombian Communist Party (PCC) and
claims over 5,000 active members and supporters. The FARC forces
consist of between 23 and 28 &quot;fronts,&quot; essentially
independent company-level forces, nearly all of which are located
in Colombia's rural areas. Over one-half of the fronts operate in
coca and marijuana growing regions. FARC forces cultivate some
coca, but derive more profit by collecting protection payments
from coca growers in their operating territory, often demanding a
10 percent share of the drug profits. One FARC front reportedly
obtained over $3.8 million per month by assessing this protection
tax. Collected monies are used to buy weapons and supplies which
are often shipped into Colombia on return drug flights. Two FARC
fronts have had documented direct dealings with cocaine
traffickers to obtain arms and ammunition. </p>

<p>In exchange for the levied fee, the FARC forces protect
growing and trafficking areas, including air fields, and warn
traffickers of nearby anti-narcotics police or military patrols.
In certain areas of Colombia FARC fronts control enough strategic
points to make police travel difficult or impossible. </p>

<p>FARC encampments have recently been discovered in close
proximity to several major cocaine processing centers. For
example, on April 6, 1984, during a raid of a fully operational
processing center in Southeast Colombia known as &quot;La
Loma,&quot; officials discovered and subsequently destroyed a
FARC guerrilla base camp. The FARC camp, complete with airstrips
and large stockpiles of food and medical supplies, that group's
direct involvement in providing protection for the cocaine
traffickers. A month prior to the La Loma raid, when authorities
raided another processing center nearby known as Tranquilandia,
they were met by approximately 30 armed resistors in fatigue
uniforms believed to be FARC members. </p>

<p>A number of other militant organizations in Colombia have also
been associated with the drug trade. The leftist 19th of April
movement (M-19) has been most notable for its October 1985
takeover of the Colombian Palace of Justice in which 11 of that
country's Supreme Court Justices were murdered. Although M-19 was
once hostile to traffickers, and on several occasions kidnapped
relatives of prominent drug smugglers, some officials maintain
that the October incident was related to drug trafficking. It is
alleged that the attack was motivated by the M-19's desire to
destroy records that might lead to the extradition a number of
major Colombian cocaine traffickers, and to intimidate
authorities in Colombia to force them to rescind the extradition
treaty in effect between that country and the United States. M-19
also at least once traded drugs for arms from Cuba through
Colombian trafficker Jaime Guillot-Lara. In the early 1970's to
1982 Guillot supplied M-19 with weapons in return for their
assistance in his drug smuggling activities through high-ranking
Cuban officials. The Cubans provided a safe haven for Guillot's
drug smuggling vessels en route to the United States from
Colombia in return for payments. M-19 received periodic weapons
shipments for facilitating the arrangement on Guillot Lara's
return trips to Colombia from the United States. </p>

<p>In Peru, where an estimated 40 percent of the world coca crop
is grown, insurgents and traffickers share much the same
relationship evidenced by the Colombians. Insurgents and growers
work in the same remote areas, primarily in the upper Huallaga
Valley, but operate separately. Smugglers supply arms and money
are supplied in return for militant protection. The two groups do
not maintain a structured relationship or pursue common goals;
their collaboration is one of convenience. </p>

<p>The most prominent insurgent group currently operating in Peru
is the Maoist Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso), which seeks a
rural-based revolution to rid the predominantly peasant
population of the &quot;imperialistic&quot; influences of the
United States and other foreign governments. While existing
evidence is insufficient to link the Shining Path to the drug
trade, the group has incited peasants, many of whom make their
living from coca cultivation, to rebel against anti-coca projects
in major growing areas. During 1984 several anti-coca projects,
including a United States-supported crop substitution program,
were attacked by armed mobs, resulting in many injuries and
deaths. </p>

<p>In Southeast Asia a number of political insurgent groups rely
principally on heroin smuggling to finance their activities. They
control or influence the main areas of opium production in
northeastern Burma, where the Burmese government does not exert
authority. The insurgents range from ideological revolutionaries
like the Burmese Communist Party (BCP), to ethnic separatists,
such as the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), and opium
warlords, like the Shan United Army (SUA). All of these groups,
whatever their professed objectives, are heavily involved in the
production, transport or sale of heroin. </p>

<p>In Burma, where 90 percent of the southeast Asian opium crop
is grown, the BCP controls an estimated two-thirds of the major
opium production areas and levies a protection tax on
cultivators. While the BCP has traditionally controlled opium
cultivation and the SUA has exclusively dominated associated
refining and trafficking activities, the BCP has recently begun
to engage in processing and sales, and the groups have come into
conflict. The BCP remains an active political insurgency while
the SUA now concentrates its resources almost entirely on the
drug trade. </p>

<p>In Thailand the link between insurgency and drug trafficking
is much weaker. Although Burmese groups operated with relative
impunity on both sides of the Burma/Thailand border in the early
1980's, government initiatives in Thailand have severely
disrupted their activities. The only indigenous Thai insurgent
group of any consequence, the Communist Party of Thailand (CPT),
is reportedly ready to engage in drug trafficking, but has been
kept under control by Thai security forces. </p>

<p>In the Middle East, nearly all the militant groups engage in
struggle in Lebanon - Palestinians, Phalangists, Druze and
Shiites - reportedly are financed in some part by the drug trade.
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley is the site of significant hashish
production; heroin laboratories are also believed to exist in the
area. Terrorists throughout that area can and do enter the drug
trade, either directly or by protecting drugs transshipped
through regions they control. </p>

<p>Armenian terrorists are also active in Lebanon, especially in
Beirut, where Armenian nationals are heavily involved in drug
trafficking. In 1980 Noubar Sofoyan, an Armenian heroin and
hashish trafficker connected with the right-wing Justice
Commandos of the Armenian Genocide, was indicted in the U.S. for
heroin smuggling. Sofoyan allegedly helped fund the 1976 bombing
of a Turkish installation in Zurich. He was arrested in Greece on
drug charges in 1981 and was subsequently extradited to Lebanon
and released; he remains a fugitive today. </p>

<p>Traffickers as Terrorists </p>

<p>While drug traffickers are not by definition terrorists or
insurgents, they rely heavily on terrorist tactics to obtain
limited political objectives. The use of threats, violence,
assassination and kidnapping by trafficking organizations to
prevent vigorous enforcement of drug laws can only be categorized
as terroristic in nature. </p>

<p>The use of terrorist tactics is most evident among traffickers
in Colombia, Peru and Mexico. In Colombia much of the violence
centers on the issue of the extradition of reputed Colombian drug
traffickers to the United States for trial. The extradition issue
has become prominent in the past two years under Colombian
President Belisario Betancur, and has prompted unprecedented
levels of terrorism by traffickers. Two key members of the
Colombian government, Minister of Justice Rodrigo Lara-Bonilla
and Justice Ministry Assistant Eduardo Gonzalez, both outspoken
supporters of the implementation of the United States/Colombia
extradition treaty, were murdered reportedly by traffickers in
1984. The Colombian judiciary, the body responsible both for the
investigation of drug cases and the disposition of extradition
requests, has been targeted by traffickers. Twenty-four judges,
among them the judge investigating the Lara assassination, have
been murdered in the past two years. Americans have also been
singled out: Colombian traffickers have reportedly offered a
$350,000 bounty for the murder of any top DEA official in the
United States or in Colombia, and have threatened to kill five
Americans for every reputed Colombian drug trafficker extradited
to the United States. </p>

<p>In Peru drug-related violence has been increasing since 1983,
and has specifically targeted anti-drug efforts in the Upper
Huallaga Valley. A series of violent attacks by traffickers on
police units and eradication workers in that area led to the
November 1984 torture and murder of 19 members of a United
States-financed coca-eradication team, and subsequently to the
brutal murder of 17 United States financed eradicators by about
50 traffickers armed with submachine guns less than one year
later. Dozens of people in Peru, including policemen, mayors and
farmers have been reported killed in the past year in attacks
attributed to cocaine traffickers. </p>

<p>In Mexico trafficking violence culminated in the February
kidnapping, torture and murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camerena and
a Mexican pilot. Camerena's abduction occurred shortly after
Mexican police, alerted by DEA, raided the largest marijuana
plantation ever discovered in that country and seized an
estimated 8,500 tons of marijuana. In the course of the search
for Camerena, five persons, including a police officer, were
killed. Mexican trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero is being held by
Mexican authorities in connection with the Camerena murder. The
trafficking-related violence in Mexico escalated further in
November 1985, when 17 police officers and other members of an
anti-drug team working in southern Mexico were lured into an
ambush, tortured, and killed by a large group of drug traffickers
armed with automatic weapons. </p>

<p>Government Complicity </p>

<p>A number of hostile foreign governments, motivated either by a
need for hard American currency, or by a more ideological desire
to undermine governments in Europe and the United States,
actively facilitate drug trafficking activities. Cuban and
Nicaragua blatantly aid traffickers smuggling drugs from Colombia
to the United States; the Bulgarian government assists
traffickers transporting drug shipments from Southwest Asia to
Western Europe. All three countries are geographically
well-positioned to serve as transshipment points for drugs en
route to Europe or the United States, and all allow trafficking
routes to cross through their sovereign territory, thus providing
a way for traffickers to circumvent drug-interdiction
authorities. </p>

<p>Cuba </p>

<p>Reports of Cuban government involvement in drug trafficking
first surfaced in the early 1960's, but were in large measure
unsubstantiated. A series of reports in the 1970's subsequently
suggested Cuban Government involvement, but did not provide solid
evidence of such activity. In the early 1980's, however, the link
between the Cuban government and Colombian drug traffickers was
documented. In November 1982, the United States District Court
indicted four major Cuban officials on charges of conspiracy to
smuggle drugs; those indicted included the former Cuban
Ambassador to Colombia, two officials of the Cuban Communist
Party, and the Vice Admiral of the Cuban Navy. All four officials
were involved in facilitating the trafficking activities of
Colombian Jaime Guillot-Lara, reputedly a major marijuana,
cocaine and methaqualone trafficker. The Cuban officials,
according to the indictment, agreed to allow Cuba to be used as a
supply and loading center for Lara's ships transporting drugs to
the United States, and permitted him to navigate drug vessels
through Cuban waters to evade United States interdiction
authorities. The Cuban Government reportedly expected large
payments for their role in this traffic; on one occasion, the
government was to receive approximately $800,000 from the sale of
10 million methaqualone pills and approximately 23,000 pounds of
marijuana. </p>

<p>In addition to facilitating maritime trafficking, recent
reports indicate that drug traffickers regularly fly through
otherwise tightly controlled Cuban airspace. Traffickers
apparently have an assigned corridor which they can transit
without challenge from Cuban air defenders. Cuba also reportedly
allows Colombian traffickers to off-load drugs to other carriers
for the final journey to the United States. </p>

<p>It is often difficult in drug trafficking cases to make a
distinction between corrupt high-ranking government officials and
government-sanctioned involvement in the drug trade. Given,
however, the tight controls exerted by the Castro government's
security apparatus over foreign travel and communications, the
drug-related activities which have occurred in Cuba in recent
years almost certainly were known and approved by that country's
highest ranking officials. According to the Department of State: </p>

<p>. . . the evidence clearly indicates more than a case of
corruption by local or mid-level security officials in Cuba . . .
Narcotics trafficking has apparently been sanctioned by Cuba as a
means to finance subversion in Latin America. </p>

<p>Nicaragua </p>

<p>Since 1981, the United States has received a steady stream of
intelligence indicating that Nicaragua is used by drug
traffickers as a transshipment point between Colombia and the
United States, and that officials of the revolutionary government
there, the Sandinista Directorate, are involved in the drug
trade. Evidence further suggests that enforcement measures
implemented by Colombian President Betancur have prompted
Colombian traffickers, notably Jorge Ochoa and Pablo Escobar, to
relocate their cocaine processing facilities to Nicaragua. </p>

<p>The best evidence to date of the link between the Nicaraguan
government and Colombian drug traffickers came to light in 1984.
In that year, pilot Adler Barriman Seal, a former Ochoa cocaine
trafficking pilot working then with the DEA in an undercover
capacity, reported that Escobar and Ochoa had agreed in April
1984 to use Nicaragua as a cocaine smuggling base. At Ochoa's
request, Seal flew 750 kilos of cocaine in June, 1984 from
Colombia to an airfield just northwest of Managua. The airfield
was used generally as a joint facility by the Nicaraguan armed
forces and the Ministry of the Interior. Seal's aircraft was
damaged in the landing, and according to Seal, Frederico Vaughn,
a personal assistant to Interior Minister Thomas Borge, arranged
for him to return to the United States in another plane. Later
that June, Seal returned to the airfield in a C-123 aircraft,
equipped with a hidden camera, to retrieve the drugs. Both Vaughn
and Escobar, escorted by Nicaraguans in uniform and recorded on
videotape, personally helped Seal load the cocaine into the
aircraft. Vaughn was paid $1.5 million for providing the
Colombian traffickers &quot;secure facilities.&quot; </p>

<p>In July 1984, Seal made another trip to Nicaragua from the
United States to bring supplies for a new cocaine processing
complex under construction there. In a subsequent taped
conversation with Seal, Frederico Vaughn stated that the
processing center was ready for use. </p>

<p>Eleven persons, including Vaughn, were indicted by a Federal
grand jury on charges stemming from this trafficking arrangement.
All remain at large. It is highly unlikely that these trafficking
activities occurred without the knowledge and consent of the
Sandinista government. </p>

<p>Bulgaria </p>

<p>Since the late 1970's, reports that many drug dealers,
especially Turkish nationals, operate out of semi-permanent bases
in Bulgaria have been in circulation. The allegations against
Bulgaria include charges that the Bulgarians, primarily through
an official government trading firm, Kintex, officially sanction
the sale of illicit drugs to Western Europe and use the proceeds
from those sales to finance illegal arms transactions and to
bankroll terrorist groups. There are consistent reports that
top-ranking members of the Bulgarian Security Service or
ex-Bulgarian ministers comprise the directorate of Kintex. </p>

<p>Certain smugglers are reportedly permitted to conduct
activities within Bulgaria. In effect, Bulgarian officials,
though Kintex, assign representatives to establish fee
arrangements with smugglers for bartered contraband. Smugglers
trafficking through Bulgaria are primarily Turkish nationals of
Kurdish background, but include Syrian, Jordanian, Lebanese and
European nationals. </p>

<p>Corruption </p>

<p>The Role of the Corrupt Official </p>

<p>The corrupt official is the sine qua non of drug trafficking.
By the corruption of his office, he protects the interest of
traffickers in all phases of growing, processing and smuggling
illicit drugs. Officials &quot;from the lowly constable on
up&quot; are bribed and subverted by traffickers. </p>

<p>Mexico </p>

<p>While United States officials and investigators commonly
acknowledge that corruption among the ranks of both the Mexican
Federal Judicial Police and the Directorate of Security
facilitates drug trafficking in and through that country, they
are hesitant to make open accusations concerning the relationship
between corrupt officials and traffickers. Their reasoning is
persuasive: Mexico is a neighbor and an ally, a politically and
economically unstable one at that. The government of President
Miguel de la Madrid appears sincere in its efforts to improve the
quality of drug law enforcement throughout the country.
Nonetheless, mounting evidence prompted the Department of State
to assert in its 1985 mid-year report to Congress that: </p>

<p>There are strong indications that the Mexican [drug] program
has been less effective over the past two years, and that
corruption is playing a major role in this decline. </p>

<p>Drug-related corruption among members of Mexico's Federal
police force, which was widespread and well-publicized in the
1970's, continues to undermine anti-drug efforts in that country.
Allegations of corruption surfaced in March 1985, after DEA agent
Enrique Camarena Salazar and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar
were kidnapped and murdered in Guadalajara. Six Mexican police
officers were indicted on charges related to the Camarena murder;
they were charged with assisting drug traffickers through
&quot;protection of personnel and goods, custody of drugs in
transit, as well as continuing services of information.&quot; The
arrested officers have reportedly confessed that drug traffickers
offered them between $200 to $6,250 a month for official
protection. </p>

<p>In connection with the Camarena case, DEA officials maintain
that Jorge Armando Pavon Reyes, the First Commandante of the
Mexican Federal Judicial Police, who directed the investigation
into the Camarena murder, accepted a bribe from the trafficker
suspect in the killing, Rafael Caro Quintero, and in return
allowed Caro to leave Guadalajara. Later apprehended in Costa
Rica, Caro claimed in a confession that he paid Pavon Reyes
$265,000 to avoid arrest at the Guadalajara airport. Despite his
denials of the charges, Pavon Reyes was indicted for the crime in
Mexico in April 1985. </p>

<p>United States pressure after the Camerena murder and
subsequent revelations of corruption prompted a number of quick
responses from the Mexican Government. President de la Madrid
announced a major reorganization and consolidation of the police
forces under stronger Federal control; the governor of one
Mexican state dismissed that state's entire judicial system,
including the state attorney general, police and administrative
personnel; and a reported 100 agents of the Federal Security
Directorate, a political police force and counterintelligence
unit run by the Interior Ministry, resigned in the face of
corruption allegations. Corruption in at least some Mexican
institutions, however, appears to be deeply embedded and not
likely to be eliminated quickly or easily. At the end of
September, 1985, six months after the Camerena murder, evidence
of Mexican corruption continued to surface as the members of the
United States Fraternal Order of Border Patrol Agents charged
that: </p>

<p>Mexican federal agents, using the latest in radio and
scanner-equipped cars and armed with automatic weapons, have been
providing transit security for huge loads of domestically
produced marijuana and heroin and in-transit cocaine. </p>

<p>Bahamas and Caribbean </p>

<p>The Bahamas and a number of Caribbean countries serve as a
major refueling transshipment points for traffickers transporting
illicit drugs from Mexico and South America to the United States.
Corruption among officials at all levels throughout these
countries appears to be widespread. </p>

<p>Drug-related corruption has reached the highest offices of
government in the British-held Turks and Caicos Islands, where in
March 1985, that country's Chief Minister, Norman Saunders, was
convicted of conspiracy to travel in furtherance of a drug plot
and on five counts of traveling in furtherance of in illicit drug
transaction. Saunders, the first foreign head of state to be
convicted on drug charges, was found not guilty of more serious
charges of conspiracy to smuggle marijuana and cocaine. Trial
witnesses testified that Saunders accepted a total of $50,000 to
allow drugs to move freely through his island chain. He planned
to use the islands as a &quot;safe-haven&quot; for traffickers
smuggling illicit drugs from Colombia to the United States.
Stafford Missick, Minister of Commerce and Development in the
Saunders government, was convicted of conspiracy to import
cocaine and marijuana in the case; a third indicted Turks and
Caicos official, Aulden Smith, has not yet been tried. </p>

<p>In the Bahamas, a 1984 Commission of Inquiry investigating
drug trafficking through the Islands reported that Bahamian
officials &quot;from policemen to cabinet minister&quot; allowed
the Islands to be used as a transshipment point for illicit drugs
in return for sizeable bribes. A majority of the three-man
Commission concluded that no credible evidence directly tied
Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden Pindling to the drug-related
corruption, but noted that Pindling's bank accounts reflected
deposits of $3.5 million in excess of his salary between 1977 and
1983. </p>

<p>The Commission of Inquiry noted that a number of the Family
Island Commissioners, the representatives of the central
government on nearly all the Bahamian Islands: </p>

<p>claimed they either had no direct knowledge of drug
trafficking or had never received any complaints regarding such
activity . . . We find that to be quite remarkable and we do not
believe that they were being candid with us . . . they could not
help but know what was going on in relation to drug trafficking.
We have concluded that there must have been a degree of
acquiescence on their part . . . </p>

<p>The Commission report also charged that Colombian cocaine
trafficker Carlos Enrique Lehder Rivas operated an extensive
cocaine enterprise in the Bahamian Island of Norman's Cay from
1978 until 1982, and the Lehder paid &quot;substantial
bribes&quot; to various ranks of policemen and customs officials
to facilitate his illicit drug activities. </p>

<p>Former trafficker Luis Carcia, who transshipped marijuana and
cocaine through the Bahamas on a regular basis in the late 1970's
and early 1980's testified before the President's Commission on
Organized Crime that he had: </p>

<p>. . . never seen corruption such as there is in the Bahamas.
The policemen used to plead with me to use airstrips in their
territory so they could received the pay-off . . . sometimes
off-duty police unloaded the stuff from the plane and into the
boats for me . . . we always operated out of the Bahamas because
of the total corruption there. </p>

<p>South America </p>

<p>Official corruption has seriously hindered anti-drug efforts
throughout South America, especially in Bolivia and Peru.
Throughout Bolivia during the 1980's regime of General Garcia
Meza, corruption among high-level officials charged with drug
enforcement was so rampant that &quot;the government itself
became an international drug trafficker.&quot; Despite the
subsequent efforts the current Bolivian government to more
effectively enforce drug control laws, corruption at all levels
of the Bolivian government remains a major problem. In 1983, for
example, Bolivian authorities arrested two suspected traffickers
with a small amount of cocaine and confiscated a 14,000 acre
ranch and two airplanes belonging to them. Two weeks later, the
men were transferred to the authority of a local prosecutor who
subsequently released them and returned their possessions.
According the reports, at least $250,000 in bribes were paid to
Bolivian police and government officials for the release of the
two traffickers. </p>

<p>In August 1985, officials in Peru began a drug corruption
investigation that country's entire Interior Ministry after
authorities discovered direct telephone lines linking reputed
cocaine trafficker Reynaldo Rodriguez Lopes to officials at the
Mexican Consulate in Peru. Officials also found a government car
belonging to a top aid of former Interior Minister and Prime
Minister Luis Percovich parked in front of Lopes' home. </p>

<p>These are a few among many examples. Corruption linked to drug
trafficking is a widespread phenomenon among political and
military leaders, police and other authorities in virtually every
country touched by the drug trade. The easily available and
enormous amounts of money generated through drug transaction
present a temptation too great for many in positions of authority
to resist. </p>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<p><b>Note from Cliff Schaffer:</b> </p>

<p>This chapter is a summary of some of the major events in
American drug prohibition. What is most interesting about this
chapter is what it leaves out. For example, elsewhere in these
pages you will find numerous historical references to the racial
motives behind these laws. In this chapter, there is only a
passing reference to an opium law restricting trade by the
Chinese. </p>

<p>In addition, the chapter spends a good deal of time talking
about President Nixon's administration and the reorganization
which took place, but fails to mention that Nixon commissioned
the largest study of drug policy in American history, which
disagreed with his policy. </p>

<h2>Chapter IV Part 1: Federal Drug Strategy... </h2>

<p>Federal Drug Strategy: Origins, Evolution, and Current Status </p>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>The Federal response to the national problems of drug abuse
and drug trafficking over the years has been both dynamic and
characterized by frustration. Drug use and its concomitant
organized crime effects continue to challenge the Nation to
develop a more effective and sophisticated response. Typically, a
particular Federal enforcement reaction to drug abuse and drug
trafficking has prompted drug traffickers and drug abusers to
take defensive actions, which in turn have required new or
different governmental responses. This reactive process has been
particularly characteristic of the Federal effort over the last
two decades. </p>

<p>The history of Federal drug policy that follows demonstrates
that approaches to reduce supply have been the preferred and
dominant Federal response over the last 75 years. It is only
relatively recently that the nature of the drug supply-demand
dynamic has become widely understood, leading to an increased
appreciation for and emphasis on programs to reduce demand, and
that there is still no consensus on what the role of the Federal
government in the national campaign against drug trafficking and
drug abuse should be. </p>

<p>The Early Years </p>

<p>Although use of drugs has been viewed by many Americans as a
medical problem or a personal moral shortcoming throughout this
country's history, laws regulating or proscribing such use are of
relatively recent vintage. The first significant piece of
prohibitory legislation relating to drugs in the United States
was an ordinance enacted in 1875 by the city of San Francisco
prohibiting the operation of opium dens, commercial
establishments in which the smoking of opium occurred. One
western state after another followed San Francisco's lead and
enacted legislation prohibiting opium smoking. Within eight years
of the passage of the San Francisco ordinance, Congress raised
the tariff on smoking opium, which was a relatively mild form of
opium, from $6 to $10 a pound; the tariff on opium had first been
imposed in 1842. In 1887, apparently in response to obligations
imposed upon the United States by a Chinese-American commercial
treaty negotiated in 1880, Congress prohibited the importation of
smoking opium by Chinese subjects. Despite these first
legislative efforts, the incidence of drug use and addiction
increased, as did societal concern and illegal drug smuggling. </p>

<p>Although estimates concerning the number of drug addicts
during the 50 years prior to the passage of drug legislation in
1914 are inherently suspect, the available information suggests
that drug abuse during that period was a &quot;major
medico-social problem.&quot; In fact, by 1909, the United States
was confronted with a significant and growing drug problem. The
increased opiate use and addiction in the United States
subsequent to the Civil War has been attributed to several
factors, including the indiscriminate use of morphine to treat
battlefield casualties during the Civil War. The increase in
morphine addiction was such that the phrase &quot;army
disease&quot; was used to describe the drug use among
ex-soldiers. The widespread administration of morphine by
hypodermic syringe also contributed to the increase in opiate
abuse. Other circumstances, which exacerbated the situation
during the period of 1865-1914, included the spread of opium
smoking from Chinese immigrants to American citizens, the use of
opium and its derivatives by the American patent medicine
industry, and the marketing of heroin beginning in 1898 as a
safe, powerful, and non-addictive substitute for the opium
derivatives morphine and codeine. </p>

<p>The American Opium Commission, established by an Act of
Congress in early 1908, investigated domestic opium use during
that year. In response to the results of this investigation,
Congress passed &quot;An Act to Prohibit the Importation and Use
of Opium for Other Than Medicinal Purposes&quot; in 1909, which
among other things, permitted the importation of opium for
medicinal purposes but only to 12 ports of entry. However, it did
not regulate domestic opium production and manufacture or the
interstate shipment of opium products: </p>

<p>Opium products were still available without a physician's
prescription and were being marketed throughout the country
through retail outlets and a growing mail order trade. </p>

<p>Another motivation for the passage of the 1909 Act was the
realization that the United States could not continue to advocate
measures to ameliorate the opium problem in the Far East without
taking serious steps to deal with its own &quot;home
problem.&quot; Although considered a necessary first step, the
1909 Act was subsequently adjudged to be seriously defective in
that it &quot;contain[ed] no provision against the possible
intrastate manufacture of smoking opium. It [did] no more than
exclude this form of the drug from the United States.&quot;
Because few States had effective laws against the manufacture of
smoking opium in addition to the proscriptions on its sale and
use, that gap could frustrate the objectives of Federal and State
laws. </p>

<p>Shortly before the enactment of the Act of 1909 an
International Opium Commission, consisting of the representatives
of 13 nations was convened in Shanghai at the initiative of the
United States. The Shanghai Commission has been described as the
&quot;first international effort at the solution of the opium
problem.&quot; Although originally conceived of as an
organization for investigating Far East opium use and
trafficking, the Shanghai Commission was transformed into a body
for examining worldwide opium use and trafficking because opium
addiction had spread to other parts of the world, especially to
the United States, and because producer countries were not
restricted to the Far East. The Shanghai Convention unanimously
adopted several resolutions for consideration by the governments
of the participating nations, including the following three: </p>

<p>(1) Consider the desirability of reviewing each country's
system of regulation of the use of opium in light of the
discrepancies among countries' regulatory systems; </p>

<p>(2) Adopt measures to prevent the exporting of opium and its
derivatives to countries which prohibit the importation of such
items; and </p>

<p>(3) Take measures for the gradual suppression of opium smoking
in each country's own territories and possessions. </p>

<p>Because of the unanimity achieved by the Shanghai Commission,
the United States on September 1, 1909, proposed to the other
participating countries that an international conference be held
to &quot;conventionalize the resolutions adopted at Shanghai and
their necessary consequences.&quot; The conference, which was
held at The Hague, began on December 1, 1911, and resulted in the
signing of the International Opium Convention on January 23,
1912. The Convention was ratified by the United States Senate on
October 18, 1913. The International Opium Convention committed
its signatories to the enactment of laws designed to suppress the
&quot;abuse of opium, morphine, cocaine as well as drugs prepared
or derived from these substances . . . In response to this
international obligation and to domestic considerations, the
United States passed the Harrison Act on December 17, 1914 (Ch.
1, 38 Stat. 785) , which &quot;became the cornerstone of domestic
narcotics policy&quot; for nearly 65 years. </p>

<p>The Harrison Act: 1914-1936, Early Years of Enforcement </p>

<p>Section 1 of the Harrison Act provided that any person who was
in the business of dealing in the covered drugs was required to
register annually and to pay a special annual tax of one dollar.
Section 2 made it illegal for any person to sell or in any way to
give away any of the covered drugs, except pursuant to the
written order of the person to whom the drug was being sold or
given; the written order was required to be on a form issued by
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Section 4 made it unlawful
for anyone who had not previously registered and paid the special
tax, required by Section 1 of the Act, to engage in interstate
trafficking in the drugs listed. With the exception of employees
of registrants and patients of physicians and dentists, Section 8
prohibited the possession of any of the drugs covered by the Act
by any person who had not registered and paid the special tax
imposed by Section I. Section 9 provided that the punishment for
any violation of the Act was to be not more than $2,000 or not
more than 5 years in prison or both. Finally, Section 10 gave the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, subject to the approval of the
Secretary of the Treasury, the responsibility for enforcing the
Act. </p>

<p>The history of enforcement under the Harrison Act was
tremendously affected by Congress' chosen source of authority for
the legislation, its constitutional power to lay and collect
taxes. The principle of Federalism and the related concept of the
States' police power were effective constraints on the scope of
the Federal government's powers at the time of the Harrison Act,
hence the use of the constitutional authority to tax to regulate
drug-related activity. </p>

<p>Because the Harrison Act was superficially a measure designed
to raise revenue, its stated purpose dictated that the
enforcement of the Statute be the responsibility of the Treasury
Department and, by the statute's own terms, of the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue. Despite its revenue-raising veneer, its
regulatory purpose was acknowledged from the beginning: </p>

<p>Certain individuals viewed the Harrison Act as a rational way
to limit addiction and drug abuse through taxation and
regulation. It was a regulatory device which, according to the
American opium Commission, &quot;would bring the whole traffic
and use of these drugs into the light of day and, therefore,
create a public opinion against the use of them that would be
more important, perhaps, than the Act itself&quot; (Dr. Hamilton
Wright, American Opium Commission). The Act was heralded as a
method of drug abuse control and as a public awareness tool. </p>

<p>The history of early enforcement efforts under the Harrison
Act, and of the nation's drug abuse problem and policy generally,
was affected in no small degree by a series of Supreme Court
decisions that were handed down during the decade immediately
following passage of the Act. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of the
Harrison Act in United States v. Doremus. In deciding the issues
raised by the Government's appeal of the dismissal of the
indictment against a physician who had been registered under the
Act, the Supreme Court set forth general principles that governed
its resolution of the issues: </p>

<p>If the legislation enacted has some reasonable relation to the
exercise of the taxing authority conferred by the Constitution,
it cannot be invalidated because of the supposed motives which
induced it. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>The Act may not be declared unconstitutional because its
effect may be to accomplish another purpose as well as the
raising of revenue. If the legislation is within the taxing
authority of Congress - that is sufficient to sustain it. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of Section 2
of the Act on the ground that it did relate to the raising of
revenue. </p>

<p>On the same day that the Supreme Court decided Doremus, it
also answered in Webb v. United States the following question in
the negative: whether an order for morphine, which is issued by a
physician to a habitual user who is not under his professional
care and which is issued not for the purpose of curing the habit
but for maintenance, is a &quot;prescription.&quot; It did so
because it concluded that &quot;to call such an order . . . a
physician's prescription would be so plain a perversion of
meaning that no discussion of the subject is required.&quot; </p>

<p>The Court extended its Webb Ruling in United States v. Behrman
by holding that an order issued by a physician for large doses of
proscribed drugs, which were not prescribed for the purpose of
treating a condition other than the addiction itself and which
were to be self-administered by the addict, to a person, who was
addicted and who was under the physician's personal care,
constituted a violation of the Harrison Act. In doing so, the
Court implicitly agreed with the district judge that
&quot;prescriptions in the regular course of practice did not
include the indiscriminate doling out of narcotics in such
quantity to addicts as charged in the indictments.&quot; </p>

<p>The Harrison Act, as construed by the Supreme Court, was the
statutory framework within which Federal drug strategies were
devised and implemented over the next half-century. However,
early enforcement efforts and priorities under the Harrison Act
did have somewhat unintended and undesirable consequences. </p>

<p>As noted previously, the responsibility for enforcement of the
Harrison Act was given initially to the Commissioner of Revenue,
subject to review by the Secretary of the Treasury. In 1915, 162
collectors and agents in the Miscellaneous Division of the
Internal Revenue Service were given the responsibility under the
Harrison Act for restricting the sale of proscribed drugs.
Meanwhile, the administration and enforcement of the National
Prohibition or the Volstead Act, which was adopted to enforce the
Eighteenth Amendment, was committed to the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue who created a prohibition unit. Because it
seemed logical to place responsibility for enforcement of the
Harrison Act within this Prohibition Unit, a Narcotics Division
was created in that unit in 1919 with a staff of 170 agents and
an appropriation of $270,000. This organizational unit for the
enforcement of the Harrison Act existed until April 1, 1927, when
legislation creating a Bureau of Prohibition and a Bureau of
Customs, to be headed by Commissioners, within the Department of
Treasury, was enacted. The 1927 legislation also transferred to
the Secretary of the Treasury all powers and duties that had been
conferred by the revenue and prohibition laws upon the
Commissioner of Revenue relating to intoxicating liquors and
narcotics. In addition, the Secretary was authorized to delegate
such powers and duties to the Commissioners of Prohibition and
Internal Revenue. The enforcement of the narcotics laws
subsequently was delegated to a narcotics unit under the
direction of the Deputy Commissioner of Prohibition. </p>

<p>Enforcement efforts under the Harrison Act from 1914 through
1929 were controversial. Following the expansive constructions of
the Harrison Act by the Supreme Court in Doremus, Webb, and
Behrman, thousands of additional prosecutions were undertaken as
a result of investigations conducted by agents of the Narcotics
Division of the Prohibition Unit. It has been estimated that over
50,000 individuals, including many physicians and others who were
required to register under the Act, were charged with violating
the Act during the period of 1914-1922. After this initial burst
of arrest activity directed against registrants, the Narcotics
Division turned its attention to closing clinics that had been
established to conduct research and treat large numbers of
addicts who could not afford private care. Because of pressure by
the American Medical Association, which had initially welcomed
the Harrison Act but which later came to view the actions of the
Narcotics Division as harassment and an improper Federal
intrusion into the practice of medicine, the Department of the
Treasury encouraged its agents to focus on the &quot;blatantly
illegal importation and sale of narcotics.&quot; </p>

<p>Despite this change in enforcement direction, the earlier
enforcement focus had a damaging, long-term impact. Because of
the mere threat of prosecution under the Act, the &quot;interest
of physicians in these cases [of narcotic addiction]&quot;
declined and &quot;they even began to refuse to prescribe.&quot;
In closing the clinics, which had been established to treat those
who were unable to afford private care, the Federal government
may have impeded - albeit unintentionally - research into
narcotic effects, use and addiction and as a result interfered
with the development of efficacious medical treatment. Finally,
the Federal government's early success in decreasing the supply
of narcotic drugs from licit sources, i.e., registrants, to drug
users forced those users to seek out illicit sources of supply. </p>

<p>The history of enforcement of the Harrison Act during the
fifteen years following its enactment illustrates the operation
of a principle that has been validated repeatedly since that
tine: drug demand will result in the creation of supply channels
to satisfy the demand. An effective drug abuse policy requires a
systematic and long-term demand reduction component;
unfortunately, there was no such component of the Federal policy
in the more than 50 years following the enactment of the Harrison
Act. </p>

<p>Enforcement efforts were burdened, however, by public
dissatisfaction with the activities of the Narcotics Division,
which was tainted by its association with the country's
anti-liquor laws. The public dissatisfaction intensified because
of a scandal involving falsification of arrest records and
charges relating to payoffs by, and collusion with, drug dealers.
In response, Congress removed the responsibility for enforcing
the Federal drug laws from the Bureau of Prohibition, which was
itself incorporated into the Department of Justice. Drug
enforcement was transferred in 1930 to a newly created Federal
Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) within the Department of the Treasury,
which was headed by a Commissioner of Narcotics. Although the FBN
was primarily responsible for the enforcement of the Harrison Act
and related drug laws, the task of preventing and interdicting
the illegal importation and smuggling of drugs remained with the
Bureau of Customs. With one major exception to be discussed at
the beginning of the next section, the Federal statutory and
organizational structure relating to narcotics that existed on
July 1, 1930, remained in place for the next 35 years. </p>

<p>1937-1969: Intensification of Pressure for Change in Federal
Drug Policy </p>

<p>Marijuana was not made subject to the Harrison Act or to the
Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act (the Jones-Miller Act)
because it was not viewed as a particularly dangerous drug. In
addition, because of its use in the making of rope, twine,
veterinary medicines, and other products, marijuana's commercial
value was thought to outweigh any deleterious effects from its
abuse. However, as marijuana use became widespread in America,
concern about its use also spread. Due to the efforts of a
&quot;small but vocal group of crusaders,&quot; the States began
to pass legislation to prohibit all marijuana-related activity.
By 1931, &quot;all but two states West of the Mississippi and
several more in the East had enacted prohibitory legislation
making it a criminal offense to possess or use the drug.&quot;
The FBN initially minimized the dangers of marijuana use, and in
its 1932 annual report, it instead urged the States to adopt a
Uniform State Narcotics Law. Such a law was drafted in 1932, and
it included an optional marijuana provision. </p>

<p>By 1937 every state had prohibited marijuana use. However,
faced with continuing intensive lobbying efforts, the FBN did
become an &quot;ardent supporter&quot; of marijuana legislation,
which finally was embodied in the Marihuana Tax Act 1937. </p>

<p>The Marihuana Tax Act was nominally a revenue measure
patterned after the Harrison Narcotic Act. It required that any
person whose business related to marijuana to register and pay a
special tax. In addition, the transference of marijuana had to be
pursuant to a written order on a form issued by the Secretary of
the Treasury and the transferee was required to pay a tax of
$1.00/ounce if he had registered and $100.00/ounce if he had not.
Finally, the Act made the transferor liable for the transfer tax
if a transfer were made without an order form and without payment
of the tax by the transferee. </p>

<p>From the late 1930's through the 1950's, the FBN's enforcement
efforts were directed almost exclusively at disrupting the
illegal importation of drugs into this country and to making
cases against distributors and dealers. Indeed, in 1942 the FBN
recognized that it was necessary to eradicate crops in Mexico if
its interdiction efforts were to achieve greater success. In that
same year Congress enacted the Opium Poppy Control Act of 1942,
which, among other things, prohibited the domestic production of
the poppy without FBN permission. </p>

<p>During a great part of this period the FBN was handicapped to
some degree by a shortage of agents and inadequate budgets. In
the Spring of 1956, a Congressional Committee found that: </p>

<p>[FBN] is one of the few Federal agencies whose personnel and
funds have not been increased to reflect population growth and
greater responsibility. Over a period of 25 years, the Federal
narcotic laws have been enforced with a force of approximately
227 agents and an average budget of less than $2 million. This
restriction on manpower and operating funds has seriously
curtailed investigations of the illicit traffic in the United
States and of sources of supply in foreign countries. </p>

<p>Because of budget limitations, the present force of 250
Federal narcotic agents is 25 short of the number authorized by
the Congress. By way of comparison, New York City has
approximately 200 police officers assigned specifically to
narcotic enforcement. </p>

<p>These statistics suggest that, during this time, drug abuse
and trafficking were not the Federal priorities that they are
today. </p>

<p>Despite the handicaps that the FBN operated under during this
period, it nevertheless enjoyed a degree of success. According to
LCN informer Joseph Valachi, the tactics used by the FBN to
infiltrate and disrupt trafficking organizations caused some LCN
chieftains to rethink the advisability of their continued
participation in the drug trade. According to Valachi, Frank
Costello, then acting boss of the Luciano Family, ordered its
members to stop trafficking in drugs in 1948. One of the
principal reasons for the edict was explained as follows: </p>

<p>Much more important . . . was the dogged harassment of the
Bureau of Narcotics. The Cosa Nostra despised - and feared - [the
FBN] . . . . </p>

<p>The Narcotics Bureau, unlike the FBI, which tends to look down
its nose at it, does not depend on the informant system for much
of its intelligence but regularly engages its agents in dangerous
undercover work; they are, as a result, . . . highly motivated,
less disciplined, generally more daring and innovational,
occasionally corruptible. Above all else, the [FBN] was the first
to recognize the existence of an organization like the Cosa
Nostra, and no other arm of the law has put more of a crimp in
its operation. </p>

<p>Although continuing to warn of the dangers of drug use, the
FBN, especially during the earlier part of the period,
&quot;adopted a more moderate approach in its dealings with
Congress as well as the American people.&quot; The Bureau's
approach reflected the attitude of the American public, which
appeared to consider the drug problem to be restricted to small
groups at the periphery of society, with no great societal
impact. </p>

<p>In the 1950's the rather complacent attitude toward the drug
problem began to change. The first indication of greater concern
was reflected in the enactment of the Boggs Act on November 2,
1951, which generally increased the penalties for violations of
the narcotic and marijuana laws. The primary motivations for the
passage of the Boggs Act were the inadequacy of penalties under
the existing law as deterrents and an increase in drug addiction.
With respect to the former, Congress relied on statistics showing
that the rate of recidivism among drug violators had increased
substantially over a 15- year period of time; in 1935, 40 percent
of those convicted of narcotics violations had prior drug
convictions, while 63.6 percent of those convicted and sentenced
during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1950 were recidivists.
Congress concluded that drug addiction was increasing on the
basis of statistics showing that between 1946 and 1950 there had
been a 100 percent increase in the number of narcotic
laws-related arrests and that the average age of persons
committed to a Public Health Service Hospital had declined from
37.5 to 26.7 years, over a five year period. </p>

<p>Encouraged by the purported success of the Boggs Act, Congress
passed the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, which further increased
the penalties for drug violations. Among other things, this 1956
Act raised the permissive maximum sentences for violations of the
narcotic possession statutes; imposed new mandatory minimum
sentences and increased the permissive maximums for trafficking
violations; eliminated probation, suspension of service, or
parole for all cases except those involving a first offender
possessor; authorized FBN and Customs agents to carry firearms
and to execute and serve search and arrest warrants; made the
sale of heroin to individuals under 18 years of age a capital
offense, although the death penalty was not made mandatory but
could be imposed only if the jury specifically so directed; and
made the smuggling of marijuana a violation of the Narcotic Drugs
Import and Export Act. </p>

<p>The severe penalties imposed by the Narcotic Control Act of
1956 were adopted even though Congress found that, as a result of
the Boggs Act, &quot;narcotic addiction and the illicit narcotic
traffic [were] generally on the decline in the United
States.&quot; Because the stringent penalties imposed by the
Boggs Act were thought to be successful in decreasing drug
addiction, the 84th Congress concluded that the imposition of
even more severe penalties would &quot;be the strongest and most
effective deterrent to narcotic addiction and illicit drug
traffic.&quot; Finally, Congress was of the view in enacting the
Narcotic Control Act of 1956 that &quot;suppression of the
illicit drug traffic&quot; would be the most important
contribution that the Federal Government could make to the
successful and permanent rehabilitation of drug addicts. Congress
thus sought to reduce the demand for drugs through reducing their
supply. </p>

<p>Public concern over the problem of drug abuse, which had been
relatively dormant during the 1940's and 1950's, flared during
the 1960's. The intensification of the national concern resulted
in increasing pressure for Federal initiatives in the area. In
response to this development, a White House Conference on
Narcotics and Drug Abuse was convened in 1962, which resulted in
the establishment of the President's Advisory Commission on
Narcotics and Drug Abuse (Prettyman Commission) on January 15,
1963. </p>

<p>The Prettyman Commission's final report, submitted to
President Kennedy in November 1963, included 25 recommendations,
the substance of several of which were: </p>

<p>(1) Transfer the enforcement and investigative functions of
the FBN relating to illicit transactions in narcotic drugs and
marijuana from the Department of Treasury to the Department of
Justice; </p>

<p>(2) Transfer the responsibilities of the FBN relating to the
regulation of the legitimate traffic in narcotic drugs and
marijuana from the Department of the Treasury to the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare; </p>

<p>(3) Substantially increase the number of Federal agents
assigned to the investigation of the illicit importation of and
trafficking in narcotic drugs, marijuana, and dangerous drugs; </p>

<p>(4) Transfer the responsibility for investigating the illicit
traffic in dangerous drugs from the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare to the Department of Justice; and </p>

<p>(5) Strictly control, by Federal statute, all non-narcotic
drugs capable of producing serious psychotoxic effects when
abused. </p>

<p>Within 18 months of the issuance of the Commission's final
report, Congress adopted the recommendation regarding the
diversion of &quot;dangerous drugs&quot; from legal channels. The
resulting Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 mandated, among
other things, record-keeping and inspection requirements for
depressant and stimulant drugs, and specifically for barbiturates
and amphetamines, &quot;throughout the chain of distribution,
from the basic manufacturer to (but not including) the ultimate
consumer.&quot; The Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 were
passed because of perceived serious problems associated with the
diversion of depressant and stimulant drugs from licit channels: </p>

<p>[T]estimony showed that over 9 billion barbiturate and
amphetamine tablets are produced annually in the United States.
It is estimated that over 50 percent, or 4 1/2 billion tablets,
are distributed through illicit channels. The human toll of drug
abuse cannot be measured for it affects not only the abuser but
his family and the community around him. Drug abuse is closely
bound up with juvenile delinquency. It also contributes to the
rising crime rate in the United States. </p>

<p>To carry out the new enforcement obligations imposed by the
Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 another agency was created;
a Bureau of Drug Abuse Control (BDAC) was established within the
Department's Food and Drug Administration. The Bureau of Customs,
however, retained responsibility for the enforcement of laws
relating to the importing and exporting of depressant and
stimulants drugs. With the establishment of the BDAC on February
1, 1966, the Department of the Treasury's virtual monopoly of the
enforcement of Federal drug laws ended. </p>

<p>Within 16 months of the enactment of the Drug Abuse Control
Amendments of 1965 Congress passed an enlightened piece of
legislation: The Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966. This
Act did many things, including: authorizing a district court to
order the civil commitment of an individual, who was an addict,
who had been charged with certain offenses against the United
States, and who elected to do so, to the Surgeon General for
treatment of his addiction and rehabilitation, in lieu of
prosecution; requiring a district court to commit an individual
who had been convicted of certain offenses against the United
States and who was an addict to the custody of the Attorney
General for treatment and rehabilitation; permitting any narcotic
addict to file a petition with a United States Attorney
requesting that he be admitted to a Public Health Service
hospital for treatment and rehabilitation; and authorizing the
Surgeon General to establish rehabilitation and
post-hospitalization care programs for narcotic addicts and to
provide financial assistance to the States to establish similar
programs. </p>

<p>As the House Committee on Judiciary, one of the Congressional
committees which reported on the proposed bill, observed, the
Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966: </p>

<p>. . . mark[e]d a fundamental reorientation toward the problem
of narcotics addiction. The Attorney General in his testimony
before the Committee stated that for too long the law had
stressed punitive solutions and neglected medical and
rehabilitative measures. </p>

<p>The 1966 Act embodied a proposition that had tended to be
overlooked in the past: successful treatment and permanent
rehabilitation of drug users, i.e., reduction of demand for
drugs, must be an essential component of Federal law enforcement
efforts. </p>

<p>A detailed evaluation of the Federal drug strategy that was
released in 1979 accurately summarized what the Federal approach
had been prior to the late 1960's: </p>

<p>Early efforts to deal with the problem primarily focused on
reducing the supply of drugs, first through taxation, then by
prohibition and strict legal control. The basic assumption . . .
was that reducing supply and availability of drugs would lead to
reduction in their use by encouraging drug-dependent individuals
to detoxify, and by keeping drugs out of the hands of users. </p>

<p>By the end of the 1950's there was a general agreement on the
part of both the public and legislators that the Federal policy
of strict supply reduction by itself was not enough. During the
1960's and early 1970's, as drug abuse increased and spread to
new markets, the almost exclusive emphasis on supply reduction
and stiff penalties was challenged with growing frequency,
leading to increased research and experimentation with treatment
for drug abusers. </p>

<p>Beginning in 1968, in response to rising . . . concern . . .,
a variety of changes occurred in an attempt to curtail drug
abuse. </p>

<p>Despite the work of the Prettyman Commission and the enactment
of the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, public agitation
concerning crime in general, and drug abuse in particular,
intensified. In response, President Lyndon B. Johnson established
the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration
of Justice (Katzenbach Commission) in 1966 to undertake a
&quot;comprehensive study of the nation's crime problem and to
provid[e] recommendations to coordinate its eradication on all
fronts.&quot; The Katzenbach Commission issued a report in 1967,
which included a chapter on drug abuse. The substance of several
of the Katzenbach Commission's recommendations addressed both the
demand and supply of drugs: </p>

<p>(1) Substantially increase the enforcement staffs of FBN and
the Bureau of Customs; </p>

<p>(2) Permit courts and correctional authorities to deal
flexibly with violators of the drug laws; </p>

<p>(3) Undertake research to develop a sound and effective
framework of regulatory and criminal laws relating to dangerous
drugs; and </p>

<p>(4) The National Institute of Mental Health should develop a
core of educational and informational materials relating to
drugs. </p>

<p>Drawing on the recommendations of the Prettyman Commission,
President Johnson sent a reorganization plan restructuring the
Federal drug law enforcement effort to Congress for its
consideration on February 7, 1968. In terms that have been
repeated often since that time, President Johnson explained the
reason for the proposed consolidation of drug enforcement
responsibilities: </p>

<p>Today, Federal investigation and enforcement of our narcotics
laws are fragmented. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>Neither [the FBN nor the BADC] is in the agency which is
primarily concerned with Federal law enforcement - the Department
of Justice. </p>

<p>This separation of responsibilities . . . has complicated and
hindered our response to a national menace. </p>

<p>Among the most significant provisions of the plan, which
became effective on April 7, 1968, were the following: the
Department of Justice was given a major responsibility for the
enforcement of the Federal drug laws for the first time in
history by the creation within it of a Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs (BNDD); the FBN was abolished, and its drug
enforcement duties and responsibilities were shifted to BNDD; and
BDAC was also abolished, and its drug enforcement duties and
responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice. </p>

<p>The 1968 reorganization did not significantly affect the
revenue collection functions exercised by IRS under the Harrison
and Marijuana Tax Acts or the responsibility of the Bureau of
Customs for interdicting the smuggling of narcotics and
marijuana. The Plan that was intended to eliminate fragmentation
in Federal drug law enforcement thus did not eliminate it
entirely. </p>

<p>Although neither House of Congress blocked the 1968
reorganization plan, criticism of it did develop. While in
agreement that merger of the FBN and BDAC would eliminate
friction and duplication of effort, Congressional opponents
expressed skepticism that law enforcement relating to drugs and
organized crime would be in any way improved by transferring the
merged entity to the Department of Justice. Because
Administration spokesmen had acknowledged that BDAC and the FBN
had been effective law enforcement agencies, the opponents of the
plan recommended that the merged entity should instead be located
within the Department of the Treasury, where coordination with
IRS and Customs, both of which had drug law enforcement
responsibilities, could be better assured. That the BNDD was
apparently not to be placed within the FBI was one factor leading
the dissenters to conclude that &quot;greater overall efficiency
in crime enforcement&quot; would not be achieved by the placement
of the merged entity into Justice. </p>

<p>Federal Drug Law Enforcement: From Implementation of the 1968
Reorganization Plan to October 27, 1970. </p>

<p>Two major issues during the 1968 Presidential campaign were
crime and drugs. Shortly after his inauguration, President
Richard M. Nixon declared war on both and formed Task Force One
in the spring of 1969 to &quot;design programs that would have an
immediate effect on the importation of heroin and other illegal
drugs.&quot; Task Force One developed and implemented Operation
Intercept, the &quot;first major interagency attempt at border
interdiction,&quot; which involved more than 2,000 Customs, INS
Border Patrol, and BNDD agents. Because the amount of illegal
drugs seized as a result of Operation Intercept was
disappointingly small and because the venture seriously strained
relations between Mexico and the United States, Justice
Department officials concluded that successful interdiction
programs required the cooperation of source countries. As a
result, in the fall of 1969, Operation Intercept was transformed
into Operation Cooperation, which in part provided U.S. financial
aid to the Mexican Government to purchase aircraft and to train
agents to interdict the flow of drugs before they reached the
United States borders. </p>

<p>The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of
1970 </p>

<p>The year 1970 was an important one in the history of this
Nation's war against drug trafficking and drug abuse. In February
of that year, President Nixon clarified the responsibilities of
the various Federal agencies involved in the effort against drug
trafficking by issuing a directive announcing that BNDD
&quot;controls all investigations involving violations of the
laws of the United States relating to narcotics, marijuana and
dangerous drugs, both within the United States and beyond its
borders. Several months later, the President approved guidelines,
developed by the Attorney General and the Secretary of the
Treasury, which increased the investigatory responsibility of
Customs at ports and borders. However, the most significant event
in 1970 was the enactment of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (1970 Comprehensive Act). </p>

<p>As of 1970, numerous Federal statutes dealt with various
facets of the Nation's drug trafficking and abuse problems. These
laws overlapped, were sometimes inconsistent, and required more
than a dozen Federal agencies to enforce them. In response, the
1970 Comprehensive Act was passed to collect and conform
&quot;diverse laws in one piece of legislation based upon new
scientific information, the restructured Federal law enforcement
efforts under Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1968, and greater
information concerning the scope of the problem.&quot; </p>

<p>The 1970 Act comprised four titles: Title I authorized the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to increase its
efforts in drug rehabilitation, drug treatment and the prevention
of drug abuse. Specifically, Title I authorized the appropriation
of funds for drug abuse prevention and education programs and for
special project grants to programs designed to treat and
rehabilitate narcotic addicts or drug dependent persons. As a
result of these steps, Congress provided for a &quot;greatly
increased Federal effort in the fields of prevention and
rehabilitation&quot; and made the National Institute of Mental
Health the agency primarily responsible for drug education and
prevention activities in the Federal government. </p>

<p>Title II of the 1970 Act, the &quot;Controlled Substances
Act,&quot; along with Title III, comprehensively addressed the
law enforcement aspects of the attack on drug abuse. Among other
things, Title II established five schedules into which controlled
substances were and could be placed, required the registration
of, and record-keeping by, manufacturers, distributors and
dispensers of controlled substances, imposed penalties for
violations of the Act, established a Commission on Marihuana and
Drug Abuse, and authorized BNDD to add 300 agents to its staff
during FY 1971. </p>

<p>Finally, Title III, the Controlled Substances Import and
Export Act, governed the importation and exportation of
controlled substances. The Attorney General was given the
responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the import/export
registration system that the Act created. </p>

<p>Although primarily an effort to consolidate the myriad of laws
dealing with drug trafficking and abuse that had been adopted
over the years, Congress's authority for enacting the 1970 Act
was predicated upon its interstate commerce power and not, as
with previous narcotics laws, on the constitutional power to tax.
This shift had enormous implications for the way that the Federal
government would and did approach drug enforcement in the future:
</p>

<p>[The Controlled Substances Act] set the stage for an
innovation in Federal drug enforcement techniques. That
innovation was assigning large numbers of Federal narcotics
agents to work in local communities. No longer was it necessary
to demonstrate interstate traffic to justify Federal
participation in combating illegal drug use. </p>

<p>Constitutional challenges to the 1970 Act that were predicated
upon the intrastate nature of the conduct prosecuted were
rejected. </p>

<p>Federal Drug Abuse Policy: 1970-1980 </p>

<p>The decade of the 1970's was an extremely significant one for
the development of Federal drug abuse policy in terms of new
laws, organizational and operational reforms, and a growing
recognition that the reduction of the demand for drugs must be
given a greater emphasis. On the debit side the extent of the
Nation's drug abuse problem at the end of 1980 was as great as,
if not greater than, the problem in 1970. To some extent, the
situation in 1980 was attributable to the continuing and
unresolved debate concerning the appropriate Federal role in the
national struggle against drug abuse and trafficking. </p>

<p>New legislative initiatives, organizations, and operational
reforms relating to the Nation's drug abuse problem were adopted
and implemented within a relatively short period after the
enactment of the 1970 Comprehensive Act. One of the most
important and innovative of these reforms was the establishment,
by executive order, of the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse
Prevention (SAODAP) within the Executive Office of the President
on June 17, 1971. The President made the Director of SAODAP his
special representative with respect to all Federal drug abuse
training, education, rehabilitation, research, treatment, and
prevention programs and activities (exclusive of law enforcement
activities and legal proceedings). In this capacity, the SAODAP
Director's duties included prescribing &quot;policies,
guidelines, standards, and criteria for the maximum achievement
of the goals and objectives&quot; of Federal demand reduction
programs and coordinating and evaluating all Federal drug abuse
programs. </p>

<p>President Nixon did not neglect the supply reduction component
of the Federal drug policy. Presidential initiatives in this area
in 1971 included the establishment of the Cabinet Committee on
International Narcotics Control (CCINC) and of the Narcotics
Traffickers Program (NTP) within IRS. The CCINC, chaired by the
Secretary of State, was given the responsibility for
&quot;developing a strategy to check the illegal flow of
narcotics to the United States and coordinating the efforts
undertaken abroad by involved Federal departments and agencies to
implement that strategy.&quot; </p>

<p>The NTP was designed to function as a mechanism for disrupting
drug trafficking by having the IRS intensively investigate
top-echelon drug dealers. The IRS effectively ended the NTP
sometime in 1975, both because it had a relatively low revenue
yield and because IRS officials felt uncomfortable in operating a
program whose primary objective was not tax-related. </p>

<p>On January 28, 1972, President Nixon took another step,
designed to improve the Federal government's drug law enforcement
efforts by establishing an Office for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement
(ODALE) within the Department of Justice. This office was to be
headed by a Director who would be a Special Assistant Attorney
General and who would serve as a Special Consultant to the
President concerning drug law enforcement. In this role the ODALE
Director was responsible for advising the President on improving
the effectiveness of Federal drug enforcement and on assisting
the States and local governments in strengthening their own drug
law enforcement. The Director was also required to develop and
implement a &quot;concentrated program&quot; for enforcing
Federal laws concerning drug abuse prevention and for cooperating
with State and local governments in the enforcement of their drug
abuse laws. Finally, to ensure that all steps permitted by law
were taken by Federal, State and local governments and by the
private sector to prevent drug abuse, the Director of ODALE was
instructed to consult regularly with the SAODAP Director. With
the establishment of ODALE and SAODAP, and the presidential
instruction that their Directors consult, cooperate, and
coordinate, a mechanism was created within the Federal Government
that, at least theoretically, could have integrated Federal
strategies to reduce drug supply and demand to achieve maximum
results. </p>

<p>That ODALE was created in early 1972, so relatively soon after
the implementation of the 1968 reorganization plan, bespoke a
lack of confidence in the structure and operation of the drug law
enforcement system created by that plan. Indeed, ODALE was
established because of the &quot;Administration's concern that
BNDD and Customs could not act with the swiftness and precision
that a single agency vested with authority and power could.&quot;
In performing its duties and responsibilities ODALE &quot;was
empowered to take the lead in the Administration's 'war on
heroin,' with a particular emphasis on street-level
trafficking.&quot; </p>

<p>Several months after the creation of ODALE, another unit, the
Office of National Narcotic Intelligence (ONNI), was established
within the Department of Justice to function as a Clearinghouse
Of information that would be useful in the Administration's
campaign against drug trafficking. The Director of ONNI was
instructed to collect and provide narcotics intelligence to any
Federal, State, or local official determined to have a
&quot;legitimate official need&quot; for the intelligence. The
ONNI Director was also instructed to cooperate with the Director
of ODALE to assist the latter in insuring that all feasible steps
were taken to prevent drug abuse in the Nation. Although its
mandate did not include the independent development of narcotics
intelligence, the establishment of ONNI was the first concrete
recognition by officials at the highest levels of the Federal
government of the crucial role that intelligence had to play in
supply reduction strategies. </p>

<p>Congress eventually responded positively to President Nixon's
request that it enact legislation confirming his creation of
SAODAP by passing the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972
(1972 Drug Abuse Office Act). This legislation was an important
event in the history of Federal drug abuse policy: </p>

<p>With the enactment of the [Act] Federal policy clearly called
for a balanced response to the problem of drug abuse by adding a
vigorous prevention and treatment component to the existing law
enforcement effort. </p>

<p>Although commitments to the &quot;balanced response&quot;
enshrined in the 1972 Drug Abuse office Act have been proclaimed
repeatedly ever since, they have not generally been translated
into action, as measured by budget authorizations and
expenditures. </p>

<p>Congress was persuaded to enact the 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act
because the witnesses who testified before its committees were
&quot;unanimously agreed that drug abuse in America had reached
epidemic proportions.&quot; Most of the witnesses were
&quot;generally agreed that greater emphasis on the so-called
demand side of the problem is required, that is, on treatment,
rehabilitation, research, education and training.&quot; Congress
also found that the Federal government's activities with respect
to the &quot;demand side of the drug abuse field have been
carried on by at least nine different agencies and
departments&quot; and that the legislation under consideration
was needed to &quot;provide for and insure a central
comprehensive coordination of the federal effort.&quot; In
passing the Act, Congress concluded that the &quot;emphasis must,
indeed, be changed [to strategies to reduce demand] if there is
to be meaningful progress in the effort against drug abuse.&quot;
</p>

<p>The 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act did many things, including
establishing SAODAP in the Executive Office of the President;
making the Director of SAODAP responsible for, among other
things, providing overall planning and policy, and establishing
objectives and priorities, for all federal drug abuse prevention
functions, making recommendations to the President concerning any
Federal drug traffic prevention function, making findings and
recommendations to the President concerning the resolution of
conflicts involving drug abuse prevention or drug traffic
prevention functions, and coordinating Federal drug abuse
prevention functions with those of the State and local
governments; directing the President to require development of a
comprehensive, coordinated long-term Federal strategy for all
drug abuse and drug traffic prevention functions; directing the
Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to
States submitting plans for establishing, conducting and
coordinating projects for the development of more effective drug
abuse prevention functions and to make special project grants to,
and contracts with, public and private entities and individuals
to develop drug abuse prevention programs; and establishing a
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to administer the
programs of the Secretary of HEW relating to drug abuse
prevention functions. </p>

<p>The 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act was necessary and useful
legislation, but it was based on the mistaken premise that the
nation's drug abuse problem could be dealt with in a relatively
short period of time: </p>

<p>[I]t is the policy of the United States and the purpose of
this Act to focus the comprehensive resources of the Federal
Government and bring them to bear on drug abuse with the
immediate objective of significantly reducing the incidence of
drug abuse in the United States within the shortest possible
period of time . . . . </p>

<p>Consistent with this premise, Congress provided that SAODAP
was to be abolished on June 30, 1975. </p>

<p>There appears to have been an expectation at the time that the
1972 Drug Abuse office Act became effective that NIDA would
assume many of the programmatic functions of SAODAP on or before
June 30, 1975, after the war against drug abuse had been won and
only &quot;mopping-up&quot; operations remained. This expectation
no doubt was encouraged by statements made subsequent to the
passage of the 1972 Act, such as that of President Nixon in
September of 1973 that &quot;[w]e have turned the corner on drug
addiction in the United States.&quot; As the historical record
demonstrates, the expectation of quick success was unrealistic
because of the nature of the drug problem. </p>

<p>The 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act reflected the realization that
an exclusive reliance on strategies to reduce supply will fail to
achieve the ultimate objective. Such an approach disregards the
fundamental economic principle, that where a demand for a service
or commodity exists, some entrepreneur, for the right price, will
attempt to supply it. There is an optimal mix of approaches to
reduce demand and supply that will obtain maximum results and
thus achieve the goal of that policy, i.e., the elimination of
drug abuse. The Federal government necessarily has a paramount
and continuing role in that policy, in terms of providing
leadership, resources, and support to the other participants.
Experience immediately following the enactment of the 1972 Drug
Abuse Office Act demonstrates that although the Nation's drug
abuse problem may never be eliminated, it can be reduced
substantially if a long-term commitment of sufficient resources
is made and unreasonable impatience for results is checked. </p>

<p>Despite the comprehensive restructuring of the Federal
narcotics laws that had occurred in 1970, related legislative
initiatives, and the innovations in Federal drug law enforcement
represented by ODALE and ONNI, the Nixon Administration concluded
that Federal drug law enforcement continued to be hampered by
interagency rivalries and jurisdictional overlaps and disputes.
In response, another major restructuring of the Federal drug law
enforcement machinery was announced on March 28, 1973. The Nixon
Administration trumpeted the 1973 reorganization plan, which was
implemented on July 1, 1973, as doing for the supply side of the
drug abuse problem what the 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act had done
for the demand side: create an organization with the necessary
resources, breadth, and leadership capacity to act decisively. </p>

<p>The Federal drug law enforcement structure in March of 1973
was complex, as reflected in Appendix C, with no single
individual or agency responsible for supervision of the overall
effort. The 1973 reorganization plan was designed to overcome
perceived deficiencies in existing law enforcement. </p>

<p>The 1973 reorganization plan was motivated primarily by the
beliefs of Administration officials that the aggregation of
Federal drug law enforcement activities had &quot;serious
operational and organizational shortcomings&quot; and that
&quot;enforcement work could benefit significantly . . . from
consolidation of our anti-drug forces under a single unified
command.&quot; The most important innovation adopted by the plan
was the creation of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
within the Department of Justice as the &quot;single,
comprehensive Federal agency within the Department of Justice to
lead the war against illicit drug traffic.&quot; The DEA, to be
headed by an Administrator who would report directly to the
Attorney General, was to be responsible for the anti-drug
functions, and would absorb the associated manpower and budgets
of BNDD, ODALE, and ONNI and those of the Bureau of Customs with
respect to drug investigations and intelligence. The plan also
provided that drug law enforcement research that had been
hitherto funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration
would be transferred to DEA. </p>

<p>While the 1973 reorganization plan reaffirmed the jurisdiction
of the Bureau of Customs to conduct investigative, intelligence,
and law enforcement functions relating to the suppression of drug
trafficking at ports of entry and borders, it prohibited Customs
from exercising those functions, as it had been previously
authorized to do, at locations away from ports of entry or
borders. In addition, drugs, evidence, and persons seized by
customs agents at ports of entry or borders were to be turned
over to representatives of the Attorney General. The plan
explicitly provided that the Department of Justice, in addition
to Customs, could perform law enforcement functions, including
those relating to illicit drug trafficking, at the Nation's ports
of entry and borders. Finally, the plan required the Attorney
General to assure the maximum cooperation between and among DEA,
the FBI, and other units of the Justice Department to achieve
coordination of all of his drug law enforcement functions. </p>

<p>Once established, DEA played an &quot;increasingly crucial
role in the coordination of Federal drug law enforcement; and
during the 1970's a number of interagency efforts were
launched.&quot; Among the coordination efforts undertaken by DEA
was the development of mechanisms to provide timely and accurate
narcotics intelligence to drug law enforcement personnel at the
Federal, State and local levels. Steps taken by DEA in this area
included the establishment of: </p>

<p>(1) An Office of Intelligence at DEA headquarters which,
organizationally, was at the same level as its Office of
Enforcement; </p>

<p>(2) Regional Intelligence Units (RIUs) in each of the DEA
regions; </p>

<p>(3) The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) in 1974 as a border
intelligence unit, which soon grew into a
&quot;twenty-four-hour-a-day intelligence center, with worldwide
capabilities to collect, process, and disseminate information
concerning illicit drug trafficking as the smuggling of aliens
and weapons; EPIC is staffed by personnel from DFA, INS, Customs,
the Coast Guard, BATF, FAA, the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI and
IRS; </p>

<p>(4) The Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System
(NADDIS) and the System to Retrieve Information from Drug
Evidence (STRIDE) to provide access to numerous investigative
records of PEA and other Federal, State and local drug
enforcement records; </p>

<p>(5) In April of 1978, the National Narcotics Intelligence
Consumers Committee (NNICC), chaired by the DEA Deputy Assistant
Administrator for Intelligence and including representatives from
the Departments of Defense, Treasury and State, and their
component agencies in the field, including Customs, the Coast
Guard, FBI, INS, IRS, and NIDA to coordinate the collection,
analysis, dissemination and evaluation of drug-related
intelligence, both foreign and domestic, and to publish annually
a &quot;National Intelligence Estimate on the Supply of Drugs to
the U.S. Illicit Market from Foreign and Domestic Sources.&quot; </p>

<p>In addition to trying to improve the intelligence gathering
and dissemination functions of Federal drug law enforcement, PEA
attempted to improve the task force concept in drug law
enforcement which it had inherited from ODALE. In 1974 DEA
adopted the Central Tactical Units (CENTAC) program to focus
enforcement resources on conspiracy investigations of high-level
drug trafficking targets. Unfettered by normal DEA regional
operations, centrally administered, specially funded, staffed by
personnel from DEA, IRS, Customs, and State and local agencies,
and charged with pursuing conspiracy cases under the Continuing
Criminal Enterprise (CCE) and RICO statutes, the CENTAC program
did produce relatively high arrest and conviction rates of high
level traffickers, and accounted for 12 percent of DEA arrests
from 1976 to 1979 while using less than three percent of DEA
personnel. Although criticizing the CENTAC Program for not
exploiting the Federal forfeiture statutes to seize the assets of
convicted traffickers, the General Accounting office (GAO)
nevertheless concluded that: </p>

<p>Given the success of the Central Tactical units and the need
for more multi-regional conspiracy investigations, the expansion
of the [CENTAC] program is warranted. </p>

<p>GAO recommended expansion of the CENTAC program despite an
earlier conclusion that the CENTAC efforts had not
&quot;achieve[d] the overall objective - complete immobilization
of the targeted trafficking organizations.&quot; The 1980 GAO
report also conflicted with: </p>

<p>DEA officials who said the current size of the CENTAC program
is optimum given existing enforcement resources, required
commitments, and their preference for regionally controlled
investigations . . . . </p>

<p>Another effort at interagency operational cooperation during
the decade of the 1970's was the creation of three FBI-DEA forces
in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles to &quot;test the
feasibility of joint operations.&quot; These task forces were
designed to combine the FBI's organized crime and conspiracy
cases expertise with DEA's experience in narcotics
investigations. This effort was probably doomed from the start
because, although each agency was supposed to coordinate with the
other, each used its own investigative techniques, personnel, and
information sources and each maintained jurisdictional autonomy.
After two years, the program was in effect disbanded, and
evaluations by GAO and others attributed the failure to
disagreements over investigative techniques and to restrictions
on case selection. </p>

<p>The creation of DEA by the 1973 reorganization plan and DEA's
subsequent development of new supply reduction approaches were
not the only steps undertaken and designed during the 1970's to
respond to what many had come to view as the almost intractable
national drug problem. For example, Congress passed the Narcotic
Addict Treatment Act of 1974, which amended the 1970 Controlled
Substances Act to require annual registration by practitioners
dispensing narcotic drugs, including methadone, for maintenance
or detoxification purposes. This legislation, which imposed
standards for the legal dispensing of drugs, was deemed necessary
because of the increased diversion of methadone for illegal sale
and use. </p>

<p>That year also saw the passage of the Alcohol and Drug Abuse
Education Act Amendments of 1974, which extended the grant and
contract authorities of the Drug Abuse Education Act of 1970 for
three years and authorized the expenditure of $90 million over
those three years. The Act placed greater emphasis on the need
for prevention and early intervention programs, recognizing the
crucial role of family, peer group, school, church and other
community institutions in influencing young people's behavior. </p>

<p>In enacting the 1974 Alcohol and Drug Abuse Education Act
Amendments, Congress noted that most of the previously adopted
Federal programs to reduce demand had &quot;inevitably been
directed primarily toward the person who is already in serious
trouble with alcohol and/or drugs,&quot; but that the focus of
the Drug Abuse Education Act of 1970 had been different in that
it was directed to those who had not yet experimented with drugs
or to those who had just begun to do so. In passing the 1974
amendments Congress applauded the focus on prevention,
reaffirming the philosophy that had suffused the 1970 Education
Act: </p>

<p>[R]eal progress in the struggle against alcohol and drug abuse
will require an intensified effort to reach that far more
numerous group, those millions of young people who may be tempted
to experiment with dangerous drugs or who may have already done
so. </p>

<p>Although committed to the continuation of Federal support for
local drug education programs, Congress was nevertheless critical
of those educational programs that were based upon information
that was incomplete, erroneous, or designed to frighten, and
those based on accurate information that had the tendency to
arouse interest in drugs and to lead to experimentation, Before
passing the 1974 Amendments Congress received assurances from the
Office of Education within the Department of HEW that it would
make every effort to support only those programs which would
&quot;incorporate factual material about drugs into programs
which focus on the causes of drug use and emphasize the
development of appropriate attitudes and values,&quot; rather
than merely inform and arouse interest. </p>

<p>The Nixon Administration opposed passage of the bill that
eventually became the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Education Act
Amendments of 1974 because it believed that &quot;alcohol and
drug abuse education [should] be included among the special
projects to be funded under other education legislation and that
alcoholism and drug abuse formula grant funds to the states
[should] be considered the major source of funds for local
alcohol and drug abuse education programs.&quot; Congress
disagreed with the Administration's position concerning
categorical legislation relating to prevention and early
intervention educational programs, stating that: </p>

<p>Failure to renew a clear legislative mandate to the Office of
Education would destroy the identity of the program at both the
Federal and the State level and would cast the alcohol and drug
education programs in the role of supplicants to those agencies
whose primary concern is not education and who are already
besieged by the demands of treatment programs. </p>

<p>The ultimate result would be either the disappearance of
community drug and alcohol education programs or a reversion to
some of the futile and dangerous efforts of the past. . . </p>

<p>As noted earlier, the 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act provided that
SAODAP would be abolished on June 30, 1975, with no assignment of
its policy-making and coordinative functions to any other Federal
agency. On March 19, 1976, however, legislation was approved that
in effect continued SAODAP, but under the slightly different name
of &quot;Office of Drug Abuse Policy&quot; (ODAP). Congress
created ODAP because: </p>

<p>[T]here is current evidence that whatever improvement in the
problem occurred in 1973 was temporary and that the present
problem is at least as great as at the time the original act was
passed. </p>

<p>In approving the continuation of an executive level drug
advisor, Congress found that &quot;drug abuse was not a crisis
which could be rapidly solved but rather a continuing problem
calling for a continued Federal responsibility.&quot; Congress
also concluded that Federal expenditures for drug abuse
prevention efforts had peaked in 1974 and then declined, despite
continuing serious problems, due to, among other things, the
anticipated end of SAODAP: </p>

<p>It would also appear that the existence of a high-level office
in the executive branch is to some extent correlated with the
fiscal emphasis provided to drug abuse prevention efforts. </p>

<p>Congress was also somewhat concerned that &quot;unless some
active direction is taken at some high level it is probable that
in the very near future funding for drug law enforcement will
again overbalance funding for drug abuse prevention.&quot; </p>

<p>In creating ODAP Congress required its Director to make
recommendations to the President regarding the policies and
priorities for, and objectives of, all Federal &quot;drug abuse
functions,&quot; a term which was defined to encompass both drug
abuse prevention and drug traffic prevention functions, and to
coordinate the performance of such functions by Federal
departments and agencies. This was a significant expansion of the
authority of ODAP's predecessor, SAODAP. </p>

<p>Despite the Ford Administration's opposition to the
continuation of an executive-level office relating to drug abuse
prevention, President Ford did not veto the 1976 amendment
creating ODAP. However, President Ford did not staff ODAP, even
though a specific line-item authorization had been made for it.
DAP did not come into being until President Carter issued a
memorandum initiating the Office on March 14, 1977. Less than two
months after the Senate confirmation of the ODAP Director,
President Carter submitted a reorganization plan restructuring
the Executive Office of the President to Congress on July 15,
1977. </p>

<p>The 1977 reorganization plan altered the structure of the
Executive Office of the President, which at the time consisted of
the immediate White House Office, the Vice President's Office,
OMB, and 14 other agencies, including ODAP and the Domestic
Council. As proposed, the plan, among other things, abolished the
Domestic Council and ODAP and redesignated the Domestic Council
Staff as the Domestic Policy Staff. The functions of ODAP and its
Director would be transferred to the President who could then
delegate such functions. </p>

<p>Several members of Congress, recalling that it was the need
for a high-level policy and coordinating office to oversee the
activities of more than 20 Federal agencies with significant drug
abuse responsibilities that had given birth to the SAODAP/ODAP
program, expressed grave concern about the abolishment of ODAP.
President Carter assured them that the ODAP's functions would be
carried on within the Executive office of the President and that
the Domestic Policy Staff, with several of its staff members
assigned exclusively to drug abuse issues, would handle ODAP's
policy-making and coordinative functions. With Congressional
acquiescence, the 1977 Reorganization became effective on March
26, 1978, at which time a core group of ODAP staff was
transferred to the Domestic Policy Staff. </p>

<p>Although Congress did not block the provisions of the 1977
reorganization plan, members of Congress nevertheless remained
unsure whether drug abuse policy-making and coordinative
functions could be or would be adequately performed by the
Domestic Policy Staff. This uncertainty was reflected in the Drug
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Amendments of 1978, which extended
the authorization for NIDA programs for only one year, instead of
the previous multi-year reauthorizations, so that it could
evaluate the system created by the 1977 reorganization plan after
a relatively brief but adequate period of time. </p>

<p>The Congressional evaluation of the operations of the drug
abuse policy and coordinating system in the Executive Office of
the President was embodied the next year in the Drug Abuse
Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Amendments of 1979.
During the consideration of this legislation, President Carter
assigned the Associate Director for Drug Policy of the Domestic
Policy Staff the responsibility for assisting the President in
performing the functions of ODAP, which had been transferred to
the President by the 1977 reorganization plan. President Carter
took this step because of Congressional concern that: </p>

<p>[T]he continued coordination of drug abuse policy, required by
the 1972 Act and its subsequent amendments, became dependent upon
the continued interest . . . of the President and other
individuals within the Executive Branch, rather than being
clearly structured by statute as had been the case prior to the
implementation of the Reorganization Plan. </p>

<p>Because of the steps taken by the Carter Administration
including the revitalization of the Strategy Council, Congress
responded by legislating what the 1977 reorganization plan had
done. </p>

<p>In addition to giving its imprimatur to the 1977
reorganization plan, the 1979 legislation made authorizations for
NIDA's state formula grants and special grant and contract
programs for drug education and prevention through September 30,
1981. It did so because it found that the &quot;growing extent of
drug abuse indicates an urgent need for prevention and
intervention programs designed to reach the general
population.&quot; In providing for a two-year reauthorization for
NIDA programs and activities, Congress rejected the Carter
Administration's proposal that state formula grants for drug
abuse be consolidated with those for alcoholism and mental health
because: </p>

<p>There is considerable history to suggest that earmarked
funding for categorical programs should remain separate at the
State level as well as at the national level. Within the
traditional health care delivery system, the drug and alcohol
client has not fared well. To force these systems to compete
again is to seriously jeopardize the major strides which have
been made . . . . The Committee insists that a categorical
emphasis on drug abuse must be maintained at all levels of
government. A loss of direct program emphasis would severely harm
the state focus on combatting drug abuse, and could seriously
endanger the Nation's battle against drug abuse. </p>

<p>The decade of the 1970's was an important one in the evolution
of the Federal drug abuse effort. It began with a comprehensive
restructuring of Federal laws relating to drugs and included a
major reorganization of Federal drug law enforcement agencies in
a effort to reduce interagency rivalries and to promote
efficiency and leadership in the fight against drug trafficking.
Equally important was the recognition that strategies to reduce
demand must be an essential component of the overall drug abuse
policy and that the nation's drug abuse problem could not be
regarded as a crisis susceptible to quick resolution. In
addition, new laws were passed to respond to particular aspects
of the drug problem, and new enforcement approaches were tried in
an effort to disrupt drug trafficking more effectively. </p>

<p>On a less positive note, disagreements over certain
fundamental issues remained unresolved at the end of the 1970's.
Among these were the role of the Federal Government in drug
policy and the appropriate balance between strategies to reduce
demand and supply. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, despite
legislation, massive reorganizations, new enforcement techniques,
and necessary attitudinal changes, the problems of drug abuse and
trafficking continued at high levels at the end of the decade. </p>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter IV </h2>

<h2>Part 2: Federal Drug Abuse Policy: 1981-Present </h2>

<p>Early in his administration President Ronald Reagan
acknowledged that drug abuse was &quot;one of the gravest
problems facing us&quot; as a Nation. The Reagan Administration
has taken many steps designed to improve the effectiveness of the
U.S. overall drug abuse policy. </p>

<p>Reorganization/Coordination </p>

<p>On January 21, 1982, in a major policy shift, the FBI was
given concurrent jurisdiction with DEA for drug law enforcement
and investigation. In addition, the Administrator of DEA was
required to report to the Director of the FBI who was given the
responsibility for supervising generally drug law enforcement
efforts and policies. </p>

<p>In giving the FBI concurrent jurisdiction for enforcement of
U.S. drug laws, the Attorney General followed the recommendation
of a committee that he had established to study the need for
increased coordination of DEA and the FBI in the drug field. This
committee was headed by then Associate Attorney General Rudolph
W. Giuliani. According to Giuliani, the Attorney General's
committee recommended concurrent jurisdiction because: </p>

<p>[W]e believe we can more effectively deal with the large-scale
trafficking groups by coordinating DEA's street-level, undercover
expertise with the FBI's ability to combat large criminal
enterprises. The FBI's 20-year experience in combatting organized
crime will also prove critical to drug enforcement. </p>

<p>Although FBI expertise in organized crime and financial
investigations would be available in drug enforcement work as a
result of concurrent jurisdiction, DEA would continue to function
as a &quot;single-mission narcotics enforcement agency&quot; that
would &quot;give the drug problem the kind of focus it
needs.&quot; </p>

<p>In another action relating to the coordination of Federal drug
abuse efforts, President Reagan issued an executive order on June
24, 1982, directing the office of Policy Development to assist
the President in performing his duties under the Drug Abuse
Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act; designating the
Director of the Drug Abuse Policy Office within the Office of
Policy Development as primarily responsible for coordinating,
overseeing, and policy-making for all Executive international and
domestic drug abuse functions; and making the Director directly
responsible for the activities of a drug policy staff within the
office of Policy Development. </p>

<p>Despite President Reagan's stated commitment to the
performance of the functions imposed upon him by the Drug Abuse
Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act, Congress became
increasingly dissatisfied with a perceived lack of coordination
of such functions. This dissatisfaction became embodied in an
Omnibus Crime Bill (H.R. 3963) which included a provision to
establish an Office of Director of National and International
Drug Operations and Policy, which was described as follows: </p>

<p>Similar in concept to SAODAP, the proposed agency would have
been charged with the overall planning and coordination of
Federal efforts to control the supply of dangerous drugs. </p>

<p>Unlike SAODAP, which had been directed by Congress to
coordinate Federal drug abuse prevention efforts, and unlike
ODAP, which was enjoined to oversee all Federal drug abuse
programs, the proposed Office of Director of National and
International Drug Operations and Policy was envisioned as a
mechanism for coordinating and directing Federal law enforcement
operations. </p>

<p>While the President was considering the merits of H.R. 3963,
an Administration spokesman criticized that portion of the bill
creating the Office of Director of National and International
Drug Operations and Policy: </p>

<p>If the czar . . . is to have the power to direct the drug
enforcement operations of other Cabinet officers, the very nature
of our Cabinet system of government would be drastically altered.
If he is not to have such power, he could do little more than
interfere with the existing mechanisms, which have been working
well. </p>

<p>Two days after this statement appeared, President Reagan
pocket-vetoed H.R. 3963 and issued a memorandum of disapproval
explaining his action: </p>

<p>The creation of another layer of bureaucracy within the
Executive Branch would produce friction, disrupt effective law
enforcement, and could threaten the integrity of criminal
investigations and prosecutions . . . . </p>

<p>The seriousness of this threat is underscored by the
overwhelming opposition to this provision by the Federal law
enforcement community as well as by such groups as the
International Association of Chiefs of Police and the National
Association of Attorney's General. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>The war on crime and drugs does not need more bureaucracy in
Washington. It does need more action in the field, and that is
where my Administration will focus its efforts. </p>

<p>Members of Congress were not easily dissuaded from their
efforts to achieve a greater degree of coordination of the
Federal drug abuse efforts. On February 7, 1984, the Senate
passed a proposed National Narcotics Act of 1984 (S. 1787),
which, among other things, would have established a cabinet-level
office of National and International Drug Operation and Policy.
Under the bill the Director of the Office was authorized to:
develop, review, implement, and enforce U.S. policy concerning
illegal drugs; coordinate all U.S. efforts to halt drug
trafficking into and within the United States; develop, in
concert with the Federal entities concerned with drug control,
budgetary priorities and allocations; and coordinate the
collection and disseminate of narcotics intelligence. </p>

<p>In recommending that S. 1787 be passed, the Senate Judiciary
Committee acknowledged that the Reagan Administration had
undertaken a number of &quot;promising initiatives&quot; in drug
law enforcement. However, the Committee concluded that an Office
of National and International Drug Operations and Policy was
necessary because: </p>

<p>[T]he Committee believes the Administration's anti-drug effort
falls short in one crucial respect: the lack of central
direction. </p>

<p>At least 15 Federal agencies play a role in the regulation of
commerce in dangerous drugs or in the enforcement of other
restrictions . . . . These agencies are located in six different
departments. Under such circumstances, it is inevitable that
divergences as to priorities will arise and that there will be
conflicting interpretations of national policy. Indeed, national
policy in such an area as drug law enforcement must be
continually reevaluated and reformulated; a one-time annual
review and the publication of a broadly-worded strategy does not
suffice. </p>

<p>The Committee also described in some detail the role it
envisioned for the proposed Office: </p>

<p>SOADAP was the same kind of &quot;overlord&quot; agency as the
one contemplated by S. 1787. However, it was flawed from the
beginning in that its effective jurisdiction was limited to
activities aimed at the control of drug demand; it was not given
authority of any substance in the law enforcement field. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>The Committee bill draws from the SAODAP concept, but focuses
on the aspects of drug control that were excluded from the former
agency's purview, i.e., the government's efforts to control the
supply of abused drugs. It is in the area of supply control, be
it in foreign or domestic programs, that the Committee perceives
the greatest current need for central direction. </p>

<p>In recommending the establishment of an office to which the
Reagan Administration appeared to be implacably opposed, the
Senate Judiciary Committee took pains to observe that the
Director of the Drug Abuse Policy office was not capable of
performing the necessary coordinative functions concerning
Federal drug law enforcement efforts: </p>

<p>[U]nder questioning by several Congressmen [of the House
Subcommittee on Crime at a February 17, 1983, hearing on the
coordination of drug enforcement efforts] it became clear that
the director does not have the authority or stature to oversee
the implementation of the Federal strategy. </p>

<p>Anxious to reassure the Administration about the proposed
cabinet-level Office, the Committee made it clear that, in
implementing the legislation, the President would have a great
deal of flexibility; for example, the Office would not have to be
established in the Executive office of the President, and the
Attorney General could be appointed the Director of the central
drug agency. However, the Committee was insistent that the
Director have something like a cabinet-level status because such
status was deemed &quot;necessary if the office is to have the
influence needed to impose a truce on interagency feuding, to
insure maximum participation, and to allocate budgetary resources
for top efficiency and economy.&quot; </p>

<p>Despite the Administration's opposition, the Senate passed S.
1787. However, Congressional conferees compromised and
substituted a National Drug Enforcement Policy Board for the
Office of National and International Drug Operations and Policy
as the means for achieving greater coordination of Federal drug
law enforcement efforts. Both the House and Senate agreed to the
Conference Report, and Public Law No. 98-473 was thereafter
approved on October 12, 1984. Title II of this law was entitled
the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, and Chapter XIII of
that title was designated the National Narcotics Act of 1984. </p>

<p>Congress established the National Drug Enforcement Policy
Board (Policy Board) because it found that drug trafficking was
estimated to be an $80 billion a year industry; only 5 to 15
percent of the drugs imported into the country were interdicted;
and controlling the supply of drugs was thought to be a key to
reducing the drug-related crime epidemic. The Policy Board,
chaired by the Attorney General, was and is charged with
facilitating coordination of U.S. operations and policy
concerning illegal law enforcement. As Chairman of the Policy
Board, the Attorney General was given many duties, including
advising the Policy Board concerning drug law enforcement and
acting as primary advisor to the President and Congress on
Board-developed programs. The Act, however, declares that nothing
therein authorizes the Board or its Chairman to interfere with
routine law enforcement or intelligence decisions of any agency.
Finally, the National Narcotics Act of 1984 amended the Drug
Abuse Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act to declare
that one of the duties of the White House Office of Drug Abuse
Policy Board was to insure coordination between the Policy Board
and health issues associated with drug abuse. </p>

<p>The creation of the Policy Board in January 1985 represents
only the latest compromise between the President and Congress in
the ongoing search for more effective coordination of all facets
of the Federal drug abuse effort. It remains to be seen whether
an entity like the Policy Board can effectively oversee, police,
and coordinate all Federal law enforcement efforts and whether
some other mechanism is needed to impose coordination of Federal
demand reduction and supply reduction strategies. </p>

<p>Legislative Responses to the Drug Problem </p>

<p>In addition to the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984,
other important legislative initiatives have been adopted in
recent years. For example, the Department of Defense
Authorization Act of 1982 contained a provision, &quot;Military
Cooperation With Civilian Law Enforcement Officials,&quot; which
was intended to codify the practices of cooperation that had
developed between military and civilian law enforcement
authorities. The Act was also designed to improve the level of
cooperation by delineating precisely that assistance which
military commanders could provide and by permitting military
personnel to operate military equipment that had been lent to
civilian drug enforcement agencies. This legislation was deemed
necessary for the following reasons: </p>

<p>The rising tide of drugs being smuggled into the United States
by land, sea, and air presents a grave threat to all Americans. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>Only through the dedicated work of all of Federal, State, and
local law enforcement agencies can we begin to stem this tide. In
fighting this battle, it is important to maximize the degree of
cooperation between the military and civilian law enforcement. At
the same time, we must recognize the need to maintain the
traditional balance of authority between civilians and the
military. </p>

<p>The most important and innovative part of the legislation was
Section 374, which permits the Secretary of Defense to assign
Department personnel to operate and maintain military equipment
that had been made available to an agency with jurisdiction to
enforce the Controlled Substances Act. This relatively simple
change increased geometrically the potential interdiction
capability of Federal drug law enforcement agencies. </p>

<p>The year 1984 was a prolific one for legislation dealing with
discrete areas in drug law enforcement. The Controlled Substance
Registrant Protection Act of 1984 made it illegal, among other
things, to steal any quantity of a controlled substance from a
registrant. Congress also directed the Attorney General,
notwithstanding the scheduling provisions of the Controlled
Substances Act, to transfer methaqualone, commonly known by the
brand name Quaalude, from Schedule II to Schedule I, with the
effect of making the prescription of methaqualone unlawful
because it no longer had an approved medical use. While remaining
committed to the proposition that scheduling of controlled
substances ordinarily should be handled in accordance with the
administrative procedures mandated by the Controlled Substances
Act, Congress took this legislative action after determining that
circumstances required it to do so and that the adverse effects
of the diversion of methaqualone outweighed its therapeutic
usefulness. </p>

<p>Congress also passed the Aviation Drug-Trafficking Control
Act, which amended the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, to, among
other things, require the Administrator of the FAA to revoke
airman certificates and aircraft registrations of those convicted
of violating any Federal or State law relating to controlled
substances, except where the violations involved possession
offenses. The Act also made it illegal for any person to serve as
an airman without an airman's certificate in connection with a
transportation that constitutes a Federal or State drug felony
offense. </p>

<p>Although the Controlled Substance Registrant Protection Act of
1984, the Aviation Drug-Trafficking Control Act, and the
Congressional rescheduling of methaqualone were necessary laws,
by far the most important drug law enforcement measures passed in
1984 were contained in several provisions of the Comprehensive
Crime Control Act of 1984. The Act included: </p>

<p>(i) Bail Reform Act of 1984: This Act comprises many sections,
but the most important and most controversial was that codified
in 18 U.S.C. Section 3142. Section 3142 provides that when a
person charged with an offense appears before a judicial officer,
the judicial officer must order that, pending trial, the accused
be released on personal recognizance or upon execution of an
unsecured appearance bond; released upon certain listed
conditions; temporarily detained to permit exclusion or
deportation if not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident;
temporarily detained to permit revocation of a prior conditional
release; or detained. The preventive detention provision states
that the judicial officer must hold a hearing in any case
involving a narcotics offense for which imprisonment for ten or
more years is prescribed to determine whether any conditions will
assure the accused's appearance and the safety of any other
person and of the community. In any such hearing the accused must
prove that there are conditions that will assure his appearance
or the community's safety, if the judicial officer finds that
there is probable cause to believe that the person committed the
offense. </p>

<p>(ii) Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984: This legislation
made extensive revisions to Federal civil and criminal forfeiture
laws and procedures, which had targeted the assets of
racketeering and drug trafficking organizations: </p>

<p>Today few in the Congress or the law enforcement community
fail to recognize that the traditional criminal sanctions of fine
and imprisonment are inadequate to deter or punish the enormously
profitable trade in dangerous drugs . . . . Clearly, if law
enforcement efforts to combat racketeering and drug trafficking
are to be successful, they must include an attack on the economic
aspects of these crimes. Forfeiture is the mechanism through
which such an attack may be made. </p>

<p>This 1984 legislation was designed to eliminate limitations
and ambiguities that had &quot;significantly impeded the full
realization of forfeiture's potential as a powerful law
enforcement weapon.&quot; </p>

<p>With respect to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, the 1984 Comprehensive Forfeiture Act did
several things, including confirming the Supreme Court's decision
in Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16(1983) that a
defendant's ill-gotten profits from racketeering were
forfeitable; defining the property subject to forfeiture to
include real property; making the relation back doctrine, i.e.,
U.S. interest in forfeitable property arises at the time of the
commission of the act that gives rise to the forfeiture,
applicable in criminal forfeiture proceedings; and expanding
post-indictment prior restraining order authority to preserve the
availability of forfeiture assets by making an indictment
sufficient to establish conclusively probable cause that the
property will be forfeited. </p>

<p>The Comprehensive Forfeiture Act also amended the 1970
Comprehensive Act. With respect to criminal forfeiture, the 1984
Act added a new provision to the 1970 act that is applicable to
all felony drug offenses, including the Continuing Criminal
Enterprise offense. In virtually all respects, the drug criminal
forfeiture provisions are now identical to those of the amended
RICO statute. The new drug criminal forfeiture provision also
creates a rebuttable presumption that any property of a person
convicted of a drug felony is subject to forfeiture if the
government establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that
the defendant acquired the property during the period of
violation, or within a reasonably short period thereafter, and
there was no likely source for the property other than the
violation. </p>

<p>(iii) Controlled Substances Penalties Amendments Act of 1984.
This legislation generally enhanced the penalties for violations
of the Controlled Substances Act. Specifically, it provided a
20-year prison term and a $250,000 fine for violations involving
specified large amounts of Schedule I and II narcotic drugs, PCP
and LSD; raised the fine for violations involving all Schedule I
or II substances and enhanced the fines for violations involving
Schedule III, IV, and V substances. With respect to all doubling
provisions for recidivists in the Controlled Substances Act, the
1984 legislation removed an ambiguity in the existing law by
providing that a State drug felony conviction would trigger the
provisions; it went further by providing that a Foreign drug
felony conviction would have the same effect. Finally, the 1984
legislation provided that anyone who distributed controlled
substances on or within 1,000 feet of school property could be
subjected to a prison term or fine or both up to twice what is
otherwise provided. </p>

<p>(iv) Dangerous Drug Diversion Control Act of 1984. This
legislation &quot;represent[ed] the first major updating of the
regulatory provisions of the Controlled Substances Act and the
Controlled Substances Import and Export Act since their enactment
in 1970.&quot; In doing so, the 1984 amendments focused
principally on diversion of drugs of legitimate origin into the
illicit market and the manufacture and abuse of new drugs, such
as controlled substance analogs. With respect to the problem of
diversion, which Congress had attempted to address in the 1970
Comprehensive Act by creating a closed system, the legislative
history states: </p>

<p>Diversion of legally produced drugs into illicit channels is a
major part of the drug abuse problem in the United States. It is
estimated that between 60 and 70 percent of all drug-related
deaths and injuries involve drugs that were originally part of
the legitimate drug production and distribution chain. Also,
diversion of legally produced drugs often evidences the same sort
of large-scale trafficking more commonly associated with the
trade in wholly illicit drugs. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>Unfortunately, experience under the [CSA] over the past decade
has demonstrated that the strong regulatory authority to maintain
a &quot;closed&quot; distribution chain does not exist at the
practitioner level. Yet, it is estimated that 80 to 90 percent of
all current diversion occurs at this level. </p>

<p>In response to this diversion problem, Congress amended the
Controlled Substances Act to, among other things, permit the
Attorney General to deny registration to practitioners if such
registration would be inconsistent with the public interest,
authorize the Attorney General to suspend or revoke a
registration upon the recommendation of a competent state
authority or if the public interest requires it; and authorize
the Attorney General to make grants to State and local
governments in connection with those governments' anti-diversion
programs. </p>

<p>With respect to the problem of the manufacture and abuse of
new drugs, Congress found that: </p>

<p>[T]he procedural requirements for controlling a drug under 21
U.S.C. 811 have proven sufficiently time consuming that they
preclude a swift response when an as yet uncontrolled drug
rapidly enters the illicit market and creates a significant
health problem. </p>

<p>As a result of the Dangerous Drug Diversion Control Act of
1984, Congress gave the Attorney General emergency scheduling
authority. Under that authority, the Attorney General is
permitted to schedule a drug in Schedule I on a temporary basis,
for up to one year, if he determines that such action is
&quot;necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public
safety.&quot; In making this determination, the Attorney General
need only consider the history and current pattern of abuse, the
scope, duration, and significance of abuse, and the nature of the
risk, if any, to the public health. The temporary scheduling may
be extended for up to six months while a rule-making proceeding
is conducted for the purpose of permanently scheduling the drug.
Such a temporary scheduling order is not subject to judicial
review. </p>

<p>(v) Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act
Amendments: &quot;Without the means to launder money, thereby
making cash generated by a criminal enterprise appear to come
from a legitimate source, organized crime could not flourish as
it now does.&quot; The 1984 amendments of the Currency and
Foreign Transactions Reporting Act were designed to &quot;fine
tune the [then] current currency reporting law.&quot; One of the
changes adopted increased the civil penalty for violating the
records and reporting requirements of the Act from $1,000 to
$10,000 for each violation and the criminal penalty from $1,000
and 1 year in prison to $250,000 and 5 years imprisonment. These
changes were deemed necessary because: </p>

<p>[I]t is important to recognize that [the requirements] are
primarily directed at persons who make a lucrative career in the
illicit drug trade and organized crime. As such, the penalties
are far too low to deter and punish such activity. Indeed, the
modest penalties now applicable may simply be written off as a
cost of doing business. </p>

<p>The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 was intended to,
and did in fact, provide Federal law enforcement agents with
better tools for combatting drug traffickers. However, it is
still too early to evaluate how these tools have been used. </p>

<p>Important legislation in the field of drug abuse since 1981
has not been restricted only to matters relating to improving
drug law enforcement. As noted previously, Congress in 1979
rejected President Carter's proposal that NIDA's State formula
grants for drug abuse programs be consolidated with those for
alcoholism and mental health. Instead it reauthorized the drug
formula grants through September 30, 1981. In passing the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Congress reversed itself and
fundamentally changed the role that the Federal Government plays
in overseeing and funding of drug abuse prevention, treatment and
rehabilitation programs by creating an Alcohol and Drug Abuse and
Mental Health Service Block Grant (ADMS Block Grant). The new
program was designed to distribute the Federal money that had
previously been provided to the States through formula and
project grants and contracts. </p>

<p>One of the principal motivations for adopting the block grant
approach was the belief that the States were in the best position
to determine the most efficacious use of Federal funds: </p>

<p>The ADMS Block . . . [was] established in 1981 to provide
State and local governments greater flexibility and
decision-making authority in focusing Federal, State, and local
resources on needs and priorities they know best and in ways they
believe are best suited to local conditions. Block grants were
also intended to eliminate duplication and overlapping of
services and allow States to better integrate and coordinate
services funded by several levels of government. </p>

<p>In addition to establishing the ADMS Block Grant, the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act specified how the States were to spend
their allotment. Although requiring the States to file reports
with information permitting the Secretary of Health and Human
Services to determine whether the Federal funds provided were
expended in conformity with the objectives of the block grant,
the Act also directed the Secretary not to impose burdensome
reporting requirements. The reporting requirements concerning the
block grant imposed by the Secretary were much less extensive
than those existing under the categorical programs that existed
prior to the adoption of the block grant approach. </p>

<p>The impact of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act has been
estimated: Since the establishment of the ADMS Block Grant, the
amount of Federal money going to State drug abuse prevention and
treatment programs has declined by approximately 40 percent. It
is not possible, however, to determine what the impact of this
reduction has been because a portion, perhaps significant, of the
reduction represents savings due to the elimination of overhead
administrative costs. </p>

<p>Law Enforcement and Executive Responses to the Drug Problem. </p>

<p>Recognizing that drug abuse and drug trafficking are serious
national problems, which also pose a threat to national security,
the Reagan Administration has taken steps since 1981 that have
been designed to improve Federal law enforcement efforts against
drug traffickers. </p>

<p>Narcotics intelligence is essential to any drug law
enforcement program. In that regard, on December 4, 1981,
President Reagan issued an executive order, entitled &quot;United
States Intelligence Activities,&quot; which was intended to
&quot;control and provide direction and guidance to the
Intelligence Community.&quot; Among the executive order's
provisions relating to drugs, one authorizes agencies within the
U.S. Intelligence Community to participate in law enforcement
activities to investigate or prevent international narcotics
activities and to render assistance and cooperation to law
enforcement authorities not otherwise precluded by law. In
addition, agencies within the Intelligence Community are
authorized to collect, retain, or disseminate information
concerning U.S. persons obtained during the course of a lawful
international narcotics investigation or incidentally obtained
information indicating involvement in activities that may violate
federal, state, local or foreign laws. Finally, the Executive
Order directs that all departments and agencies involved in the
U.S. intelligence effort shall cooperate to provide the President
and the National Security Council with information on which to
base decisions concerning the conduct and development of foreign,
defense, and economic policy and the protection of U.S. national
interests. </p>

<p>Whether the U.S. Intelligence Community has played or will
play the important role in the Nation's anti-drug effort
envisioned for it by Executive Order 12333 depends upon the
commitment of its constituent departments and agencies to
eliminating this threat to national security. The Executive Order
was an important event because it represented recognition at the
highest level of the Executive Branch that, without accurate and
adequate strategic, operational, and tactical narcotics
intelligence, the Federal drug trafficking prevention effort
would be seriously crippled. </p>

<p>During 1981 the deleterious effect of drug trafficking on the
quality of life in Florida, and especially in South Florida, had
become so great that the State's citizens demanded prompt and
effective responses by government at all levels. At the Federal
level, President Reagan established on January 28, 1982, a
cabinet-level South Florida Task Force, also known as Operation
Florida, which was chaired by Vice President Bush, to
&quot;assist and coordinate Federal efforts with those of State
and local authorities in order to reduce crime&quot; and which
was patterned after previous multi-agency efforts, such as the
CENTAC program. The South Florida Task Force was intended to be a
&quot;broad, multifaceted anti-crime program,&quot; but its focus
was on interdiction and the arrest and prosecution of drug
smugglers. Assistance to the South Florida Task Force, which
became operational on March 15, 1982, was provided by DEA,
Customs, FBI, BATF, the Marshals Service, the Coast Guard, and
the Department of Defense. </p>

<p>One of the more significant features of the South Florida Task
Force was the creation of the South Florida Joint Task Group,
which consisted of DEA and Customs personnel and which was
charged with conducting follow-up investigations of drug
interdictions. In authorizing Customs agents to conduct such
investigations under the supervision of DEA on March 20, 1982,
the Attorney General modified, albeit slightly, the structure of
Federal drug enforcement that had been established by President
Nixon's 1973 reorganization plan. That plan had prohibited
Customs agents from exercising investigative, intelligence, and
law enforcement functions at locations away from ports of entry
or borders. This action was in effect a recognition, long
overdue, that it was necessary, if law enforcement efforts
against drug trafficking were to be improved, for Customs'
intelligence and investigative functions to be expanded. </p>

<p>Operations Greenback and Florida were successful in that they
forced traffickers to reduce their activities in Florida.
However, the increased law enforcement pressure, as had happened
so many times in the past, resulted in the traffickers diverting
drug smuggling to Gulf and Eastern ports of entry and their money
laundering activities to New York and the California-Mexico area.
The successes achieved by the Florida multiagency operations thus
exacerbated an already serious nationwide drug problem, but they
also provided a model for responding to that problem. In 1982 the
Attorney General appointed a committee to develop new approaches
to the drug trafficking problem. The Committee concluded that
&quot;no single agency could cope with the problem&quot; and that
&quot;many previous cooperative ventures, although limited in
scope by comparison, provided the promise that agencies can
cooperate and . . . only full-scale teamwork could meet the
crisis . . . .&quot; The Committee's conclusions led to President
Reagan's announcement on October 14, 1982, of the formation of 12
regional Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, which were
authorized in January 1983 and became operational during the
spring of that year. </p>

<p>The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program
(OCDETF Program) is modeled after the South Florida Task Force,
but its objectives are quite different. While the primary
objective of the South Florida Task Force is the interdiction of
drugs, the focus of the OCDETF Program is the leaders of large
organizations, which control drug importation and distribution
networks, and the disruption of those networks. The participating
Federal agencies are the U.S. Attorney's offices, DEA, FBI,
Customs, BATF, IRS, the Coast Guard, and the U.S. Marshals
Service. The OCDETF Program differs from previous multi-agency
law enforcement efforts in several respects: the task forces are
directly controlled by the Attorney General; the initial funding
was under the control of the Attorney General; and the task
forces are to focus on only one major segment of organized
criminal activity, drug trafficking. Because the OCDE Task Forces
are not intended to replace existing Federal enforcement efforts
against drugs and organized crime, the work of the organized
Crime Strike Forces and the South Florida Task Force continue, as
do the efforts of the FBI, DEA, Customs, and U.S. Attorneys
directed against organized crime groups involved in drug
trafficking. </p>

<p>Shortly after the establishment of the OCDETF Program, the
Reagan Administration adopted another multi-agency approach to
one facet of the Nation's supply reduction efforts, interdiction,
by creating the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System
(NNBIS) which was to be headed by Vice President Bush. NNBIS was
given the responsibility for informally coordinating the
interdiction efforts of other organizations; it could recommend,
but not require, that the organizations take certain actions, and
it itself was not authorized to interdict drugs. When it became
operational, NNBIS took over the interdiction coordination
responsibilities of the South Florida Task Force. Despite the
establishment of the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board in
1984, NNBIS continues to operate as an interdiction coordinating
body.<br>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter V Drug Enforcement, Policy, and Reducing Drug Demand </h2>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>The preceding chapter of this report discusses the historical
development of Federal drug policy and demonstrates that the
Federal response to the problems of drug abuse and drug
trafficking has become more complex over time. A good indicator
of the present complexity of the Federal response is the fact
that 32 Federal agencies are now involved in the multifaceted
effort to reduce the supply of and demand for drugs. In this
chapter, the Commission describes the current anti-drug efforts
of the principal Federal agencies and their roles in the national
strategy. The agencies are grouped by function, beginning with
those with central policy roles, followed by international
efforts, interdiction, domestic enforcement, data gathering,
intelligence, and United Nations efforts. </p>

<p>Overall Policy </p>

<p>The National Drug Enforcement Policy Board </p>

<p>The National Narcotics Act of 1984 created the National Drug
Enforcement Policy Board (the Board). This Cabinet-level Board
consists of the Attorney General as Chairman and the Secretaries
of State, Treasury, Defense, Transportation, and Health and Human
Services, as well as the Directors of Central Intelligence and
the Office of Management and Budget, as members. It is the latest
manifestation in the persistent effort to achieve singularity of
purpose in the fight against drug abuse, despite the diversity of
Federal agencies involved. This fact is explicitly recognized in
the pertinent statutory language, found at 1302(b) of the Act, in
which Congress expresses its intent to: </p>

<p>(1) Maintain a national and international effort against
illegal drugs; </p>

<p>(2) Coordinate fully the activities of the Federal agencies
involved; and (3) Charge a single, competent, and responsible
high-level Board of the United States Government, chaired by the
Attorney General, with responsibility for coordinating United
States policy with respect to national and international drug law
enforcement. </p>

<p>This intent is based upon sweeping Congressional findings set
forth in Section 1302(a) of the Act: </p>

<p>(1) The flow of illegal narcotics into the United States is a
major and growing problem. </p>

<p>(2) The problem of illegal drug activity falls across the
entire spectrum of Federal activities both nationally and
internationally. </p>

<p>(3) Illegal drug trafficking is estimated by the General
Accounting office to be an $80 billion per annum industry in the
United States. </p>

<p>(4) The annual consumption of drugs has reached epidemic
proportions. </p>

<p>(5) Despite the efforts of the United States Government and
other nations, the mechanisms for smuggling opium and other hard
drugs into the United States remain virtually intact, and United
States agencies estimate that they are able to interdict no more
than 5 to 15 percent of all hard drugs flowing into the country. </p>

<p>(6) Such significant indicators of the drug problem as
drug-related deaths, emergency room visits, hospital admissions
due to drug-related incidents, and addiction rates are soaring. </p>

<p>(7) Increased drug trafficking is strongly linked to violent
addiction-related crime, and recent studies have shown that over
90 percent of heroin users rely upon criminal activity as a means
of income. </p>

<p>(8) Much of the drug trafficking is handled by syndicates, a
situation that results in increased violence and criminal
activity because of the competitive struggle for control of the
domestic drug market. </p>

<p>(9) Controlling the supply of illicit drugs is a key to
reducing the crime epidemic confronting every region of the
country. </p>

<p>(10) The magnitude and scope of the problem requires the
establishment of a National Drug Enforcement Policy Board,
chaired by the Attorney General, to facilitate coordination of
all Federal efforts by relevant agencies. </p>

<p>(11) Such a Board must have responsibility for coordinating
the operations of Federal agencies involved in attacking the
problem through the development of policy and resources, so that
a unified and efficient effort can be undertaken. </p>

<p>To accomplish the statutory purpose, S. 1304 of the Act
specifically empowers the Board to improve policy development and
coordination among Federal agencies by: </p>

<p>(1) reviewing, evaluating, and developing U.S. government
policy, strategy, and resources with respect to drug law
enforcement efforts, including the setting of budgetary
priorities and development of a national and international drug
enforcement strategy; </p>

<p>(2) facilitating coordination of all U.S. government efforts
to halt national and international trafficking in illegal drugs; </p>

<p>(3) coordinating the collection and evaluation of information
necessary to implement U.S. policy with respect to drug law
enforcement. </p>

<p>In furtherance of these aims S. 1306 of the Act directs the
Director of the Drug Abuse Policy Office to serve as an advisor
to the Board on matters related to health issues in the drug
abuse field. As a principal figure in the area of interdiction,
the Vice President is included as an ex officio member. </p>

<p>Under this scheme the Attorney General as Board Chairman, in
consultation with the other members, supervises the preparation
of initiatives for consideration by the Board. The Board, under
the direction of the Chairman, then determines which items to
include on its agenda and what priority each is to receive. Such
items are then referred to the Coordinating Group, chaired by the
Deputy Attorney General and consisting of senior officials from
the member agencies. </p>

<p>The Coordinating Group in turn is to submit to the Board
practical recommendations, based on consultation with the
agencies involved, for resolving drug law enforcement issues and
developing appropriate Federal policy. Both the Board and the
Coordinating Group are supported in their efforts by a full-time
professional staff charged with performing necessary research,
analysis, and writing. This staff is composed of individuals
drawn from various principal agencies. The intent of this
multi-agency composition at all levels, Board, Coordinating
Group, and staff, is a reflection of the Board's intent, as
expressed in its 1985 Interim Act to Congress: </p>

<p>This structure reflects the need for interagency participation
at every level of Policy Board activity. The underlying principle
is that there is a practical advantage to resolving differences
at the lowest level possible. Disagreements on issues will
inevitably occur among various agency participants, but if all
points of view are represented at each level, many differences
can be worked out by the Staff or Coordinating Group rather than
being elevated to the Policy Board. </p>

<p>Section 1304(a) of the Act specifically directs the Board to
focus its work on two parts of the five-point National Strategy
on Drug Abuse: drug law enforcement and international
cooperation. In the area of drug enforcement, the Board pursues
four principal strategies: 1) illegal drugs are to be destroyed
at their source; 2) drug contraband is to be intercepted and
seized en route to or at the borders of the United States; 3)
drug trafficking organizations are to be identified, investigated
and prosecuted, and drug related assets seized and forfeited; and
4) regulatory means are to be exercised to stem diverted drug
abuse. </p>

<p>The Board commenced its activities on April 24, 1985, almost a
year after its creation. In its first meeting, it adopted the
organizational structure described above. In the months between
April 1985 and the end of that year, the Board met five times and
the Coordinating Group, five times. Issues referred to the
Coordinating Group during that time include &quot;designer&quot;
drugs, efforts to improve government-wide drug seizure
statistics, and drug crisis management. Its agenda includes a
report in January 1986, required by the Narcotics Act of 1984, on
the Board's achievements and the effectiveness of its policies to
combat national and international drug trafficking. It is also to
publish a 1986 strategy report. Items under consideration for
inclusion in the Boards agenda are: </p>

<p>Budget Review. The Government has increased substantially the
amount of resources devoted to drug law enforcement. Because of
the numerous agencies and departments now involved in combatting
drug trafficking, the Policy Board is an ideal forum for
considering the Government's overall drug law enforcement budget.
The Board may undertake budget reviews to determine whether
resources are appropriately allocated. Consideration will also be
given to insuring proper interagency balance and the optimal use
of tax dollars and resources in the drug war. </p>

<p>Memoranda of Understanding. The Board may review the numerous
jurisdictional Memoranda of Understanding between Federal
agencies to determine the effectiveness of these mechanisms for
interagency cooperation. </p>

<p>Interdiction. The Board may examine all of the interdiction
programs currently in place. Since, in the last few years, the
Federal Government has made an increased effort to prevent
illegal drugs from entering the United States, the Board may
propose to analyze the effectiveness of interdiction as an
overall law enforcement strategy. The Board will also consider
the experience gained from the 1981 exception to the Posse
Comitatus Act to determine whether additional legislative action
is needed. </p>

<p>Eradication. The Board proposes to assess the efficacy of all
eradication strategies and the cost-effectiveness of eradication
as a drug law enforcement strategy. In addition, it will address
how eradication relates to other elements of our enforcement
strategy. Because domestic marijuana reduction involves a number
of agencies, this issue is well suited to a study by the Policy
Board and its staff. </p>

<p>Other Issues. The Board may also refer other issues for
additional staff analysis. These might include: money laundering;
financial investigative techniques, including asset forfeiture;
the relationship of supply and demand reduction strategies; and
the collection and sharing of drug intelligence. </p>

<p>The Board's vision of its role is summed up in its Interim
Report: </p>

<p>The Board is assuming the task of coordinating all drug
related programs. To do this, the Board may develop a planning
and management process for policy development and evaluation of
the nation's narcotics law enforcement programs. </p>

<p>White House Drug Abuse Policy Office </p>

<p>Created within the White House by Executive Order 12368, the
Drug Policy Abuse Office was established to ensure that the
President is provided with a center for coordination and
oversight of both national and international drug abuse functions
of all executive branch agencies. The role of this office has
been expanded to include drug trafficking issues as well. The
office publishes a regular report on both drug abuse and drug
trafficking, the National Strategy, which provides policy
direction for all agencies involved in anti-drug efforts. As part
of the White House Office of Policy Development, the White House
Drug Abuse Policy Office provides the President with a direct
advisor on drug abuse policy matters. </p>

<p>International Efforts </p>

<p>Bureau of International Narcotics Matters </p>

<p>As the Federal agency responsible for coordinating the United
States' drug control efforts overseas, the Department of State's
Bureau of International Narcotics Matters (BINM) is pivotal in
implementing U.S. anti-drug policy on the international level.
BINM attempts to encourage foreign coordination for joint illicit
drug control activities; bilateral assistance for crop control
and interdiction programs in the form of equipment, training and
technical advisory services; participation in international
organizations to increase drug control efforts in licit and
illicit drug production countries; training programs for foreign
personnel in illicit drug control functions to strengthen
interdiction and enforcement efforts; guidance, coordination and
support of the work abroad of all U.S. government agencies
involved in drug control; and technical assistance for
international demand reduction. BINM currently provides support
for drug eradication efforts in 14 countries and is in large part
responsible for much of the world's crop control and eradication
efforts, described elsewhere in this report. </p>

<p>Agency for International Development </p>

<p>Section 126 of the Foreign Assistance Act instructs the Agency
for International Development (AID) to &quot;give priority
consideration to programs which would help reduce illicit
narcotics cultivation by stimulating broader development
opportunities.&quot; Given this mandate, AID issued Policy
Determination No. 1 on drugs in 1982, encouraging the design of
projects that provide economic alternatives to farmers in drug
growing areas. Overseas, AID coordinates with the State
Department's Bureau of International Narcotics Matters. </p>

<p>AID drug control efforts include finding a suitable mix of
substitute crops, assuring free market incentives, and
encouraging appropriate host country pricing and marketing
policies. AID attempts to develop and implement development
projects that facilitate the host government's enforcement of
existing bans on drug production. </p>

<p>Department of Agriculture </p>

<p>The United States Department of Agriculture through the
Agricultural Research Service (ARS) assists in the control of
illicit drug plants by providing technical information pertaining
to eradication and substitute crops. Scientists in the ARS
conduct research on the use of herbicides and other techniques
for eradication, as well as the use of substitute crops for
farmers presently producing drugs. ARS scientists also provide
expert advice to the State Department and cooperating foreign
countries regarding proposed eradication programs. Potential
adverse environmental impacts are assessed prior to the
recommendation of control measures, whether it be chemical,
mechanical, fire, biological, or through genetic manipulation or
a combination of two or more of these techniques. Scientists from
ARS have been involved in drug research since 1972 and have
assisted control authorities in several drug producing countries
in the Americas and the Near and Far East. </p>

<p>Interdiction </p>

<p>National Narcotics Border Interdiction System </p>

<p>The National Narcotics Border Interdiction System (NNBIS)
attempts to accomplish comprehensive planning in the limited area
of interdiction at or approaching U.S. borders. NNBIS was created
by the President on March 23, 1983, and is directed by the Vice
President. </p>

<p>NNBIS' mission is to improve border interdiction by
accomplishing a threefold goal: to continue to improve
interagency coordination among law enforcement agencies; to
maximize the participation of the military services and Federal
agencies involved in drug interdiction; and to increase and
provide interaction for intelligence community involvement in
interdiction efforts. Participating agencies include the U.S.
Customs Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Drug Enforcement
Administration (of particular importance is the contribution of
DEA's El Paso Intelligence Center - EPIC) the Border Patrol, the
Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, the
Federal Aviation Administration, the National oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, the Federal Communications
Commission, and the Department of State. NNBIS itself consists of
a headquarters staff in Washington, D.C. and six regional
offices: Miami, New Orleans, El Paso, New York, Chicago and Long
Beach, California. </p>

<p>Actual interdiction at or approaching U.S. borders is
accomplished by individual agencies during single agency or
multi-agency special operations. The role of NNBIS is to provide
necessary equipment, intelligence, detection and trend analysis
support. Specific NNBIS contributions to drug seizures consist of
direct support, such as the passing of &quot;real-time&quot;
information, general information, or regional analysis. NNBIS
staffs, consisting of agency-contributed personnel in both
Washington and the regional centers, coordinate with contributing
agency staffs to lay the groundwork for special initiatives,
which then can proceed in a timely fashion to enhance drug law
enforcement efforts. Of critical importance in understanding
NNBIS' role is the fact that the activity has no funding of its
own. It is entirely dependent upon agency contributions of
manpower and intelligence and does not have a direct operational
authority. It can only inform and advise its constituent agencies
concerning opportunities for coordinated or expanded operations.
Thus, criticisms of NNBIS, alleging that many seizures would have
occurred anyway, even if NNBIS did not exist, miss the point.
Individual agencies are intended, indeed mandated, to carry out
their missions, including contraband seizures. NNBIS is intended
to supplement, not replace, those efforts. It has a steadily
improving record of doing so, a fact recognized even by some
critics. </p>

<p>Operation Hat Trick I </p>

<p>In the fall of 1984 Hat Trick I, the first major coordination
effort attempted under the NNBIS management mechanism, was
undertaken. Hat Trick I was designed to disrupt the transshipment
of the fall harvest of marijuana from Colombia, while
simultaneously intercepting any cocaine shipped during the
operation. </p>

<p>During the 60-day operation, an intercept line of Coast Guard
and Navy ships was formed in the Caribbean to halt smuggling
vessels. The Department of Defense supplemented the operation
with electronic equipment capable of detecting both aircraft
which flew over the ships and vessels which slipped through the
net. Additionally, the Customs Service and Border Patrol
increased their efforts at and between the ports of entry to the
United States, and the intelligence community added previously
unprecedented support to the effort. This multi-agency approach
emphasized the critical need for compatible communications
capabilities. This lesson is being carried forward in current
operational planning. </p>

<p>The anticipated reaction to this operation was an attempt by
the smugglers in Colombia to stockpile shipments. To counter
this, multi-agency teams, headed by the Department of State,
visited Colombia and neighboring countries to brief officials
there about the operation and to elicit their support. The
Colombian government, which had declared a &quot;war without
quarter&quot; against drugs the previous year, seized the
opportunity to step up efforts to destroy the marijuana in that
country. Colombian officials were also placed aboard U.S. Coast
Guard cutters, operating off the Colombian coast to coordinate
with Colombian enforcement units. </p>

<p>Operation Hat Trick I proceeded as expected, with massive
maritime seizures, and a significant reduction of maritime drug
shipments. According to NNBIS, over 600,000 pounds of marijuana
and 6,000 pounds of cocaine were seized by U.S. agencies during
the operation. Simultaneously, the Colombian government, through
eradication and destruction of stockpiled contraband, removed
over 50 percent of the fall marijuana crop from possible export. </p>

<p>Operation Hat Trick II </p>

<p>Operation Hat Trick I has come to be viewed as a prototype
effort in it initiated improvements in planning, communications
security, in-country efforts, air operations, intelligence and
resource support. Hat Trick II, a much more ambitious operation
begun in November 1985 and still under way, is the logical
follow-on, drawing carefully on lessons learned from Hat Trick I.
</p>

<p>Coordinated by NNBIS and consisting of the combined forces of
U.S. civilian drug enforcement agencies and all branches of the
military, Hat Trick II involves increased land and air patrols to
disrupt drug traffic into the United States. The long-term goal
of the operation is to affect the worldwide availability of drugs
by increasing international pressure on trafficking
organizations. It is a complex operation that tightens
surveillance along our border with Mexico and along the known air
and ocean supply routes from South America and other Caribbean
countries. </p>

<p>The United States Navy and the Coast Guard, working together,
provide the primary maritime surveillance and interdiction forces
for Hat Trick II, while the U.S. Customs Service works as the
lead agency with the Navy, Air Force, Army and Marines in
directing air operations. The Customs Service and the Immigration
and Naturalization Service Border Patrol are conducting
intensified operations all along U.S. land and sea borders.
Through Department of State and DEA initiatives, the U.S. is
working to provide the maximum coordination of anti-drug efforts
in foreign countries. </p>

<p>Hat Trick II employs military surveillance aircraft to
identify and track smugglers and to exploit the known routes
traffickers use from their source countries to their ultimate
destination. If the smugglers attempt to hide and wait in a
source or transit country, the drug enforcement authorities in
those countries are prepared to seize drugs and make arrests. An
important key to Hat Trick II lies in the ability of source and
transit countries to take advantage of the disruption the United
States has caused in normal drug trafficking. Colombia, Panama,
Venezuela, Jamaica and other countries throughout the region are
cooperating in this international effort. </p>

<p>Hat Trick II has contributed significantly to institutional
change among involved agencies. For example, as a result of
planning initiatives for Hat Trick II, the U.S. Navy has changed
its policies, and Navy ships have served as platforms for a
significantly increased number of Coast Guard interdictions.
Further, military radars have become a much more significant
factor in aircraft seizures. The diversions in smuggling routes
and methods caused by the operation have made drug trafficking a
more costly enterprise for smugglers, and secure communications
enhancements have kept operational information away from them.
Major cocaine seizures have resulted from U.S. Bahamian
cooperation. The intelligence community has greatly increased its
collection and dissemination of tactical intelligence. Each law
enforcement agency has, in essence, developed specialized
intra-agency operations in support of the overall Hat Trick II
effort. </p>

<p>Operation Blue Lightning </p>

<p>To test the effectiveness of conducting an operation with
Federal, State and local participation, as well as exercising the
growing U.S.-Bahamian partnership against drug smuggling, a major
special operation, entitled &quot;Blue Lightning,&quot; was
devised and coordinated from the NNBIS Regional Center in Miami. </p>

<p>Blue Lightning concentrated on two geographical areas, the
Bahamian Archipelago and the area West of the Bahamas up to and
including the coast of Florida. In the Bahamas islands were
targeted as &quot;stash sites,&quot; or drug holding areas, and
unannounced sweep teams were flown in to search for contraband.
The sweep teams were composed of Bahamian Police, transported by
U.S. military helicopters. Efforts were coordinated by the DEA
and U.S. Embassy in Nassau. The effort outside the Bahamas
included coordinated, augmented air and sea detection capability
up to the Florida coast. As a primary participant in the NNBIS
coordinated operation, the U.S. Customs Service was requested to
assume lead agency status for the portion of the operation
outside the Bahamas. Overall Blue Lightning participants included
16 State, county and city law enforcement agencies, the Customs
Service, Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and National Park
Service in addition to the DEA and the Government of the Bahamas.
Additionally, Bahamian personnel were assigned to South Florida
for the duration of the operation to fly law enforcement missions
with U.S. Customs. </p>

<p>The raids by Bahamian authorities forced smugglers to move
their drugs to the U.S. immediately, where law enforcement units
were positioned to intercept them. Over 6,000 pounds of cocaine,
33,000 pounds of marijuana, and over $1.5 million worth of
vessels, aircraft, trailers and cash were seized. Additionally,
interdiction techniques were tested and refined, heightening the
ability to conduct coordinated international and interagency
operations. </p>

<p>U.S. Coast Guard </p>

<p>Responsible in large part for U.S. drug interdiction efforts,
the Coast Guard's strategy has been mainly directed toward
intercepting motherships as they transit the major passes of the
Caribbean. To effect this &quot;choke point&quot; strategy, the
Coast Guard conducts both continuous surface patrols and frequent
surveillance flights over the waters of interest, and boards and
inspects suspect vessels at sea. In the past major Coast Guard
resources have been concentrated in the &quot;choke points&quot;
traditionally transversed by traffickers. Cutters now more
frequently patrol the Bahamas, the eastern passes of the
Caribbean, and the Gulf, Atlantic and Pacific coastal areas. </p>

<p>During the past several years the Coast Guard has increased
the number of cutter patrol days and aircraft operating hours
devoted to drug interdiction, increasing their ability to respond
quickly to sightings and other intelligence. In addition, the
Coast Guard is deploying leased Sea Based Aerostats (SBAs), which
are small tethered balloons equipped with surface search radar,
tethered offshore at sufficient altitude to greatly increase its
range. As part of a coordinated operation, surface target
information is paused to a command and control cutter for
evaluation and deployment of other assigned units, both surface
and air. </p>

<p>Better intelligence remains an important factor in increasing
the Coast Guard's overall interdiction effectiveness. The most
critical need is timely and accurate information on the number,
identity, location and destination of vessels and aircraft
carrying contraband which are bound for the United States. During
the past two years improvements have been made in the collection,
evaluation, and dissemination of intelligence. A new intelligence
coordination center in Washington, D.C. maintains a 24-hour
all-source watch to exploit all intelligence systems available to
the Coast Guard, and produces intelligence tailored to the needs
of operational commanders. The Coast Guard is also continuing
liaison with the law enforcement community's intelligence
network. </p>

<p>U.S. Customs Service </p>

<p>The U.S. Customs Service participates in several multiagency
investigative programs, including the Florida Joint Task Group
and the President's Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.
The efforts of these two programs alone resulted in 1,194 arrests
and drug seizures of 35,702 pounds of cocaine, 132 pounds of
heroin, and 3,848,293 pounds of marijuana from FY 1952 to FY
1985. </p>

<p>Prompted by the increasing sophistication of violators of
critical technology and trade laws, including individuals in
drug-related activities, the Customs Service established an
Office of Intelligence in 1981. Customs-acquired intelligence of
national security interest is, for the first time, actively being
disseminated to community agencies, and the intelligence
community is currently developing information useful for drug
enforcement. The development of secure communications facilities
within the Customs Service, currently underway, will further
enhance this capability. </p>

<p>The Customs Aviation and Marine Programs are consistently
changed and upgraded to reflect new technologies and equipment
and improved tactics and strategy. Drug smugglers have responded
to these programs by adjusting their routes to elude the
increased effectiveness of enforcement officials. </p>

<p>The Customs Service has developed teams of inspectors and
canine enforcement officers to more thoroughly examine persons,
conveyances, and cargo determined to be high risk. These mobile
teams, which use highly trained dogs to detect drugs, allow
Customs to release cargo and passengers deemed to be low risk
without examination, thus speeding the entry of most people and
cargo. The teams comprise 12 percent of the inspectional
workforce, but have accounted for the greater proportion of the
drug seizures. During the first 9 months of FY 1985, they have
been responsible for 66 percent (10,269 pounds) of the hashish,
87 percent (876 pounds) of the cocaine, and 40 percent (243
pounds) of the heroin that has been seized by inspectors. </p>

<p>During the past three years, the Customs Service has attempted
to convince the commercial air and sea carriers of their
responsibilities in the effort to halt drug trafficking. As part
of this initiative Customs contacted the major carriers and
signed cooperative agreements with a number of them. These set
out specific measures designed to prevent and detect the use of
commercial vessels and aircraft that smuggle drugs and other
contraband. Customs works closely with carriers, to apprise them
of their vulnerabilities through regular meetings; to provide a
training program on cargo, aircraft, and facility security; to
perform security surveys; and to compile threat assessments. This
cooperation between Customs and commercial carriers has led to
the detection of drugs and the transmittal of valuable
intelligence to local customs officials. </p>

<p>Department of Defense </p>

<p>In 1981 Congress passed legislation clarifying statutory
restrictions on the use of Department of Defense (DOD) resources
for law enforcement purposes. As a result, the Department of
Defense now has greater freedom to support Federal law
enforcement agencies. DOD resources play an important role in the
Federal drug interdiction program by providing surveillance and
support services, such as using aircraft to search for smugglers
and Navy ships to tow or escort vessels seized by the Coast Guard
to the nearest U.S. port. As of the end of September 1985, the
DOD has been involved in 38 vessel seizures, and their assistance
has been invaluable during NNBIS-directed joint operations. </p>

<p>DOD's increased involvement in drug law enforcement as a
result of amendments to the Posse Comitatus Act, has proved
pivotal in many instances. In fact, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
recommended unanimously in early 1985 that the U.S. military be
engaged to an unprecedented extent in fighting drug trafficking
and production. It called for the implementation of a massive new
program in which military forces would expand their present
supportive role by becoming involved in drug interdiction, in
training Central American nation's anti-drug forces, and in
providing needed weapons and equipment. </p>

<p>Domestic Enforcement </p>

<p>Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program </p>

<p>The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program
(OCDETF), comprised of 13 Task Forces nationwide, brings all
Federal agencies with drug enforcement responsibilities together
into a coordinated effort against the largest and most important
national and international drug trafficking rings. Justice
Department agencies involved in the effort include the FBI, the
DEA, and the Marshals Service; Treasury Department agencies
include the U.S. Customs Service, the Bureau of Tobacco, Alcohol,
and Firearms, and the International Revenue Service. The Coast
Guard has a major role in the program as well, and the Department
of Defense offers intelligence and information on sightings of
suspected drug traffickers heading for the U.S. by sea and air. </p>

<p>In slightly more than two and one-half years, the Task Force
has produced 1,721 indictments against 6,545 defendants. The Task
Force emphasis is on prosecuting and imprisoning drug kingpins,
money launderers, and financiers. There is also strong focus on
seizing cash and drug-related assets. In fact, the assets seized
may soon exceed the cost of the Task Force program. </p>

<p>The Task force Program relies largely on the Continuing
Criminal Enterprise Statutory provision and the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute. The
conviction rate in cases reaching disposition is approximately 95
percent. State and local officers participate in nearly one-half
of the Task Force investigations. </p>

<p>New international law enforcement cooperation also has been
achieved, since nearly one-half of Task Force cases target
organizations international in scope. These efforts have received
substantial support from foreign law enforcement agencies, as
indicated by the fact that five percent of Task Force cases now
involve direct participation by foreign police. This has created
a new focal point for international drug investigations. </p>

<p>Drug Enforcement Administration </p>

<p>As the lead Federal drug agency the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) is charged with enforcing the controlled
substance laws and regulations of the United States. DEA also
participates in non-enforcement programs to reduce the demand for
drugs. Part of the Department of Justice, DEA comprises 2,400
special agents in 121 domestic field offices and 61 offices in
over 40 foreign countries. </p>

<p>DEA's primary objectives are: </p>

<p>- To bring to bear all the Federal resources on the arrest,
prosecution, and immobilization of major drug trafficking
organizations via continued coordination with other Federal
agencies and the use of financial and legal tools, emerging
technology, and sophisticated investigative techniques. </p>

<p>- To reduce the supply of illicit drugs from source countries,
thereby reducing the availability of illicit drugs in the United
States and abroad via source country initiatives, assistance to
foreign government, training for foreign law enforcement
authorities, and public support for successful foreign government
endeavors. </p>

<p>- To significantly reduce the diversion of controlled
substances from the legitimate channels in which they are
manufactured, distributed, and dispensed through a vigorous
program of investigations and State, local, and international
cooperation. </p>

<p>- To enlist the active participation of State and local
governments and law enforcement agencies in the national drug
eradication program, clandestine laboratory task forces, State
and local task forces, and other multi-state coordinative
efforts. </p>

<p>- To participate actively and aggressively in the Federal,
State, and local effort to mobilize public support for the drug
enforcement and abuse prevention program by implementing
strategies and educational programs that stimulate cooperation
among State and local criminal justice agencies, school,
businesses, civic, and parent groups. </p>

<p>- To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of DEA
operations through the implementation of specific programs
designed to enhance employee performance. </p>

<p>Domestic Eradication Programs </p>

<p>The DEA's Domestic Eradication/Suppression Program has
expanded significantly since the Drug Enforcement Administration
first provided eradication assistance to Hawaii in 1979, and
currently all 50 States participate in this venture. DEA
encourages State and local eradication and provides training,
equipment, funding and investigative and aircraft resources. In
1984, with 48 States participating, approximately 3.8 million
marijuana plants were eradicated. The Secretary of the Interior
has also been authorized by a recent Executive Order to conduct
an extensive eradication program targeting marijuana plants on
Federal lands. Spraying commenced on October 6, 1985. </p>

<p>El Paso Intelligence Center </p>

<p>The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) is the Drug Enforcement
Administration's national drug information center, with
intelligence systems located at DEA headquarters, and in DEA's
foreign and domestic offices. EPIC's strategic intelligence
program furnishes geographic assessments, estimates, and warnings
of drug availability, production, trafficking trends and routes.
It distributes information to foreign, Federal, State and local
agencies through numerous publications. Its operational
intelligence program directly supports investigations underway
against top-level traffickers and supplies information on
specific organizations and their financial assets to support
investigations worldwide. As appropriate, this intelligence is
shared with other Federal, State and local agencies to ensure its
maximum utilization against drug traffickers. EPIC serves as a
clearinghouse for drug information collected 24 hours a day. With
DEA as its lead agency, EPIC is staffed by special agents and
intelligence analysts working with personnel from the FBI,
Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Marshals Service, Federal Aviation
Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Customs
Service, Coast Guard, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
the Departments of Defense and State, and members of the Federal
intelligence community. Today all States participate in EPIC
through chartered arrangements made between DEA and the
individual States. </p>

<p>Federal Bureau of Investigation </p>

<p>Although DEA is nominally the lead Drug Enforcement Agency,
its Director reports to the Director of the FBI. In granting the
FBI concurrent jurisdiction with DEA, the Attorney General has
mandated that the FBI assume a significant drug enforcement role.
He has also directed that FBI expertise in such areas as
organized crime financial investigations and white-collar crime
investigations be fully used in drug enforcement work. </p>

<p>Both DEA and the FBI place strong emphasis on major
distributors and organizations involved in the manufacturing,
importing, distributing and financing of illicit controlled
substances. Conspiracy investigations (particularly the
Continuing Criminal Enterprise and Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Statutes) are the focal point of
investigation efforts. </p>

<p>Internal Revenue Service </p>

<p>Within the Department of the Treasury, the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) plays a critical role in U.S. drug control efforts
by targeting drug traffickers' profits. IRS Financial
Investigative Task Forces rely on the reports of financial
transactions, filed by banks and other institutions, to identify
financiers of criminal activities and money laundering
specialists. These reports include Currency Transaction Reports
and Foreign Bank Accounts Reports. Through these Task Forces
trace the transferrals of large sums of cash and identify the
proceeds of drug trafficking. </p>

<p>Data Gathering </p>

<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse </p>

<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is the principal
source for current information about the effects of drug abuse.
NIDA was established in 1972 as part of the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare, and for its first nine years, operated
under a broad mandate that included providing direct financial
assistance for drug abuse education, training, treatment, and
rehabilitation, as well as conducting research programs. With the
passage of The Alcohol and Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services
Block Grant in 1981, full responsibility for carrying out
treatment and prevention service functions was transferred from
NIDA to the States. </p>

<p>Now a part of the Department of Health and Human Service,
NIDA's current role in reducing demand, as set forth both in the
National Strategy and the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Amendments of
1983, is to develop and disseminate new knowledge about drug
abuse, its prevention and treatment, and to exercise national
leadership in encouraging and assisting the private sector, the
States, and local governments to implement and support drug abuse
prevention and treatment programs in their communities. </p>

<p>The NIDA research program has several important components.
Through its epidemiological research program NIDA assesses the
nature and extent of the nation's drug abuse problem and its
trends. NIDA supports two ongoing epidemiological surveys, the
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse and the High School
Senior Survey. NIDA's Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) monitors
information on the health consequences of drug use through
emergency room visit statistics and through medical examiner
reports. In addition to these major efforts, NIDA provides grants
for a number of special epidemiological studies. </p>

<p>National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee </p>

<p>The 11-agency National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers
Committee consists of the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs Service,
the Departments of Defense, State and Treasury, Drug Enforcement
Administration, Immigration and Naturalization Service, National
Institute on Drug Abuse, White House Drug Abuse Policy Office,
Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service.
This Committee was created as the primary vehicle at the national
level for review and dissemination of strategic intelligence. It
publishes an annual report, the &quot;Narcotics Intelligence
Estimate,&quot; which details the supply of drugs to the U.S.
illicit market from foreign and domestic sources, and their
patterns and rates of use. </p>

<p>Intelligence </p>

<p>Central Intelligence Agency </p>

<p>Since the signing of Executive Order 12333 in December 1981,
the Central Intelligence Agency has provided assistance to drug
law enforcement efforts through the collection, analysis, and
dissemination of information regarding foreign narcotics
production. The CIA plans to upgrade its capabilities to gather
and assess drug-related intelligence over the next five years,
and is currently coordinating research to develop technologies
which can be used to better detect drug trafficking. </p>

<p>United Nations </p>

<p>United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control </p>

<p>As the drug control arm of the United Nations, the United
Nations for Drug Abuse Control was established in 1979 to assist
governments by helping finance projects aimed at reducing the
illicit supply of and demand for drugs. Projects undertaken by
the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control include replacing
illicit opium cultivation, treating and rehabilitating drug
addicts, strengthening control measures, or organizing
information and education programs. The Fund relies entirely on
voluntary contributions, mainly from governments but also from
private sources. The United States has long been the primary
contributor to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control. In
early 1983, however, the Fund obtained a $40 million pledge,
extending over a five year period, from the government of Italy
for coca control projects in South America. In early 1984 major
donors to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control agreed
that development assistance to narcotics growing regions should
be linked to government commitments to control illicit drug
production.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter VI Part 1: Current Supply Strategies: Analysis and
Recommendations </h2>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>Currently, the great bulk of our Federal drug abuse budget is
devoted to strategies aimed at cutting off the supply of drugs
available to users and prospective users. These strategies, such
as source country eradication, interdiction, and domestic
enforcement, are frequently attacked as expensive, too slow in
producing perceptible results, and frequently dangerous for the
public officials charged with carrying them out. Far too often
such criticism seems to be the result of isolated examination
without regard to the programs' proper long-term goal or
relationship to strategic approaches to reduce demand. </p>

<p>This report attempts to avoid such pitfalls, and in this
chapter, examines and analyzes in its proper context, each of our
Federal efforts to reduce supply. It makes recommendations to
encourage a coordinated, comprehensive effort at restricting the
flow of drugs to the maximum extent possible, while complementary
demand reduction programs take hold. </p>

<p>Legalization of Illicit Drugs </p>

<p>The debate over strategies to reduce supply has produced a
wide range of proposals, including at one extreme the suggestion
that currently illicit drugs be legalized. Profits in the drug
trade are enormous, primarily because drugs are in high demand
and because traffickers charge prices high enough to justify the
risks involved. Proponents of legalization argue that because of
the clear connection between illegal drug trafficking and
organized crime, making drugs legal would remove the enormous
profits in the illicit drug industry a priority. </p>

<p>On the surface, this argument appears to have some merit.
However, it omits any consideration of the health costs of drug
abuse to the individual and to society, a dimension this
Commission views as fundamental. The drugs discussed in this
report are inherently destructive to mind and body.
&quot;Legalized&quot; drugs would still alter behavior, impair
productivity and educational potential, damage vital organs, and
kill. Moreover, legalization would almost certainly increase
demand, and therefore spread this destruction. Finally, this
Commission is not persuaded that legalization would result in
organized crime's abandonment of the drug business. While demand
for drugs in the United States represents a significant share of
global drug consumption, many other countries have a considerable
demand for drugs that would continue to be met by some or the
same organized crime groups now confronting this country. </p>

<p>It is the position of this Commission that legalizing
substances, which by their very nature destroy rather than
benefit the individual and society, will not solve the problem of
drug trafficking and is therefore not a viable option. This
Commission is emphatic in its position that legalization of drug
use is not a viable option. </p>

<p>National Drug Enforcement Policy Board </p>

<p>The National Drug Enforcement Policy Board (&quot;the
Board&quot;), presents a rare, possibly even unique, opportunity
to bring focus and singularity of purpose to the Federal
anti-drug effort. That fact is explicitly recognized in the
legislation creating the Board, wherein Congress acknowledges
that for the first time, a single, competent, and responsible
high-level Board of the United States Government, chaired by the
Attorney General, will be charged with this responsibility of
coordinating United States policy with respect to national and
international drug law enforcement. </p>

<p>The sentiment is echoed by the Justice Department's own
handbook discussing the National Narcotics Act of 1984, which
identifies the Act as &quot;a substantially revised version of
earlier 'Drug Czar' proposals.&quot; </p>

<p>This Commission recognizes and has pointed out repeatedly in
this report that drug abuse, a term including all of the medical,
social, and legal costs imposed on the American people by illegal
drugs, is a problem of proportions unmatched in any other area of
law enforcement. A problem of such dimensions demands a
coordinated response by the Federal government. The creation of
the Board is a major step toward a truly unified, coordinated
enforcement effort. </p>

<p>The performance of the Board to date has been somewhat
ambiguous. On the positive side, the Board has begun to meet, has
adopted an effective and comprehensive membership list for its
Coordinating Group, and has assembled a professional staff,
composed of experienced and able agency representatives. </p>

<p>It is troubling to note, however, that in light of the
acknowledged urgency of the drug abuse situation, characterized
by Congress as an &quot;epidemic,&quot; marked by
&quot;soaring&quot; death rates and a &quot;key to reducing the
crime epidemic confronting every region of the country,&quot; the
Board has yet to assert a clear leadership role. Instead, it has
adopted a more relaxed and collegial approach, waiting three
months after the effective date of the Act to hold its first
meeting. The Board began its work with a suggestion from the
Justice Department that the Board's mandate is &quot;. . . quite
broad and allows a range of possible roles - from an essentially
passive research and analysis to active implementation of drug
policies.&quot; This Commission notes with alarm that this
contemplative expression does not even extend to policy
formulation, which is the core of the Act's mandate. This concern
is heightened by the Board's initial choice of agenda items:
&quot;designer drugs,&quot; drug seizure statistics, and drug
management. These topics are certainly important, but only one,
seizure statistics, would have an impact on the formulation of a
coordinated drug enforcement policy. Even that connection is
remote. Uniform statistics are an important step toward
compilation of the reliable data base necessary to formulate
policy and measure its effectiveness, but that is all they are.
It is also troubling that the Board's first Interim Report to
Congress consists almost entirely of a verbatim recitation of
portions of the 1984 National Strategy. </p>

<p>An urgent but rational approach to the problem of drug abuse
is needed. This must begin with the statement of a goal. What is
the ultimate objective of the policy Board and of our drug
enforcement effort generally? This Commission is of the opinion
that the success of a national drug enforcement effort should
ultimately be measured in terms of reduced usage. The poisoning
of minds and bodies is the evil we are combatting. All other
targets - manufacture or cultivation, processing, smuggling,
distribution, and so on - would be of no consequence were it not
for the terrible destructive force of the use of illegal drugs.
Eliminating drug use, then, must be the cornerstone of a national
policy, and our national operational design - our strategy -
should flow from it. It is at this fundamental level that the
Board's deliberations should begin, difficult as the dialogue may
be. </p>

<p>A key to achieving the Board's essential singularity of
purpose is the commitment of each Board member, on behalf of his
entire Department, to the goal of reducing drug consumption,
accompanied by a resolve that no opportunity for action,
particularly coordinated, multi-agency approaches, will be
ignored on the basis of parochial concerns. However, the use of a
committee in place of a single figure of authority runs the
inherent risk of preserving interagency competition. It is
encouraging to note that the Board has included as
&quot;potential items&quot; for review total budgetary planning
and administrative operations. This Commission submits that
vigorous review of the latter is urgently needed, with special
attention to what is not included in such memoranda and the
reasons for such omissions. </p>

<p>A combined and coordinated effort among the dozens of Federal
agencies and offices, measured by a single standard of success,
is certain to require program dislocations, reordering of
Departmental priorities, and subordination of Departmental plans
to Board direction. It will mean abandoning the &quot;Not
Invented Here&quot; veto, which has far too often blocked
inter-Departmental efforts. Cooperation is the heart of a truly
coordinated national attack on drug abuse. It will require not
just review, analysis and coordination, but initiative by the
Board to overcome unnecessary obstacles, outmoded concepts, and
self-protective agency narrowness. Success will also depend upon
careful attention to long-term coordination between Federal
agency operations and with State and local components, for if
experience has shown anything in the effort against drug
trafficking, it is the resourcefulness and adaptability of the
traffickers. Successful interdiction or enforcement in one area
is virtually certain to result in a relocation to a new area of
operations. Long range planning is critical if our resources are
to be used in a fashion which anticipates such movement, rather
than reacts to it. </p>

<p>It is neither possible nor desirable under our system of law
to invest a Board Chairman or any other &quot;Czar&quot; with
dictatorial power to command other Cabinet members to conduct the
affairs of their respective Departments in a particular fashion.
This fact is reflected in the tone of the Act, which empowers the
Chairman only to &quot;advise, recommend, correlate and
evaluate&quot; and to direct action only with &quot;the
concurrence of the head of the agency&quot; involved. Such terms,
intended to recognize the independence of the various
Cabinet-level agencies, also spread among them a common
responsibility for the success or failure of this vital task. </p>

<p>Intelligence </p>

<p>Accurate, timely, and complete intelligence is vital to the
efficiency of United States anti-drug efforts. Strategies to
reduce the supply of drugs, such as eradication, interdiction,
investigations, and prosecutions are dependent on effective
intelligence gathering. Less commonly acknowledged is that
strategies to reduce demand are similarly dependent on such
intelligence. Adequate data is the foundation upon which focused,
purposeful programs to reduce demand must be built. There is
substantial evidence to suggest that such a foundation is often
lacking in our current approaches. </p>

<p>Intelligence concerning both drug abuse and drug trafficking
must be shared between strategists who are working to reduce
supply and demand. Evidence indicates that thorough strategic
planning, whether concerned with the reduction of demand or with
attacks on supply, must carefully consider the available data on
the other side of the equation. For example, to achieve the most
carefully reasoned deployment of resources, decisions concerning
priorities for disrupting the supply of a particular drug should
consider not only the geographical and political conditions in
source and transit locations, but also carefully evaluate the
geographic and demographic data concerning drug consumption. Such
coordination of data from both sides of the supply-demand dynamic
is crucial to long-range planning. An awareness of traffickers'
ultimate markets will facilitate anticipatory deployment of
resources. This unified theory of planning is the basis for the
&quot;all source&quot; intelligence center discussed below. </p>

<p>Domestic Data Collection </p>

<p>One principal category of drug-related intelligence is
consumption and law enforcement data formally collected within
the United States. Such data are essential to describe and
measure the problems of drug abuse and trafficking. They are also
vital to our efforts to evaluate the effects of various efforts
to reduce the supply of and demand for drugs. The reliability of
these estimates is critical for both policy makers and drug law
enforcement officials. However, because drug trafficking and use
are illicit activities, data concerning them are necessarily
estimates. Compounding this problem is the fragmentation of the
current system of drug data gathering. Much greater coordination
is imperative. </p>

<p>Two primary ongoing studies are used to measure the number of
drug users and frequency of drug abuse in the United States: the
bi-annual Household Survey of Drug Abuse and the annual High
School Senior Survey, both sponsored by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA). The Household survey sample includes 5,000
people 12 years of age or older, living in households across the
country. The High School Senior survey questions approximately
17,000 high school seniors. These surveys have been criticized
because they do not include information from those populations
that are frequently involved with drugs, high school dropouts and
people without residences. To compensate for this deficiency, it
has been proposed that these surveys oversample groups thought to
be heavy users of drugs. </p>

<p>While these surveys provide estimates of the extent of drug
abuse, they do not gather important data, such as the price and
quantity of drugs purchased. Such information is crucial for
effective organized crime and drug enforcement policy planning,
because it would provide information concerning the effects of
certain enforcement actions on drug purchasing/using behavior.
NIDA should amend these surveys to include questions about drug
purchases. To the extent possible, they should also be designed
to determine the sources of the funds used to finance drug
purchases. Such data may be crucial to effective prevention
education planning. </p>

<p>NIDA provides two additional data bases of drug use in this
area. The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) collects data
concerning drug-related emergency room visits and deaths. These
statistics are based on reports gathered by NIDA from one-sixth
of the country's emergency rooms and two-thirds of the medical
examiners' offices. NIDA collects information about drug users in
treatment through the Client Oriented Data Acquisition Process
(CODAP). Formerly, all States were required to provide such data
as a condition of Federal assistance. However, since the
institution of block grants to partially fund State drug programs
in 1982, the Federal government has not been able to compel
participation in CODAP, and the number of participating States
has shrunk to approximately 15. Because of the importance of this
treatment data, the Federal government should again require
participation in CODAP. </p>

<p>Much data concerning drug trafficking is gathered by the
11-member National Narcotics Intelligence Consumer Committee
(NNICC) and reported annually in the Narcotics Intelligence
Estimates (NIE). This data includes estimates of the amount of
drugs produced and entering the United States, trafficking
patterns, and prices and purity of drugs. Although the NIE claims
to be &quot;the most comprehensive assessment prepared for the
Federal Government on the worldwide illicit drug situation in
1984,&quot; the report also states that, &quot;[b]ecause of gaps
in some of the data used to derive the estimates, there is a high
degree of uncertainty to the resulting estimates.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1983 NNICC prepared a report analyzing the methodologies
used in preparing drug estimates. The report concluded that NNICC
estimates are not timely, with estimates generally 18-30 months
out of date; there is insufficient data concerning the price and
potency of drugs, in part because of inadequate input from State
and local sources; and estimates of the total retail value of
drugs is an imprecise measure, which should be replaced by a
better measurement of final drug sales. In addition, NNICC's
methodology has been criticized as &quot;analysis by
negotiation,&quot; with final estimates resulting from a
bargaining process among the member agencies. Complaints about
the reliability of NIE data also result from the fact that NNICC
does not publish the background data used to develop the
estimates. </p>

<p>Another important set of data in the drug field is the
estimate of the results of drug law enforcement, including the
amount of drugs and property seized, and the numbers of arrests
and convictions and sentences imposed on drug violators. A
significant problem in generating reliable statistics in this
area is the lack of a centralized system for collection. Because
many agencies often are involved in the same case, the amount of
drugs seized and other information may be reported by each
agency. According to the National Drug enforcement Policy Board, </p>

<p>One of the principal problems encountered by the Federal
Government in its efforts to gauge the effectiveness of its
overall drug law enforcement program has been the lack of
centralized statistical information on Federal drug seizures . .
. Because of an undetermined amount of double and triple
counting, reliable statistics on total Federal drug seizures are
not available. </p>

<p>In apparent response to this problem the 1984 National
Strategy called on the Drug Enforcement Administration to develop
and maintain a centralized system for statistics concerning
Federal drug seizures. </p>

<p>As discussed throughout this report, asset forfeiture programs
are an extremely promising source of funding for anti-drug
efforts. Unfortunately, the availability and reliability of
information about non-drug assets seized by all levels of
government is hampered by the same double counting,
decentralization, and inconsistent data gathering methodologies
described above. Although the Department of Justice Asset
Forfeiture Office was created to maintain centralized information
on forfeited assets, the office is still in the process of
developing statistics for total Federal assets forfeited. A study
of State and local officials found that more than one-half of
those surveyed could not estimate the value of property and cash
obtained through forfeiture. State and local governments which
have not already done so should establish asset management
systems for the disposition of forfeited assets to provide
accurate estimates of their value. </p>

<p>Drug Supply Intelligence </p>

<p>With regard to intelligence concerning drug supplies, this
Commission is encouraged by what appears to be a growing
commitment to effective information-gathering. A number of
agencies have reported confidentially to this Commission that
both their funding and priority determinations are giving greater
weight to effective intelligence programs. </p>

<p>Intelligence efforts in this area take different forms,
depending on the topic to which they are directed. All are
subject to the two classic categories of information gathering:
human intelligence, referring to data gathered from human
informants, and technical collection, gathered by such means as
surveillance flights and satellites. In the area of crop
eradication, the lead agency is the State Department's Bureau of
International Narcotics Matters, supported by other members of
our country teams. Issues here include crop conditions, host
country political and military capabilities, and the role, if
any, of groups, including insurgents, opposing eradication
efforts. </p>

<p>Interdiction efforts require tactical intelligence concerning
specific drug movements, such as the identities of those
involved, shipment techniques, vessel and aircraft
identification, routes, and schedules. Also required is
&quot;strategic&quot; information, such as shifts in processing
and staging locations or in transshipment techniques. The current
exclusion of the Customs Service from foreign intelligence
gathering, mandated by the 1973 reorganization plan, particularly
needs to be re-examined. Strategic and tactical intelligence are
critical for border interdiction. Therefore the Commission
proposes that the Customs Service be integrated into the foreign
intelligence process of the Drug Enforcement Administration, to
the maximum extent permitted by the Reorganization Plan currently
in effect. </p>

<p>Because international drug trafficking organizations
frequently locate components of their operations within U.S.
borders, domestic investigations and prosecutions are often
dependent upon effective international intelligence gathering to
supplement such domestic techniques as legal electronic
surveillance and development of informants. </p>

<p>Effective international intelligence collection and
dissemination is not necessarily a highly sophisticated process.
On the contrary, it can consist of information as simple as
providing the names of suspected traffickers known to the Drug
Enforcement Administration to the State Department to ensure that
consular officers do not issue U.S. visas to such persons, or
that issuance be on a controlled basis to assist the
investigative work of DEA. It is encouraging that the National
Drug Enforcement Policy Board, pursuant to the Foreign Relations
Authorization Act for 1986 and 1987, has been directed to compile
a list of such traffickers and prepare guidelines for
inter-agency sharing of that information. </p>

<p>In the area of more sophisticated drug-related intelligence
work DEA and the intelligence community are currently playing
leading roles. The former has recently expanded its foreign
detail by ten percent, and additional expansion is prevented by
lack of funding. This matter deserves careful consideration by
both Congress and the Executive Branch. In addition, the
capabilities of DEA agents presently stationed in foreign
locations are unduly and unnecessarily hampered by the
&quot;Mansfield Amendment&quot; to the Foreign Assistance Act of
1961, which restricts their activities to a secondary role. As
part of a new expression of determination to combat international
drug trafficking, the amendment should be repealed. </p>

<p>The intelligence community is not burdened by any such
ill-conceived restriction. On the contrary, with regard to
international narcotics trafficking, its mandate, found in
Executive Order 12333, is clear, direct, and sweeping: </p>

<p>1.4 The Intelligence Community. The agencies within the
Intelligence Community shall, in accordance with applicable
United States law and with the other provisions of this Order,
conduct intelligence activities necessary for the conduct of
foreign relations and the protection of the national security of
the United States, including: </p>

<p>(c) Collection of information concerning, and the conduct of
activities to protect against, intelligence activities directed
against the United States, international terrorist and
international narcotics activities, and other hostile activities
directed against the United States by foreign powers,
organizations, persons, and their agents. </p>

<p>Although the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has in the past
been criticized for failing to give sufficient priority to drug
trafficking, the Commission is satisfied that the agency is
currently placing suitable emphasis on the issue. This is due, in
part, to the necessary Executive direction now being given to the
intelligence community, and in part to the growing recognition
throughout the government that drug trafficking in many forms and
in many locations has grown to become a national security
concern, transcending the traditional drug-related health and law
enforcement concerns, as discussed in this report. To complement
this effort, additional options are available and should be
pursued. </p>

<p>First, consistent with the direction now being provided to the
intelligence community, the Department of State should vigorously
pursue a program of educating its own foreign-based personnel to
the importance being given to drug-related intelligence and to
the critical need for State Department support for such efforts.
This appears to have been less than entirely adequate in all
instances. Second, the CIA's operational capabilities should be
fully explored to determine how the infrastructure of drug
trafficking organizations can be disrupted, consistent with the
concerns expressed in Executive Order 12333 and elsewhere.
Finally, the CIA's considerable research and development
capabilities should be used to develop additional means for
furthering efforts directed at international drug traffickers. </p>

<p>In connection with these contributions by the intelligence
community, it is encouraging to note the rapid evolution of a
cooperative relationship between the intelligence and law
enforcement communities. This is evidenced by the pertinent
language of Executive Order 12333, which provides that: </p>

<p>1.7 Senior Officials of the Intelligence Community. The heads
of departments and agencies with organizations in the
Intelligence Community or the heads of such organizations, as
appropriate, shall: </p>

<p>(g) Participate in the development of procedures approved by
the Attorney General governing production and dissemination of
intelligence resulting from criminal narcotics intelligence
activities abroad, if their departments, agencies, or
organizations have intelligence responsibilities for foreign or
domestic narcotics production and trafficking. </p>

<p>This direction is complemented by the inclusion of a
representative of the CIA on the Coordinating Group of the
National Drug Enforcement Policy Board. </p>

<p>Defense Capabilities </p>

<p>The intelligence community is not the only available source of
drug-related intelligence. The Department of Defense has a wide
range of facilities, equipment, and operations, which lend
themselves to effective participation. Although such a role is
most frequently discussed in connection with interdiction
operations near the U.S. border, intelligence-gathering
opportunities for Defense Department components exist much
farther afield. Like their counterparts in the interdiction area,
such efforts may be subject to Defense Department directives and
priorities, which in turn rely on a changeable definition of
&quot;national security.&quot; Nevertheless, if as a matter of
national policy, the military view of national security draws
closer to that of the intelligence community, as expressed in
Executive Order 12333, the potential for military drug-related
intelligence-gathering is profound. Because of the connection
between some drug trafficking organizations and terrorist or
insurgent groups, whatever assets are currently in place or in
planning for intelligence-gathering regarding terrorism or
insurgency could just as well function in connection with drug
traffickers. </p>

<p>Intelligence-gathering in source and transshipment countries
would be particularly effective in the interdiction effort, in
the opinion of former SOUTHCOM Commanding General Paul F. Gorman:
</p>

<p>I can't stress enough that it seems to me that the easy way to
operate on the [drug smuggling] pilots is down at the other end.
He is at the other end of his communications tether where the
airfields are much more primitive, where he is dependent on these
cartels and it's easier to penetrate. </p>

<p>Because they occur outside of U.S. territory, such operations
would not violate the Posse Comitatus Act. In addition, with an
expanded definition of national security, such as that manifest
in Executive Order 12333, the Economy Act would not be an
obstacle. Such an expanded intelligence-gathering role is a
desirable course of action for the Department of Defense. The
Commanding Officers of Unified Commands should be given maximum
flexibility in deploying their forces. </p>

<p>Another change in our application of military assets to
drug-related intelligence is much less sweeping in concept, but
nevertheless appears very useful. That is the inclusion of Coast
Guard officers in our Defense Attache programs in drug source and
transit countries. This Commission has been advised that such a
program is in process and encourages the agencies involved to
pursue this program with all due speed. </p>

<p>Allied governments in affected areas could significantly
enhance the intelligence operations of our own military units.
Such activities already under way and worthy of note include a
regional radio communications network being set up among the drug
enforcement authorities of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and
Venezuela. This network is designed to give these countries the
opportunity to coordinate drug enforcement strategies and work
closely together in confronting the drug trafficking threat
common to all. Agreements signed very recently by Brazil,
Venezuela, and Colombia allow these countries to initiate joint
investigations on their common borders, call for periodic
meetings between drug enforcement police, exchange intelligence,
and solve common problems. Although such efforts must contend
with the endemic problems of corruption and organizational and
national rivalries, they are a step in the right direction. To
the extent that United States assistance can contribute to the
elimination of corruption and other systemic problems, such
assistance should be provided to promote these programs. </p>

<p>All Source Intelligence and Operations Center </p>

<p>Data collection is but one phase of a complete intelligence
operation. To be effective collection should be followed by
thorough and timely analysis and dissemination. This Commission
therefore concludes that this Nation's anti-drug intelligence
efforts should be built upon an all-source intelligence and
operations center. Such a concept is described briefly above in
connection with interdiction efforts. EPIC and NNBIS together
provide an existing core upon which such a center could be built.
EPIC has demonstrated the feasibility of joint agency operations,
and NNBIS has shown that interagency operational coordination,
particularly involving military components, is well within
capabilities. </p>

<p>As a component of a comprehensive intelligence program, such a
center should be designed to collect drug-related intelligence
from the broadest base possible, including those sovereign
nations that will provide consistent, timely data on a
cooperative basis. In this regard, it is encouraging to note that
Latin American drug enforcement agencies are reported to be
planning to establish a regional intelligence center in a
strategic location, such as Panama, in the near future. Because
analysis should be as complete as possible, such a center should
include not only supply and transit-related intelligence, but
also counterpart demand data, including information on such
topics as drug-related deaths and emergency room admissions. This
will allow a complete picture of drug distribution from one end
of the chain to the other. This center would assume the
functions, including issuing annual reports, currently undertaken
by the National Narcotics Intelligence Consumer Committee
(NNICC). In addition, it should integrate all financial data
currently available to agencies of the Federal government, to
enable analysts to complete their knowledge about the drug-money
cycle whenever possible. </p>

<p>To be consistent with the rest of our national effort, such a
center should be under the general direction of the Policy Board
or its delegate, with the Vice President retaining primary
responsibility for management and coordination of the information
related specifically to interdiction. Such a facility would thus
coordinate the collection, analysis, and dissemination of
intelligence, covering every topic from production and
cultivation (including related political issues) to domestic
enforcement and detailed patterns of domestic consumption. It
would also provide the necessary centralized data base for
thorough inter-agency coordination of operations. Given the
sensitivity of many of its sources and the data received
therefrom, the functions and output of such a center would, of
course, require physical and communications security. The
resources and expertise of the National Security Agency with
regard to operational and communications security is an extremely
valuable national asset, which should be exploited to the fullest
extent possible in this connection. As this Commission has sought
to demonstrate repeatedly, drug traffickers have regularly and
successfully sought to penetrate law enforcement communications.
The equipment available for such purposes is readily available.
Communications security thus requires very careful attention in
the planning and design of all anti-drug operations and
facilities.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter VI Part 2: Interdiction </h2>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>Our National Strategy consists of five &quot;major
elements,&quot; each of which in turn is comprised of numerous
programs and strategies. Interdiction, just one of these
sub-components, presently consumes one-third of the entire
Federal drug abuse outlay for the fiscal year. Measured just in
terms of outlays designated for law enforcement activities,
interdiction's portion swells to almost one-half of the Federal
funds being spent to combat drug abuse. By Commission
calculation, Federal funds devoted to interdiction have increased
100 percent over the last five years. </p>

<p>Despite this massive dedication of funds, drugs of primarily
foreign origin - cocaine, heroin, and marijuana - continue to be
widely available in this country. Many observers, including some
leading drug enforcement officials, readily acknowledge that
interdiction can only serve a limited role in increasing risks to
smugglers while this government pursues other programs. Frank
Monastero, former Assistant Administrator for Operations of the
Drug Enforcement Administration, summed up this view in a recent
interview: </p>

<p>[Interdiction] is important, but it is the least effective
thing you can do . . . it's like the patrolman on the beat . . .
It is preventing [some drugs] from getting into the trafficking,
and that's something. But we can continue that ad infinitum. If
we don't do something at the source or don't do something before
that or don't do something at the end of the trail in the
prevention area, we will never change the situation. </p>

<p>It is the view of this Commission that interdiction is not
going to end drug use or availability in this country. It will,
however, continue to discourage some potential smugglers. This
deterrent effect is often overlooked or denied by many critics,
but not by smugglers themselves. According to Adler B. Seal, an
experienced drug smuggling pilot, in response to a question
concerning the difficulty of recruiting smuggling pilots: </p>

<p>Well, it used to be easy. However, now it has become a little
less attractive for some of the younger pilots. Some of the older
pilots, as myself, have been indicted. </p>

<p>We've been cognizant of law enforcement techniques and the
improvements in it; and the younger pilots are seeing the
newspaper reports of the older pilots and the amount of time that
they are being convicted on and serving, and it's not as
attractive a proposition as it used to be. </p>

<p>Successful interdiction not only discourages some new members
from joining smuggling enterprises, but also encourages some
already in the field to get out of it. This was confirmed by the
firsthand experience of smuggler Seal: </p>

<p>I think that the more flights that are interdicted, the word
gets around. </p>

<p>For instance, I have absolutely - or had in my capacity - no
desire whatsoever to go into and would do anything to stay out of
the south Florida area simply due to the fact that that is where
the concentrated interdiction efforts are being made due to the
Vice Presidential Task Force, which has been highly publicized
and which has taken its toll on the paranoia of the drug
smuggler. </p>

<p>It also appears to this Commission to be consistent with the
view of the Commissioner of Customs, William von Raab: </p>

<p>We are always asked what is a good measure of success against
smuggling. It is always quoted in terms of how much we seize. </p>

<p>I have always maintained that a good measure of success is to
reach a point at which a pilot doesn't want to fly into the
United States anymore; and I have always suggested that there may
be a percentage. </p>

<p>For example, if he has a one-out-of-ten chance of getting
caught, he might run in; but certainly if he had a
nine-out-of-ten chance of being caught, he's not going to do it. </p>

<p>In summary, this Commission recognizes that interdiction is
and should continue to be a vital component of our National
strategy, as a complement to other approaches to reduce drug
supply. Any analysis that defines success in the area of
interdiction as apprehending all, or nearly all, smuggled drugs
is unrealistic and counter-productive. To the extent that is a
very costly approach, additional expenditures must be weighed
very carefully, particularly if they have the effect of reducing
funds available for other efforts to reduce supply and demand.
There are, however, improvements to our interdiction efforts
which can be made without any significant increase in funding.
These steps, which generally involve reordering of priorities or
redefinition of interagency responsibilities, are discussed
below. </p>

<p>It is crucial to note that the single most important need in
the interdiction field is leadership. If innovation and increased
commitment are to be pursued successfully and expeditiously, both
by foreign governments and agencies of our own, a strong leader
orchestrating a single comprehensive plan is the key. That role
to date has been played by the Vice President, and it is one in
which he should continue. The weight of his office has produced
results when other officials might have been ignored. While the
National Drug Enforcement Policy Board necessarily includes
several Cabinet-level officers, they serve as peers. Only the
Vice President brings to the interdiction effort sufficient rank
to lead them. His central role should be preserved and promoted
within the context of the National Drug Enforcement Policy
Board's leadership in drug enforcement. Recognition by the Board
of the Vice President's leadership in interdiction activities
holds the promise of singularly promoting success in that key
area, preserving the momentum and continuity of existing
interagency interdiction efforts, and putting to rest the
confusion that has already begun to surface concerning the Vice
President's relationship to the Board. </p>

<p>Air Interdiction </p>

<p>The United States Customs Service has the lead responsibility
for air interdiction. To combat drug smugglers, some of whom have
the most sophisticated and expensive communications and
navigational equipment available today, Customs has increased its
airborne capabilities significantly in the recent past. At the
time of this report, the Service had just received $11 million in
a supplemental fiscal year 1985 appropriation for its air
operations, bringing the agency's total fiscal year budget for
air operations to $55.4 million. Customs' most significant need,
apart from more aircraft and more sophisticated electronics, is
the support of other Federal agencies with related jurisdictions.
</p>

<p>One example of the need for support is on the diplomatic
front. Customs has for some time found itself frustrated by its
inability to pursue suspected smuggler aircraft into Mexican
airspace after detection on the American side of the border.
Although this has been the subject of numerous diplomatic
discussions, there has been little progress to date. Giving this
matter an extremely high priority in our bilateral negotiations
with Mexico is the type of assistance another agency, in this
case the state Department, can and should provide to Customs in
recognition of the critical importance of the fight against drug
smuggling. </p>

<p>Another Customs' Services critical need is intelligence, both
tactical and strategic. While &quot;cold hits&quot; -
apprehension of smugglers in a random, uninformed basis - have an
important role to play in deterring smugglers by their very
randomness, intelligence is the key to effective interdiction.
According to former Drug Enforcement Administrator Francis
Mullen, every major seizure of drugs from South America made by
his agency has been made on the basis of prior intelligence, and
it is no less critical to the Customs Service. While the topic of
intelligence-gathering is the subject of a separate analysis in
this report, it is important to note in connection with this
discussion on inter-agency support that Customs and the Drug
Enforcement Administration have made considerable progress in the
area of information sharing. Customs has for some time had an
analyst stationed in DEA's Office of Intelligence, and a program
is currently underway to place Customs intelligence analysts in
country teams abroad to analyze data gathered by DEA. This
program should be pursued aggressively. Simultaneously, the
Customs Service should scrutinize its Customs Attache program to
determine to what extent it can play a larger role in
intelligence-gathering concerning smugglers. With its close
liaison with host government customs officials, this program may
be of particular significance with regard to smuggling involving
containerized and other commercial cargo. As interdiction
capabilities improve in the areas of pleasure craft and general
aviation, it is almost certain that commercial cargo will be used
increasingly for concealing illicit drug shipments. This has
already been observed in some cases. Such a Customs effort would
be complemented by the private sector initiatives Customs has
been able to bring about, such as the agreements now in effect
with the Airline Transport and International Airline Transport
Associations. </p>

<p>An active intelligence gathering role for Customs is now
blocked by the 1973 Reorganization Plan. The current recognition
by Customs and DEA of the former's need for time-sensitive
intelligence is of vital importance however, and should be
actively cultivated by the two agencies and the Policy Board.
That this would require modification or elimination of certain
provisions of the 1973 Reorganization Plan should not be an
obstacle. </p>

<p>The area of inter-agency support currently in need of the most
attention is the relationship between the Customs Service and the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The latter, which has
primary jurisdiction over entry into United States air space,
maintains a number of programs, which lend themselves to support
of Customs operations. While the FAA has to date given
significant support to Customs in a number of instances, more is
needed. To this end, the Customs Service has recently proposed
omnibus legislation, currently entitled the Customs Enforcement
Act of 1985, which contains provisions that address such
sensitive topics as restricted entry points and minimum altitudes
for air entry. Among other things, this Act would require all
vessels and aircraft entering the United States to report
immediately for Customs inspection, and would increase the fines
for failure to report entry. Fines would also be substantially
increased for smuggling controlled substances, and such
violations would be punishable by imprisonment. All assets seized
by Customs, including planes, vessels, and cash, would be subject
to forfeiture. The Act would prohibit airdrops to vessels, make
it unlawful to operate an aircraft without lights, and prohibit
the installation of all illegal fuel tanks in planes. In
addition, commercial carriers would be subject to more stringent
regulations under the Act. While this legislation may be
unpopular with private aviation, it is a collection of important
anti-smuggling measures which go directly to some of the most
frequently encountered drug smuggling techniques. It is worthy of
support. </p>

<p>Similarly, proposals advanced by both Customs and DEA that
aircraft identification numbers, now required to be twelve inches
high and displayed on the fuselage or tail, be displayed on an
upper and a lower wing surface as well are entirely consistent
with anti-smuggling requirements. DEA pilots have been fired upon
from the ground as they tried to fly low enough to read tail
numbers. Although the FAA has stated that an increase in required
number size has no &quot;aviation safety basis,&quot; it is this
Commission's position that needless exposure of Federal agents to
hostile fire should be considered an &quot;aviation safety&quot;
concern sufficient to justify remedial action. Again, reports
that a change in required number size or location would be very
unpopular with the general aviation community seem frivolous in
the context of issues as grave as those under discussion here.
There are a number of additional aviation-related proposals being
advanced by Customs today, concerning such matters as pre-filing
of &quot;border flight plans,&quot; advanced notice of entry into
U.S. air space, and improvements in pilot identification
certificates, which appear to this Commission to be worthy of
adoption, absent some compelling opposition. </p>

<p>There are other promising areas for Customs/FAA cooperation.
Customs reports, for example, that the FAA, in undertaking its
long-term buildup of the approach radar system, is working
closely with Customs to accommodate the latter's needs. This is
to be encouraged, particularly by the Policy Board, which has
both Customs and the FAA on its Coordinating Group. </p>

<p>One legal issue which would benefit from careful analysis by
the Board is the extent to which current asset forfeiture
provisions need revision to enable seizure of aircraft and other
equipment which is rented or leased by traffickers for the
purpose of avoiding forfeiture. </p>

<p>Another area worthy of study is the extent to which Customs'
air interdiction capabilities could be enhanced by Coast Guard
aviation components. Although such a concept might be contrary to
existing understandings, it would be a grave omission if
substantial Coast Guard aviation assets were overlooked,
particularly at a time when fiscal considerations threaten the
Customs air operations budget. </p>

<p>Maritime Operations </p>

<p>In the area of maritime interdiction, the Coast Guard serves
as lead agency. Its success has been remarkable and is limited
only by shortages in resources. New tactics and innovative forms
of assistance by the Navy have significantly improved the Coast
Guard's capabilities. There is no question that not only maritime
traffickers but air smugglers as well are intimidated by the
seaborne detection capabilities of Coast Guard vessels. Inasmuch
as the most critical limitation on Coast Guard capabilities is
the lack of budgeted resources, the single most pressing concern
is the augmentation of the Coast Guard budget to permit more
extensive participation in interdiction operations. A proposal,
which has surfaced annually but to no avail as yet, is the
imposition of user fees for various Coast Guard services now
provided to the boating community gratis. As with the aviation
community in connection with the FAA discussed above, there is
considerable opposition to maritime measures that would
inconvenience the user community or cost it money. However, given
the inescapable facts of the drug invasion this country is
experiencing, the nominal costs of various user fees would seem
to be a small price for boaters to pay as their contribution to
what must be seen as a national effort to defeat a deadly enemy. </p>

<p>In-shore operations of the Customs Service bolster Coast Guard
maritime interdiction operations. Having received over $12
million for maritime operations in its fiscal year 1985
supplemental appropriation, Customs has begun to get fast, state
of the art pursuit boats in the water off the coast of Florida.
These have been used to great effect, and more such craft should
be deployed. </p>

<p>One innovation for which the Customs Service and the
leadership of the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System
(NNBIS) are to be commended is the highly effective integration
of State and local authorities in the recent operation &quot;Blue
Lightning.&quot; It is clear and has been stressed throughout
this report that comprehensive, coordinated multi-agency
operations are absolutely essential to effective anti-drug
programs. On the Federal level, this typically means
&quot;horizontal integration,&quot; i.e., the careful combination
of equal Federal agencies. Blue Lightning is a fine example of
the equally important concept of &quot;vertical
integration,&quot; the well-planned and complementary cooperation
of Federal, State, and local resources aimed at a specific
trafficking activity. The Customs Service and NNBIS are
rightfully proud of this accomplishment and are encouraged to
pursue similar successes in operations to come. </p>

<p>Consolidated Efforts </p>

<p>The evolution of interdiction in recent years has been in the
direction of consolidation of intelligence and operations. This
is a trend characteristic of anti-drug efforts generally, and it
is a proper response to the breadth of the drug smuggling
situation. In the area of interdiction, the most prominent joint
efforts in addition to NNBIS are the National Drug Enforcement
Policy Board (the Board) and the El Paso Intelligence Center
(EPIC). All are described in detail elsewhere in this report. </p>

<p>The following is a proposed realignment of these
organizations, based on this Commission's review. </p>

<p>First, our proposal recognizes the leadership role of the
Board. That important topic is the subject of a separate analysis
in this report. Within the Board and as a part of its coordinated
program, we propose the combination of the functions of EPIC and
NNBIS into a single, all-source intelligence facility. In the
critical early stages of designing and implementing such an
operation, the Vice President's leadership will be invaluable.
The combined intelligence center will incorporate the input of
all intelligence-gathering components at the Federal level,
including those sources already feeding into EPIC and NNBIS, as
well as new sources still to be developed, as outlined below. </p>

<p>The present duplication between the various functions
performed by EPIC and NNBIS has been acknowledged by such
authorities as David Westrate, Assistant Administrator for
Operations of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the parent
agency of EPIC. Although it is true there are certain functions
being performed by each of the two activities, which are not
duplicated by the other, this should not prevent effective
integration of their functions. Everywhere in the current Federal
response, we find a movement toward consolidation and
coordination. Intelligence and planning should not be exceptions.
</p>

<p>A combined all-source intelligence center would require at
least two features not found in either NNBIS or EPIC. One is a
physically secure headquarters facility. EPIC is presently
located in a private office building in El Paso. It has neither
the space nor the necessary physical security to accommodate the
comprehensive input advocated here. NNBIS headquarters is in the
Old Executive Office Building in downtown Washington, and its
regional facilities are located in various Federal buildings
around the country. While such quarters might provide adequate
physical security, they are not equipped to provide for the scope
of the proposed undertaking. A secure facility with sufficient
physical dimensions is crucial, as are secure communications with
participating agency and military headquarters. Ft. Bliss, Texas,
is a potential site, as it provides the necessary physical
security and is located near the present EPIC facility. This and
similar locations should be considered. </p>

<p>The second requirement of the facility proposed here is
enhanced intelligence input. Thorough, &quot;real-time&quot;
intelligence is absolutely vital to effective interdiction, and
it is almost as critically important to other areas of
enforcement operations as well. The importance of intelligence is
such that it is treated as a separate topic below. At this point,
it is sufficient to note that the design of a new center must
from the very outset include the most thorough provisions for the
maximum intelligence contribution permitted by law and physical
and technological capabilities. </p>

<p>Military Support for Interdiction </p>

<p>Perhaps the single most valuable development in the area of
interdiction in recent years has been the assistance rendered by
components of the Department of Defense. Such activities were
constrained somewhat by the Posse Comitatus Act until certain
exemptions to the Act were passed in December 1981. Since that
time the assistance rendered by the military has grown
dramatically. In calendar year 1984 the military provided
assistance to interdiction efforts worth $100 million by Pentagon
calculations. Such assistance is typically in the form of aerial
surveillance, transport of enforcement personnel, and loans of
equipment and personnel as permitted by law. </p>

<p>The role of the Defense Department has become steadily more
active, more innovative, and more flexible. The quality and
quantity of such assistance, however, continue to be limited by
the constraints found in the Posse Comitatus exemptions: military
assistance to law enforcement cannot include direct participation
by military personnel in arrest or seizure activities, and it can
be provided only if it does not affect military preparedness.
Furthermore, law enforcement authorities will be required by the
Economy Act to reimburse the Department of Defense for assistance
provided, unless such assistance is incidental to existing
military operations or provides &quot;equivalent training.&quot;
Reimbursement may also be waived, if such waiver does not
adversely impact military preparedness. In this regard, as in
other, the Department of Defense has been increasingly flexible.
One example of this is the expanded delegation of authority to
waive reimbursement, as found in the January 2, 1985,
modifications to the applicable Departmental directive. Another
is the increasingly positive liaison role being played by the
Department of Defense Task Force on Drug Enforcement. </p>

<p>There are grounds for concern that the military's role
continues to be too narrowly defined. There appears to be a
fundamental misconception at the very top of the Department
concerning the permissible scope of the military's role. Writing
to the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee in June
1985, Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger stated that direct
military participation in drug seizures outside United States
territory would do violence to &quot;the historic separation
between military and civilian spheres of activity . . . one of
the most fundamental principles of American democracy. This
Commission has been unable to find the basis for such a
&quot;fundamental principle&quot; of co-equal &quot;spheres of
activity.&quot; The fact is that the military, rather than being
a parallel entity, has traditionally been subject to the
direction of the civilian &quot;sphere.&quot; Indeed, the
military's Commander-in-Chief is a civilian. The Posse Comitatus
Act does no more than prohibit use of military forces to enforce
civilian laws on the territory of the United States. The
Constitution was in existence for approximately a century before
such a law was passed by Congress. The Act has been amended once
since then, and it can be amended again if appropriate.
Furthermore, there is nothing in the laws of the United States
forbidding an active enforcement role by the military outside
United States territory, except the requirement of reimbursement.
This in turn hinges upon the definition of &quot;military
preparedness.&quot; However, nowhere in the debate over the
military's role in this area has this Commission found a
discussion of this term. The definition of the military's role
has been left to the military itself, which, through the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, has declared that the military shall be prepared
to serve national security by providing: </p>

<p>a defense posture capable of successfully resisting hostile or
destructive action from within or without, overt or covert. </p>

<p>As described in Chapter 3 of this report, international drug
traffickers have regularly formed alliances with insurgent and
terrorist forces in certain countries. In a few instances these
alliances may actually threaten friendly governments. In many
more countries such a combination at least drains resources from
constructive goals and inhibits efforts to build or maintain a
stable democracy. Even where the threat is more remote, it is
clear that the smuggling techniques in use are the very same ones
that are or could be used to move personnel, weapons, and other
supplies for insurgent groups. For these reasons alone, the
activities of traffickers should bring them squarely within the
national security concerns of the Department of Defense. This
fact has already been recognized by the Vice President, who has
stated clearly that &quot;success against drug smuggling is
intimately tied to the continuation of freedom and democracy in
the hemisphere.&quot; Recognition of this fact would permit the
Defense Department much greater latitude in conducting military
operations aimed at disrupting trafficking organizations.
Examples of such programs include a wide range of activities,
such as expanded and focused intelligence gathering, security
assistance to receptive host governments, expanded deployment of
tethered aerostat radar sites, and joint research and development
between military and law enforcement agencies to provide greater
operation compatibility. </p>

<p>Beyond threats to friendly democracies, international drug
traffickers should be considered a threat to our national
security because they comprise a direct attack on the physical
and social well-being of our country. The costs of this invasion,
which comes by air, sea, and land, is thoroughly documented in
this report. Recognition of this attack as a &quot;. . .
destructive action from without . . .&quot; which is within the
meaning of the Joint Chiefs' definition, would bring the
Department of Defense squarely into the war in which we presently
find ourselves. This may be further than present policy makers
are prepared to go, but it is surely time to bring the issue into
the debate so that it can be decided on the basis of what is
actually permitted or proscribed by the laws and Constitution of
the United States. </p>

<p>Domestic Investigations and Prosecutions </p>

<p>Domestic investigative and prosecutive activity is only one
facet of drug law enforcement. As with all other approaches
designed to reduce the supply of drugs, proper assessment of
their effectiveness requires that realistic goals be established.
As this report has demonstrated, it is unrealistic to expect that
domestic law enforcement alone will solve, or even substantially
reduce, the Nation's drug abuse problem. Rather, its goal must be
a more limited one: to increase the arrests and successful
prosecutions of drug traffickers, whether they be importers,
wholesalers, or retailers, and those who assist them, including
pilots, bankers, and attorneys, and the forfeiture of their
properties accumulated from criminal activity. </p>

<p>The attainment of this objective would contribute to the
ultimate national policy goal of eliminating drug use in several
ways. First, it would directly reduce the supply of drugs by
removing from the illicit drug market those drugs that are seized
along with the arrested traffickers. Second, it would reduce the
supply of drugs indirectly by disrupting the networks that make
it possible to distribute drugs efficiently. Finally, the
traffickers would likely raise the price of their product to
reflect the increased risks, which theoretically should cause a
reduction in the overall consumption of drugs. </p>

<p>In a recent study prepared by the Rand Corporation the authors
concluded that prevention programs, not intensified domestic law
enforcement, were the best approach to control adolescent drug
use. The Commission agrees with the Rand Corporation's
conclusions concerning adolescent drug use and believes that they
are equally valid with respect to adult drug use. However, such
conclusions should not be interpreted as a call for a reduction
in domestic law enforcement efforts against drug trafficking.
Without effective domestic law enforcement, the drug abuse
problem, and its concomitant organized crime effects, would be
immeasurably worse. </p>

<p>Although domestic law enforcement has a limited, albeit
essential, role to play in the national effort against drug
abuse, the Commission has concluded, on the basis of its
investigations, hearings, and study, that changes in focus and
attitudes and a rearrangement of priorities must be undertaken to
achieve the maximum effect of domestic law enforcement. Before
discussing these matters, it is necessary first to address two
fundamental issues: (1) Do organized crime policy and drug abuse
policy conflict? and (2) What, if any, should be the level of
interaction and cooperation between Federal law enforcement
agencies on the one hand and State and local agencies on the
other? </p>

<p>Professor Mark H. Moore, a former Special Assistant to the
Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, has
described the objectives of U.S. organized crime policy as
follows: </p>

<p>[T]o suppress the provision of illegal goods and services that
constitute the core of organized crime, to prevent the violence
and corruption that is more characteristic of organized crime
groups than other kinds of criminal activity, and to prevent the
emergence of very large, durable organizations with well
developed capacities for violence and corruption. </p>

<p>This Commission believes that the Nation's drug policy must
have as its goal the elimination of illegal drug use. Domestic
law enforcement contributes to this goal by reducing the supply
of drug in the illegal market and by increasing the prices of
drugs that remain available for purchase. It has been suggested
that the pursuit of the Nation's drug policy, without regard for
its impact on organized crime, may exacerbate the country's
organized crime problem by enriching organized crime groups,
eliminating their competitors, and encouraging trafficking
organizations to become organized crime groups if they are not
already. Although agreeing that such a concern is legitimate,
this Commission has concluded that drug and organized crime
policies do not inherently conflict. Indeed, there is
substantial, if not complete, overlap in the goals of the two
policies because, as the Commission has found, drug trafficking
is a principal activity of organized crime groups. In light of
this, the Commission recommends that targeting high-level
organized-crime trafficking groups, whether they be foreign,
multinational or domestic, should be the top priority of Federal
domestic law enforcement. As Professor Moore has stated: </p>

<p>What is not in conflict, however, is the need of both drug
abuse policy and organized crime policy to develop and use
tactics that are successful in attacking large, entrenched
criminal organizations. This is useful to drug policy, and
essential to organized crime policy. </p>

<p>The Commission is aware that some commentators have criticized
the Federal Government's bias in favor of enforcement against
high-level dealers to the virtual exclusion of lower- or
street-level enforcement. However, the Commission's
recommendation that targeting organized crime trafficking groups
should be the top priority of Federal domestic law enforcement
should not be construed to mean that lower-level enforcement is
not useful and therefore has no place in the Nation's drug
policy. On the contrary, such lower-level enforcement is
essential to achieve the goal of eliminating drug use for several
reasons. As discussed earlier, the arrest of the customers of
drug retailers may result in a direct and immediate reduction in
the demand for drugs. In addition, successful enforcement efforts
directed at lower-level dealers will reduce the supply of illegal
drugs and raise the price of drugs available for purchase, thus
resulting in lower drug consumption. Finally, lower-level
enforcement operations are useful in providing information that
will be invaluable to those involved in investigating high-level
organized crime trafficking groups. The absence of vigorous
lower-level domestic law enforcement could encourage organized
crime groups to remain in drug trafficking, and quite possible
spawn more such groups. High-level enforcement efforts could be
crippled, if not completely undermined, by a lack of a
complementary, lower-level effort. </p>

<p>A fundamental question remains: Which agencies should be
responsible for the various facets of domestic law enforcement?
The investigation of high-level organized crime trafficking
groups, whose activities are generally regional, national or
international in scope, is expensive, time consuming, and
requires special skills and sophisticated tools. The Federal
government, through its agencies, is best equipped to undertake
such investigations. State and local agencies, because of their
unique knowledge of local conditions and expertise in the
required techniques, are more qualified to conduct lower-level
domestic law enforcement, including street operations and
investigations of certain smaller and geographically-restricted
trafficking organizations. </p>

<p>The conclusions and recommendations set forth in the preceding
paragraph are not intended to suggest that Federal domestic law
enforcement and that of State and local agencies should be
completely separate and independent. The drug problem facing the
United States is a national one, and the efforts of all law
enforcement agencies must be coordinated and interrelated to some
extent, if we are to deal successfully with the problem. The
required level of cooperation in some instances may be more than
the routine exchange of drug intelligence or the suppression of
interagency rivalries and jurisdictional disputes. In this
regard, the Commission endorses generally the view expressed
recently by a Federal prosecutor concerning drug enforcement
efforts in New York City: </p>

<p>[O]ne can not compartmentalize the narcotics enforcement
effort, and leave the streets entirely to state and local
enforcement and the conspiracy cases entirely to the federal
government. While each may have a primary area, each must do some
of both. The ideal combination may be some federal prosecution of
state and local arrests, and a significant state and local
participation in joint Task Forces, aimed at dismantling of drug
networks through the conspiracy law. </p>

<p>Examples of successful joint ventures involving Federal, State
and local personnel include the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement
Task Force Program, Operation Pressure Point, and the New York
Drug Enforcement Task Force, which was formed in 1970. These
programs can serve as useful models for any future cooperative
domestic law enforcement arrangements that might be needed. </p>

<p>Federal Domestic Law Enforcement </p>

<p>As a result of its investigation and study, the Commission has
concluded that the tools and techniques needed to permit Federal
law enforcement agents to prosecute their portion of the war
against drug traffickers successfully are for the most part
currently available. The need is not for sweeping new legislative
initiatives but for further changes in attitudes and a greater
commitment to cooperation and coordination among the Federal
agencies involved in drug law enforcement. Balkanization and
jurisdictional disputes between agencies are the most serious
obstacles to success in the struggle against drug trafficking.
The personnel of each Federal agency involved in domestic law
enforcement, from the chief executive to the newest employee,
must understand that their agency alone cannot solve the Nation's
drug problem. Acceptance of this reality will go a long way in
eliminating the destructive competition that in the past has
hampered Federal law enforcement. </p>

<p>As discussed above, the Commission has concluded that the
targeting of high-level organized crime trafficking groups should
be the top priority of Federal drug law enforcement efforts.
Because of the sophistication and complexity of such
organizations and their operations, the Federal response must be
equally sophisticated and complex. The Reagan Administration's
establishment of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force
Program (OCDETF Program) in late 1982 was an attempt to create a
mechanism for attacking high-level organized crime trafficking
groups; by their own account, the multiagency Task Forces,
drawing on the resources of a broad spectrum of Federal, State
and local agencies, have achieved an encouraging degree of
success. The success that has been achieved was not the result of
the development of new techniques but of the efficient use of
existing ones: </p>

<p>The OCDE Task Force Program can lay claim to no new inventions
in the fields of investigative and prosecutorial techniques. It
can, however, be justifiably proud of its creative utilization of
existing tools. </p>

<p>The Commission applauds the OCDETF Program and those who
designed and have implemented it. It strongly favors the
Programs's continuation and expansion, to the extent that it is
desirable and feasible to do so, for several reasons: the Program
has resulted in the elimination of interagency disputes to a
substantial extent; the disruption of large and sophisticated
trafficking groups requires large, efficient and strongly
supported enforcement organizations; and multiagency task forces
are particularly suited to use the Federal conspiracy, Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), Continuing Criminal
Enterprise (CCE), and forfeiture statutes to the maximum and
optimum extent possible. In addition, the different investigative
techniques used by the participating agencies increases the
probability of successful infiltration of trafficking
organizations. However, the effectiveness of the OCDETF Program
could be enhanced if the following changes were made. </p>

<p>In creating the OCDETF Program, its designers concluded that
to insure the maximum support of the participating agencies, a
consensus-based decision-making process was necessary. In this
regard, no single agency was designated as the lead Task Force
agency. Although participants in the OCDETF Program have been
able to reduce interagency competition and conflict to a
substantial and significant extent, the Commission believe that
further improvement is both desirable and feasible. Such
improvements would flow naturally from a renewed, unambiguous
commitment to the Program and its goals by participating
agencies. Increased cooperation and coordination might also
result, if DEA or the FBI were designated as the lead Task Force
agency, or if the United States Attorneys were given greater
authority with respect to the operations of the Task Force. The
Commission recommends that those in charge of the OCDETF Program
should consider whether a lead agency should be designated or a
U.S. Attorney be given greater authority to achieve even greater
coordination of effort. </p>

<p>Law enforcement agencies that participate in the OCDETF
Program have other missions in the struggle against drug
trafficking. For this reason, each &quot;agency must balance its
commitment to the Task Force concept with its fundamental
mission. Because the targeting of high-level organized crime
trafficking groups should be the top priority and because the
OCDE Task Forces are the best available devices for infiltrating
and disrupting such groups, the Commission is concerned that, in
allocating manpower and other resources between the program and
other missions, the participating agencies should not shortchange
the Task Forces in any way. The top echelon of each participating
agency must be strongly committed to the OCDETF Program and its
goals and must be actively involved in assuring its success. The
required commitment and involvement are not satisfied by
abdicating responsibility for insuring the success of the program
to those heading field offices. Indifference at the headquarters
level will be reflected eventually in field offices. </p>

<p>To signal their commitment to the program and to encourage
their best agents to participate in it, the top executives of
each participating agency should adopt an unambiguous policy that
salary increases and career advancement within the agency for an
agent who participates in an OCDE Task Force will not be
adversely affected in any way by that participation. Such a
policy would require that the evaluation of an agent assigned to
a Task Force be based not on such criteria as the number of
arrests or cases made or the amount of drugs seized. Evaluations
should assess that agent's qualitative performance in complex
financial and conspiracy cases, which may last more than two
years and which may result in the arrest of few, albeit
high-level and important traffickers. </p>

<p>The OCDETF Program is only one facet of the Federal effort
against drug trafficking. The effective functioning of the other
facets of Federal domestic law enforcement, i.e., Organized Crime
Strike Forces, the South Florida Task Force, the FBI, DEA,
Customs, and U.S. Attorneys, is also essential if the Nation's
drug problem is ever to be contained and eventually eliminated. </p>

<p>That the OCDE Task Forces are and should be primarily
responsible for disrupting high-level organized crime trafficking
groups does not mean that the other Federal efforts should be
devoted to, or focused upon, lower -or street-level traffickers
or purely local drug problems. For the reasons discussed above,
these enforcement concerns are rightfully and almost exclusively
those of State and local law enforcement. However, there will be
cases against organized crime trafficking groups that will be
deemed inappropriate for OCDETF treatment, and these will then
have to be handled by some other Federal agency; this is also
true with respect to large trafficking organizations that are not
organized crime controlled and that may or may not be
multi-jurisdictional. </p>

<p>As a result of its investigation and study, the Commission has
concluded that the non-OCDETF Program segments of Federal
domestic drug law enforcement are for the most part functioning
well and that the variety of investigative techniques that these
agencies bring to the Federal effort to reduce the supply of
drugs is a great benefit. The use of financial expertise,
undercover, sting and reverse sting operations, informants,
electronic and other kinds of surveillance, preselected target
and target of opportunity approaches to initiating
investigations, and buy-bust transactions are all useful ways of
infiltrating trafficking organizations. However, the Commission
is concerned that the healthy competition among enforcement
agencies that the current organizational structure is supposed to
encourage often degenerates into jurisdictional conflicts that
harm the overall Federal effort against traffickers. This will
continue to occur unless top agency officials instill in their
agents and employees the sense that genuine cooperation and
coordination with other agencies are essential to the ultimate
success of the Nation's drug effort. In this regard, the National
Drug Enforcement Policy Board has an important and unique role to
play insuring that healthy and constructive competition does not
become destructive and petty conflict. </p>

<p>The Board could take one important step to eliminate
jurisdictional disputes, as well as to avoid duplication of
investigative efforts and to provide maximum safety to drug
agents. This would be to require the establishment of a system
whereby an agency would file a report with a central reporting
repository, once it has opened an investigation of an individual
believed to be a part of a trafficking operation. If two or more
agencies were investigating the same individual, they would be
notified of that fact, and they would be required to decide,
after negotiations, the best way for conducting the
investigation, a single agency or an ad hoc task force. Such a
system would work at its optimal level only if all law
enforcement agencies, including State and local units,
participated. The Commission believes that such a reporting and
control system is highly desirable and, because of existing
technology, feasible. The Commission also believes that this
system could be incorporated easily into the all-source
intelligence and operations center, recommended elsewhere in this
report. </p>

<p>As result of the 1973 reorganization plan, the Customs Service
was prohibited from conducting investigative, intelligence, and
law enforcement functions, relating to the suppression of drug
trafficking, at locations away from ports of entry or borders.
This aspect of the plan has been controversial and as elicited
much criticism on the ground that is weakened the &quot;Nation's
capability to interdict the flow of narcotics into the United
States.&quot; </p>

<p>The Commission has no objections to that feature of the 1973
reorganization plan that created a lead agency in Federal drug
law enforcement, and indeed believes that it remains a valid
concept today. However, the Commission has concluded that it is
an appropriate time to study whether the functions of the Customs
Service with respect to drug trafficking should be expanded to
include investigative, intelligence, and law enforcement
functions within this country, beyond the borders and ports of
entry, where appropriate and subject to the oversight and
supervision of the lead agencies. In this respect, the Commission
notes that the 1973 reorganization plan was modified somewhat
when, on January 5, 1984, the Attorney General signed the
&quot;Request for Assistance and Authorization Respecting Drug
Enforcement Activities of Certain Customs Officers in Domestic
Drug Investigations.&quot; This action granted authority to the
DEA Administrator to endow specific Customs agents, for a
designated period of time, with the power, among others, to
conduct investigative, intelligence, and law enforcement
functions relating to drug trafficking. Because this arrangement
appears to have worked well, a broader expansion of Customs'
functions may be warranted at this time in an effort to improve
domestic law enforcement. </p>

<p>In addition to the attitudinal and organizational matters
discussed above, the Commission proposes substantial expansion of
the use of one particular investigative technique because of the
magnitude of illicit drug production in this country. All of the
PCP (phencyclidine), almost all of the methamphetamine, and an
estimated 80 percent of injectable amphetamine available
illicitly in the United States in 1984 were produced in domestic
clandestine laboratories. In addition, an increasing amount of
cocaine in being processed in this country. In fact, the number
of cocaine laboratories seized by law enforcement authorities in
the United States between 1983 and 1984 nearly doubled. </p>

<p>To combat both the domestic and foreign production of illicit
drugs, law enforcement officials have, in some instances,
targeted the chemicals used to manufacture the drugs. For
example, through its &quot;Operation Chem-Con,&quot; DEA tracks
the movement of chemicals used to process cocaine from the
principal manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers to their final
destinations. According to the chief of the DEA's cocaine
section, Johnny Phelps: </p>

<p>Through cooperation gained by DEA from the world's ether
industry and foreign law enforcement elements, we now have
voluntary restrictions on sales to known trafficking groups and
are able to seize shipments of chemicals after purchase causing
great financial losses to cocaine producing consort[ia]. </p>

<p>In addition to the voluntary compliance of chemical companies
in Operation Chem-Con, reporting requirements are sometimes used
to control chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs.
Piperidine, a chemical used to manufacture the hallucinogen PCP,
is subject to reporting requirements under the Controlled
Substances Act. The provision requires that any person selling
piperidine report to the Attorney General information concerning
the sale, including identifying information about the purchaser,
and the quantity, form and intended use of the piperidine. This
system has worked well and permits DEA to investigate any
suspicious sales of piperidine. Since 1984 DEA has seized four
clandestine PCP laboratories and has located at least ten other
operations, which obtained chemicals for PCP manufacture by
posing as legitimate businesses. </p>

<p>Chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs can be regulated
in the same manner as controlled substances. Under the Controlled
Substances Act, the Attorney General may place an immediate
precursor in the same schedule as the controlled substance for
which it is a precursor. </p>

<p>Although the regulation of chemicals used to manufacture
illicit drugs can thwart efforts to produce these drugs and can
help law enforcement officials to locate clandestine
laboratories, several factors limit the effectiveness of such
approaches. First, many of these chemicals have widespread
legitimate uses in industry, and tracking their sales would be
impractical. Even tracking a limited number of these chemicals
would be costly, requiring adequate computer resources and
individuals to review and analyze chemical sales information.
Second, controls on chemicals may have only short-term effects.
In the case of the reporting of piperidine, both use of PCP and
clandestine laboratory activity appeared to decline from 1979 to
1981. However, by 1982, trafficking in and abuse of PCP had
increased. Third, some chemicals can be obtained illicitly. For
example, a shortage of P2P (phenyl-2-propanone), which is used to
manufacture methamphetamine, resulted from the placement of P2P
in Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. Traffickers
responded by increasing illicit manufacture of P2P in 1982. </p>

<p>Despite these limitations, controlling a limited number of
these chemicals has merit. The United Nations International
Narcotics Control Board has identified the following chemicals as
suitable targets for control: ether, used to process cocaine;
acetic anhydride, (heroin); P2P, (methamphetamine); ergotamine
(LSD); anthranilic acid (methaqualone); and piperidine (PCP).
This United Nations Board has called on countries in which
illicit drug manufacture occurs to impose a licensing system and
quotas for supplying and importation of these chemicals. </p>

<p>For the foregoing reasons, the Commission recommends that DEA
should determine which chemicals currently used to manufacture
illicit drugs should be subject to reporting requirements or
placed in a schedule of the Controlled Substances Act. This
review should included a consideration of which drugs are most
abused, which have the most serious consequences, and which
precursor chemicals are essential to the production process. In
addition, DEA should identify the resources needed for the
computerization, analysis and follow-up of reports concerning
chemicals selected for monitoring. </p>

<p>The Commission's final recommendations concerning Federal
domestic law enforcement relate to the Federal agents and
employees who are most involved in the Federal effort against
drugs. This country owes these agents the greatest possible
amount of protection and assistance against the vicious and
ruthless participants in organized crime trafficking
organizations. As the testimony of drug pilot Adler Barriman Seal
before this Commission revealed, because of the massive amounts
of money involved, high-level traffickers are able to procure and
use the products of the latest technological advances to
facilitate their trafficking operations. Drug agents must also be
given access to such state of the art equipment and weapons. In
this regard, the research and development operations of Federal
drug law enforcement agencies should work closely with field
agents to produce the equipment and tools needed to defeat drug
traffickers. </p>

<p>Finally, this Commission has made several recommendations
designed to improve Federal domestic law enforcement. However,
the men and women involved in the day-to-day effort against drug
trafficking have the most incentive and are the best qualified to
offer suggestions as to how to improve domestic law enforcement.
These &quot;experts&quot; should be encouraged to make
recommendations and should be rewarded for the ones that are
successful. </p>

<p>State and Local Domestic Law Enforcement </p>

<p>The role of State and local agencies in the national campaign
against drugs has been described above: they have the primary
responsibility for lower- and street-level enforcement because of
their proximity to the affected areas and because they possess or
can adopt the tools necessary for carrying out their mission. The
successful accomplishment of the mission of State and local law
enforcement agencies is a desirable end, in and of itself,
because harassment and disruption of drug retailers and smaller
or geographically-restricted distribution networks could lead to
a reduction in the supply of drugs, an increase in the price of
the drugs remaining in the marketplace, and discouragement of
non-drug users from experimenting with drugs. Successful
completion of this mission will also permit State and local
authorities to provide Federal law enforcement agencies with
information that will be invaluable to the latter in infiltrating
and disrupting high-level organized crime and other large
trafficking organizations. The leaders of State and local
agencies must constantly reiterate to their agents that their
efforts cannot be viewed in isolation and that they are part of
much larger national campaign against drugs. Such indoctrination
will result in the kind of cooperation and coordination essential
to the success of the overall national effort. </p>

<p>Effective State and local domestic drug law enforcement will
undoubtedly require increased expenditures, including the
expansion of prison facilities. Although the drug problem is
quite correctly denominated a National one, its devastating
effects are most pronounced at the State and local levels.
Therefore, the Commission recommends that State and local
governments determine what is necessary to permit their law
enforcement agencies to carry out their drug mission successfully
and do all they can to convince their citizens that any required
increase in expenditures is absolutely essential. Such a campaign
will be considerably more palatable if it includes a large
segment of funding from seized drug revenues and assets, as
described below. </p>

<p>The Commission has concluded that if a State is serious about
responding to the drug problem within its jurisdiction it must
provide its law enforcement agencies with certain tools that are
available to their Federal counterparts. The Commission therefore
recommends that those States, which do not already have such
statutes, consider enacting legislation patterned after the
following Federal statutes: Bail Reform Act of 1984, the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act;
statutory use and derivative use immunity for witnesses;
statutory criminal and civil forfeiture provisions; the
Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE) statute; Title III of the
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (electronic
surveillance); and the Currency and Foreign Transactions
Reporting Act. In addition, the Commission recommends that, where
appropriate, States consider adopting statewide grand juries,
with public reporting authority, to improve their investigations
of drug trafficking organizations and eliminating accomplice
corrobation statutes or rules. Although the Commission is
cognizant that there may be legitimate State constitutional
objections to the adoption of some provisions and devices, the
Commission nevertheless believes that each has increased the
effectiveness of Federal domestic law enforcement and would
similarly increase the effectiveness of State and local law
enforcement agencies in infiltrating and disrupting trafficking
groups. </p>

<p>Foreign Assistance </p>

<p>Because the majority of drugs consumed in the United States is
produced abroad, a primary component of our national strategy is
international cooperation to control drugs. A prerequisite of
this strategy is the cooperation of drug producing and
trafficking nations. While this has proved difficult or even
impossible in some situations, due to the political, economic or
social instability of some drug producing countries,
international cooperation can contribute to our national effort
to reduce drug consumption. </p>

<p>The United States provides various forms of assistance to
other countries to help them in their anti-drug efforts,
including both economic and military aid. According to the 1984
National Strategy For Prevention of Drug Abuse and Drug
Trafficking, the objectives of the U.S. international strategy
are: </p>

<p>. . . strengthening U.S. efforts to assist foreign governments
in stopping the production and transportation of illicit drugs
and improving interdiction efforts in transit nations;
encouraging and assisting governments of producer nations to
undertake crop control programs as the most effective means of
curbing production; developing innovative mutual assistance
treaties with foreign governments, directed at facilitating
judicial actions against the drug trade, seizing assets derived
from drug trafficking, eliminating banking procedures which hide
illicit drug transactions, and extradition and other legal
arrangements; encouraging other nations to support international
narcotics control programs, financially and with other resources,
including developmental assistance linked with crop control and
cooperative law enforcement efforts; encouraging international
organizations and development banks to link their assistance with
narcotics control objectives, where appropriate; and curtailing
the diversion of pharmaceuticals and chemicals from legitimate
international commerce. </p>

<p>Indications are increasing that the concern over drug-related
problems is becoming universal. This growing concern is due
largely to recognition by governments in both developed and
less-developed countries, that the illicit production,
trafficking and abuse of drugs pose serious problems to their
nations' development, their societies, and in some cases, to
their national security. The multiple effects of drug trafficking
are increasingly felt in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and
Southwest Asia. These effects include crime, corruption, economic
destabilization, political manipulation, and epidemic drug abuse.
Much of the increased anti-drug activity in South American
countries in the past two years correlates directly to the
emergence of domestic drug problems in those countries, and their
awareness of their own vulnerability to the myriad problems
related to drug abuse. </p>

<p>At a time when drug traffickers rule segments of some
countries, and dominate local economies in others, an increasing
number of nations are realizing that passivity is not the answer.
This realization is encouraging efforts for more cooperation with
the United States in its multilateral enforcement and demand
reduction programs. Reduction in the demand for drugs in the
United States and abroad is beginning to be perceived by drug
producing and trafficking nations as a vital component in the
fight against drug abuse. It is an objective that has greater
long term potential for producing action by source nation
governments than do efforts perceived as benefiting the United
States exclusively. </p>

<p>The Commission recognizes the importance of existing
international drug control efforts. Because drug trafficking and
production are threats to the stability of existing democracies,
a primary goal of the United States and its allies should be to
enhance the security of drug producing and transshipment regions.
Because some source countries are promoting drug control in the
interests of their own national security and public welfare more
actively than they have in the past, it is an opportune time for
the United States to intensify its international drug control
efforts. The success of these efforts requires the political and
financial support of a much broader coalition within the
international community. </p>

<p>The United States offers assistance to numerous countries
around the world with drug abuse and trafficking problems,
primarily through the Department of State's Bureau of
International Narcotics Matters, the Agency for International
Development, and the United States Information Agency. The United
States currently supports crop eradication programs in 14
countries and is working to develop such programs in several
others. These control efforts are vitally enhanced by the public
adareness programs sponsored by the Department of State, the
Agency for International Development, and the United States
Information Agency. </p>

<p>There has been an ongoing debate in this country concerning
the wisdom of making foreign assistance, both general and
drug-related, conditional on the progress of drug control
efforts. Proponents of utilizing existing authority to suspend
aid to any nation not taking steps to control drug production
claim that the United States should employ this leverage as a
final step in forcing nations to stop drug production. Opponents
feel that sustained aid is necessary to achieve U.S.-supported
drug control objectives and that an aid cut-off might undermine
other U.S. interests in some cases. </p>

<p>The National Drug Enforcement Policy Board is now in a central
position in this area, as in all others in the anti-drug effort.
It should carefully evaluate the data used in the President's
annual decision whether to suspend aid to drug producing or
transshipment countries, and make a suitable recommendation to
the President for his ultimate decision. </p>

<p>Extradition and mutual assistance treaties can also contribute
to international drug control efforts by enhancing diplomatic
initiatives and providing leverage in United States' foreign
policy decisions. Clauses in several existing treaties are
particularly innovative and worthy of inclusion in future
agreements. The willingness of a country to engage in and
actively implement drug-related extradition and mutual assistance
treaties should be a primary consideration in ultimate U.S.
policy decisions regarding foreign assistance to a country, and
should be weighed in the deliberations of the President and the
policy Board described above. </p>

<p>The Department of State, in conjunction with the Department of
Defense, should continue its program of expanded economic
assistance with emphasis on assisting those foreign governments
making concerted efforts to control their drug problems. At the
same time, a recognition that drug trafficking has become a
national security issue should lead to the availability and use
of security assistance funds. The effectiveness of such
assistance is, of course, dependent upon the political will of
the host government. To encourage this, the United States should
raise the drug issue to the highest level possible in bilateral
relations with producer and trafficker nations. Similarly, the
United States should raise the drug issue in terns of
international security with its industrialized allies. This
should occur not only in the United Nations, but also on a
bilateral and multilateral basis. This would provide incentive in
urging those nations to increase their assistance and cooperation
within the region and in urging those nations to raise the issue
as a high priority in their bilateral relations with the producer
and trafficking nations. </p>

<p>In addition to these efforts to reduce the supply of drugs,
international efforts to reduce the demand for drugs are an
important component of U.S. strategy. The United States should,
therefore, continue to help producer nations develop prevention
and education programs aimed at drug abuse within the producer
and trafficker nations. </p>

<p>Indications are overwhelming that the world community in
general realizes the dangers inherent in drug use. In the past,
many nations regarded drug abuse as aberrational social behavior,
and relegated governmental reaction, if there was any at all, to
law enforcement or social/health ministries. As international
awareness of the actual nature and scope of the threat of drug
abuse increases, however, nations are placing the issue where it
belongs: within the realm of national security. </p>

<p>Source Country Crop Control </p>

<p>Strategies to control drug trafficking and drug abuse in the
United States have traditionally included measures designed to
eliminate illicit drug supplies at their source. These
&quot;source country eradication&quot; measures, primarily the
manual elimination or uprooting of illicit drug crops and the use
of herbicides to kill illicit plants, remain a central focus of
this country's anti-drug efforts. The 1984 National Strategy for
the Prevention of Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking clearly states
U.S. policy in this regard: </p>

<p>Fundamental to the overall supply reduction effort is
eliminating illegal drugs as close to their source as possible.
The major gains will be realized in the longer term reduction in
the availability of illicit drugs. </p>

<p>Since 1978 the Department of State's Bureau of International
Narcotics Matters (BINM) has had primary responsibility for
overseeing and implementing foreign drug production control
efforts. BINM provides bilateral assistance for crop control and
interdiction programs in drug source countries in the form of
equipment, training and technical advisory services. BINM's
stated objective is: </p>

<p>to control production simultaneously in all key sectors of
illicit drugs exported to the United States so that significant
and lasting reductions in availability are achieved . . . .
Preventing cultivation and destroying illicit narcotics at their
source will prove to be the most effective means of reducing
availability. . . . BINM's first priority is on crop control -
government bans on cultivation production, enforced by manual or
chemical crop eradication. </p>

<p>In a successful crop control system drugs would be stopped at
their source, thereby alleviating the &quot;chain reaction&quot;
associated with drug trafficking and drug abuse in this country.
In fact, crop reduction efforts have at best enjoyed limited
success. Despite the fact that nearly all drug producing and
transit countries are signatories to a 1961 agreement that
restricts production and distribution of certain drugs to only
medical and scientific uses, drug production has escalated in
most source countries in the past 20 years. Increased production
has resulted in decreased prices and wider availability of most
illicit drugs in the United States. Accordingly, domestic
consumption of many drugs has increased. </p>

<p>The effectiveness of efforts to control illicit drug crops in
source countries is inherently limited. First, many source
country governments are not motivated to reduce crop production,
either because the profits obtained from the illicit crops are
essential to the economic and/or political stability of the
country, or because they view drug consumption as an exclusively
American problem. In addition, many drugs that are illegal in the
United States are traditionally consumed in milder forms by
source country natives and are viewed as necessities of life or
an essential part of their culture. </p>

<p>Secondly, in many cases farmers do not have an easily
available alternative crop. In any case, an illicit drug crop can
provide a farmer with far more income than any legitimate crop
and is therefore likely to be selected above any other crop for
cultivation. </p>

<p>Third, the governments in many producing areas are weak and do
not exert control over growers. The Thai and Burmese governments
have long been fighting insurgent groups in the Northwest
Frontier Provinces, where most of the Golden Triangle opium is
grown. The Peruvian government has had little effective control
in remote coca producing regions controlled by that country's
Shining Path Guerrillas. Even where governments aggressively
pursue crop eradication programs, difficulties are sometimes
overwhelming. </p>

<p>Fourth, some major source countries are controlled by
governments hostile to the United States, who while adopting
policies to reduce domestic consumption, have no hesitation about
importation of illicit drugs to the United States. Because many
source country governments are politically and economically
unstable, United States diplomatic relations with even nonhostile
source country governments are often very complex. </p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the set of source
countries is not fixed. When a crop is successfully reduced in
one country, production begins or increases in another country.
New producers constantly emerge. This shifting has been observed
repeatedly throughout the history of source country control
efforts, even where the United States has claimed major crop
eradication successsses. This has been the most serious obstacle
to total crop reduction efforts. </p>

<p>U.S. and Mexican efforts provide an example. The crop
eradication program conducted in the mid-1970's in Mexico is
often cited as a successful model. Through the program, the
United States supplied equipment, herbicide and funds for the
eradication of opium poppies, primarily in Northern Mexico. While
Mexican heroin production declined after the program's
implementation, heroin production in and export from the Golden
Triangle and the Golden Crescent accelerated, and within five
years, total heroin available in the United States reached levels
equal to those attained before the Mexican eradication program.
Mexican heroin production has increased every year since 1980,
and in 1984 that country provided an estimated 21 percent of the
total U.S. supply. </p>

<p>Despite the limitations of source country control programs,
the efforts to reduce international illicit drug crops are
essential to the overall U.S. drug strategy. Implemented
selectively and judiciously, crop control programs could
effectively reduce the availability of targeted illicit drugs in
the United States, if only on a temporary basis. As viewed by the
Select Committee on Narcotics, </p>

<p>Effective action in relatively few countries, against the
production and trafficking of opium, heroin, coca, cocaine,
marijuana and hashish would have a great impact on the drug abuse
problem in the United States by dramatically curtailing supplies
available to users and potential users . . . </p>

<p>The United States, through the Department of State, should
focus crop control efforts in those countries where political and
economic climates will make the success of crop eradication
programs probable. Particular crop control opportunities could
best be determined if the State Department established a cadre of
professional drug officers. Currently, international drug
programs are often managed by contract personnel or by Foreign
Service Officers not especially interested in drug issues.
Narcotics Assistance Unit positions within the Foreign Service
often remain unfilled for long periods of time because Foreign
Service Officers often view them as a detriment to their careers.
The absence of a specialized drug group within the Foreign
Service structure thus impacts negatively on the overall
international drug effort. The Department of State should
recognize Narcotics Assistance Unit positions as priority
assignments, and integrate them into the career advancement
structure. </p>

<p>BINM should also examine the possibility of introducing source
country farmers to more imaginative and feasible alternatives to
illicit drug cultivation. The available options are currently
limited to cultivating licit replacement crops but could possibly
include the mining of indigenous minerals and the introduction of
light industry to a traditional growing region. </p>

<p>Finally, the importance of international crop controls in the
context of the overall drug reduction strategy should be
reevaluated. The limitations inherent in these programs, the
majority of which are beyond the control of the United States,
make them a less likely success than other strategies discussed
elsewhere in this report. In addition, the problems associated
with international controls, most notably the relentless shifting
of drug crop cultivations to non-targeted countries, underscores
the ultimate importance of reducing the demand for drugs in this
country. History has shown that as long as consumer demand for an
illicit drug is strong, some country, somewhere, will become a
source country.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter VII Reducing the Demand for Drugs </h2>

<p>The Limitations of Tactics Affecting Supply </p>

<p>Traditionally, efforts to reduce the trafficking and abuse of
illicit drugs in this country have been based on the theory that
significant reductions of drug supplies would lead to equal
reductions in drug-related problems. While this seems plausible,
a review of the 75-year history of these efforts reveals that
they have not reduced social, economic or crime problems related
to drugs. Despite continuing expressions of determination,
America's war on drugs seems nowhere close to success. Now more
than ever, drugs present problems of vast proportions. </p>

<p>This does not suggest that efforts to reduce supply, such as
crop eradication, border interdiction, and prosecution, have
failed. To the contrary, they have achieved a measure of success.
In 1983, for example, authorities estimated that approximately 10
percent of the drugs destined for illicit markets were
interdicted. Crop eradication programs were significantly
expanded in Colombia, where most of the world's cocaine is
processed and nearly one-half of the marijuana consumed in the
United States is grown. In addition, indictments and convictions
of some of the world's most notorious traffickers have been
obtained in recent years. </p>

<p>Despite these efforts, American consumption of cocaine
increased an estimated 12 percent and dangerous drug use
increased an estimated 15 percent between 1983 and 1984. Cocaine,
heroin, amphetamine, and methamphetamine-related deaths
increased, as did cocaine, PCP, and methamphetamine-related
emergency room visits. </p>

<p>In short, strategies to reduce supply are &quot;working&quot;
by some standards, but only to a limited degree. </p>

<p>Although some inherent factors limit the effectiveness of
these tactics, the overwhelming and continuing demand for illicit
drugs among Americans is the primary cause of their limited
success. Millions want illicit drugs and are willing to violate
the law, spend billions of dollars, and in many cases risk their
lives to obtain them. </p>

<p>Supply Versus Demand </p>

<p>Although the supply of and demand for drugs have often been
considered separate issues, by both the public and private
sectors, they are in fact inseparable parts of a single problem.
The success of supply efforts are related to commitments made to
reduce the demand for drugs through drug abuse education,
treatment, research, vigorous enforcement of drug abuse laws, and
effective sentencing. Drug supply and demand operate in an
interrelated and dynamic manner. The strategies employed to limit
each should be similarly connected. </p>

<p>The national fight against illicit drugs relies on two
fundamental strategies: organized crime policy and drug abuse
policy. Organized crime policy targets specific criminal groups
and seeks to destroy those already in existence and prevent the
emergence of new ones. In contrast, drug abuse policy attempts to
reduce drug use and its associated adverse effects.
Theoretically, organized crime policy and drug abuse policy can
conflict. Reducing the demand for drugs advances the goals of
both organized crime policy and drug abuse policy. A
significantly smaller drug market, which would likely result from
a substantially reduced demand for drugs, would attack organized
crime groups by limiting the huge profits currently available in
drug trafficking, while simultaneously reducing the number of
drug users, the goal of drug abuse policy. </p>

<p>A clear example of the relationship of supply and demand is
provided by the case of heroin trafficker Cecily Lermusiaux, who
with several associates, moved heroin into an area of Las Vegas
where its use among &quot;middle to high-class whites&quot; was
previously unknown. In a scheme which began with the distribution
of free samples of heroin, Lermusiaux's independent heroin
business generated a profit of several million dollars in
approximately six years. </p>

<p>The demand for drugs is also widely recognized as the fuel
that the illicit drug industry needs to operate. According to
Colombian President Belisario Bentancur: </p>

<p>In the world war against narcotics, we need the commitment of
the consumer nations to attack the traffic with the same vigor we
have shown. We can make all the sacrifices possible, but if there
is enormous demand, production will never be completely
eradicated. </p>

<p>This sentiment has been echoed by the other side of the law.
Carlos Lehder, who heads one of Colombia's most notorious cocaine
cartels, sees the American demand for drugs as the driving force
behind the &quot;bonanza&quot; of drug trafficking: </p>

<p>The demand for drugs in the United States is so great that the
producer countries like Colombia play a really tiny role compared
to the total consumption of the United States. </p>

<p>Tactics to Reduce Demand </p>

<p>Efforts to reduce demand are not hampered by international
political complications, or other factors that limit the
effectiveness of tactics to reduce supply. This Commission is of
the opinion that since reducing demand is the single policy
option pursuable entirely within our own borders, it deserves
greater attention. </p>

<p>More successful tactics to reduce demand may in the long-run
decrease the need for current high levels of funding for
approaches to reduce supply. A significant reduction in the
demand for drugs as a complement to aggressive enforcement
efforts is likely to make drug trafficking less lucrative for
organized crime and thus prompt many organized crime groups to
drop out of the drug business. According to analyst Mark Kleiman:
</p>

<p>Demand reduction is clearly the strategy of choice with
respect to its effects on organized crime . . . anything that
tends to depress demand will reduce both trafficking-related
ancillary crime and the level of drug enforcement resources
needed to attain any given level of reduction in drug
consumption. </p>

<p>Skeptics have argued that past tactics to reduce demand have
not been successful. However, the history of drug abuse
prevention and treatment programs has been relatively short. It
was not until the upsurge of drug use in the 1960's that these
programs developed. Some early prevention approaches were
ill-conceived. For example, they often presented information
about drugs without persuasive arguments to deter their use, and
other programs used exaggerated information. Such programs have
been criticized for unintentionally encouraging experimentation
with drugs or squandering the credibility of anti-drug
information. The most recent and effective drug abuse education
and prevention programs focus on the psychological and
sociological factors that contribute to the onset of drug use.
Drug education programs must be continually evaluated and
improved to keep pace with changing drug abuse patterns. </p>

<p>In a model program, the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA) used the strategy of the anti-smoking campaigns of the
late 1970's, which many feel were effective, to develop its
&quot;Just Say No&quot; campaign against drug use which
recognizes the impact of social pressure. NIDA seeks to show
adolescents through a music video, television commercials, and
other media that they can turn down drugs by simply saying
&quot;no&quot; to them. </p>

<p>While it is difficult to measure precisely the effectiveness
of such anti-drug advertising, it is clear that the media can
help shape attitudes. Just as beliefs about cigarette smoking
have changed in recent years, so too can attitudes about drugs.
Anti-drug advertising has an advantage over the anti-smoking
campaigns: drug dealers cannot openly advertise their product.
According to the New York advertising firm of Trout and Ries, </p>

<p>Unlike cigarette manufacturers, drug producers and sellers
cannot use advertising to promote a fashionable image for their
drugs. Quite the opposite, the government can use advertising to
make drugs less and less fashionable to use. This, if America
runs true to form, will dramatically reduce demand. When it's
'out' in America, it doesn't sell. </p>

<p>Reducing the demand for drugs requires a long-term commitment
because it takes time to change attitudes. This commitment must
be made by Federal, State, and local governments and the private
sector. Each must unequivocally reassert that any and all illicit
drug use is unacceptable in light of the effects of drugs on
individuals, families, communities, and governments. It is only
in this context that a war against drugs that seeks to limit both
the supply of and demand for drugs can be effective. </p>

<p>Federal Government </p>

<p>Federal Priorities </p>

<p>Three of the five elements of the current National Strategy
for Prevention of Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking are directed to
reduction of demand: drug abuse prevention, medical
detoxification and treatment, and research. </p>

<p>The importance of reducing demand has, in addition, been,
publicly acknowledged by leading law enforcement officials.
According to Attorney General Edwin Meese III, for example: </p>

<p>All the enforcement efforts that we can try in this country,
all the police agencies in this nation and worldwide will never
be able to stem the supply of drugs in this nation until we have
first decreased the number of users and have decreased the demand
for these drugs. </p>

<p>John Lawn, administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), concurs: </p>

<p>Were we [DEAl to increase dramatically in size, the drug
problem would continue to exist until we could do something about
demand reduction. </p>

<p>While the importance of strategies to reduce demand has been
acknowledged, it is reduction of supply that has consumed the
bulk of the Federal drug abuse budget. This may be due, in part,
to the fact that certain enforcement operations are inherently
more expensive, and they are exclusively a Federal function. In
addition, primary responsibility for developing and maintaining
programs to reduce demand has been shifted to the States and the
private sector. </p>

<p>The concept of our current National Strategy, assigning
complementary roles to the Federal government, on the one hand,
and State and local governments and the private sector, on the
other, is commendable for its recognition of the unique roles of
each component. However, the adoption of this coordinated
approach carries with it the responsibility for ensuring that the
components perform in a truly coordinated and complementary
fashion. There is insufficient evidence today that this
responsibility is being met. Moreover, in precisely the same way
that approaches to reduce supply recognize a unique Federal
capability, there are certain functions in the area of demand
that, by their nature, can only be performed by the Federal
government. The Federal government's exclusive role in reducing
the demand for drugs includes providing national coordination in
the conduct of research, gathering nationwide data, and
developing and disseminating standards for drug prevention and
treatment programs across the country. </p>

<p>Current budgetary figures reflect the emphasis on drug law
enforcement. while programs to reduce demand at one time received
the larger share of the Federal budget, the focus on enforcement
has increased dramatically during the last decade. For example,
between fiscal year 82 and 86, Federal funding for drug abuse
prevention has decreased by 5 percent, while Federal funding for
drug law enforcement has increase by 70 percent. For fiscal year
1986 Federal expenditures on drug law enforcement constitute 84
percent of the total Federal drug abuse budget outlay of $1.7
billion. Interdiction alone consumes 38 percent of this budget.
In the same year Federal funding for drug abuse prevention
constitutes one percent, treatment and rehabilitation 6 percent,
and research 4 percent of the total Federal drug abuse budget. </p>

<p>In addition to this funding the Federal government provides
funding to the States for drug abuse prevention and treatment
through the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Block Grants.
For fiscal year 1986 between $65 and $244 million is made
available to the States for drug programs. However, prior to 1981
under the formula grant program, 40 percent more funds were
available to the States for these purposes. A thorough review of
the current budgetary allotments for anti-drug efforts, now
contemplated by the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board,
should be placed at the top of the agenda of the Board
immediately. This Commission concludes that such a review will
indicate that greater Federal resources should be devoted to
programs to reduce demand, and that the Board should pursue
appropriate action without hesitation. </p>

<p>Asset Forfeiture </p>

<p>Expanded efforts to reduce demand would, of course, require
additional funding at all levels. A particularly promising source
of such funding is the considerable amount of money and property
obtained annually through forfeiture and seized by law
enforcement officials. In 1984 Federal agencies obtained an
estimated $400 to 450 million through the forfeiture and seizure
of drug traffickers assets. Rudolph Guiliani, U.S. Attorney for
the Southern District of New York, observes: </p>

<p>The drug dealers are just about paying for the drug law
enforcement, and hopefully we can get them to pay for drug
education. </p>

<p>Under current policy, the Federal government channels all
seized and forfeited assets into Federal, State, and local law
enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice Assets
Forfeiture Fund. Presently, no portion of these funds is used for
Federal drug demand reduction programs, such as prevention,
treatment, and research. However, pending legislation is being
considered that would direct use of portions of the Assets
Forfeiture Fund for drug abuse prevention and treatment programs.
A portion of the Federal government's asset forfeiture fund
derived from drug cases should be devoted to programs to reduce
demand in whatever proportion is indicated by the Policy Board's
budgetary review. Funding to reduce demand should include a
responsible contribution to the States for their own programs in
this area. However, any funding directed to the States should be
made contingent upon their vigorous pursuit of such programs, and
after a reasonable grace period, funding should be denied to any
State failing this requirement. Failure to enact State electronic
surveillance measures and asset forfeiture provisions, with the
proceeds thereof directed to anti-drug programs, should
constitute per se failure. </p>

<p>Research </p>

<p>Because data concerning drug abuse are in many instances
relatively incomplete, and in all cases, subject to change based
on new discoveries, continuing research is a fundamental
component of any drug strategy. Recent discoveries concerning
cocaine provide an example. The 1967 President's Commission on
Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice reported that
cocaine did not &quot;create tolerance or physical
dependence;&quot; however, research during the 1980's showed that
cocaine does, in fact, create tolerance and some argue, physical
dependence. Despite this increased understanding about cocaine,
many experts, such as Dr. Arnold Washton, argue that research
about the effects of cocaine is still in its &quot;infancy.&quot;
</p>

<p>Continuing research is required not only by the complex nature
of drugs and their effects on the human mind and body, but also
by the constantly shifting patterns of drug abuse. While heroin
has traditionally been the most frequently encountered drug of
abuse among individuals in treatment programs, cocaine now
follows closely behind and has, in fact, overtaken heroin as the
primary drug of abuse by those in treatment in 18 States. While
requests for treatment by cocaine users are estimated to have
increased by as much as 600 percent in the last three years,
research about cocaine and its effects has not kept pace with
this growing problem. The development of new drugs, such as
controlled substance analogs, presents another compelling need
for continuing research. </p>

<p>Data Collection and Dissemination </p>

<p>As part of its research responsibilities, NIDA supports two
continuing epidemiological surveys, the National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse and the High School Senior Survey. While these two
surveys provide valuable information about the extent of drug
use, neither NIDA nor any other agency systematically collects or
disseminates information about the thousands of drug abuse
programs. </p>

<p>State governments, which disbursed 46 percent ($642.5 million)
of the funding for alcohol and drug abuse prevention and
treatment services in fiscal year 1984, do not systematically
report to the Federal government about these programs. This lack
of data is due primarily to the absence of any statutory
requirement for such reporting, and is a major obstacle to
effective drug policy planning. The States should be required to
report to the National Institute on Drug Abuse information about
their prevention and treatment programs. With this information,
and reports obtained from private programs, NIDA will be better
able to identify the best prevention and treatment programs and
to develop and disseminate standards and guidelines for such
programs to the States. The States should, in turn, provide this
information to all groups engaged in prevention, treatment, and
related research. </p>

<p>Guidelines </p>

<p>Because the Federal government does not systematically collect
and evaluate information about drug abuse prevention and
treatment programs, it cannot develop substantive guidelines for
such efforts. The history of drug abuse prevention has
demonstrated that certain approaches are considerably more
effective than others. Some have even unwittingly encouraged
experimentation with drugs. As an increasing number of school and
community-based prevention programs are created, the need for
guidelines for drug abuse programs is particularly acute.
Officials at NIDA acknowledge that many programs use outdated
factual information and philosophies; however, the Federal
government is in a unique position to establish and disseminate
such guidelines to improve both State and private sector drug
abuse programs. Its current failure to do so is a major
deficiency in the campaign against drug abuse. </p>

<p>In addition to contributions to reducing the demand for drugs
through research, data collection and dissemination, and the
formation of guidelines, the Federal government should provide an
example of the unacceptability of drug use. The President should
direct the heads of all federal agencies to formulate immediately
clear policy statements, with implementing guidelines, including
suitable drug testing, expressing the utter unacceptability of
drug use by Federal employees. Government contracts should not be
awarded to companies which fail to implement drug programs,
including suitable drug testing. </p>

<p>State and Local Governments </p>

<p>State and local governments are key components in the national
campaign against drug abuse. Their unique capabilities in the
area of reducing demand include State-sponsored media campaigns
against drug use, prevention and education programs in the
schools, drug treatment programs, more vigorous enforcement of
State drug laws, and the inclusion of mandatory treatment or jail
sentences, as appropriate, for those individuals convicted of
possession of drugs. Because the nature of drug use tends to vary
among different geographical areas, State and local governments
are best positioned to tailor techniques to reduce demand to suit
their particular drug problem. </p>

<p>Drug Education </p>

<p>The public school systems of State and local governments
provide an appropriate forum for drug abuse prevention programs.
Consistent with identified measures of success, State governments
should establish credentialing standards for prevention and
treatment programs. They should further require that all
elementary, junior high, and high schools within the State
include drug abuse prevention programs in their curricula,
designed in a manner consistent with such credentialing
standards. State funding should be made available to assure the
proper training of educators assigned to such programs. </p>

<p>Combining prevention programs, clear school policies about the
consequences of drug use, increased discipline, and higher
academic standards has been demonstrated to be effective. For
example, Northside High School in Atlanta, Georgia implemented
such a program in the late 1970's in the face of &quot;poor
academic performance . . . student apathy . . . discipline
problems . . . class cutting and open drug use on campus.&quot;
By the early 1980's, performance on standardized tests improved
significantly and &quot;the use and possession of drugs on campus
[had] all but disappeared.&quot; Every employer, public and
private, and public education institutions at all levels should
have clearly-stated policies prohibiting drug use, possession of
drugs, or being under the influence of drugs on their premises.
The consequences of violating these prohibitions should be
clearly explained. </p>

<p>Law Enforcement </p>

<p>A critical part of a national campaign to reduce demand is
vigorous enforcement by State and local governments of their laws
regarding the possession of controlled substances. The Department
of Justice Uniform Crime Report for 1984 states that 552,552
arrests were made in 1984 by State and local police agencies for
possession of drugs. Given that in 1984 there were estimated to
be 20 million monthly marijuana users, over four million monthly
cocaine users, and approximately 520,000 heroin addicts, it is
clear that the statistical probability of arrest for possession
was and is quite low. This low probability of arrest vitiates in
large part whatever deterrent value laws against drug possession
and use may have. </p>

<p>In addition to increasing the likelihood of arrest for drug
possession, punishment for those convicted of such offenses can
be more effective. Drug users are not &quot;victims&quot; who
bear no responsibility for their actions. Imprisonment for
recidivists provides both deterrent value and an opportunity to
break the cycle of drug use. Uniform and rational sentencing for
drug offenses is essential. Such a system should provide a
sentence of probation and a fine for a first offense involving
possession of drugs. The terms of probation should include a
requirement to remain drug-free, to be verified through periodic
drug testing. A second offense for possession of drugs should
result in a jail sentence or mandatory treatment, if appropriate,
or fines or all three. The results of random drug screening
should be used in considering parole in cases of both drug
possession and trafficking. </p>

<p>Society's commitment to the unacceptability of illicit drug
use is properly expressed in vigorous enforcement of the laws
regarding possession of drugs and sentencing of recidivist users
to jail terms and mandatory treatment. Such a national commitment
is in conflict with various States' relaxation of criminal
penalties for the possession of marijuana. Because such measures
were based on limited information and popular misinformation
about the effects of marijuana, it is appropriate for those
States that reduced these penalties during the 1970's to
reconsider these laws. This reconsideration is warranted,
especially in light of a Federal campaign against marijuana
smuggling and the considerable evidence that a substantial share
of marijuana trafficking is dominated by organized crime groups,
which are both ruthless and involved in smuggling other drugs. In
addition, the sale of drug paraphernalia undermines this Nation's
anti-drug efforts. States that have not already done so should
enact and enforce laws prohibiting the sale of drug
paraphernalia. </p>

<p>Reducing demand and increased enforcement of drug possession
laws will undoubtedly place a greater burden on our courts and
will generate the need for more jail cells and treatment
facilities. The accompanying increase in expenditures, however,
could be met in part with funding extracted from the illicit drug
industry itself. All 50 States currently authorize forfeiture of
assets in connection with drug trafficking and manufacturing,
making available millions of dollars in cash and property each
year to State governments. </p>

<p>The Private Sector: Attitudes and Actions </p>

<p>The hostess who is certain enough of her own unwillingness to
tolerate pot smoking in her home doesn't need to call the cops to
keep her guests from lighting up. </p>

<p>&quot;Great scent. Lousy name.&quot; - Advertising Age, a
trade journal commenting on &quot;Opium,&quot; a popular perfume
marketed by Charles of the Ritz, a subsidiary of Squibb
Pharmaceuticals. </p>

<p>Drug abuse is fundamentally a social problem, which cannot be
solved by the government alone. Federal and State governments can
support drug abuse prevention and treatment programs, conduct
research, enforce drug laws and provide leadership in the fight
against drug abuse and drug trafficking. However, not until
public and individual attitudes change will illicit drugs and the
organized criminal groups that traffic in them be eliminated.
Individuals need not accept drug use in their midst. There is no
&quot;right&quot; to use drugs. Government efforts to combat drug
trafficking and drug abuse are a vital effort, but they are
ultimately only a holding action, while consensus continues to
build among individuals concerning the utter unacceptability of
drug use. </p>

<p>Despite this growing consensus, a profound disparity exists
between principle and practice. Popular entertainment arid
advertising, sometimes subtle, sometimes not, regularly reflects
and even promotes the view that the use of illicit drugs is
glamorous, exciting, and sophisticated, or at least harmless and
amusing. </p>

<p>The illusion that drug use is glamorous is regularly, if
somewhat indirectly, reinforced by revelations that drug use is
commonplace among celebrities in the sports and entertainment
worlds. In August 1985, for example, the New York Times reported
cocaine's alleged use by players on virtually every team in the
major leagues, prompting the Commissioner of Baseball to declare
drug use the &quot;number one&quot; problem facing the game. </p>

<p>It is even possible to find purportedly responsible groups
urging not only recognition but acceptance of drug use as a
feature of daily life. An article in the January/February 1984
issue of Social Work, the journal of the National Association of
Social Workers, prescribes the following for adolescent marijuana
use: </p>

<p>Use should be moderate . . no more than four to five joints
per week seem advisable. </p>

<p>Such acceptance of drug use may be shared by many who resign
themselves to the fact that drug abuse is inevitable. Such a view
reflects a failure of will on the part of the American public.
American society may view drug use in the abstract as wrong, and
many People agree that heroin addicts who commit additional
crimes to support their drug habits should be jailed. However,
many people react with ambivalence to the drug use in their
midst. Even while the United States government spends almost a
billion and one-half dollars on drug law enforcement, threatens
to cut off foreign aid to drug producing countries, and
extradites and imprisons foreign nationals on trafficking
charges, we appear to lack the same degree of resolve to hold
this country's drug users, as well as those who directly or
indirectly promote drug use, accountable for their actions and
the consequences thereof. </p>

<p>While attitudes are ultimately an individual matter, actions
need not be. It is in combination with others that private
citizens have been most effective in combatting drug abuse. As
discussed earlier, athletes, entertainers, manufactures,
advertisers and media can promote drug use by their individual
examples or by favorable portrayals of drug use. However, these
elements of society also have the power to shape different public
attitudes about drug use by presenting the truth about drugs. The
media and entertainment industries should carefully review their
portrayals of drug use and its consequences and ensure their
accuracy. </p>

<p>Efforts to combat drug abuse can also be successful in the
workplace. Many businesses across the country have Employee
Assistance Programs (EAPs), which seek to prevent drug abuse at
the worksite and which offer treatment and referrals. In
addition, many businesses now test employees or prospective
employees for drug use. According to a survey of 100 Fortune 500
companies, two-thirds refuse to hire job applicants who fail such
tests, 25 percent fire employees and 41 percent require treatment
for employees who fail. Drug testing protects businesses, which
lose billions of dollars each year in reduced productivity as a
result of drug use, employees, and the public. Drug testing in
certain &quot;critical positions,&quot; such as in the
transportation industry, law enforcement, and education is
particularly important. </p>

<p>In addition to efforts in the workplace to combat drug abuse,
health professionals, such as physicians, nurses, psychologists,
and social workers can help identify and treat drug users.
However, currently formal training in the diagnosis and treatment
of drug abuse is limited. Health professionals should be
thoroughly trained to identify and counsel drug abusers. </p>

<p>Decisions to use or not to use drugs are ultimately derived
from values that are best inculcated and reinforced in families,
churches, civic organizations, schools and local communities. The
efforts of organizations, which seek to help families prevent
drug use, such as the National Federation of Parents for
Drug-Free Youth, are essential to the fight against drug use and
drug trafficking. First Lady Nancy Reagan has made an important
contribution to this effort to reduce the demand for drugs.
Relying on the task force approach which law enforcement
officials have used successfully, parents, churches, schools,
civic organizations, and business associations should form
community task forces in every community across the country to
provide a unified front against drugs.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter VIII Summary of Recommendations </h2>

<p>Based on its findings and the extended analysis, found
elsewhere in the report, (primarily in Chapters VI and VII), the
Commission makes the following recommendations: </p>

<p>General Recommendations </p>

<p>1. The ultimate goal of the Nation's drug policy is the
effective suppression of drug abuse in the United States. While
efforts to reduce the supply of drugs in this country, such as
interdiction and source country crop controls, indirectly advance
this goal, efforts to reduce the demand for drugs can make a more
direct contribution. For this reason, the Nation's drug policy
must emphasize more strongly efforts to reduce the demand for
drugs. </p>

<p>2. Because drug trafficking and abuse are the most serious
organized crime problems in America today, they must be addressed
at the highest levels of government. Therefore, the National Drug
Enforcement Policy Board (Board), under the direction of the
Attorney General, is and should continue to be responsible for
this country's drug policy. The mandate of the Board should be
interpreted, or expanded if necessary, to require the Board to
coordinate carefully efforts to reduce both drug demand and
supply to achieve this ultimate goal. The Board should evaluate
all programs undertaken pursuant to the national drug strategy in
terms of their contribution to this goal. In recognition of the
scope of the problem of international drug trafficking and the
extended national effort needed to combat it, the Attorney
General, as Chairman of the National Drug Enforcement Policy
Board, should depart from the current formulation of a National
Strategy on an annual basis, directing instead the formulation of
a long range national offensive against drug supply and demand,
including long term funding proposals. Such a program should
include an appropriate role for State and local agencies as a
complement to Federal efforts. State and local police agencies
should be trained and equipped to perform such a role. </p>

<p>3. The rigorous pursuit of the Nation's drug policy, as
proposed in this report, will not undermine its organized crime
policy. Indeed, the goals of the two policies substantially
overlap and therefore both can and must be implemented
simultaneously and aggressively. </p>

<p>4. The cost of this Nation's anti-drug efforts can be
subsidized to a great extent by the seizure and forfeiture of
drug traffickers' assets. That portion of the Federal
government's asset forfeiture fund derived from drug cases should
be devoted exclusively to anti-drug programs. Such a funding
mechanism should be made permanent through law, and the current
ceiling of $10 million should be eliminated. In the annual
Congressional appropriations process, these funds should be
allocated to participating agencies according to Congressional
findings, just as if the funds were appropriated. </p>

<p>5. Because of the international dimensions of drug
trafficking, the United Nations, in performance of its leadership
role in the international community, should sponsor the drafting
and promotion of a model International Controlled Substances Act,
identifying each and every drug which is trafficked to the
detriment of any single member nation. This model act should be
accompanied by a Model Mutual Legal Assistance and Extradition
Treaty, embodying the recognition that international drug
trafficking is a matter of profound international concern. In the
spirit of international cooperation, the Attorney General, as
Chairman of the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board, should
direct the creation of bilateral working groups, modeled on the
present Italian-American Working Group. </p>

<p>Interdiction </p>

<p>1. Within the overall structure of the National Drug
Enforcement Policy Board (the Board), the Vice President's role
as leader and coordinator of interdiction efforts should be
recognized, maintained, and strengthened. </p>

<p>2. A proper and realistic goal of our interdiction efforts
should be the maintenance of persistent pressure on drug
traffickers, both as a deterrent and as a symbol of national
determination. Operational and policy decisions should reflect
that measure of su cess and specifically reject any less
realistic or effective goal. </p>

<p>3. Both Congress and the Board should carefully evaluate the
technical capabilities and equipment of drug smugglers. To the
extent that law enforcement agencies' capabilities and equipment
are inferior to those of drug traffickers, immediate steps should
be taken to rectify the situation. </p>

<p>4. All Federal agencies having any responsibility for the
regulation of air, sea, or land travel into or out of the United
States should review their policies and practices and ensure that
no purpose other than the promotion of public safety is given
priority over the effort to combat drug trafficking. To this end,
the proposed &quot;Customs Enforcement Act of 1985&quot; should
be enacted promptly. </p>

<p>5. The Policy Board should carefully examine the regulatory
practices of the Federal Aviation Administration, particularly in
the field of aircraft modification, to determine whether
possibilities exist for more aggressive anti-smuggling efforts.
In addition, the Policy Board should carefully monitor the design
of the Federal Aviation Administration's approach radar system to
ensure that interdiction capabilities and opportunities are
maximized. </p>

<p>6. Diplomatic initiatives should be pursued immediately to
facilitate Customs pursuit of suspected airborne drug traffickers
into Mexican air space. Such efforts should be given the highest
priority in our bilateral relations with Mexico, including the
Western Hemisphere discussions agreed upon between the Presidents
of the United States and Mexico on January 3, 1986. </p>

<p>7. The Policy Board should thoroughly evaluate expanded use of
Coast Guard aviation capabilities in drug interdiction. </p>

<p>8. Congress should give careful consideration to user fees as
a means of supplementing the Coast Guard's budget. Fees should go
directly to the Coast Guard's budget rather than the general
Treasury. </p>

<p>9. Both the Policy Board and the Department of Defense should
continue to examine Navy assistance to Coast Guard interdiction
operations, with a view to expanding such assistance whenever and
wherever possible. Such expansion should be facilitated by
adoption of the broader military view of national security
advocated in this report. </p>

<p>10. Monies from the proposed permanent asset forfeiture fund
should be made available to the Customs Service for the
acquisition of necessary equipment, including but not limited to
the type of fast patrol boats recently deployed in Operation Blue
Lightning. </p>

<p>11. Joint Federal-State-local interdiction operations, such as
Operation Blue Lightning, should be refined and used wherever
feasible and desirable. </p>

<p>Intelligence </p>

<p>1. The Policy Board should take all necessary steps to ensure
that data concerning all aspects of both drug supply and demand
are adequately collected, analyzed, correlated and disseminated. </p>

<p>2. The Federal electronic surveillance statute should be
examined and amended to reflect existing technology. Existing
State laws should be similarly studied and changed where
necessary. Those States still without a statute permitting
court-ordered electronic surveillance should immediately enact
one, consistent with current technology. </p>

<p>3. The &quot;Mansfield Amendment&quot; to the Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291 (c)(l)) should be repealed
in its entirety. The concerns addressed by that legislation
should be incorporated in agency guidelines which provide
necessary flexibility while embodying the limits of permissible
U.S. agency conduct. </p>

<p>4. Data relating to assets forfeited to Federal, State and
local jurisdictions should be collected, analyzed, and
disseminated by the all source intelligence center discussed
elsewhere in this report. </p>

<p>5. Because of the importance of information about individuals
in drug treatment programs, the Federal government should again
require the States to participate in the Client Oriented Data
Acquisition Process. </p>

<p>6. Both the Household Survey on Drug Abuse and the High School
Senior Survey should over sample populations thought to be heavy
drug users. In addition, because questions about the nature of
drug transactions, e.g., the price paid and purity and quantity
of the drug purchased, could provide important information for
policy makers and enforcement officials, such questions should be
added to the Household and High School Senior Surveys. </p>

<p>Combined Intelligence and Interdiction </p>

<p>1. The Policy Board should take immediate steps to ensure that
the law enforcement and intelligence communities are thoroughly
familiar with each other's needs and capabilities. </p>

<p>2. Every agency involved in the interdict ion of drug
shipments or the apprehension of drug traffickers should have
ready access to all necessary intelligence gathered in source and
transshipment countries. To the extent that this requires
expansion or modification of existing practices, the Policy Board
should ensure that such change is pursued immediately. In
particular, the critical nature of real-time intelligence to
effective Customs operations at the border must be recognized,
and the Policy Board should take all necessary steps to ensure
that, under current Federal organization, such information from
all sources is being provided. </p>

<p>3. To the extent that the intelligence community under the
current Federal structure needs direction from the highest levels
of government concerning aggressive anti-drug actions, including
operations against the infrastructure of foreign drug-trafficking
organizations, such direction should be provided immediately. </p>

<p>4. The &quot;all-source intelligence and operations
center,&quot; now being considered by the National Drug
Enforcement Policy Board, should be pursued aggressively and
expeditiously. It should combine in a physically secure facility
the functions now being performed by EPIC and NNBIS, retaining
the current Vice Presidential direction and regional structure of
the latter for interdiction functions. Ft. Bliss, Texas, and
similar locations should be considered as possible sites for the
center. Its design, giving due consideration to the protection of
civil liberties, should provide specific roles for all pertinent
Department of Defense components and for all members of the
intelligence community, to the fullest extent Permitted by
Executive Order 12333, The design should also incorporate
specific foreign intelligence-gathering functions for other U.S.
Agencies, in order to maximize the acquisition of both strategic
and tactical data. Each Participating agency should be required
to present to the Policy Board its specific operational
guidelines for providing time-sensitive data to the center. The
center should also Include a uniform national system for
gathering and analyzing drug related data on various categories
of information, including arrests, seizures, convictions,
sentences, forfeitures, emergency room admissions, and deaths. A
similar system of compiling and analyzing financial data gathered
by all members of the intelligence community, as well as that
contained in all financial records now required by law to be kept
by any Federal agency, should also be included as an Integral
component of the center. Both data bases should be compiled and
maintained in a fashion that provides reliable, constant, and
uniform tracking, retrieval, and compilation for the purpose of
charting trends and profiles, as well as support for specific
operations whenever Possible. Access to all data compiled should
be available to appropriate State and local agencies, in addition
to Federal components, subject to Procedures necessary to ensure
the integrity of the information-sharing process. </p>

<p>5. Joint enforcement and intelligence operations by source and
transshipment countries should be encouraged, and careful,
resourceful analysis should be given to identify means of U.S.
funding of such operations. Consistent with other recommendations
in this report, participation in such operations by American
components should be promoted. </p>

<p>6. The Department of State should stress to Chiefs of Mission
at principal reporting posts and to all other cognizant
Departmental personnel the high priority attached to a
coordinated narcotics intelligence and interdiction strategy. </p>

<p>7. All necessary steps should be taken to ensure that Consular
officers can and do deny U.S. entry visas to individuals
suspected of drug trafficking. Subject to the informing agency's
safeguards of reliability, information provided by any agency of
the United States, without further corroboration, should be
sufficient to require such denial under the pertinent statute, 8
U.S.C. Section 1182 (a)(23). The Policy Board should promptly
establish guidelines for similar information-sharing on a
government-wide basis. </p>

<p>8. Both Congress and the Executive Branch should closely
examine the operations and cost effectiveness of drug-related
intelligence-gathering abroad. When and where justified by such
an examination, resources available for such operations should be
expanded. Particular attention should be paid to the critical
need for adequate foreign intelligence by the Customs Service in
performing its border interdiction function. </p>

<p>9. Coast Guard officers should be thoroughly integrated into
the Defense Attache system. </p>

<p>10. The definition of &quot;national security&quot; now
employed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as their starting point in
mission determination is: </p>

<p>A collective term encompassing both national defense and
foreign relations of the United States. Specifically, the
condition provided by: </p>

<p>a. a military or defense advantage over any foreign national
or group of nations, or </p>

<p>b. a favorable foreign relations position, or </p>

<p>c. a defense posture capable of successfully resisting hostile
or destructive action from within or without, overt or covert. </p>

<p>The Joint Chiefs should be instructed by the highest levels of
government, through a National Security Decision Directive or by
other appropriate means, that &quot;hostile or destructive action
from within or without, overt or covert,&quot; as used in this
definition, shall include the airborne, amphibious, and overland
invasion of this country by drug smugglers. This policy is
already followed by the intelligence community, pursuant to
Executive Order 12333. All Department of Defense and component
operational decisions concerning interdiction of drug smugglers
should be made accordingly. </p>

<p>11. For the purposes of intelligence-gathering mission
planning, the Joint Chiefs of Staff should be given direction
from the highest levels of government that the Defense
Department's definition of &quot;foreign hostile action&quot; is
to be brought into accord with the view expressed in Executive
Order 12333, as described in the preceding recommendation. </p>

<p>12. Consistent with the foregoing definitions of
&quot;national security&quot; and &quot;foreign hostile
action,&quot; Department of Defense policies and practices, such
as existing interpretations of the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. Section
1535, and exemptions to the Posse Comitatus Act, 10 U.S.C.
Section 371 et al., should be thoroughly re-examined. Unit
planning and deployment should be adjusted accordingly. </p>

<p>13. The Posse Comitatus Act, IS U.S.C. Section 1385, and its
1981 exemptions, now found at 10 U.S.C. Section 371 et seq,
should be consolidated in Title 18. The consolidated statute
should include a statement of purpose reflecting the view of
national security advocated here and promoting an accordingly
expansive interpretation of the statutory language, subject to
such limitations as are necessary to protect civil liberties. </p>

<p>14. The Policy Board, in accordance with Executive Orders
12333 and 12472, and with applicable National Security Decision
Directives, if any, should coordinate with appropriate agencies
and departments to ensure that a secure and interoperable,
interagency communications capability is available for
drug-related intelligence collection and dissemination in support
of interdiction and other anti-drug activities. The resources and
expertise of the National Security Agency should be fully
exploited to this end, and operational and communications
security should be given a high priority in the training and
operating procedures of all pertinent agencies. </p>

<p>Domestic Investigations and Prosecutions </p>

<p>1. Domestic drug law enforcement efforts directed at
high-level trafficking groups should be supplemented by and
integrated with enforcement efforts directed at lower-level
trafficking groups and street-level drug activity. Unless the
necessary supplementation and integration occur, the enforcement
effort at all levels will be undermined. </p>

<p>2. Although the enforcement efforts of Federal and State and
local law enforcement agencies cannot and should not be
completely independent, these agencies nevertheless have primary
areas of responsibility. The Federal law enforcement agencies
should concentrate their efforts on infiltrating and disrupting
high-level organized crime and other large trafficking
organizations. State and local law enforcement agencies on the
other hand should focus their resources on street-level drug
activity and on smaller and geographically-restricted trafficking
organizations. </p>

<p>3. Although Federal, State and local agencies have primary
areas of responsibility, the drug problem is a national one that
requires extensive and genuine coordination and cooperation among
all agencies. Those in charge of the agencies involved in
domestic drug law enforcement must constantly instill In their
agents the need for such coordination and cooperation, especially
with respect to the exchange of drug intelligence. Joint
operations, such as Operation Pressure Point, the New York Drug
Enforcement Task Force, and the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement
Task Force Program, have fostered this required spirit of
cooperation and coordination, and they should be undertaken
whenever appropriate, provided that they do not interfere with an
agency's primary mission. </p>

<p>4. The sophistication of high-level trafficking groups
requires an equivalent Federal response. Because of the variety
of investigative techniques used by participating Federal
agencies and their unique ability to exploit such tools as
electronic surveillance, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), the Continuing Criminal Enterprise
statutory provision (CCE), forfeiture, and currency transactions
reports, the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF)
Program is the Federal mechanism that is best equipped to respond
to and disrupt high-level organized crime trafficking groups. Its
operation should be supported strongly and its scope should be
expanded wherever feasible and desirable. </p>

<p>5. Because the OCDETF Program has been operational for more
than two years, the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board should
consider whether a lead Task Force agency should be designated.
As an alternative, the U.S. attorneys Involved should be given
greater policy authority with respect to the participating
agencies In order to improve still further the coordination that
has been achieved by the consensus-based decision-making
approach. If the latter approach is taken, the Board must take
steps to ensure uniform policies and priorities are recognized by
all United States Attorneys involved. </p>

<p>6. The heads of the agencies participating in the OCDETF
Program must continually and unambiguously reiterate their total
commitment to the success of the program. One simple way they can
do so is to ensure that their agents involved in the Program are
not affected adversely in any way with respect to career
advancement by their participation therein. </p>

<p>7. The components of Federal domestic law enforcement other
than the OCDE Task Forces should focus their resources on
organized crime trafficking groups that do not qualify for OCDETF
program treatment and on other large trafficking organizations,
which may or may not be multi-jurisdictional. </p>

<p>8. To eliminate jurisdictional disputes between the Federal
agencies involved in domestic law enforcement, to avoid
duplication of investigative efforts, and to increase the safety
of drug agents, the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board should
establish a system whereby agencies would be required to file
reports on whom they are investigating. If more than one agency
is investigating the same individual, the agencies involved would
be required to negotiate and to determine the best way for
proceeding with the investigation, subject to uniform Policy
Board guidelines. Such a reporting and control system should be
incorporated into the &quot;all source intelligence and
operations center&quot; recommended elsewhere in this report. </p>

<p>9. It is an appropriate time to consider whether the mission
of the Customs Service with respect to drug trafficking should be
expanded to include intelligence and law enforcement functions
beyond the borders and ports of entry within this country, where
appropriate, subject to the lead responsibility of the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA). </p>

<p>10. DEA should determine which chemicals currently used to
manufacture illicit drugs should be subject to reporting
requirements or placed in a Schedule established by the
Controlled Substances Act. This review should include a
consideration of which drugs are most abused, which have the most
serious consequences, which precursor chemicals are essential to
the production process, and which chemicals could feasibly be
regulated. In addition, DEA should identify the resources needed
for the computerization, analysis, and follow-up of reports
concerning chemicals selected for monitoring. </p>

<p>11. The research and development operations of Federal drug
law enforcement agencies should work closely with their field
agents to produce the equipment and tools necessary to defeat
traffickers. The expertise of the Central Intelligence and
National Security Agencies should be called upon to the fullest
extent possible and proper in this regard. </p>

<p>12. Although the drug problem is a national one, its immediate
effects are felt most at State and local levels. To respond
effectively to the drug problem, State and local jurisdictions
will have to increase expenditures for such critical resources as
prison facilities, increased manpower, and sophisticated
equipment. </p>

<p>13. States must provide their law enforcement agencies with
certain tools available to their Federal counterparts. Those
States, which do not already have such statutes, should consider
enacting legislation patterned after the following Federal
statutes: Bail Reform Act of 1984; the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act; statutory use and derivative
use immunity for witnesses; statutory criminal and civil
forfeiture provisions; the Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE)
statute; Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act of 1968 (electronic surveillance); and the Currency and
Foreign Transactions Reporting Act. States should consider
adopting statewide grand juries in order to improve their
investigations of drug trafficking organizations, as well as
eliminating accomplice corroboration statutes or rules. </p>

<p>Foreign Assistance </p>

<p>1. Because drug trafficking and production are threats of such
magnitude to the stability of existing democracies, a primary
goal of the United States and its allies should be to enhance the
security of drug producing and transshipment regions. </p>

<p>2. As a part of its international responsibilities, the
National Drug Enforcement Policy Board should participate in the
President's annual decision whether to suspend aid to drug
producing or transshipment countries. The Board should examine
the drug control efforts made by each foreign nation and make a
suitable recommendation to the President for his ultimate
decision. </p>

<p>3. The willingness of a country to engage in and actively
implement drug-related extradition and mutual assistance treaties
should be a primary consideration in the ultimate U.S. policy
decision regarding foreign assistance to that country. </p>

<p>4. The Departments of State and Defense should continue their
programs of economic and security assistance with emphasis on
assisting those foreign governments making concerted efforts to
control their drug problems. </p>

<p>5. The United States should continue to help producer and
trafficking nations develop prevention and education programs
aimed at drug abuse within these countries. </p>

<p>Source Country Crop Control </p>

<p>1. In light of restrictions inherent in international crop
control efforts, the Board should initiate a thorough
cost/benefit analysis of the entire history of those efforts by
the United States. If justified by such an analysis, the
Department of State, through its Bureau of International
Narcotics Matters (BINM), should initiate or intensify crop
control and plant eradication programs selectively and
judiciously in those countries where the political and economic
climates make it probable that crop eradication programs will
succeed. </p>

<p>2. The Department of State should establish and present to the
Policy Board a specific formula for triggering the cut-off of
foreign aid provided for in the &quot;Diplomacy Against
Drugs&quot; amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act. </p>

<p>3. Narcotics Assistance Unit positions must be recognized by
the State Department as priority Foreign Service assignments. The
State Department should establish a select group of professional
Narcotics Officers to fill those positions, and should ensure
that those positions are fully integrated into the career
advancement structure within the Foreign Service. </p>

<p>4. BINM should expand the range of possibilities under
consideration as alternatives to illicit drug cultivation for
source country farmers and include such options as mining,
petroleum production, and light industry, where feasible. </p>

<p>Reducing Demand for Drugs </p>

<p>1. A thorough review of the current budgetary allotments for
anti-drug efforts, now contemplated by the National Drug
Enforcement Policy Board, should be placed at the top of the
agenda of the Board immediately. If that review indicates that
greater Federal resources should be devoted to programs to reduce
demand, the Board should pursue appropriate action without
hesitation. </p>

<p>2. A portion of the Federal government's asset forfeiture
fund, derived from drug cases, should be devoted to programs to
reduce demand in whatever proportion is indicated by the review
recommended above. Funding to reduce demand should include a
responsible contribution to the States for their own programs in
this area. However, any funding directed to the States should be
made contingent upon their vigorous pursuit of such programs, and
after a reasonable grace period, as determined by the Board or by
Congress, funding should be denied to any State failing this
requirement. Failure to enact State electronic surveillance
measures and asset forfeiture provisions, with the proceeds
thereof directed to anti-drug programs, should constitute per se
failure. </p>

<p>3. The President should direct the heads of all Federal
agencies to formulate immediately clear policy statements, with
implementing guidelines, including suitable drug testing
programs, expressing the utter unacceptability of drug abuse by
Federal employees. State and local governments and leaders in the
private sector should support unequivocally a similar policy that
any and all use of drugs is unacceptable. Government contracts
should not be awarded to companies that fail to implement drug
programs, Including suitable drug testing. No Federal, State, or
local government funds should go directly or indirectly to
programs that counsel &quot;responsible&quot; drug use or condone
illicit drug use in any way. Laws in certain States which
&quot;decriminalized&quot; the possession of marijuana constitute
a form of such condonation, and should be reconsidered. </p>

<p>4. States that have not already done so should enact and
enforce laws prohibiting the sale of drug paraphernalia. </p>

<p>5. The States should be required to report information about
their prevention and treatment programs to the National Institute
on Drug Abuse. With this information, and reports obtained from
private programs, NIDA will be better able to identify the best
prevention and treatment programs and to develop and disseminate
standards and guidelines for such programs to the States. The
States should, in turn, provide this information to all groups
engaged in prevention, treatment, and related research. </p>

<p>6. Consistent with identified measures of success, State
governments should establish credentialing standards for
prevention and treatment programs. They should further require
that all elementary, junior high, and high schools within the
State Include drug abuse prevention programs in their curricula,
designed in a manner consistent with such credentialing
standards. State funding should be made available to assure the
proper training of educators assigned to such programs. </p>

<p>7. Every employer, public and private, and public education
institutions at all levels should have clearly-stated policies
prohibiting drug use, possession of drugs, or being under the
influence of drugs on their premises. The consequences of
violating these prohibitions should be clearly explained. </p>

<p>8. Government and private sector employers who do not already
require drug testing of job applicants and current employees
should consider the appropriateness of such a testing program. </p>

<p>9. State and local law enforcement authorities should enforce
more vigorously the laws prohibiting possession of drugs, and
State legislatures should ensure that enforcement agencies have
the necessary resources to do so. Such resources can be funded in
large part, if not entirely, through effective asset forfeiture
programs. </p>

<p>10. Uniform and rational sentencing for drug offenses is
essential. Such a system should provide a sentence of probation
and a fine for a first offense involving mere possession of
drugs. The terms of probation should include a requirement to
remain drug-free to be verified, if necessary, through periodic
drug testing. A second offense for possession of drugs should
result in a jail sentence or mandatory treatment or fines or all
three. </p>

<p>11. The media and entertainment industries should carefully
review their portrayals of drug use and its consequences and
ensure their accuracy. </p>

<p>12. Health professionals should be thoroughly trained to
identify and counsel drug abusers. </p>

<p>13. Relying on the task force approach which law enforcement
officials have used successfully, parents, churches, schools,
civic organizations and business associations should form
community task forces to provide a unified front against drugs. </p>

<p>Conclusion </p>

<p>The recommendations made here have not been reached
carelessly. They are the result of months of concerted research
and analysis, documented in the body of the report. Although some
recommendations reach to the most fundamental levels of
government agency operation and community life, they have been
presented only after consideration of every identifiable option. </p>

<p>The depth of concern expressed in this report is not the
result of any preordained strategy. Rather, it reflects this
Commission's recognition, based on objective evidence, that we
are confronted with a national crisis. Every course of action,
including a failure to act at all, has a natural consequence. The
recommendations made here are those actions deemed most effective
in promoting a national campaign against drugs at all levels of
society.<br>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Data and Analysis Requirements for Policy
Toward Drug Enforcement and Organized Crime </h2>

<p>By Mark Kleiman. Submitted: November 1985. Mark Kleiman is a
Research Fellow in the Program in Criminal Justice Policy and
Management at the John F. Kennedy School of Government of Harvard
University, Senior Lecturer in Political Science at the
University of Rochester, and President of BOTEC Analysis
Corporation. </p>

<p>Executive Summary </p>

<p>Organized crime control and drug enforcement need to be
considered together insofar as drug trafficking contributes to
the organized crime problem or organized crime contributes to the
drug problem. In making policy it would be useful to know about
(1) the role of drug trafficking in supporting organized crime
groups; (2) the role of organized crime groups in supplying
drugs; and (3) the effects on each problem of changing
enforcement practices in the other. </p>

<p>Drug trafficking is almost certainly the largest source of
illegally-earned income in the United States. </p>

<p>Both &quot;traditionally&quot; organized crime groups (Mafia
families) and &quot;emerging&quot; organized crime groups
participate in some aspects of the illicit drug trafficking
industry. In addition, some drug trafficking organizations have
some of the characteristics of organized crime groups, such as
the capacity and reputation for the use of violence and
corruption to frustrate enforcement. </p>

<p>Organized crime can participate in drug markets either
&quot;productively,&quot; using its lawbreaking skills to
contribute to the supply of illicit drugs, or
&quot;parasitically,&quot; using violence and the threat of
violence to extort drug merchants or organize cartels. Only the
productive activity of organized crime contributes to the drug
supply problem, which is the main target of drug enforcement.
Parasitic organized crime activity, in illicit markets as in
legitimate markets, tends to raise prices and reduce consumption.
</p>

<p>Controlling organized crime and controlling drug abuse (and
drug-abuse-related crime) are two distinct objectives. Some
agencies of government - the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), for
example - have primary responsibility for drug abuse control.
Others, like the Organized Crime Strike Forces, are concerned
primarily with organized crime control. The two sets of agencies
may or may not promote each other's objectives. </p>

<p>Drug enforcement actions may affect the drug markets in
several ways. They may: (1) help or hurt the efforts of organized
crime to participate in and profit from drug dealing; (2)
encourage or retard the development of organized-crime-like
characteristics among drug trafficking groups; and (3) lead to
more or fewer convictions of organized criminals. Unless it is
deliberately focused on organized crime groups, high-level drug
enforcement may tend to foster organized crime by keeping prices
high and driving out less well-organized competitors. </p>

<p>Organized crime enforcement actions may make the task of drug
enforcement harder or easier, depending on whether the roles of
those groups in the drug markets are primarily parasitic or
primarily productive. Aside from heroin importation into New
York, traditional organized crime is largely a parasite on the
drug markets; thus, as long as the organized crime effort
concentrates on the Mafia, it has little to contribute to drug
supply reduction. </p>

<p>Data about drug trafficking and drug enforcement, and about
the relationships between the drug trade and organized crime, can
serve three purposes: describing the current dimensions of the
problem, reasoning about how changes in enforcement activity
might make matters better or worse, and measuring the actual
effects of such changes after they are made. </p>

<p>From the perspective of organized crime policy, essential
facts about the drug markets are prices and quantities, and, most
important, the relationship between changes in retail price and
changes in the quantity purchased: the price-elasticity of
demand. Driving up the price of an inelastically-demanded drug
will increase the total revenues of traffickers of that drug, and
thus tend to promote organized crime. </p>

<p>Data about the drug markets and drug enforcement come from
three sources: (1) survey research; (2) observations of the
consequences of drug abuse (deaths, injuries, and demand for
treatment); and (3) enforcement statistics and reports. </p>

<p>Current large survey efforts, among households and high-school
seniors, do not gather much price and quantity data. We need a
separate national survey with a sample designed to overrepresent
heavy drug-users, that ask very detailed questions about price,
quantity, and conditions of drug purchase. In addition, local and
regional surveys should be conducted to evaluate the effect of
enforcement initiatives on market conditions and drug
consumption. </p>

<p>Two techniques not now in use - &quot;panel&quot; surveys of
drug users and surveys of convicted dealers - should be
undertaken, if the difficult operational and ethical issues can
be resolved. </p>

<p>Neither abuse-consequence data now gathered (medical examiner
and emergency-room reports through the Drug Abuse Warning Network
(DAWN), drug abuse treatment data through the remnants of the
Client-Oriented Data Acquisition Process (CODAP), opinions of
treatment professionals through the Community Epidemiology Work
Group (CEWG)) nor alternative ways of reaching the same facts are
very useful in making organized crime/drug enforcement policy
choices. These programs serve other purposes and should not be
disturbed, except for adding bioassay capability to some DAWN
sites. Pilot programs to test jail admittees for heroin use are
worth pursuing. </p>

<p>More could be done with enforcement agency data, which could
tell us about the enforcement effort itself (agency activities,
targets, measured results) and on its effects (prices at
different levels of the drug trade). The new management of the
Drug Enforcement Administration has put less effort into
estimating prices and quantities in the drug markets. That change
should be reversed, and DEA should again publish price-chain
estimates. </p>

<p>Enforcement agencies can also make and analyze retail-level
drug purchases, unrelated to specific cases, to measure the state
of the drug markets. Such &quot;monitor&quot; programs should be
increased in frequency, systematized, and applied to marijuana
and cocaine as well as heroin. </p>

<p>Recent revisions in the methods used by the National Narcotics
Intelligence Consumers Committee (NNICC) in preparing the annual
Narcotics Intelligence Estimate (NIE) appear to have somewhat
reduced that document's inconsistencies with observable fact.
However, the NNICC still seems to practice analysis by
negotiation rather than basing its estimates on evidence. The NIE
would be more useful if its assumptions, data, and computations
were explicit. There might be value in allowing a group of
experts outside the government access to NNICC documents and
sources, from which they could develop an independent set of
estimates. </p>

<p>Questions to be Answered: </p>

<p>Drug trafficking and organized crime are linked problems.
Policy making and evaluation for each is complicated by the
presence of the other. My objective is to outline a set of data
collection and analysis activities that would answer questions
under four headings: </p>

<p>1. What effects do organized crime have on drug trafficking
and enforcement? </p>

<p>2. What effects do drug trafficking and enforcement have on
organized crime? </p>

<p>3. How should federal agencies engaged in organized crime
enforcement adjust their policies to contribute to the objectives
of drug policy? </p>

<p>4. How should federal agencies engaged in drug enforcement
adjust their policies to contribute to the objective of organized
crime control? </p>

<p>Data collection and analysis are never free; in the drug area,
they are likely to be quite expensive. It is therefore important
to identify in advance what is relatively certain on the basis of
information and analysis now in hand; it doesn't take a
spectroscopic analysis to discover that the sky is blue. The
following section will therefore attempt to describe what we now
know and to identify the key analytic points. </p>

<p>Introduction: Drug Enforcement and Organized Crime Control </p>

<p>How Two Objectives and Two Sets of Institutions Intersect </p>

<p>The objective of drug enforcement is to keep drugs away from
consumers. The objective of organized crime enforcement is to
control the wealth and power of major criminal organizations and
to frustrate their goal of being able to defy the law. </p>

<p>These objectives interact where the illicit drug business is a
major source of power or revenue to organized crime groups (or a
major source of their vulnerability to enforcement), and where
the capabilities of organized crime groups make drugs more
available than they would otherwise be: in other words, where the
drug trade contributes to the organized crime problem or where
organized crime contributes to the drug problem. </p>

<p>Defining Organized Crime </p>

<p>The term organized crime can be used in one of two ways. It
may be merely an ethnically neutral euphemism for &quot;the
Mafia&quot; or &quot;La Cosa Nostra&quot; (LCN); or it may
describe a class of criminal organizations whose characteristics
make them particularly worthy of law enforcement attention. Size,
wealth, political power, participation in a variety of criminal
activities, and continuity over time have all been suggested as
such characteristics. </p>

<p>One way to bridge the gap between the two definitional
approaches is to refer to the Mafia as &quot;traditional&quot;
organized crime, while acknowledging the existence of other,
&quot;emerging,&quot; organized crime groups. </p>

<p>Defining organized crime in terms of its characteristics,
rather than ostensibly, complicates the analysis. Not only does
this approach treat the set of &quot;organized crime&quot; groups
as variable rather than fixed; it also implies a many-valued
rather than two-valued classification. Criminal groups, rather
than simply being organized crime or non-organized crime (i.e.,
Mafia families or other), will fall along a spectrum of being
more or less &quot;organized-crime-like.&quot; This suggests the
possibility that drug enforcement activity can increase or
decrease the number of drug-dealing organizations with many
organized crime characteristics. It also suggests that it can
make existing organized-crime-like drug dealers more or less
organized-crime-like and give such groups a greater or lesser
share of the drug market. </p>

<p>This paper will attempt to distinguish between traditional and
emerging organized crime groups, but will think of organized
crime as primarily a set of organizational characteristics rather
than a predefined set of organizations. The relevant
characteristics are organizational continuity and organizational
investment in the capability and reputation for violent or
corrupt interference with law enforcement activity. </p>

<p>Organized Crime as a Drug Supply Problem </p>

<p>&quot;Traditional&quot; organized crime - La Cosa Nostra -
does not now contribute substantially to the drug problem, with
the exception of the major roles of two of the five New York LCN
&quot;families&quot; in heroin importation. This is not to say
that LCN members and associates do not participate in drug
dealing on many levels, but only that they make no distinctive
contribution to the supply of illicit drugs. Indeed, as Thomas
Schelling has pointed out, the activity of organized crime in
cartel formation and extortion from illicit entrepreneurs may on
balance reduce the supply and increase the price of illicit
goods, as is true in licit markets. </p>

<p>As a consequence, organized crime enforcement institutions -
the Strike Forces and the investigators who work with them - have
relatively little to contribute to solving the problem of illicit
drug supply, as long as they continue their concentration on
&quot;traditional&quot; organized crime groups. This
concentration has been so successful, both in terms of successful
cases and in terms of creating and maintaining productive,
high-morale enforcement and prosecution institutions, that it
seems both unlikely (as a matter of prediction) to be changed and
unwise (as a matter of policy analysis) to consider changing. </p>

<p>It may be the case that some &quot;emerging&quot; organized
crime groups make distinctive contributions to various parts of
drug supply, so that their disruption would contribute to drug
supply control (over and above the general effect of enforcement
in raising prices by raising the costs and risks of drug
trafficking). Outlaw motorcycle gangs - the Hell's Angels in the
West, the Outlaws in the Mid-Atlantic region - may be
&quot;least-cost suppliers&quot; in the distribution of cocaine,
amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP). Similarly, some
ethnic-based organizations among Asian-Americans may be
significant contributors to the heroin supply, as the Herrera
organization certainly was at least until the recent arrests. By
contrast, neither the importation nor the distribution of
marijuana appears to offer the economies of organization that
would make breaking up particular trafficking groups a major
marijuana enforcement objective. The marijuana trade may be at
its most efficient as a decentralized set of independent buyers
and sellers. </p>

<p>To develop a set of institutions to appropriately address the
role of emerging organized crime groups in the drug markets will
require devising organizational incentives and career patterns
that support extremely long-term investigations and investments
in intelligence (broadly defined), while maintaining a
supply-control orientation among agents and prosecutors. This
will not be an easy task. There may be lessons to be learned from
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in its approach to LCN heroin
dealing. </p>

<p>The Drug Markets as an Organized Crime Problem </p>

<p>The illicit drug traffic contributes to the organized crime
problem because of the enormous amounts of money at stake. These
potential revenues will both attract (and help to sustain)
existing organized crime groups and call into existence new
groups with organized crime characteristics. </p>

<p>LCN families, other ethnically-based organizations long in
existence, and outlaw motorcycle gangs may engage in drug dealing
as a way to support themselves financially and to take advantage
of their organizational abilities in illicit transactions. The
opportunities in the drug trade may also allow the development of
organizations whose origin is in drug dealing, and which may
remain specialized in drug dealing, while taking on organized
crime characteristics, in particular, organizational continuity
and organizational investments in the abilities to use violence
and corruption to resist enforcement efforts while remaining
prominent in illicit markets. </p>

<p>Drug trafficking is almost certainly the largest source of
illegally-earned income in the United States, far outstripping
the market for illegal gambling or prostitution. Estimates of
total revenues from drug sales vary widely and are highly
unreliable. It seems unlikely that total annual revenues are much
less than $25-30 billion. </p>

<p>Virtually all of this represents rewards for lawbreaking; the
payments forlicit goods and services (rental or purchase of
vehicles and buildings; lawyers' fees) are negligible. On the
other hand, relatively little represents revenue to large
criminal organizations, because so much of the final retail price
of illegal drugs consists of the markups of retail dealers and
low-level wholesalers. For heroin and cocaine less than one-tenth
of the final retail price is collected by the dealer who sells
kilogram units. Marijuana, by contrast, with much less vigorous
enforcement at lower levels, undergoes only about a four-to-one
price markup between first domestic distribution and final retail
sale. </p>

<p>Therefore, while all three markets have total values on the
order of $10 billion per year, more than $2 billion of the
marijuana market represents the revenues of high-level
organizations, while the heroin and cocaine markets at that level
represent about $1 billion each. On the other hand, the tighter
distribution channels for heroin and cocaine make it possible for
large and highly disciplined organizations to exist at the
wholesale-retail level, so that organizations with many of the
characteristics of organized crime may exist at lower levels of
those trades (e.g., the Barnes organization in the Harlem heroin
market). </p>

<p>Making Strategy </p>

<p>Drug enforcement actions change the drug markets in ways that
may: (1) help or hurt the efforts of existing organized crime
enterprises, whether traditional or emerging, to participate in
and profit from them; (2) encourage or retard the development of
organized crime characteristics in existing or new enterprises
within the drug markets; (3) be more or less helpful in securing
convictions against members of already-identified organized crime
groups and the identification of new groups meeting those
criteria. </p>

<p>The more effectively drug enforcement is directed toward
organized crime control, the less hospitable organized crime
groups will find the drug markets. On the other hand, an increase
in the overall level of drug enforcement not aimed specifically
at organized crime groups may tend to frustrate organized crime
control by helping existing organized crime groups profit from
the drug trade and by encouraging existing drug enterprises to
take on more organized crime characteristics. </p>

<p>The ability of organized crime groups to profit from the drug
trade - and the tendency of the drug trade to spawn new organized
crime groups - depends both on the amount of money to be made in
that trade and on whether the environment rewards or punishes
tight control and a reputation for violence. Under some
conditions, tightened enforcement can both boost the total money
available to be made and confer competitive advantage on more
violent groups at the expense of less violent ones. </p>

<p>Tighter enforcement can increase the money to be made in any
black market, if it succeeds in raising the price of the
commodity involved and if consumption decreases less, in
percentage terms, than prices rise. (A 50 percent price increase
that causes only a 20 percent decrease in volume will create a
new market with total revenues 1.5 x 0.8 = 1.2 times as large as
the revenues in the old market, and thus increase the money to be
made by 0.2 or 20 percent.) Thus the sensitivity of consumer
demand to retail price - what economists call the
price-elasticity of demand - becomes an essential number to know.
</p>

<p>If the price-elasticity of demand is (in absolute value)
greater than one - if a given percentage increase in price will
cause a larger percentage decrease in volume - then price
increases will decrease total revenues. (Such goods are said to
be &quot;relatively elastically demanded.&quot;) On the other
hand, if the price-elasticity of demand is (in absolute value)
less than one - if a given percentage change in price will cause
a smaller percentage change in volume, as in the example above -
then price increases will increase total revenues. (Such goods
are said to be &quot;relatively inelastically demanded.&quot;) </p>

<p>In markets where demand is relatively elastic - where
consumers will respond to price increases by cutting back
consumption sharply - increased enforcement will reduce the money
at stake and thus tend to make the markets less lucrative for
organized crime. Where demand is inelastic, increasing
enforcement will increase the money at stake and thus make the
markets more able to support organized crime. Much of the
empirical work recommended below centers on measuring the
price-elasticity of demand for various drugs. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it appears that the demand for marijuana and
cocaine is relatively inelastic. (The argument with respect to
marijuana is on much firmer ground than the argument with respect
to cocaine.) In any case, tightened general drug enforcement - as
opposed to drug enforcement targeted at organized crime - will
tend to give organized crime groups and organized crime-like
groups relative competitive advantage, because their capacity for
violence and corruption helps protect then against ordinary
enforcement actions. This is the central tension in organized
crime/drug enforcement policy: good drug enforcement may be bad
organized crime control. </p>

<p>Observations to be Made </p>

<p>The observations to be made fall into three broad classes:
retail purchasing and consumption, lower-level dealing, and
enforcement activity. (Of course, observations on high-level
dealing are also of great importance, but they are almost
impossible to distinguish from enforcement intelligence. Data
collection here means talking to agents, enforcement-agency
analysts, and prosecutors, and the information to be collected is
rarely in quantitative form.) </p>

<p>Three Objectives of Data Collection and Analysis </p>

<p>Data collection and analysis about drug markets can serve
three distinct functions: </p>

<p>- Descriptive: measuring the current dimensions of the problem
and identifying trends. Sample questions: How much cocaine was
sold to end users last year? What prices do they pay? How were
those revenues distributed among individuals and groups in the
illicit cocaine industry? What were the relationships between
identified organized crime groups and cocaine trafficking? How
have the volumes and prices in the cocaine market changed over
time? What organized crime groups are active in the cocaine
market? What role does it play in their other activities? What
roles do they play - productive or parasitic - in the market? </p>

<p>- Theoretical: generating and testing hypotheses about
relationships among variables, and in particular about the likely
effects of changes in enforcement. Sample questions: Are there
&quot;barriers to entry&quot; at some levels of the cocaine trade
that allow traffickers to collect &quot;pure&quot; profits
(&quot;economic rents&quot;)? How would the average size and
longevity of cocaine-trafficking organizations change if
enforcement were substantially tightened? </p>

<p>- Evaluative: measuring the actual effects of enforcement
initiatives. Sample question: How did the South Florida Task
Force change prices and volumes in the cocaine market? </p>

<p>Three Sources of Data </p>

<p>Illicit activities are by their nature hard to observe and
measure, because participants attempt to conceal them from
authorities. Excise tax data, which provide the most convenient
measures of alcohol and tobacco consumption, are unavailable for
illicit drug markets. The same is true of the reports routinely
prepared by licit enterprises reports to state and federal tax
collectors, to trade associations and government statistical
collectors, to trade associations and government statistical
agencies, and to stockholders - from which estimates of licit
markets are derived. </p>

<p>The remaining potential sources of information about illicit
drug markets are: </p>

<p>(1) Surveys of drug users and potential drug users; </p>

<p>(2) Observations of the consequences of drug - abuse health
effects, intoxicated behavior, and demand for treatment - and the
opinions of professionals who deal with those consequences; and </p>

<p>(3) Enforcement data and the opinions of agents and
prosecutors. </p>

<p>Note that while surveys and observations of consequences tell
us almost exclusively about the behavior of drug consumers and
drug dealers, enforcement data and the opinions of enforcement
professionals can also tell us about the other half of the
equation: the governmental response. </p>

<p>Several current programs now attempt to tap these three
sources of information. None is without major flaws from the
perspective of organized crime policy. A major problem common to
many is that they are more concerned with numbers of users and
frequency of use consumed than with quantities consumed and flows
of revenues. </p>

<p>Survey Research </p>

<p>Survey research is potentially the most powerful tool
available for studying the markets for illicit drugs. Unlike data
from enforcement activity or abuse consequences, survey research
can attempt to measure prices and quantities directly rather than
through complicated chains of inference. Performing surveys about
consumption activities - market research supports a rather
prosperous industry, including both for-profit enterprises and
prestigious universities and nonprofit research centers. These
institutions have developed a repertoire of established
techniques. The fact that consumer-goods firms continue to use it
heavily testifies to the ability of market research to measure
and predict consumer behavior. </p>

<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse funds two series of
survey research projects on illicit drug consumption. The Social
Research Group of George Washington University does a survey
every two years of more than 5,000 persons 12 years or older
living in households [Miller et al. 1983]. This series is
referred to among students of drug abuse as &quot;the household
survey.&quot; </p>

<p>Every year, the Institute of Social Research of the University
of Michigan questions about 17,000 seniors in high school. The
Michigan reports are referred to as &quot;the high-school senior
survey.&quot; These two surveys are believed to cost NIDA
something less than one-half a million dollars for each two-year
cycle. </p>

<p>The concept of survey research is simple. Draw a sample so
designed that every member of the population under study has an
equal probability of being chosen. (This is what statisticians
mean by the term &quot;random sample.&quot; A variant on simple
randomization is to divide the population under study into
subgroups, called &quot;strata,&quot; and to draw the sample so
that each stratum is represented in proportion to its
representation in the population, and each member of a given
stratum has the same chance of being drawn as any other member.
This procedure, called &quot;stratified random sampling,&quot; is
the most commonly used.) Having drawn the sample, ask questions
and record the answers. Then use the percentage answers from the
sample as estimates of the behavior of the population from which
the sample was drawn: that is, make population projections based
on sample results. </p>

<p>Surveys can be inaccurate for three reasons: random error,
sample bias, and response bias. </p>

<p>Random error (or &quot;sampling error&quot;) occurs because
the law of averages only works on average. If 30 percent of the
population uses Crest Toothpaste, then in a sample of 100 persons
drawn at random about 30 will say they use Crest. But the
operative word is &quot;about:&quot; one time it will be 28,
another 33. The larger the sample, the smaller the random
sampling error, in accord with well-known statistical formulas.
This does not depend on the size of the population to be
measured: a sample of 1,000 is subject to the same sampling error
in estimating a population of 100,000 as in estimating a
population of 10 million. The rule of thumb is that the sampling
error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample
size: a sample four times as big gives estimates one half as
uncertain. For many purposes - predicting the outcome of a
Presidential election, for example - a sample size of a few
hundred is ample. </p>

<p>The smaller the percentage of a population that has some
trait, the larger the sample needed to measure that trait
accurately, because a sampling error of 2 percent looms larger if
the underlying figure is 5 percent than if it is 50 percent.
Thus, attempts to measure rare phenomena - heroin use, for
example - take bigger samples than attempts to measure common
phenomena such as alcohol use. The other factor that drives up
needed sample sizes is the desire to study how subgroups of a
population differ. In a study of the effect of income on cocaine
use, the relevant sample size is the number of respondents within
each income class. To study whether recent increases in marijuana
enforcement by the Boston DEA office succeeded in reducing
marijuana consumption, one would need a sample including at least
a few hundred marijuana consumers from New England, and a similar
sample from another area to serve as a control. </p>

<p>Other than the expensive expedient of using very large sample
sizes - such as the 50,000 households interviewed each month by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics - the only way to reduce
sampling-error problems in estimating rare traits is to deviate
from stratified random sampling. Areas under special study or
subpopulations among which the trait in question is less rare can
be deliberately overrepresented. For example, if cocaine use is
concentrated among upper-income urban males in the 20-45 age
bracket, a study of cocaine use might deliberately seek out a
sample including more such people; this is called oversampling.
The results of a survey using oversampling need to be adjusted to
project them back on the population. Those adjustments introduce
great complexity into the statistical analysis of survey data.
Subtle errors can easily creep in. In consequence, survey
researchers try to avoid using oversamples. </p>

<p>Random error, just because it is random, does not tend to bias
results. The luck of the draw produces overestimates and
underestimates impartially. It does, however, introduce
uncertainty. This is more of a problem when trying to measure
trends (where small changes from one survey to the next matter
greatly) than in measuring absolute levels. By contrast, both
sample bias and response bias can create systematic divergences
between survey results and actual phenomena. </p>

<p>Sample bias comes from a failure to draw a representative
sample. If the sampling technique makes persons with a given
trait under study more or less likely than average to be
selected, the sample results will consistently overestimate or
underestimate the trait in question. For example, the household
survey omits persons with no fixed address and those living in
dormitories, barracks, and prisons. If very heavy drug users are
more likely than the general population to be drifting, away at
school, in the service, or in prison, then the household survey
will underestimate the number of very heavy drug users.
Similarly, the high-school senior survey may underrepresent drug
abuse among persons in that age range for two reasons. By
choosing to study high-school seniors, it omits dropouts, who may
be more likely than average to be heavy drug users. In addition,
the actual sampling technique may tend to underrepresent frequent
absentees, and frequent absenteeism seems to be associated with
heavy drug use. </p>

<p>If the only statistics of interest are population proportions
(e.g., the proportion of the voters who think the President is
doing a good job), sample bias is a controllable problem. When
frequency or quantity is at issue (e.g., how frequently the
average high-school senior smokes marijuana, how much cocaine was
consumed last year, the total amount paid for heroin) sample bias
can be a major worry. A small proportion of any population can
easily account for a very large fraction of any activity, from
baseball games attended to books purchased. In the case of
alcohol, for example, 5 percent of the population accounts for 50
percent of the consumption. By one estimate, 10 percent of the
marijuana-using population smokes two-thirds of the marijuana.
Cocaine consumption may be even more skewed, with the additional
problem that the total number of cocaine users is itself much
smaller than the totals for marijuana and alcohol; two-thirds or
more of the cocaine consumption may be accounted for by one-half
a million users. </p>

<p>Sampling procedures to guard against underrepresenting such
very small populations are hard to devise, particularly when the
behavior under study tends to make them furtive or to reduce
their participation in various normal activities. Oversampling
can help; so can what are called &quot;snowball&quot; techniques,
where respondents who fit some profile are asked for the names of
other respondents. The illicit nature of drug abuse can make
&quot;snowball&quot; sampling very difficult, however. </p>

<p>Response bias comes from the systematic failure of respondents
to answer accurately. Any survey will gather some inaccurate
responses, due to misunderstanding the questions, lapses of
memory, or deliberate deception by respondents resulting from
fear of breach of confidentiality, embarrassment, or a simple
desire to tell the interviewer what the respondent thinks he or
she wants to be told. As long as those errors cancel out, they
pose no problem. The problem comes if the inaccuracies are tilted
to one side or the other. A survey that asks questions about
activities that are both illegal and socially disapproved runs a
greater-than-normal risk of encountering response bias. </p>

<p>A clue to how serious response bias can be, even with legal
behavior, comes from surveys where people are asked how much
alcohol they drink. Only two-thirds of the alcohol on which
excise tax is paid (which may be an undercount of alcohol sold if
distillers cheat the Treasury) is accounted for by survey
responses; the survey data thus underestimate consumption by at
least 50 percent. It has been suggested that psychological
&quot;denial&quot; by a small population of extremely heavy
drinkers may account for most of the difference. Here again, as
with sample bias, problems with a very small portion of the
sample can cause the results to be seriously wrong. On the other
hand, a compilation of studies in which survey responses to
questions about illegal drug use were compared with urine-test
results showed no tendency to underreport. </p>

<p>A special kind of response-bias problem comes when survey data
are used to estimate trends. If the level or social disapproval
as perceived by recipients changes, then response bias may change
too. For example, increasingly negative attitudes about marijuana
use might lead adolescent respondents to the high-school seniors
survey to be less likely to tell adult interviewers that they
smoked marijuana every day, even if their actual behavior did not
change. The result would be an apparent, but spurious, decline in
heavy marijuana use among adolescents. (This is not to say that
changing attitudes might not also change behavior, only that the
survey evidence is subject to error from this source). </p>

<p>There are no easy answers to the problem of response bias.
Sometimes, as in the studies cited by K. H. Marquis, it is
possible to collect independent data as a check on a sample of
responses, and then adjust the sample results for the measured
bias. Another strategy is to vary the circumstances of response,
for example, by using &quot;secret ballot&quot; answer sheets
instead of face-to-face questioning or by changing the
characteristics of the interviewers. Just as pollsters long ago
discovered that black respondents answered many questions
differently when the interviewers were black, it may be the case
that some adolescents would respond differently to questions
about drug use put by another adolescent - particularly one
dressed and groomed in ways consistent with drug use - than to
the same questions put by an adult. </p>

<p>Changes and Supplements to Current Surveys </p>

<p>Both the household survey and the high-school seniors survey,
conducted by experienced researchers at institutions with
reputations for producing high-quality survey research, are
well-designed for their intended purposes: primarily the
measurement of the number of drug users, secondarily the
measurement of frequency of drug use. But from the perspective of
making drug enforcement policy, and particularly policy to
control organized crime, they do not gather the right data, or
gather it from the right people, or gather it frequently enough.
The most important things surveys can tell us are the quantity of
each drug purchased and consumed; the prices at which those
purchases are made; the identities and relationships of buyers
and sellers; the effects of enforcement on market conditions; and
the effects of market conditions on consumption. In order to
learn these things, surveys would have to: </p>

<p>1. Find More of the Heavy Drug-Users. So much of total drug
consumption is concentrated among a relatively few very heavy
users that no practical increase in sample size for a stratified
random sample among the general population will yield an adequate
sample. For example, the 5,000-person household survey could
expect to get by chance about a dozen of the one half-million
heaviest cocaine users. There are two ways to get a meaningful
sample of heavy users: either use oversampling in drawing
respondents for the household and high-school senior surveys, or
run separate studies of heavy use. The &quot;Young Men and
Drugs&quot; studies show both the feasibility of finding samples
rich in serious drug abusers and the value of the results that
finding such samples can yield. </p>

<p>2. Ask about Prices and Quantities purchased. We would like to
know when the user's last purchase of a given drug took place;
what quantity was involved, plus whatever the purchaser knows or
was told about purity/potency/ quality; and how much money
changed hands; this information is essential to making any
serious estimate of the dollar volume of the market. </p>

<p>3. Ask about the Conditions of the Transaction. Where did the
purchase take place? (The purchaser's residence, the seller's, a
school building, an office building, an apartment corridor, a
park, a street corner?) Were there other people present? Had the
transaction been prenegotiated? Was the price
take-it-or-leave-it, or was there negotiation? Was the
purchaser's previous transaction with the same seller or a
different seller? Is the seller a relative, a close friend, and
acquaintance, or a stranger? These questions can help answer
questions about the possible effectiveness of retail-level
enforcement as a way to cut down on the volume of drugs consumed.
</p>

<p>4. Ask about Price Increases, Shortages, Sharing, and Consumer
Inventories. Was the price of the most recent transaction higher
or lower than the respondent's previous transaction? Than the
respondent expected? If the price of the drug were to increase by
25 percent, what would the respondent do? (Use about the same
amount, use less, quit altogether, switch to another drug?) Has
the respondent ever been unable to find a supply of the drug in
question at any price? Does the respondent now have a supply of
the drug? If so, how long would it last at his normal consumption
rate? How frequently has the respondent used drugs purchased by
another? Given drugs to another? These questions will help
determine the effect of price increases and temporary shortages
on consumption behavior. Unfortunately, experience from market
research on legitimate products suggests that the answers to the
what-if questions are likely to be unreliable. </p>

<p>5. Give Information about Local Markets. Federal and local
enforcement efforts vary widely across the country in their
intensity and success, but there are almost no studies of what
the effects are on retail purchases and consumption. Nationwide
samples need to be supplemented with local ones. </p>

<p>6. Provide a Steady Stream of Data in Addition to Annual or
Once-Every-Two-Years Snapshots. This is particularly valuable in
combination with local data as a way of measuring the difference
enforcement makes (or fails to make). Is the availability of
drugs fairly constant, or does it vary? How do consumers respond?
Estimating the price-elasticity of demand requires frequent
measurements of both price and quantity, both to generate an
adequate number of data points and to avoid confounding price
effects with long-term trends or cohort effects on the demand
side. </p>

<p>One alternative to random sampling often used in market
research is a panel survey, where questions are asked repeatedly
of the same group of respondents. Panel data would be enormously
useful in understanding the effects of market conditions on drug
use, and the individual patterns of drug consumption. For
example, when drug supplies are short, how are consumption
decreases distributed among new users and existing users, poor
users and affluent users, heavy users and light users? What drugs
are used as substitutes when marijuana is scarce or expensive?
How many users, who cease use when supplies are tight, never
start up again, or start up at lower levels of use? An obvious
problem is assuring respondent confidentiality, and convincing
respondents that it is assured. Perhaps more worrisome, being
members of such a panel might make respondents more
drug-conscious, which raises serious ethical questions, as well
as threatening the validity of such studies. </p>

<p>Obstacles </p>

<p>Naturally, proposing such studies for someone else to fund and
carry out is much easier than doing the work. Aside from the
problems of expense and the mass of legal, ethical, and
operational issues raised by asking detailed questions about
illegal transactions, such studies would face several obstacles: </p>

<p>First, they would have to be cleared by the Office of
Management and Budget, which views any expansion of survey
research by the government with a jaundiced eye. The complexity
of the questions to be asked strongly argues for the value of
paying respondents a small fee to encourage them to complete the
interview, but this makes OMB reviewers even more nervous. (The
1981 household survey didn't get into the field until 1982
because of a dispute with OMB about forms and payments to
respondents.) </p>

<p>Second, modifying the existing surveys in terms of content or
sample selection will interfere with the ability of researchers
to compare results from one survey to the next to determine
trends. The preference of survey researchers for asking the same
questions in the same words to the same samples is not mindless
conservatism, but a well-founded belief in the virtues of
repeating measurements exactly, rather than changing survey
series represents a big investment of money and talent. </p>

<p>Finally, it is worth noting that neither the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, which funds the current surveys, nor the
researches who conduct them, share the policy and research
perspective urged here. NIDA is far more interested in the
patterns of drug abuse than in the size and functioning of the
drug markets. Nor is there any demand for this sort of research
from the enforcement and prosecution agencies. </p>

<p>Surveys of Dealers </p>

<p>The discussion above concerns only surveys of drug users. It
is also possible to survey drug dealers, asking both about their
own dealings - transactions, strategies for dealing with
customers, suppliers, and enforcement agencies, incomes,
expenses, encounters, if any, with organized crime, opinions of
enforcement risk, pricing policy, recruitment into the trade,
career patterns and goals - and about their knowledge of how the
drug markets work. There is probably no better way to start on
serious estimates of, for example, bow many marijuana or cocaine
to deliver drugs to the market - is more plausible the fewer the
participants, and the more stable the organizational structure,
of any given market. </p>

<p>Finding and interviewing a sample of dealers poses both
problems and risks for the researcher. However, we do have access
to a sample of drug dealers with nothing better to do than answer
questions: they are in federal and state prisons. Of course, they
may be unrepresentative of the overall dealer population,
particularly in terms of their success in avoiding enforcement,
and may also be unwilling to be interviewed, or to speak
candidly. </p>

<p>Still, if systematic interviews could be conducted with a
sample of convicted drug dealers, the results could not fail to
be informative. The Rand Corporation is now conducting a pilot
study along those lines funded by the National Institute of
Justice. </p>

<p>Consequence Data </p>

<p>One alternative to asking people about their consumption of
illicit substances is to observe the consequences of drug abuse.
These consequences include coming into contact with both the
police (arrests, automobile accidents) and the health care
system: hospital emergency rooms, medical examiners' offices, and
drug treatment facilities. There is now no systematic attempt to
record drug intoxication at arrest or at accident scenes of drug
users, but the National Institute of Drug Abuse maintains three
collection activities to gather medical data: the Drug Abuse
Warning Network (DAWN), the Client-Oriented Data Acquisition
Process (CODAP) and the Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG).
</p>

<p>The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) </p>

<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse collects and publishes
[National Institute on Drug Abuse Statistical Series I)
information from about one-sixth of the nation's emergency rooms,
with a heavy concentration on 26 metropolitan areas (SMSA's), and
from about two-thirds of the medical examiners in those 26 SMSA's
only. The emergency rooms report on patients who come in as a
result of acute ill experiences with the non-medical use of
drugs; the medical examiners report on persons who, in their
judgment, died as the direct result of drug use. In 1981, the
most recent year for which the data have been published, the DAWN
system recorded 121,268 emergency room visits and 2,825 deaths,
as a result of drugs. (The deaths exclude New York City, which
did not report to DAWN in 1981; in previous years, New York had
accounted for about one-quarter of DAWN medical examiner
reports.) </p>

<p>DAWN records all drugs used incidents of multiple drug abuse:
thus 121,268 emergency room &quot;episodes&quot; yielded 199,400
&quot;mentions,&quot; and 2,825 deaths involved 5,640 mentions.
Heroin is the third most frequently-mentioned drug in emergency
rooms, after alcohol-in-combination (alcohol alone is now counted
in DAWN) and diazepam (Valium). Cocaine is sixth, marijuana
seventh. Others in the top ten are aspirin, methaqualone,
acetaminophen (Tylenol), flurezapam (another tranquilizer) and
PCP. Heroin, marijuana, and cocaine, the three largest drug
markets in dollar terms, account for fewer than 20,000 total
mentions among them. This is such a tiny proportion of the users
of these drugs (about 1 in 50 heroin users, about 1 in 1,000
cocaine users, about 1 in 5,000 marijuana users) as to make any
inferences from the DAWN sample to the general population
extremely questionable. In any case, other than personal
demographic data, no questions are asked of DAWN subjects other
than &quot;what did you take?&quot; For some drugs, even the
answer to this question may be open to doubt, since illicit drug
sellers frequently misrepresent their wares, and DAWN sites are
not equipped to assay blood or urine to determine the chemical
composition of the &quot;speed&quot; or &quot;ludes&quot; that
subjects report they have taken. </p>

<p>Attempts to base estimates of patterns and trends in drug
availability on DAWN data, but they have not been convincing.
DAWN is valuable as an early warning network about both street
drugs and pharmaceuticals causing injury and death; but it does
not, and almost certainly cannot, contribute much to our
understanding of the kind of drug trafficking that contributes to
organized crime. </p>

<p>The Client Oriented Data Acquisition Process (CODAP) </p>

<p>Through 1981 NIDA gathered data from all federally-funded drug
treatment clinics and programs and published them as NIDA
Statistical Series E. Incentive to participate was provided by
making participation a condition of funding under the NIDA
categorical grant program that paid for drug treatment. The
abolition of that categorical grant program and the inclusion of
drug treatment in the Community Development Block Grant program
of direct fiscal assistance to the states both reduced the total
number of drug treatment facilities and eliminated any direct
relationship between the clinics and NIDA. As a result, NIDA can
mo longer compel participation in CODAP. Approximately 15 states
have voluntarily continued to submit CODAP data, and NIDA
collects the information and prepares am unofficial series of
annual reports. In 1981 there were 249,206 admissions to CODAP
facilities, more than three-fourths for outpatient treatment.
(Persons admitted more than once during the year were
double-counted, so the number of individuals admitted was
somewhat smaller). At any one time there were an average of
126,000 persons under treatment, almost 85 percent as
outpatients. </p>

<p>While CODAP collected demographic data and information about
the drugs for which its clients sought or were assigned to
treatment, it did not collect data about individual purchase and
consumption patterns. Variations in CODAP counts over time might
indicate either increases in abuser populations brought about by
increased availability, growing numbers of addicts without
connections brought about by decreased availability, or merely
increased availability of treatment. CODAP data were of great
interest to treatment professionals and produced interesting
time-series data on such indicators as age at first use (which
allowed some inferences about &quot;cohort effects&quot;).
However, CODAP had even less direct relevance to enforcement
planning than did DAWN. While local studies of enforcement
effectiveness may wish to gather data on treatment demand, this
can probably be done as effectively on an ad hoc basis as through
a process like CODAP. Reviving that process would not seem to be
a high priority from the viewpoint of organized-crime
policymaking. </p>

<p>The Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG) </p>

<p>The Community Epidemiology Work Group, also supported by NIDA,
collects reports from drug abuse prevention and treatment experts
and officials around the country about patterns and trends as
they perceive them in their own areas, and summarizes and
publishes those reports in volumes of &quot;Proceedings&quot;.
The local reports are not in standard format, and CEWG does not
generate statistical series. Prices are occasionally mentioned;
quantities rarely, if ever. It is conceivable that CEWG
participants night be encouraged and funded to develop informal
&quot;panel studies&quot; among drug users in their own areas.
But this would represent a substantial move away from CEWG's
current informality. </p>

<p>Changes and Other Studies </p>

<p>As suggested above, drug abuse consequence data have little
promise of contributing much to making or evaluating strategy
against organized crime. The one source not now tapped is arrest
data. Arrests of users - particularly heroin users - for property
crimes and prostitution may be quite sensitive indicators of
short-run changes in availability. To develop such data, it would
be necessary to test arrestees' urine for the presence of opiate
metabolites and quinine. The National Institute of Justice is
funding a few pilot programs along these lines. Assuming they
turn out to be operationally feasible, they probably represent a
wise investment of funds. </p>

<p>Enforcement Data </p>

<p>From the agencies that arrest, prosecute, try, and imprison
drug traffickers and seize their drugs and other assets, we can
gather valuable data both about the enforcement activity and
about the underlying illegitimate market. Some of this
information exists, or can readily be obtained, in statistical
form; the rest is buried in case reports, informant interviews,
and intelligence analyses. The one governmentally-published
series estimating the revenues in the drug markets, the annual
Narcotics Intelligence Estimate, is prepared primarily by
enforcement agencies (particularly DEA) and apparently in large
part from enforcement sources. </p>

<p>Information About Enforcement Activity </p>

<p>Three things about enforcement activity are of interest: </p>

<p>(1) Inputs. What resources - measured in dollars, agent-hours,
prosecutor-hours, cell-years, ship-days, wiretap orders under
Title III - are spent on drug enforcement, and how are those
resources divided among agencies, geographically, by target drug,
by enforcement technique, and by the trafficking activity under
investigation (high-seas smuggling, port smuggling, first
domestic distribution, wholesaling and middleman activity, retail
dealing, money laundering)? </p>

<p>Even at the Federal level alone, something as relatively
simple as a comprehensive dollar budget broken down by agency and
by drug is not available. An attempt has been made to estimate
the share of marijuana in total Federal enforcement; it
illustrates both what is and what is not available. Assembling
such data is best done within the government, by an agency with
the authority to demand the relevant documents, than by
outsiders; the Drug policy Board, the Office of Management and
Budget, the White House Drug Abuse policy Office, any one of the
cognizant Congressional subcommittees, the General Accounting
Office, or the President's Commission on Organized Crime could,
by collating budget submissions from the agencies involved,
assemble crude but adequate estimates of dollars spent by agency
and drug rather easily. </p>

<p>Assembling meaningful information about inputs in non-monetary
forms (e.g., work-hours) would be a tedious process, requiring
both access to internal agency reporting systems and an
understanding of how those systems represent or misrepresent
reality. However, assuming that something resembling the DEA's
annual statistical report is available from the Coast Guard,
Customs Service, IRS, and FBI, it might be possible to assemble a
fair picture of Federal enforcement activity. Federal prosecution
agencies do not now have the ability to generate statistical
profiles of their work that would be useful here. The
case-management software system (PROMIS) being installed in the
U.S. Attorneys' offices may be able to produce estimates of
prosecutive work-hours by case type, although the system may not
code enough of the case data (e.g., G-DEP rank of case and
defendants) to allow useful analysis. </p>

<p>The Administrative Office of U.S. Courts can produce
cases-pending counts by offense, although this overestimates drug
cases as a proportion of total cases to the extent that drug
defendants are more likely than others to default on bail and
thus remain as active cases for long periods of time; no
estimates are made of the use of judge-days or grand jury days
for various kinds of cases. Moreover, since the statute names and
numbers attached to a given drug charge (manufacture,
distribution, conspiracy, continuing criminal enterprise, etc.)
do not vary with drug involved, it is almost impossible to
separate the conviction data by drug. It is possible to make very
crude estimates of Federal prison-cell utilization by convicted
drug dealers from the court data. The attempt to work directly
from DEA data is frustrated by the fact that the DEA statistical
report lists total convictions, rather than convictions in
Federal courts. The lack of a unified set of file numbers for the
federal criminal-justice agencies, or a set of links from one
file system to the next (what is called an &quot;Offender-Based
Tracking system,&quot; or OBTS) makes it nearly impossible to
trace a sample of DEA defendants through prosecution and
incarceration. </p>

<p>The primary problem with assembling such data is not
technical, but organizational: its collection and dissemination
are not in the perceived interests of the agencies involved or
the key individuals within them. While that remains, little
progress is to be expected. Below the Federal level, the
situation is much worse; there are simply no published figures on
drug enforcement spending or activities by state and local police
agencies, most of which do not have separate drug enforcement
units. </p>

<p>The current paucity of data on enforcement activities would
frustrate any attempt to study the effects of changes in
enforcement resources on the drug markets, even if adequate price
and quantity data were in hand. This problem is not easy to fix;
unless the agencies involved have their own reasons for
collecting the data, it will be difficult either for
&quot;outsiders&quot; - even from within the government - to do
the job or to persuade the agencies to do it instead. The
situation is similar for state and local enforcement; in the
absence of any convenient ways of getting nationwide data, a few
studies of individual cities and states might be useful. </p>

<p>(2) Outputs. How do those inputs translate into enforcement
actions felt by traffickers: arrests, convictions, sentences,
time actually served in prison, drug seizures, asset seizures?
How are those outputs distributed geographically, by drug, by
level of the traffic? </p>

<p>These figures are less nebulous than resource and workload
data; a man-hour is &quot;the stuff that dreams are made
on,&quot; but an arrest actually happens. Nonetheless, although
DEA reports its arrests broken down by almost every possible
variable, there is no government-wide collation of all arrest
reports. Convictions and prison time, as noted above, are simply
not available in useful formats. </p>

<p>Even drug seizure data are complicated by the multiplicity of
agencies involved; simply adding together agency totals runs the
risk of double-counting. The first annual report of the Organized
Crime Drug Trafficking Task Force program gives government-wide
numbers that may be reliable. </p>

<p>Data on asset seizures are complicated both by interagency
(and Federal/ State/local) cooperation and by the complexity of
seizure cases: appraised value is one thing, realized value less
lienholders' equity something very different. The lags in
forfeiture actions against seized items, plus the growth in the
overall level of seizures, make it difficult to compute
seizure-to-forfeiture ratios, because 1984 forfeitures do not
correspond to 1984 seizures. Some central responsibility for this
area was assigned to the U.S. Marshal Service and the Asset
Forfeiture Office of the Criminal Division of the Justice
Department; those agencies may now be in a position to provide
unified statistics. </p>

<p>Arrests, convictions, seizures, and prison time are basic
measures of risk imposed on the illicit drug industry, and it is
very hard to plan or evaluate policy in their absence. Unlike
most of the input numbers, good output measures can be assembled
with only minimal cooperation from the agencies themselves, if
someone with authority insists on it. </p>

<p>Below the Federal level the situation is more dismal. Other
than the uninformative counts of total drug arrests in the
Uniform Crime Reports, no national data are available. It has
been almost ten years since the last national study of state
prisoners by offense category, and even that study combined all
drug offenses into one category. Here again, the best that can be
hoped for is a few well-done local studies. </p>

<p>(3) Effects. Enforcement actions impose costs and risks on
illicit entrepreneurs and thus tend to increase prices and
perhaps to make supplies less reliable. To some extent the
cost-imposition value of a given enforcement action - the
imprisonment of a major marijuana importer for an effective term
of six years, the seizure of one kilogram of 90 percent pure
heroin from a New York City wholesaler - can be calculated, and
those costs can be added together to estimate the effects of
enforcement on the market. Such calculations could contribute
substantially to policy analysis and evaluation. They could form
the basis for comparisons of alternative enforcement techniques
in terms of the costs imposed on a given drug market per
government dollar spent. However, to make then accurately one
needs the right kind of tabulation of enforcement outputs. </p>

<p>The value of any illicit drug grows enormously as it moves
down the distribution chain toward the final consumer. A kilogram
of heroin that sells for $200,000 is the raw material for street
bags of heroin worth more than $2 million. Adding together
physical volumes seized at different stages of the traffic is
adding apples and oranges. Each seizure should be evaluated at
the point where it is seized, and then the values added together.
The &quot;street value&quot; calculations, so beloved by
reporters, resemble calculations of the value of stolen cattle
based on the price of a steak dinner in a restaurant. Given
estimates of the &quot;price chains&quot; (of which more below),
simple rules of thumb, based on quantity and location, will give
reasonable estimates of the coast imposed on the illicit market
by drug seizures. Imprisonment data also need to be
quality-weighted. The higher in the trade a trafficker is, the
more dollars he would spend to avoid a year in prison, both
because he has more dollars and because any given period in
prison costs him more in lost earnings. That willingness-to-pay
per prison-year-willingness-to-pay of traffickers at different
levels. But unless the data on imprisonment are collected by drug
and G-DEP violator class, there are no figures to use in
calculation. </p>

<p>Information about Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime </p>

<p>Enforcement activity yields two kinds of information about
drug trafficking: (1) that which can be inferred from the
enforcement statistics, and (2) that known to (and sometimes
published by) agents, prosecutors, and enforcement-agency
intelligence analysts. </p>

<p>(1) Inferences from Enforcement Statistics. Lost in the
organizational history of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics is the
unsung hero who first proposed the rule of thumb that enforcement
agencies capture about 10 percent of the drug supply on its way
to market. That rule of thumb allows (once the problems with the
seizure data are straightened away) a simple calculation of the
physical size of the drug markets: take seizures and add a zero.
More of the official drug market estimation than anyone would
like to admit is still based on some variant of that methodology.
</p>

<p>There are two problems with this calculation. First, there was
never a period when we had a good measure of the total market
traffickers will tend to lower it. In fact, if the change in
enforcement is great enough to cause shifts in basic smuggling
patterns, the result may be a lower overall seizure rate despite
a higher level of enforcement. This seems to have been the case
for the South Florida Task Force, which succeeded both in driving
drug smugglers away from its territory and in causing many of
them to switch from large vessels to smaller, faster vessels;
total seizures actually fell. </p>

<p>The same is true of using other enforcement measures as
estimates of market size. The enforcement success count depends
on the size of the market, the vigor and tactics of enforcement,
and the countermeasures of traffickers. Without an independent
basis for estimating the effect of countermeasures, the success
count tells us little even about trends in the size of the
market. </p>

<p>(2) Facts and Analysis From Agents and Agencies. Drug
enforcement agencies are not in business to collect data or do
analysis; they are in business to put drug dealers in jail and
seize their drugs. Like other agencies, they tend to collect and
publish data that will help them do their job better, will
persuade someone else to help them do their job better, or will
make them look good. </p>

<p>Traditionally, the Drug Enforcement Agency and its
predecessors defined their mission as controlling the supply of
drugs. Thus, for example, the estimates of the price and purity
of heroin at retail were published as part of the
&quot;Performance Measurement System,&quot; implying that drug
availability was an important measure of agency effectiveness.
This mission definition encouraged the development within DEA of
an extensive &quot;strategic intelligence&quot; capability,
devoted to understanding the drug markets. By contrast, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation has always defined its mission as
securing the conviction of lawbreakers. It regarded the number of
bank robbers it caught, rather than the number of bank robberies,
as its central performance measure. Since the 1981 reorganization
that placed DEA under the administrative authority of the
Director of the FBI, DEA's mission definition has moved closer to
the FBI's. At least in part, this reflected a belief that
enforcement outputs were more subject to organizational control,
and thus more likely to consistently reflect organizational
success, than drug market outcomes. This new mission definition
may have advantages from the perspective of organized crime
control. The supply-control approach tended to stress quantities
of drugs rather than trafficking organizations as targets.
However, the new mission definition is much less hospitable to
strategic, as opposed to operational, intelligence. </p>

<p>(a) Price Chains. In the past DEA devoted considerable energy
to estimating &quot;price chains&quot; for drugs, based on
undercover buys and data from informants. That information,
insofar as it was accurate, told a great deal about the structure
of the markets, and in particular about where the money was being
made. It was never formally published, but it was estimated on a
quarterly basis and available to the rest of the government. It
appears that such &quot;price chain&quot; estimates are no longer
made, or no longer made available. If true, that should be
rectified. There is no other source for that information, and it
is essential. There is an enormous amount of relevant information
in DEA case files. Undercover transactions, intercepted
communications, and conversations with informants all contain
price data. The problem is maintaining a staff to collate and
analyze what is there. One improvement that could easily be made
in publishing all statistics on drug prices is to adjust past
prices for the effects of inflation, using the Consumer Price
Index or GNP deflator. Otherwise, anyone trying to determine
price trends has to keep looking up the rate of inflation since
1976, or whatever appropriate date. </p>

<p>(b) &quot;Monitor&quot; Programs. DEA has never had a
substantial number of retail-level cases, but the Performance
Measurement System required data about retail price and purities
for heroin across the country. These were accordingly collected
by the simple expedient of sending agents out to make undercover
retail purchases and collecting retail samples from local police
to seek good quality at low prices? More seriously,
&quot;retail&quot; included samples as large as 2 grams and up to
14 percent pure, while the typical actual retail transaction is
for 100 milligrams (one-tenth of a gram) less than 5 percent
pure. </p>

<p>Now that price-purity data are no longer publicly released,
there seems to be somewhat less monitoring activity than in the
past. It may well be true that a program run by local police
units (perhaps with funding from DEA or NIJ) would be more
effective than DEA-run monitoring efforts. (Unofficial
researchers might develop even more accurate results, but the
legal and ethical problems seem insurmountable). But whether run
by DEA or outside, there is no substitute for actual street buys
as an index of market conditions, and not only for heroin. </p>

<p>Enforcement-based Analysis: NNICC </p>

<p>The National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee
(NNICC, pronounced &quot;nick&quot;) is the official custodian of
estimates regarding the drug markets. It was originally
established to help control the embarrassing flow of mutually
contradictory estimates that used to emerge from various Federal
agencies. Although staffed primarily from DEA, it includes a
broad variety of agencies as members, and its reports are
negotiated products. </p>

<p>At one time, the NNICC annual report, called the Narcotics
Intelligence Estimate, provided sources, physical volumes, and
dollar revenues for each of the four major drug categories:
opiates, cannabis, cocaine, and the &quot;dangerous drugs.&quot;
Subsequently, criticism of the dollar-volume estimates, both from
outsiders and from within the NNICC staff, led to a decision to
cease publication of dollar-volume estimates. At the same time
the marijuana estimates for previous years were restated downward
by approximately one-third. As the NNICC methodology review makes
clear, the NIE figures are largely derived from estimates of
farm-level production in foreign source countries, because the
data sources on the consumption side are so inadequate. However,
that same report shows how weakly grounded the production-based
estimates are. The crop figures themselves are hard to
distinguish from guesswork, and the fraction of each country's
crop reaching the U.S. market is fundamentally unknown. </p>

<p>Still more serious is a problem not considered in the
methodology review: that a large fraction of the total crop in
the average year may go unsold. But a peasant marijuana-grower,
for example, deciding how many plants to grow under uncertainty
both about crop yields and about demand from exporters, will, if
he is rational, overplant on average. Marijuana is so lucrative,
compared with other crops, that it makes sense to grow an extra
plant, even if there is only one chance in five of selling it for
export. Of course, if there were a smoothly functioning
competitive market over wide geographic areas, the result would
be lower prices rather than unsold crops, but the market in
marijuana for export may be highly localized, with exporters
buying from nearby farmers even if prices elsewhere are much
lower. </p>

<p>In general, then, it is hard to place much confidence in the
NIE numbers, particularly because they are presented as a just
set of conclusions, without any detailed presentation of the
underlying data or the calculations performed on that data. One
way to improve this situation would be to gather better data,
particularly about consumption, as discussed above. </p>

<p>On the purely analytic side, two things might be done: (1)
NNICC might publish more of its underlying data and some of the
details about the calculations performed on them, or (2) a team
of outside scholars might be allowed full access to NNICC
materials and asked to prepare an independent estimate. </p>

<p>But whether one considers improving the data with which NNICC
has to work or changing the analytic approach, the fundamental
problem remains one of organizational incentives. The current
lack of adequate data or convincing analysis is not a problem
from the perspective of DEA or other enforcement agencies. If the
information were available, there is no reason to expect that it
would be used to reshape what agents and prosecutors do. In fact,
by providing outsiders with a basis on which to criticize, data
and analysis might seem to threaten agency autonomy. Nor have the
White House or Congressional staffs concerned with these problems
displayed any anxiety over the absence of information. The first
step in solving a problem is getting it identified as a problem
by someone with the resources to bring about a solution. In this
area, that step remains to be taken.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Recommendations for the Regulation of
Selected Chemicals and Controlled Substance Analogs </h2>

<p>By Frank Monastero. Submitted: September 1985. Frank Monastero
retired in 1985, having served as the Chief of Operations of the
Drug Enforcement Administration. </p>

<p>As we can see from media reports, cocaine has fast become the
nation's number one drug abuse problem. The supply of cocaine
coming from South America has reached overwhelming proportions.
In 1985 alone the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimates
seizures will reach 50,000 pounds, and this, of course, does not
account for that part of the supply that ultimately reaches the
more than 20 million regular users. </p>

<p>Another facet of the drug abuse problem, which could grow as
rapidly if not addressed promptly, is that of controlled
substance analogs, known as &quot;designer drugs.&quot; These are
clandestinely produced substances not covered by the Controlled
Substances Act because of their chemical structure. </p>

<p>Most drugs, including those manufactured illicitly, are
produced at least in part from commercially available chemicals.
The purpose of this paper is to examine the feasibility and
desirability of regulating certain of these chemicals. It will
also analyze how to curtail illicit production and examine what
legal mechanism would be effective to control the manufacture of
synthetic analogs (designer drugs), produced for illicit
purposes. </p>

<p>Cocaine abused in the United States has its origin from the
coca bush, a very hardy plant, grown in certain areas of South
and Central America. As in the case with almost all drugs,
whether produced from plants or totally synthetic, one or more
precursors, reagents or solvents is used in the process. These
chemicals are defined as follows: a precursor is a raw material
used in the production of a controlled substance that becomes
part of the finished product; a reagent reacts chemically with
one or more precursors but does not become part of the finished
product; a solvent, which does not react chemically with a
precursor or reagent and does not become part of the finished
product, is used to dissolve solid precursors or reagents, to
dilute reaction mixtures, and to separate and purify other
chemicals. For example, a precursor for cocaine is coca leaves, a
reagent is sulfuric acid, and a solvent used in the manufacturing
process is acetone. With respect to methamphetamine, a precursor
is phenyl-2-propanone, a reagent is sulfuric acid, and a solvent
is methanol. It is important to understand that, in the case of
these and other controlled substances, there are many other
precursors, reagents and solvents, which can easily be
substituted to produce the same final product. </p>

<p>With some exceptions only the final product drug itself, is a
controlled substance. Many of the chemicals used to produce or
refine illicit drugs are needed in industry to produce a myriad
of items and are produced in tremendous quantities. Controlling
their distribution would, in most cases, be impossible and
probably undesirable because of the cost alone. Acetone, for
instance, which is used as a solvent in processing opium and coca
leaves, is used to make paints, lubricants, pharmaceuticals,
cosmetics and agricultural products. </p>

<p>Although controlling all precursors, reagents and solvents
used to manufacture illicit drugs is neither desirable nor
feasible, the idea of controlling certain chemicals has merit. In
fact, some chemicals are now subject to regulation. Piperidine is
a precursor to the controlled substance phencyclidine, commonly
known as PCP, which can have serious physical and psychological
consequences when abused. Piperidine is subject to reporting
requirements under the Controlled Substances Act, although its
possession and distribution are not subject to penalties, as is
the case with the possession and distribution of PCP. Forms
recording the sale of piperidine and the purchaser's name must be
maintained for two years. Anyone who sells piperidine must report
the sale. This reporting procedure allows DEA to monitor sales of
piperidine and to investigate those sales recognized as
suspicious by either DEA or the seller. As a result of concerted
efforts begun in late 1984, DEA has seized four clandestine PCP
laboratories and has located at least ten operations that
received chemicals from legitimate channels by posing as
legitimate businesses. In one case a manufacturer shipped a
substantial amount of piperidine to a &quot;chemical
company&quot; over an extended period, all in good faith based on
the company's name. A check of the address by DEA showed it to be
an auto repair shop. </p>

<p>Precursors, reagents and solvents are used to manufacture many
drugs, including synthetic analogs, drugs so close in structure
to controlled substances that they create virtually the same
effect for the user. These are not covered under the Controlled
Substances Act because of minor differences in molecular
structure. Synthetic analogs, commonly known as &quot;designer
drugs,&quot; pose particular health threats. </p>

<p>The production of controlled substance analogs,
pharmacologically active, chemically related substances, to avoid
the laws regulating controlled substances, was first observed in
the mid-1960's with the synthesis of amphetamine analogs of
mescaline, such as MDA and others. Some of this group of
hallucinogenic amphetamines sold on the illicit market were
brought under the Drug Abuse Control Amendments, a predecessor to
the Controlled Substances Act. Others in the group were
subsequently controlled under the Controlled Substances Act after
its passage in 1970. Later three PCP analogs were controlled. </p>

<p>The process of designing analogs is, therefore, not new, and
the formulas are not primarily a phenomenon of clandestine
laboratories. Most of these drugs were developed by legitimate
pharmaceutical chemists in search of better medicinal agents
through the testing of numerous analogs of a parent compound. It
is not surprising, therefore, that some of their precursors have
names such as N-(1-phenethyl-4-piperidinyl)-aniline (for
fentanyl) or N-[1-(2-phenylisopropyl)]-4-piperidinone-4-one (for
alpha-methylfentanyl). These analogs, in many cases, mimic the
qualitative actions of the original compound but may vary in
potency or duration of action. Thus, there is a need to deal both
with the problem of chemicals used in the production of illicit
drugs and with the problem of controlled substance analogs. </p>

<p>Factors Affecting the Regulation of Chemicals </p>

<p>There are in excess of 200 precursors, reagents and solvents
used in the production of the 37 most commonly abused substances.
Among these are amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, Diazepam,
hash oil, heroin, LSD, MDA, PCP and methaqualone. In considering
what should be regulated two factors are most significant: (1)
How common is the chemical interest? (2) How great is the
workload to track the needed information? Each situation must be
examined individually, if the objective is to reach an ultimate
solution for each drug. </p>

<p>It is quickly apparent that there is no ultimate, universal
solution to absolute chemical control for all drugs. Acetone and
ether, although widely used, are subject to tracing. Piperidine,
less available commercially, is easily synthesized. The first
conclusion might well be that if the source of the chemical is
known and that source will identify and report suspicious sales,
the investigator will be able to pursue the investigation.
Obviously, this will not help when all chemicals can be obtained
from illicit sources. But when the source will provide assistance
or at least when sales information is available for review,
tracing can be attempted. </p>

<p>The problem then becomes one of resources. How much
information can be reviewed and how many people are available to
pursue leads. These are very significant factors to consider. If,
indeed, all chemicals used in the production of controlled
substances were reported it is unlikely the responsible agency
could cull the most suspicious orders, let alone investigate
them. The computer input itself would be substantial.
Furthermore, the drug abuse situation is constantly changing, and
a chemical, not of interest today, might be a prime target as a
new drug emerges. </p>

<p>Case Study: Ether </p>

<p>Because cocaine abuse is a serious problem in the United
States at this time and because an increasing number of cocaine
laboratories are being seized, it is important to examine the
chemical control of cocaine. To refine coca, dried leaves are
moistened with an alkaline solution, such as lime water, sodium
or potassium carbonate. The moistened leaves are soaked in
kerosene, which extracts cocaine and similar compounds. The
kerosene is extracted with aqueous sulfuric acid, and the acid
neutralized with limestone or lime. After the cocaine
precipitates and is removed by filtering, it becomes coca paste.
To become cocaine base, the paste is dissolved in a solution of
sulfuric acid, and a solution of potassium permanganate is added
to aridize impurities. The solution is filtered to remove
impurities and manganese oxides. Anmoniun hydroxide is added to
the filtrate, and the precipitate is collected and dried, forming
the base. The base is dissolved in acetone or ether and filtered
to remove insoluble material. Concentrated hydrochloric acid is
added in acetone along with ether. Cocaine hydrochloride will
crystallize from this solution and is collected by filtration and
dried. The ratio of base to cocaine hydrochloride is one to one. </p>

<p>Because ether and acetone are readily available in the United
States, traffickers recognized the advantage of processing here,
and the number of base to hydrochloride laboratories seized
increased steadily from 3 in 1980 to 21 in 1984; as of mid-1985,
there were already 25. </p>

<p>Six reagents are used to refine cocaine: ammonia, hydrochloric
acid, lime, limestone, potassium carbonate, potassium
permanganate and sulfuric acid. The four solvents used are
acetone, ethanol, ether and kerosene. These could be targets for
monitoring or control. However, after considering the
availability and usage of each chemical, the possible targets can
be narrowed to acetone and ether. As mentioned earlier, acetone
has a number of legitimate uses. An estimated 2.5 billion pounds
is produced each year in the United States, a commercial value of
about $400 million. </p>

<p>There are 12 major U.S. producers and over 40 foreign sources.
Although usually produced from petroleum or synthesized from
benzene, there are other processes to produce it. Nonetheless,
acetone, in fact, was selected as a target, and the targeting did
produce results. Ether, likewise, has broad use, with a U.S.
production estimate of over 60 million pounds, but with only five
U.S. producers and seven major foreign sources. Ether, therefore,
represents, and did turn out to be, an even better target. </p>

<p>Early in 1982 a project was undertaken to determine how much
ether was being shipped to Colombia and to what, if any,
legitimate uses it was put. Colombia was selected because,
although most of the coca is grown in Bolivia and Peru, most of
the cocaine processing laboratories were known to be in Colombia.
The Colombian government determined that thousands of gallons of
ether were being imported annually, but that there was virtually
no legitimate need for it. Most of the ether was imported from
the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States. Through
liaison with those ether manufacturers and distributors who would
cooperate, hundreds of barrels of the chemical were tracked to
clandestine laboratories deep in the Amazon jungles of Colombia.
Many of these labs were destroyed and thousands of pounds of
cocaine were seized. In the celebrated Tranquilandia raid in
March 1984, 10,000 kilograms of cocaine paste and base were
seized and destroyed, along with thousands of barrels of
chemicals. Through court testimony and media attention, cocaine
producers have, no doubt, become aware of the detection
techniques used to locate laboratories, and they are or will take
action to avoid detection. Opportunities for a continuing supply
of ether exist through unscrupulous manufacturers and
distributors and through clandestine production from ethanol.
However, the program has been useful and demonstrates the
effectiveness of the monitoring approach. </p>

<p>Case Study: P2P </p>

<p>In addition to tracking chemicals, such as ether, another
approach is to bring certain chemicals under the Controlled
Substances Act. For experience with this approach, it is
important to examine methamphetamine and one of its precursors,
phenyl-2-propanone (P2P). Domestic methamphetamine production is
significant. In fact, during a 45 month period beginning in
September 1981, more than 50 percent of the 751 clandestine
laboratories seized by DEA were methamphetamine labs. In order to
control clandestine methamphetamine production, P2P was placed in
Schedule II of the Controlled Substance Act on February 11, 1980.
P2P is an immediate precursor (used in the step just prior to
completion) in the most desirable synthesis and was, therefore, a
good choice for targeting. Furthermore, with the exception of its
use as a cleaning solution, most of its uses are in connection
with pharmaceutical manufacturing. Annual production in the U.S.
is estimated to be about 10,000 pounds, with only two principal
domestic producers and nine foreign sources. Full control of P2P
under the Control Substances Act resulted in a significant
increase in the number of clandestine methamphetamine laboratory
operators synthesizing P2P. More than 75 percent of the
laboratories seized after passage were refluxing phenylacetic
acid and acetic anhydride with sodium acetate or pyridine. In
addition, one laboratory was synthesizing phenylacetic acid as
well. </p>

<p>Recommendations for Action </p>

<p>(1) That legislation be enacted requiring the reporting of all
sales of selected chemicals used in the production of controlled
substances, subject to public notice by the Administrator of DEA
that a particular chemical was selected for such control. This
would create a requirement similar to that affecting piperidine;
however, reporting would only be required for those chemicals
specified for a particular period of time. The requirement should
apply to the importing and exporting of the specified chemicals. </p>

<p>(2) That legislation be enacted to empower the Administrator
of DEA or some other appropriate authority to identify and add
new chemicals to the list of those requiring reporting, as it
becomes known they are being used for the production of
controlled substances. </p>

<p>(3) That DEA identify the resources needed for the
computerization, analysis and follow up on reporting and that
those resources be acquired through the budget process. </p>

<p>Controlled Substance Analogs </p>

<p>As previously stated, the controlled substance analog problem
is not new. However, their wider illicit use and the greater
recognition of their use has heightened concern. There have been
three major types of analogs available in the United States:
analogs of PCP, analogs of amphetamine and methamphetamine having
hallucinogenic properties, and the newer trend, analogs of
fentanyl and meperidine. There are, of course, hazards common to
all three groups. They are likely to contain toxic impurities.
Dosage is not consistent, i.e., one dose of a substance is likely
to contain a different amount of the active ingredient than
another. As a result, a single dose could contain a lethal amount
of the drug in question. Because they are analogs, they may well
produce toxic effects not caused by their parent drug. Another
critical consideration associated with designer drugs is the
difficulty of identifying them in the body. Recent testimony at a
Senate hearing indicated there are now only two laboratories in
the country, capable of identifying certain &quot;designer
drugs&quot; in body fluids, because standards for identifying the
drugs are not widely available. This creates two serious
problems: (1) Without the ability to detect and determine what
drugs are being used on the street it is impossible to even
identify that a problem exists let alone judge its magnitude; and
(2) without being able to determine positively what drugs has
been ingested, it is impossible to identify the correct antidote,
which in many cases could be a matter of life and death. </p>

<p>The Situation in More Detail </p>

<p>PCP was originally developed in the early 1950's as an
anesthetic for humans, but it was soon limited to veterinary use
because of its adverse side effects. Licit production ceased in
1978, and PCP is controlled in Schedule I of the Controlled
Substances Act, as are three of its analogs. They now are
recognized as having no medical use. The National Institute on
Drug Abuse has identified 35 other analogs, but none has
presented an abuse problem as far as is known. </p>

<p>Many analogs of amphetamine and methamphetamine are known to
have hallucinogenic affects. One receiving considerable media
attention recently, known on the street as &quot;Ecstasy,&quot;
is MDMA or 3,4-methylene dioxymethamphetamine from the parent
compound MDA. Its psychopharmacological effects are similar to
those of MDA, altered consciousness, increased acoustic, visual
and tactile sensory perceptions and mild intoxication. There is
considerable concern among some experts that MDMA is likely to
cause damage to the serotonergic system, which has to do with
regulating sleep, mood, sexual activity and sensitivity to
aversive stimuli. The conclusion is based on research indicating
that MDA can selectively destroy serotonergic nerve terminals in
the rat brain. First recognized in the illicit traffic by DEA in
1970, MDMA was proposed for control under the Controlled
Substances Act in July 1984 because of increasing incidents of
discovery. However, because of rapidly mounting evidence of abuse
since then and possible serious neurological damage, the
emergency provisions contained in the Comprehensive Crime Control
Act of 1984 were used, and the drug was controlled as of July 1,
1985. </p>

<p>Fentanyl is widely used by the medical community as an
analgesic and anesthetic. It was first marketed in the United
States for this purpose in 1968 and is the most popular analgesic
used in surgical procedures in this country. There are likely
several hundred fentanyl analogs, many with pharmacological
properties similar to heroin or morphine but far more powerful.
The alpha-methyl analog was the first synthetic analog drug
recognized in the illicit traffic and was associated with
overdose deaths in California in 1979. Sold on the streets as
synthetic heroin, or &quot;China White,&quot; it was placed in
Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act in September 1981,
substantially eliminating its appearance in the illicit traffic.
DEA has identified seven additional fentanyl analogs in the
illicit traffic since then, however. Interestingly, two analogs
have not been recognized in the scientific literature. </p>

<p>There are two dramatic concerns related to the fentanyl
analogs: (1) their potency; and (2) their production/profit
margin. This second element will be of obvious importance to
traditional organized crime elements. Three methyl-fentanyl, the
latest analog to appear in the illicit market, is 3,000 times as
potent as morphine and has already been responsible for over a
dozen overdose deaths in the San Francisco Bay area alone. This
is the highest rate of fentanyl related deaths to date. Dosages
for fentanyl analogs are measured in micrograms and are likely to
be less than 1 percent of the dosage unit sold to the user. The
Drug Enforcement Administration has estimated that one kilogram
of fentanyl analog could be manufactured for under $2,000 and
that this amount might equal as many as 50 million dosage units,
with a street value exceeding one billion dollars. </p>

<p>Meperidine, a synthetic narcotic used to control pain, is
frequently used by heroin users when the street supply of heroin
is low. Meperidine, known more commonly by its trade name
&quot;Demerol,&quot; is in the Controlled Substances Act,
Schedule II. Two analogs of meperidine have been found in current
use. The first apparent MPPP (1-Methyl-4-Propionoxy piperidine)
abuse came to light in 1976 when a young man synthesized what he
thought was the analog for his own use. He soon sought treatment
for symptoms of Parkinson's disease. In revealing his drug use he
provided the formula and procedures he had used. Subsequent
analysis revealed he had, in fact, created MPTP. Additional
research by a National Institute of Health grantee showed that
MPTP had produced the Parkinson's type symptoms. MPPP was first
identified by a DEA laboratory in 1982; and samples of MPPP have
been discovered to contain the neurotoxic byproduct MPTP, formed
during the synthesis of MPPP. The neurological damage produced by
MPTP is irreversible and apparently worsens with time. The State
of California has identified more than 500 people who have used
MPTP; many users thought it was a new synthetic heroin. Twenty of
those involved have been permanently crippled. A group of seven
young addicts, who appeared at a California medical center
several years ago with symptoms resembling advanced Parkinson's
disease, were unable to move or talk. Treatment with
anti-Parkinson's therapy was, according to California
authorities, probably life saving, yet the patients continued to
be severely handicapped, requiring medication every one to three
hours just to be able to eat and drink. </p>

<p>The other meperidine analog with effects similar to heroin is
PePAP (l-(2-Phenylethyl)-4-Acetyloxpiperidine). The analgesic
potency of PePAP, measured in rodents, is described as from 12 to
72 times the potency of meperidine itself. This analog has so far
been discovered in California, although a clandestine laboratory
operation in Texas may have been attempting the process but did
not succeed. </p>

<p>Proposed Legislation </p>

<p>As mentioned at the outset of this discussion, unless the
specific chemical makeup of the substance being abused can be
determined by all laboratories regularly engaged in the analysis
of substances being abuse, serious problems could go unrecognized
for long periods, even years. Those who examine for and record
overdose deaths and injuries must likewise be able to determine
the abused substance involved. Further, that information must be
collected and analyzed at a central point. There is currently
only a limited mechanism for this collection (the NIDA DAWN
system). When a situation needing attention is discovered,
enforcement authorities must be empowered to act quickly. This
means that a mechanism must exist by which these &quot;designer
drugs&quot; can be controlled under the Controlled Substances Act
and appropriate State laws. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act
of 1984 does contain such a provision. Under that statute the
Administrator of DEA can bring a drug under Schedule I for up to
one year, with a six month extension where justified, and on
emergency basis, while the normal control mechanism is in
progress. The Administrator must decide that such scheduling is
necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to public safety. Control
of the substances occurs 30 days after public notice. The
efficacy of this legislation is yet undetermined, since it was
only first used in the Spring of 1985. </p>

<p>On July 16, 1985, a bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate, S.
1437, known as the &quot;Designer Drug Enforcement Act of
1985.&quot; This proposed legislation would make it a felony to
manufacture or distribute a designer drug for human consumption.
The proposed act, which would amend the Controlled Substance Act,
reads in part &quot;(31) The term 'designer drug' as used in
section 403A means a substance other than a controlled substance
that has a chemical structure substantially similar to that of a
controlled substance in Schedule I or II.&quot; During a Senate
hearing on the legislation by the Subcommittee on Children,
Family and Drugs and Alcoholism, July 25, 1985, both the DEA
Administrator and the Administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse
and Mental Health Administration, supported the bill. </p>

<p>Recommended Actions </p>

<p>(1) That DEA provide assistance to the States in acquiring
laboratory standards for use in identifying &quot;designer
drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>(2) That legislation be enacted requiring the reporting by
anyone authorized to sign a death certificate, to an appropriate
Federal authority (perhaps the Public Health Service) of deaths
caused wholly or in part from the ingestion of any substance. </p>

<p>(3) That legislation be enacted requiring the reporting to an
appropriate Federal authority (DEA) by all laboratories
performing drug analysis for law enforcement purposes: (a) the
total amount of each controlled substance as defined in the
Controlled Substances Act, received for analysis each calendar
year, and (b) immediate notice of the receipt of samples of any
substance suspected of being or found to be a &quot;designer
drug&quot; as defined in the proposed bill. </p>

<ol>
    <li>That DEA formulate model &quot;designer drug&quot;
        legislation for the States as has been done for other
        aspects of the drug abuse problem. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Part 1: Drug Policy and Organized Crime </h2>

<p>Drug Policy and Organized Crime </p>

<p>By Professor Mark H. Moore. Submitted: January 3, 1986. Dr.
Mark H. Moore is Daniel and Guggenheim Professor of Criminal
Justice Policy and Management at the John F. Kennedy School of
Government, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. He is
former Special Assistant to the Administrator of the Drug
Enforcement Administration. </p>

<p>Introduction: Drug Policy, Law Enforcement and Organized Crime
</p>

<p>Criminal laws prohibiting the production, distribution, and
possession of narcotics and dangerous drugs are the basis of drug
policy in the United States. These laws target the drugs that
have no recognized legitimate medical uses: heroin, cocaine,
marihuana, and hallucinogens. Enforcement efforts against these
drugs can be uncompromising, for there are no legitimate uses or
users to be protected. </p>

<p>Other drugs, however, pose similar threats to public health
and welfare, but they do have recognized legitimate uses. These
drugs include morphine, methadone, barbiturates, amphetamines,
and tranquilizers. With respect to these drugs the aim of the
legal regime and associated enforcement strategies is more
complex. It is not simply to eliminate the drugs but to preserve
a legitimate sector in which the benefits of these drugs may be
enjoyed, while minimizing illicit use. Towards this end the laws
license a limited number of people to produce, import, sell,
distribute and use them. To prevent the drugs from leaking from
and to illicit distributors and users, licensees have to secure
their inventories, and deal only with other licensees. To make
sure that the licensees meet these responsibilities, they must
keep records and make them available to investigators for
inspection. Failures to meet their responsibilities expose the
licensees to both civil and criminal penalties. To make sure that
no one can operate outside the boundaries of the legitimate
system, the unlicensed production, distribution or use of these
legitimate drugs is prohibited. </p>

<p>Drug Laws as a Comprehensive Drug Policy </p>

<p>It has become customary to think of the drug laws as operating
principally on the &quot;supply side&quot; of illegal drug
markets. For most practical purposes this is appropriate, for
these laws are the principal policy instruments directed at the
supply of illicit drugs. It is also generally true that the
principal targets of enforcement are suppliers rather than users.
However, these laws impose criminal liability on the illicit
possession and use of drugs, as well as to illicit production and
distribution. And indeed, each year more than 500,000 drug users
are arrested for possession. Therefore, criminal enforcement is
directed at the &quot;demand side&quot; of illicit drug use as
well as the &quot;supply side.&quot; To the extent that these
laws attack both the supply and the demand for illicit drugs,
they can be understood as a comprehensive drug policy, designed
to distinguish legitimate and useful drug use from illicit use
and to minimize illicit use in the society. </p>

<p>To produce this result, three different mechanisms are relied
on. One is the moral force of the law itself. To the extent that
individual citizens are guided in their decisions about drug use
by the explicit instruction provided by the law, or to the extent
that the existence of the law mobilizes widespread informal
interventions by parents, friends and relatives, the existence of
laws that define illicit use may succeed in reducing overall
levels of illicit use without any public enforcement activities. </p>

<p>A second, more widely understood mechanism is general
deterrence: the notion that citizens might be discouraged from
illicitly selling or using drugs by the fear that they will be
arrested and punished. This notion differs from the first in that
it depends on citizens' fears of punishment to motivate
compliance with the laws, rather than their desires to conform or
seek virtue. The more severe the penalties, and the higher the
probability of being caught, the more compliance will result. </p>

<p>A third mechanism is incapacitation: the notion that
imprisonment may physically prevent drug dealers and users from
continuing their activities. This concept differs from the second
in that it operates only on those dealers and users who are
caught, and only for as long as they remain under legal
supervision. If enough drug dealers and drug users are locked up,
then the problem of illicit drug dealing and drug use will
disappear. </p>

<p>Limitations of Drug Laws as a Drug Abuse Policy </p>

<p>To describe these mechanisms is to reveal the limitations of
the drug laws as a comprehensive drug abuse policy. The problem
is not that they are directed only at the &quot;supply side&quot;
of illegal drug abuse. Nor is it that they fail to produce
reductions in the level of illicit drug use. The problem is that
the drug laws are imperfectly effective. They leave behind a
residual market, composed of drug dealers and users, who failed
to get the message that they should abandon their drug
activities. Moreover, while the levels of drug distribution and
use that remain are undoubtedly lower than they would be in a
world of legalized drugs, the character of the market on both the
supply and the demand side are fundamentally altered and
generally worsened as a result of their illegality. </p>

<p>On the demand side the users who are not dissuaded from using
drugs discover that they confront high prices and low quality in
the drugs they buy. In addition, they are exposed to social
stigmatization and criminal prosecution. These circumstances
produce disastrous results for their economic status, physical
health, and social well-being. Of course, to the extent that
these consequences are unpleasant to the users, they provide a
continuing incentive for users to abandon their drug use. And, to
the extent that the users do so, an important social objective is
achieved. But to the extent they do not respond, their lives are
made miserable with little corresponding social benefit. The
society is left with drug users who are more dependent, dangerous
and unhealthy than they would otherwise be. </p>

<p>On the supply side the residual capacity takes the form of an
illicit industry. Some of that industry operates outside the
boundaries of the United States, and therefore to some degree
beyond the reach of its law. Another portion operates under the
cover of predominantly legal drug production and distribution -
within reach of the law, but a morally and legally ambiguous
target. The vast majority of the illicit industry, however,
consists of wholly illicit traffickers in the United States. </p>

<p>The Illicit Drug Industry: A Problem for Drug and Organized
Crime Policy </p>

<p>The existence of this illicit industry creates two different
kinds of problems. Viewed from the vantage point of drug abuse
policy, the principal problem created by the illicit industry is
that it continues to supply drugs to illicit markets. To the
extent that this continues, old drug users nay continue their
harmful activities, and new users may be recruited into dangerous
patterns of drug use. Thus, to achieve the objectives of drug
policy, the society must find ways to constrict the supply
capacities of the illicit industry. </p>

<p>Viewed from the vantage point of those concerned with the
control of organized crime, the existence of the illicit industry
creates a different kind of problem. To a degree, the illicit
drug industry engages in the sort of activities that make
organized crime a specially important social problem. Not only do
the illegal dealers frustrate the aims of drug policy by
continuing to supply drugs, but they grow rich in the process and
taunt the society with their financial success. Moreover, the
industry seems to spawn violence. Sometimes the violence spills
out into the general population. But even when the violence
remains confined to participants in the industry, its sheer
viciousness creates a general sense of lawlessness and brutality
that is threatening to the community. The illicit dealers also
seem to become heavily involved in corrupting government
agencies. Such activities undermine community security, and the
integrity of its basic institutions. Finally, the illicit drug
industry may gives birth to unusually large and powerful criminal
organizations, or nourish those that already exist. From the
vantage point of organized crime policy, then, the drug laws
create a major problem to be solved. </p>

<p>Drug Policy as a Portfolio of Policy Instruments </p>

<p>To deal with these side effects and residual problems, the
drug laws must be complemented by other policy instruments. To
deal with the limitations of drug laws in suppressing the demand
for drugs, a comprehensive drug policy necessarily includes drug
treatment and preventive education programs. Treatment programs
must be provided to help users make the transition to non-use and
to save lives that would otherwise be lost. Preventive education
programs must be operated to give more detailed explanations to
individuals of why illicit drug use is undesirable. Indeed, given
the focus of drug enforcement on the supply side of the market
and the obvious limitations of the drug laws in discouraging use
among those who are already dependent, it is generally
appropriate to think of drug treatment and education programs as
the principal instruments focused on the &quot;demand side&quot;
of the illicit drug markets. </p>

<p>To deal with the limitations of the laws in suppressing the
supply of illicit drugs and preventing the appearance of
organized criminal activity, traditional enforcement methods must
be supplemented by some special policy instruments. Diplomacy and
foreign aid must be joined to enforcement and regulation to reach
the pieces of the illicit supply system that operate outside the
United States. An effective regulatory enforcement system must be
created to prevent the diversion of narcotics and dangerous drugs
from legitimate to illicit markets in the United States. And
perhaps some special enforcement strategies that are effective in
constricting the capacity of the supply system to move drugs to
illicit markets or in dispersing well organized drug traffickers
must be designed and used. </p>

<p>The Objectives of the Paper </p>

<p>The purpose of this paper is not to design an effective
overall drug policy. Nor is it to consider the wisdom of relying
on criminal laws against drug distribution and use to the degree
we do now. My opinion is that our current drug policy is a wise
one, and that the balance of risks favors the continuation of
criminal laws directed against the distribution and use of
narcotics and dangerous drugs. </p>

<p>The aim of this paper is to take the existence of the current
drug laws and policies as a starting point and to design a
strategy to reduce supply consistent with the aims of our current
drugs abuse policy. In designing such a policy, special attention
will be given to the relationship between the strategy to reduce
supply that is necessary to achieve the goals of our current drug
abuse policy and organized crime policy. </p>

<p>As we have seen, there is some tension between these policies.
Making drug distribution illegal establishes fertile soil from
which existing organized crime groups might take sustenance or
new groups might arise. Thus, the continuing prohibitions of drug
distribution may exacerbate the organized crime problem. On the
other hand, to the extent that organized crime groups are now
active in producing or distributing drugs, and to the extent that
our organized crime policy makes available resources and
techniques that are effective in immobilizing such groups,
organized crime policy may make an important contribution to drug
policy. </p>

<p>In balancing these concerns the dominant emphasis will be
given to designing a supply reduction strategy that can achieve
the purpose of drug abuse policy. This perspective will be
adopted not because it is obvious that an effective drug control
policy is more important than an effective organized crime
policy, but simply because, if it were true that it was more
important to combat organized crime than to keep drugs from
illicit users, the simple solution would be to legalize the drugs
so that no illegal firms could arise. Since the society does not
choose this option, it must be that we are willing to pay a price
in terms of the objectives of organized crime policy to achieve
the objectives of drug control policy. The only interesting
questions, then, are how to minimize that price, and how best to
deploy the special resources and capabilities or organized crime
control policies to further the objectives of drug policy. That
is what we will try to discover. </p>

<p>The Analytic Framework </p>

<p>As we have seen, the character of the illicit drug industry is
important to the ultimate success of both drug abuse policy, and
organized crime control policy. To define objectives, set
reasonable expectations for success, and guide strategic choices
in targeting supply reduction efforts, an analysis of the illicit
drug industry is essential. </p>

<p>The Crucial Distinction Between the &quot;Industry&quot; and
the &quot;Firms&quot; </p>

<p>In carrying out this analysis, it is important to distinguish
the concept of the industry from the concept of individual firms
within the industry. The industry includes everyone who is
engaged in producing, importing, or distributing narcotics and
dangerous drugs to illicit markets in the United States. A firm
within that industry is nothing more than a collection of assets
whose specific uses are determined by the authoritative decisions
of an identifiable organizational unit. </p>

<p>Obviously, the firms that make up the industry could take a
variety of forms. They could represent different production
capacities, such as a boat, a person who knows the chemistry to
produce psychoactive drugs, or $50,000 in cash. They could be
involved in all aspects of the deal from financing through
production, transportation, and distribution, or they could
specialize in only one of these functions. For any given function
the firm may be more or less dominant in more or less local
geographic markets. They could consist of a single entrepreneur
linked to others only through the fragile ties of economic
interest, or they could include many people linked to one another
by family or cultural ties. They could be relative newcomers or
have a long history in the industry. They could enter the
industry with hopes for a single, big score, or they could plan
to become or remain a permanent fixture. </p>

<p>Often, the distinction between the industry and the firms that
comprise it is blurred, and the industry is viewed as a single
firm. This casual assumption is justified on one of two different
grounds. One is that the observed performance of the illicit
market is so impressive in terms of its operations and
adaptability that it is hard to believe that it is not guided by
a single intelligence. Nothing short of a single coherent
enterprise could accomplish the enormously complicated tasks of
collecting raw materials, processing then, and transporting the
finished product through the mine fields created by enforcement
agencies. Nor could anything other than an enterprise guided by a
single intelligence adapt successfully to the frequent changes in
supply reduction strategies. </p>

<p>The problem with this argument is that legitimate industries
accomplish similar feats of production, distribution and
adaptation all the time without a single intelligence guiding
them. The reason legitimate industries are successful is that
there are many guiding intelligences, but none predominant. The
aggregate result of the individual choices made by individual
economic actors may look organized in the sense that the industry
gradually moves from places where enforcement has become heavy to
areas where it is weaker, or it shifts from one drug to another
depending on consumer demand. But this orderly response need not
be the result of a wise choice by a single, powerful firm. It
could be the natural result of the firms in the heavily enforced
areas being wiped out, and the firms in the less heavily enforced
areas growing to meet the demand. In short, the adaptations are
made at the expense of individual firms, not under their control
- nor, necessarily, to their advantage. </p>

<p>The second line of argument supporting the notion that the
industry should be viewed as a single firm is somewhat more
sophisticated. It is based on the hypothesis that some illicit
firms will develop crucial specialized capabilities, and that
these will give the firm important advantages in producing and
distributing illegal drugs, or effective control over others who
do. These special capabilities could be access to capital,
connections with foreign sources of raw materials, knowledge of
how to produce the drugs, a special tie to corrupt officials, or
a general capacity for disciplined violence that could be brought
to bear on anyone who produced or distributed drugs without their
permission. This argument depends essentially on the idea that
there are some natural economies of scale in the illicit
industry, and that these will tend to produce a concentrated
industry. This is a more powerful kind of argument than the
first, but it is only an assertion. It needs to be examined with
both logic and evidence. </p>

<p>The Analysis of Industrial Organization </p>

<p>The form of analysis that is appropriate is an analysis of
industrial organization. An analysis of this kind rigorously
maintains the distinction between the industry and the firms that
comprise it. Indeed, the principal objective of an analysis of
industrial organization is to understand the relationships among
the structure of the industry, the conduct of the firms within
the industry, and the long run performance of the industry. </p>

<p>The Definition of Industry Structure. The concept of industry
&quot;structure&quot; explicitly captures the distinction between
the industry and the firms that comprise it. It focuses attention
on how the activities of the overall industry are divided among
different organizational units called Firms. One key concern in
examining structure is the degree of concentration in the
industry. The fewer the firms, the more concentrated the
industry. A second is the extent of horizontal and vertical
integration. Integration refers to the proportion of activities
essential to creating a product and delivering it to a market
that are contained within a single firm. Vertical integration is
measured by the extent to which a firm includes all the steps
from extraction of raw materials to final sales to ordinary
consumers. Horizontal integration is measured by the proportion
of a given step in the production and distribution of a product
that is controlled by a single firm. </p>

<p>The Definition of Industry Conduct. &quot;Conduct&quot; refers
to the distinctive ways that the firms within the industry go
about their business. Specific questions might focus on the
production technologies now commonly utilized, major factors
influencing costs within the industry, levels of investment in
research and development, the rate at which new products are
introduced, or the geographic organization of the industry's
markets. Conduct might also be concerned with institutional
relationships in the industry; e.g., the competitive strategies
being pursued by firms within the industry, the relationships
with governmental regulators, and even patters of collective
bargaining and labor relations. </p>

<p>The Definition of Industry Performance.
&quot;Performance&quot; focuses on the question of how successful
the industry is over the long run in delivering a product at low
cost, expanding the market, and adapting to changing
circumstances. Performance is ultimately what an industry analyst
is trying to understand. Indeed, the observations about structure
and conduct are made principally to explain and predict
performance. The more decentralized and competitive the industry,
and the lower the costs of bringing new products or new
production technologies on line, the more adaptable and dynamic
the industry. The larger the economies of scale in operating,
marketing, or bringing new products or production technologies on
line, the more concentrated the industry is likely to be. The
more concentrated the industry, the higher the prices and the
slower the rate of innovation. Propositions such as these link
observations of structure and conduct to explanations and
predictions of performance. </p>

<p>Objectives in Attacking the Illicit Drug Industry </p>

<p>To a great extent this framework of analysis can be carried
over and used in examining the character of the illicit drug
industry. But some crucial differences are worth noting. By far
the most important is that the implicit evaluative perspective
reverses when we are analyzing illicit industries. </p>

<p>An Evaluative Perspective. In standard industry analyses one
generally hopes for high performance from the industry. The more
successful it is in delivering products at low prices, expanding
its market to new areas, adapting to changing economic
circumstances, and maintaining high rates of innovation, the
better the result for the society. </p>

<p>In the case of the illicit drug industry, of course, the
society's hopes run in the opposite direction. High performance
from the illicit drug industry means that it adapts well to
government efforts to eliminate it and continues to supply drugs
at low cost to illicit markets. Over the long run, this means
higher levels of illicit drug use. In analyzing the illicit drug
market, then, what one hopes for is a failing industry: one that
cannot overcome the hurdles set by the government in trying to
get its products to market. These hopes are generally frustrated
by the sheer inventiveness and adaptability of illicit
entrepreneurs in pursuit of money. Nonetheless, one keeps hoping
that this industry will stumble rather than flourish. Indeed,
making it fail is an explicit purpose of public policy. </p>

<p>A second important difference is that in the analysis of the
illegal drug industry, the structure and conduct of the industry
have an elevated importance. As noted above, in traditional
analyses of industrial organization, structure and conduct have
importance primarily as factors that influence the performance of
the industry. In the analysis of the illegal drug industry, they
retain that importance: to the extent that structure and conduct
enhance or hinder the industry's long-run performance in
delivering drugs to illicit markets at low prices, they are a
source of interest, and a possible target of enforcement actions.
</p>

<p>What increases the importance of structure and conduct in the
analysis of illegal drug markets, however, is that they are
valued by the society independently of their impact on the
performance of the industry. Crucial questions about the conduct
of the firms within the illegal drug industry include the extent
to which they rely on violence to maintain internal discipline or
eliminate competition, and the extent to which they rely on
corruption to ward off the threat of enforcement. To the extent
that they do rely on violence and corruption as essential
elements of their business, their conduct has importance to the
society quite apart from how these practices affect their ability
to supply drugs. </p>

<p>Similarly, the society seems to be deeply concerned about the
structure of the illicit drug industry. Specifically, the society
seems to regard the problem as worse if the industry is highly
concentrated and composed of a few large, durable firms than if
it were less concentrated and populated by smaller and more
transient firms. No doubt, this view derives primarily from a
dominant concern about the performance of the industry, and an
assumption that an illicit industry, composed of a few large and
durable firms, would be more effective over the long run in
supplying drugs at low cost to consumers. It is important to keep
in mind, however, that a highly concentrated industry might
perform less well over the long run in delivering drugs to
illicit markets than a more atomistic market. Economic theory
tells us that prices would be higher in a concentrated market,
and it is quite possible that innovativeness and adaptability to
attacks would be less. The firms might represent more formidable
enforcement targets, but the result of dismantling them might be
larger and more durable than would be true in an atomistic
market. </p>

<p>Even if this were true, however, it seems likely that the
society would still regard an illicit industry, composed of a few
large, durable firms, as worse than one composed of many small
transient firms. The reason is that large, durable firms
constitute a social problem independent of their ability to
supply drugs. Large, durable criminal organizations can bring
much more powerful pressures to bear on their employees,
competitors, the government officials who are pledged to attack
them, and even the communities in which they operate than could
smaller or more transient firms. It is partly that the large,
durable firms become very wealthy; partly that they can maintain
truly frightening capacities for disciplined violence; but
perhaps most fundamentally that they will be around for a long
time and therefore able to reward cooperation and punish
opposition that makes them so powerful. </p>

<p>Thus, the concepts of structure, conduct and performance help
to clarify the society's objectives in dealing with the illicit
drug industry. The concerns of drug abuse policy are captured
principally by questions about the performance of the industry,
since it is the long run performance of the industry that will
decisively shape overall levels of drug abuse. The concerns of
organized crime policy are captured principally by questions
about conduct and structure. The concept of conduct captures the
concern about levels of violence and corruption associated with
an illegal industry. The concept of structure captures the
special concerns that are raised for organized crime policy by
the existence of very large, durable organizations, whose wealth,
disciplined use of violence, and long memories make them
especially powerful. A successful supply reduction strategy,
then, would leave an illicit drug industry, which is high cost,
ineffective in supplying drugs to illicit markets, not very
adaptable, reluctant to rely on bribery and violence, and
composed of small, transient firms. </p>

<p>Competition among Objectives. We are accustomed to thinking
that any supply reduction strategy will move us towards improved
performance on all of these objectives, and therefore there are
no trade-offs between the objectives of drug abuse policy and
organized crime control policy. We have already seen that there
is a certain tension between the aims of these two different
policies insofar as the criminal laws against drug distribution
and use create the basic conditions under which an illicit
industry night arise. But now it is possible to see a new tension
as well, one that is not only between drug abuse policy and
organized crime control objectives, but also between different
objectives of organized crime control policy. </p>

<p>Ironically, a supply reduction strategy that increased the
degree of concentration in the illicit industry might achieve
some important objectives of a supply reduction strategy.
Economic theory predicts, for example, that the actual supply of
drugs will be less in a concentrated industry than in a more
decentralized competitive industry. It is also likely that the
violence would be less, or at least more disciplined and focused
on those who were actually involved in the industry in a tightly
organized, concentrated industry. Thus, a supply reduction
strategy might succeed in reducing the overall performance of the
industry and even changing its conduct to reliance on threats and
bribery rather than overt violence, but do so only at the price
of increasing the size, power, and durability of criminal
organizations. Whether this would be preferred to a strategy that
reduced the concentration in the industry, but enhanced its
performance and shifted its conduct to more random patterns of
violence depends on how the society values these competing
objectives, and how much improved performance and violence it
would have to accept as the price of reduced concentration. That
would be a difficult choice. </p>

<p>The Definition of Improvements. At any rate, the directions in
which improvement lie, are clear, and so are the objectives of a
supply reduction strategy. The first and most important objective
is to frustrate the performance of the illicit industry - to
constrict its capacity to supply drugs to illicit markets. The
second is to shape the conduct of the residual industry so that
it is less violent and less corrupting. The third is to disperse
the industry so that the firms that comprise it are small and
transient rather than large and durable. How are one can go in
achieving these objectives, and how sharp the trade-offs among
them can only be answered by a close look at the factors that
shape the structure, conduct and performance of the industry. </p>

<p>Major Factors Shaping the Industry </p>

<p>As in any industry performance is determined at least partly
by engineering or mechanical factors: e.g., the physical
requirements of production and distribution. To get drugs to
illegal markets, firms must have access to raw materials, have
the knowledge and the equipment required to transform the raw
materials into finished products, be able to maintain and protect
inventories, and be able to transport finished products to
individual markets. </p>

<p>In addition, the performance of the industry will be shaped by
economic factors: i.e., the perceptions of opportunities and
risks. Those who make investments of the time and energy in
producing or diverting raw materials, in learning the techniques
and acquiring the equipment for producing illegal drugs, in
storing and transporting the drugs, and so on, must have some
assurance that they will make money from their investments. They
must have some capital to give them the time and the capacity to
arrange the deals that will ultimately produce satisfactory
returns. They must also have a certain tolerance for risk - not
only the risk that they might be imprisoned for their activities,
but also that they might take economic losses as a result of
successful enforcement actions against them, betrayals by their
associates, or more common economic disasters, such as
shipwrecks, plane crashes, spoiled production runs, or sudden
changes in exchange rates. Unless there is a reasonable chance in
their minds that they can make enough money from illicit drug
deals to compensate them for their time and their risks, the
deals will not be made. </p>

<p>A third factor influencing performance is the structure of
criminal liability that surrounds the industry, for it is the
laws and the way that they are enforced that determines many of
the opportunities and risks facing illicit drug dealers. A simple
way to think about how this factor operates is to think of the
criminal laws and the specific methods of enforcement as a kind
of tax confronting the illegal dealers. To maximize their return,
they seek to avoid as much of the tax as possible. They do this
by avoiding activities that are heavily taxed, by taking
advantage of loopholes in the tax laws or weakness in
enforcement, by concealing as much of their operation from the
tax collectors as possible, or by corrupting the tax collectors.
Such activities affect both the scale and the character of the
illicit industry. </p>

<p>The Apparent Influence of Geography </p>

<p>Geography looks like a factor that plays an important role in
determining the conduct and performance of the illicit industry.
Indeed, much of our thinking about supply reduction strategies is
guided by the notion that there are important &quot;source
countries&quot; that become the targets of diplomatic and
enforcement initiatives. Thus, for many years, Turkey and France
were regarded as the principal sources of heroin, although they
have now been replaced by Mexico and Southeast Asia. Similarly,
Colombia is now considered the principal source of cocaine, and
Jamaica a primary source of marijuana. </p>

<p>The reason that geography seems important is that different
countries represent different clusters of conditions that give
them a comparative advantage as a supplier of drugs to illicit
markets in the United States. Sometimes a country becomes an
important source country because of agricultural conditions that
make it an especially attractive (perhaps even unique) place in
which to produce raw materials. Thus, for a while, we imagine
that opium poppies could be successfully grown in only a few
countries in the world, and we now hope this is true of coca
leaves. In short, a country may become an importance source of
supply due to a physical advantage. </p>

<p>Other times it seems that a country has become a major source
as the result of a long tradition of producing the relevant raw
materials, or a large domestic industry that is based on them. In
effect, the country has a unique institutional and economic
advantage because it has a large infrastructure already invested
in the cultivation of the opium, coca leaves, or marijuana. </p>

<p>Still other times, it seems that the country's advantage comes
from week laws governing the legitimate or illicit drug
industries, or weak governmental commitment and capacity for
controlling the illicit drug industry. Just as Las Vegas can
become the center of gambling simply by establishing a legal
regime that tolerates it, Jamaica may become a principal source
of marijuana by being particularly lax with respect to the
suppression of illicit cultivation. </p>

<p>Thus, while geography looks like it plays an important
independent role in determining the character of the illicit drug
markets, this apparent influence actually derives from the more
basic causes already noted: the physical relations governing
production and distribution, the economic/ institutional
relations that give economic actors reasonable assurances that
investments in particular activities will be rewarded, and the
legal regime that has an independent effect on the risks and
opportunities confronting illicit dealers. Thus, geography may
drop out of any close analysis of the factors shaping the
performance of the illicit supply system, and be replaced by a
separate consideration of how certain countries seem to represent
unusually favorably combinations of the underlying causal
factors, and which ones seem particularly important. </p>

<p>The Irrelevance of Physical Requirements </p>

<p>While it is tempting to search for the explanation of the
structure, conduct and performance of the illicit industry in the
physical mechanics of producing and distributing drugs, there is
very little in these relationships that is unusual, or that could
constrain or shape the performance of the industry. Many of the
raw materials necessary to produce narcotics and dangerous drugs
are widely available. This is true primarily because they have
many legitimate uses, but also simply because they can be grown
or artificially produced in many different locations. Of course,
and occasional local shortage in basic raw materials may sometime
appear. But, given the alternative sources of supply, it is hard
to imagine that the shortage would last. Indeed, it is hard to
imagine long run shortages in the availability of opium poppies,
marijuana, coca leaves, or even chemicals used to produced
synthetic opiates, hallucinogens, and other psychoactive drugs. </p>

<p>It is equally difficult to imagine that either the knowledge
or the equipment necessary for manufacturing illicit drugs could
be in long run short supply. The chemical structure of the
illicit drugs are well known. Indeed, they are so well known that
illicit labs are now experimenting with small manipulations of
the chemical structure of existing drugs to determine if the
newly created drugs will produce similar or superior psychoactive
effects. These so-called &quot;designer drugs&quot; challenge the
legal regime regulating drugs because they may be legal to
produce and distribute until enough experience has accumulated to
declare them a significant abuse threat. </p>

<p>The equipment required for the production of the drugs is also
commonplace. Indeed, heroin &quot;labs&quot; in Mexico often
consisted of little more than wash-tubs and rubber hoses. And the
drugs can be made in many different quantities with few
implications for the costs of production. So, there seems to be
little in the technology of production that would have a decisive
impact on the structure, conduct or performance of the industry. </p>

<p>The Impact of Illicitness on Industry Conduct </p>

<p>My strong conviction is that the dominant factor shaping the
illicit drug industry is the simple fact that it is illicit. This
fact has broad and significant implications for its structure,
conduct and performance. The immediate consequences of
illicitness register in the conduct of the illicit firms, but the
changes in conduct have important implications for structure and
performance. </p>

<p>The Risk of Arrest. The most obvious consequence of
illicitness is that those who produce, import, distribute or use
drugs illegally are exposed to the threat of arrest, prosecution
and imprisonment. Moreover, in some countries, they are
threatened by the seizure of any property or assets used in their
illegal drug dealing - a threat whose significance may dwarf not
only any fine they may receive, but also some jail terms. </p>

<p>The obvious effect of threatening illicit producers,
distributors and users with jail is that the dealers who remain
in the business will take steps to reduce their risks, or to
compensate themselves for the risks of being is the business. The
principal devices for reducing risks are to keep operations
secret so that enforcement agencies cannot discover them, or to
corrupt the agencies so that even if their operations are
discovered, they are not punished. The principal devices used to
keep their operations secret are to deal with a small number of
people, to conceal the traces of their activities, and to screen
and discipline their employees, associates and customers to make
sure they are not undercover agents, and do not become police
informants. The principal ways of corrupting enforcement agencies
are to offer money to be allowed to continue to operate, and to
inform on their competitors and associates so that the police can
make arrests without harming their operations. </p>

<p>Such efforts can only be partially effective in eliminating
the risk of punishment. To deal in large quantities of drugs and
make money from the enterprise, one must inevitably deal with a
large number of people, only some of whom are trusted and
effectively disciplined. Thus, the risk of informants and
undercover agents among one's employees, associates or customers
is always present. Similarly, drug dealing always involves
leaving traces of one's activities that cannot be entirely
concealed: physical inventories of raw materials or drugs,
records of financial transactions, even records of phone calls
among the conspirators. These, too, are vulnerable to discovery
by enforcement agencies. Also, there are so many agencies and
agents involved in drug enforcement activities that one can never
be sure whether all those who pose a threat have been corrupted.
Since the risk can never be quite eliminated, the dealer's
response is to demand additional compensation for the risks in
trafficking drugs. He demands higher prices for drugs than he
would if there was no risk of going to jail. </p>

<p>The Risk of Rip-Offs. A less obvious but by no means less
important consequences of the illicit status of drug production,
importation and distribution is that illegal dealers are
confronted by threats from other criminals as well as by
enforcement agencies. Indeed, associates, competitors and
ordinary armed robbers probably create greater risks for illicit
drug dealers than enforcement agencies. Partly this is because
dealers are very tempting targets. They are likely to have large
amounts of cash, or large quantities of drugs that can be
converted to cash. Also, they are unlikely to turn to enforcement
agencies to help protect their operations. They have to supply
protection against armed attack or stealing. Those in the
criminal milieu may know more than enforcement agencies about who
is &quot;holding&quot; or currently doing business, and these
other criminals may be less constrained by the niceties of due
process than the enforcement agencies. Thus, other criminals may
be more strongly motivated and better positioned to attack
illegal drug dealers than the enforcement agencies, and therefore
pose a graver threat to the illicit dealers. </p>

<p>The implications of this fact are that the dealers must make
special provisions to protect themselves from this threat. To a
degree, the same methods of secrecy and discipline may be as
helpful against other crooks as against the police. But it seems
likely that the threat from other crooks is more apt to be met by
capacities for violence. In general, if an armed confrontation
between the dealers and enforcement agencies occurs, the dealers
know they will lose. They may win a local fire-fight, but there
is no way they can compete over the long run with enforcement
agencies in violent confrontations. Consequently, they rely most
heavily on secrecy and corruption to deal with the threat of
enforcement. </p>

<p>With other criminals, however, the balance of armed power is
less clear. Thus, it is tempting to build capacities for violence
to protect oneself and one's business from &quot;take-off&quot;
artists, and to establish credible threats effective against
betrayals by associates. This capacity for violence can also be
used externally to drive out competitors. But the vulnerability
to other criminals associated with illicitness provides the most
immediate and compelling justification for developing a capacity
for violence, as well as for secrecy and corruption. The
existence of these capacities for violence among dealers and
those who would steal from them produces the bulk of the violence
within the illegal drug industry. </p>

<p>Thus, the conduct of the firms within the illicit industry is
profoundly influenced by the fact of their illicitness. They are
forced to maintain secrecy, and to prevent the infiltration of
police agents. They must develop capacities to bribe, suborn, or
mislead government agents. Also they must develop capacities for
violence to enforce contracts with associates, protect their
property from armed robbers, and to discipline employees.
Finally, because the risks of arrest or rip-offs cannot ever
wholly be eliminated, they must price their products not only to
cover costs, but also to compensate themselves for the risk of
arrest or financial loss they are taking by engaging in such a
risky business. These effects on the conduct of firms have
implications for structure and performance. </p>

<p>The Impact of Illicitness on Structure </p>

<p>The consequences of illicit status for the structure of the
illicit industry are hard to estimate, for they will be
determined by a balance of conflicting influences. On one hand,
the desire to prevent the police and other criminals from
learning about their operation will motivate illicit
entrepreneurs to keep their small firms, transient, and neither
vertically nor horizontally integrated. </p>

<p>The Virtues of Small Firms and Decentralization. Smallness has
the virtues of involving only a small number of people and a
small number of transactions. This implies both that the
intrinsic vulnerability of the operations is less, and that the
contributions of any special efforts to discipline or secure the
operation will go further because there are fewer associates,
employees or transactions over which to spread these efforts. </p>

<p>Transience has similar advantages to smallness. If the
problems for illicit dealers is to avoid others knowing they are
in business, they can accomplish this by getting into the
business and out of it before anyone knows who they are. Indeed,
from the perspective of avoiding detection, the best operation is
one that is both small and transient. But that firm is not worth
disrupting, also, for it could never amount to much in terms of
its ability to supply drugs, its contribution to violence and
corruption, or to become a powerful institution to the community.
</p>

<p>Vertical and horizontal disintegration also have important
advantages in avoiding detection. A vertically integrated firm
would require some system of information-gathering and
record-keeping to exploit the advantages of explicit coordination
across the different phases of the operation. But these records
would become an important source of evidence against the dealers.
Similarly, almost by definition, vertically integrated firm would
be large and involve many transactions, and each element of the
firm would know what other elements were doing. Thus, a
vertically integrated firm would present more possible points of
penetration and would be much more vulnerable to any given
penetration, than a firm organized as a set of largely separate
cells that operated relatively autonomously. </p>

<p>Similarly, a horizontally integrated firm would also have to
be large and would have to be in contact with all firms engaged
in the activities at other stages of the production process.
Thus, a horizontally integrated firm in the business of
off-loading mother ships would come to know the principal
importing firms that arranged for the mother ships to appear off
the coast, and the principal firms engaged in storage and
distribution. This would make such a firm vulnerable to betrayal
by the others, compared with a firm that handled less of the
overall off-loading business. </p>

<p>Thus, to escape detection, firms in the illicit drug industry
would choose to be small, transient and disintegrated. This, in
turn, would lead to a highly fragmented - even atomistic -
structure in the industry. </p>

<p>The Virtues of Scale and Concentration. On the other hand, it
is possible there are some economies of scale in the production
and distribution of illicit drugs, or some opportunities for
controlling competition that would lead to relatively large,
durable firms, and a relatively high degree of concentration in
the industry. Ironically, the principal potential for economies
of scale do not seem to lie in the areas of production or
marketing. Instead they lie in the development of capacities for
corruption and violence that will give some firms special
opportunities to operate safely and efficiently in the dangerous
illicit markets. </p>

<p>The capacity for disciplined, irresistible violence may be a
particularly important factor of production in illicit supply
systems, and may be an area where there are natural economies of
scale. As we have seen, a capacity for violence is terribly
important in disciplining employees to keep then from becoming
informants. It is also important in being able to enforce
contracts with business associates and in protecting life and
property from other criminals in a world where one cannot rely on
the ordinary courts and police to perform this function.
Moreover, once developed for these purposes, the capacity for
violence can become important in eliminating competition, or
forcing it to be small and transient rather than large and
durable. For all these reasons, a firm had a substantial capacity
for violence would have an obvious competitive advantage in
supply drugs to illicit markets. </p>

<p>To argue that violent firms would have a competitive advantage
is not quite the same as saying that the obvious value of a
capacity for violence will tend to produce large, durable firms,
and a concentrated structure in the industry. That argument rests
on an additional assertion that there are economies of scale in
the development of this special capacity for violence. This
assertion, in turn, rests on the ideal that a useful capacity for
violence consists not in the production of actual violence, but
instead in a reputation for irresistible violence that can
overwhelm (in force, viciousness, sustainability or all three)
any degree of violence that another illegal entrepreneur can
imagine mounting. This is important, for it is quite obvious that
real violence can be produced quite easily and inexpensively.
What is valuable violence, however, is violence that need not be
used but will still intimidate and discourage others because it
is there to be used and cannot be successfully resisted. To have
this capacity, a firm must have available not only a large
quantity of violence and demonstrate its willingness to use it,
but also be a sufficiently permanent and relentless institution
so that the possibility of an opponent challenging it and
escaping without retaliation seems remote. </p>

<p>This capacity seems to have some natural monopolistic
features. One can easily imagine how a single organization could
gradually corner the market for irresistible violence and create
a fairly impregnable local monopoly. One can less easily but
still plausibly imagine a small number of firms with such
capabilities co-existing in an uneasy truce, and ignoring a
certain number of violations of their tacit understandings, as
well as a small amount of minor competition from transient
outsiders. What is hard to imagine as a stable equilibrium is a
world in which there are large numbers of closely matched firms
vying for the position of a recognized dominant capacity for
violence. In that world the factor of production that has value -
namely, a dominating capacity for violence that is sufficient to
discipline employees, enforce contracts, and protect reliably
against take-offs - is not available to any firm. Each firm is
therefore vulnerable to all threats that a solid reputation for
irresistible violence would guard against. </p>

<p>If the reputation for irresistible violence is valuable, it
takes substantial investment to build the capabilities, and if it
only has value when it is greater than any other competing
firm's, the importance of this factor of production will tend to
produce high degrees of concentration in the industry. This will
lead to the development of a few large, durable firms in any
local market. This is true at least in part because this
reputation for violence can substitute for a small scale in
preventing the detection of the operation. If employees,
associates, competitors and customers are all afraid to give
information about the operations of a firm to the police or other
criminals, then it can operate at any given scale with less risk
than another firm that is similar in all respects other than its
capacity and reputation for violence. </p>

<p>The capacity for corrupting government officials may also be
an important factor of production and distribution. This might
also be an important factor of production and distribution that
might also tend to create larger more durable firms and higher
degrees of concentration than one might hypothesize, if one were
thinking only of how the illicit firms might escape detection.
The easiest way to think about the problem of corruption is to
imagine that the various government officials and agencies,
responsible for enforcing laws against illegal production and
distribution, have a de facto power to grant a license to illegal
entrepreneurs to operate legally - or at least with no treat from
them. Obviously, the value of this license to the illicit dealers
depends on the extent to which a given official or agency
monopolizes the legal threat to them. If a given official or
agency is the only official threat against an illicit dealer, the
value of his protection will obviously be higher than if the
official threat against an illicit dealer, the value of his
protection will obviously be higher than if the official or agent
is only one of many potential threats against the dealer. </p>

<p>Thus, the question of whether corruption will tend to
concentrate in the industry depends crucially on the organization
of the enforcement agencies. If the enforcement agencies were
organized in a single agency, and if the hierarchical control
within the agencies was very powerful, and if the illicit firm
could corrupt that agency, it would be able to gain and hold a
monopoly in the area principally by using the enforcement agency
to help it eliminate competition, while keeping it safe. If, on
the other hand, the enforcement agencies had fragmented
jurisdictions, and quite imperfect control over their agents,
then they might be more vulnerable to some degree of corruption,
but the significance of the corruption would be much less.
Essentially, the enforcement agency could not sell an exclusive
right to operate safely. It could only sell little pieces of
insurance against threats from specific agents or agencies. Even
this would produce some higher degree of concentration in the
industry than if corruption were not part of the operating
strategies of the illicit firms, since it would establish some
barriers to entry and protect the position of some firms. But it
would by no means guarantee a monopoly. </p>

<p>The Net Result of Conflicting Pressures. Therefore, there are
pressures that push the drug industry towards small firms and an
atomistic structure, and others that are consistent with the
development of local monopolies and relatively concentrated
structures. My strong hunch is that the net result of this will
be to produce an illicit industry that includes a heterogeneous
distribution of firms. There will be a few firms that are in
strong position to exploit the economies of scale that come from
a reputation for trustworthiness, and for irresistible violence
in the case of betrayal. Such firms may come to account for a
relatively large fraction of the drugs reaching illicit markets,
but they will be a small fraction of the total number of firms
operating. This will be true partly because it is unlikely that
these firms will become either horizontally or vertically
integrated. The risks of long chains of command in the case of
vertical integration, or a wide network of contacts in the case
of horizontal integration are apt to be much greater than the
potential benefits. It is also true because these firms will not
be able to prevent (and will not find it worth preventing)
occasional competition from transient or small operations which
have their own sources of supply, and their own local markets.
Therefore, there will be a great many firms of different sizes in
the industry. </p>

<p>If one were thinking about analogies from legitimate
industries, my hunch is that the best analogy might be something
like the real estate industry, rather than the auto industry or
even the fast-food industry. Many developers put together large,
uncertain deals, rather than producing or distribution a product.
Moreover, the deals are likely to involve several different
partners, and the partnerships and roles may change from deal to
deal. Those in the industry who have a reputation for
trustworthiness, &quot;deep-pockets,&quot; strong political
connections, and effective lawyers are likely to account for a
large fraction of the total dollar value of the deals made. But
there will be a great many others in the industry who do smaller
deals. </p>

<p>The Impact of Illicitness on Performance </p>

<p>Because illicitness affects conduct and structure, it also has
an enormously importantly impact on industry performance. The
crucial result is that drug prices are much higher than they
otherwise would be. This is partly because the defensive
strategies mounted by dealers against enforcement agencies and
other criminals translate into higher operating costs per unit of
drug delivered, and partly because dealers demand additional
compensation for their risks. This is shown by the fact that the
price of drugs in illicit markets is higher than the price of
equivalent drugs in legal markets by factors of 20 or 30. </p>

<p>Almost as important is that the drugs are less conveniently
available than they otherwise would be. Dealers have an incentive
to conceal their activities rather than advertise then. Growth in
the market tends to happen within intimate networks of friends,
rather than through public advertising and widespread
availability. In all likelihood, these are slower and less
effective methods of market development than the same mechanisms
joined with a legitimate distribution system. </p>

<p>We can combine the effect on price and the effect on
availability in a single concept called the &quot;effective
price&quot; of drugs in illicit markets. That would include not
only the monetary cost, but also the amount of time a customer
would have to spend looking for the drug, and the chance that he
might fail to find the drug, or be cheated by an unscrupulous
dealer. In these terms, illicitness results in much higher
effective prices for illicit drugs than if they were legal. Note
that this is probably true even if publicly supported enforcement
activities were relatively ineffective. For, even if the threat
from the enforcement agencies were removed, the threat from other
criminals would remain, and that by itself would be enough by
itself to increase dramatically the effective prices of illicit
drugs. So illicitness has a profound impact on the performance of
the industry. </p>

<p>The fact that the price of drugs is increased by the illicit
status of the industry is evaluated in different ways from
different vantage points. Viewed from the perspective of drug
abuse policy, this is desireable because it will reduce overall
levels of drug use in the population by discouraging new users
from continuing their drug use, and motivating older users to
seek treatment and abandon their use. Viewed from the perspective
of organized crime policy, the increased prices mean a larger
flow of revenues to illicit dealers and criminal organizations.
This is damaging to the objectives of organized crime policy, for
it creates the impression that crime pays, and provides the
necessary financial means to enlarge illegal operations, or to
consolidate a position vis-a-vis other criminal organizations or
the enforcement agencies. Regardless of whether the economic
proceeds are used by illegal dealers for consumption or
investment, the higher revenues become a problem for organized
crime policy. </p>

<p>It is also possible that over the long run, the higher
revenues become a problem for drug abuse policy. This would be
true, for example, if the conspicuous consumption of wealthy drug
dealers attracted more people into the industry, or if the
investments made by more disciplined dealers allowed them not
only to dominate the supply system, but to increase its overall
capacity to supply drugs. In each case, the revenues from the
industry would be operating to increase the overall supply
capacity of the system, just as excess profits in a legitimate
industry would attract new investment into that industry. </p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind, however, that the reasons
that prices are high in the drug industry is precisely because
dealers are confronted by risks of violence and financial loss
from both the government and other criminals. This fact remains
true and continues to discourage many from entering the business.
Indeed, the greater the risks, the greater the profits must be to
attract any one into the business. That is the explicit purpose
of making the drug business illegal and attacking it
aggressively. As long as that threat remains substantial, the
overall supply capacity of the industry will be much smaller than
otherwise, even though people in the industry are making money.
People do not flock to the industry, even with high prices and
high revenues, because the risks are also high.<br>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Part 2: The Impact of the Legitimate Drug
System </h2>

<p>The last important factor shaping the structure, conduct and
performance of the illicit drug industry is the character of the
legitimate drug system that operates alongside it. The
significance of the legitimate drug system is most obvious for
drugs such as methadone, amphetamines and barbiturates, which
have important medical uses, and very large legitimate production
and distribution systems. Even those drugs that do not have
legitimate medical uses often have some contact with a legitimate
market system. Some illicit heroin, for example, comes from
legitimate opium crops grown to produce morphine. Hallucinogens
and methamphetamine are often manufactured from chemical
precursors that have significant legitimate uses. And even
marijuana has a legitimate sector composed of researchers who are
experimenting with its pharmacological characteristics and
potential medical applications for the control of glaucoma and
depression. </p>

<p>The existence of a legitimate sector in which raw materials,
precursors, or finished goods are produced, stored, distributed
and consumed has a potentially significant impact on the
character of the illicit industry. The reason is that diversion
from the legitimate market becomes an alternative to wholly
illicit production and distribution as a source of supply to
illicit markets. Exactly what influence will be exerted depends
on the size of the legitimate market, the strength of the
regulatory regime that surrounds it, and whether the legitimate
system includes the production and distribution of finished goods
or stops some place short of this goal. </p>

<p>For drugs which have a large, loosely regulated legitimate
supply system that includes the distribution of finished goods,
diversion from legitimate sources is likely to become the
dominant source of supply to illicit users. For drugs that have
only a small legitimate sector that is limited to raw materials
or precursors, the illicit supply will be dominated by wholly
illicit production and distribution. Thus, the illicit demand for
tranquilizers is likely to be supplied principally by diversion.
The illicit demand for hallucinogens and marijuana will be
principally supplied by wholly illicit production and
distribution. Also, the illicit demand for amphetamines and
opiate analgesics, such as heroin, morphine and methadone, will
be supplied partly by diverted legitimate drugs, and partly by
wholly illicit production and distribution. </p>

<p>The existence of a legitimate sector from which drugs may be
diverted to illegal use will generally improve the performance of
the illicit market in that drugs will be cheaper and more readily
available than they would be if no legitimate sector existed.
This is true simply because some portion of the activities
necessary to produce and distribute the drug will not be hampered
by the difficulties created by illicitness. Raw materials can be
acquired, transformed into finished products, stored, and
distributed with fewer worries about theft and betrayal by
associates, or disruption by enforcement officials. True,
operating costs will be increased by the requirements of the
regulatory regime. And true, also, someone must absorb the costs
and risks of diverting the drugs to illicit markets. But in all
likelihood, these costs will be much smaller than the costs
imposed on the firms, if they had to assume all of the burden of
protecting their property and enforcing contracts as they have to
in wholly illicit industry. To the extent that only a portion of
the supply system must pay these costs, operating costs and
therefore prices should be lower in illicit markets. </p>

<p>The existence of the legitimate industry should also make the
illicit markets much more flexible. If an illicit amphetamine
laboratory finds that it cannot obtain precursors from the
legitimate market, it can always go into the business of stealing
them from the legitimate sector. Once it has the capacity to
steal precursors, the illicit firm might find it easier to steal
finished products. In short, the existence of the legitimate
market allows illicit dealers the options of relying on theft or
fraud with or without the collusion of people within the
legitimate industry to meet market demands - options that would
not be available if there were no legitimate market. </p>

<p>The impact of the legitimate market on the structure of the
illicit industry is also quite important. The crucial variables
are the places where leaks occur in the process of production and
distribution and the size and regularity of leaked quantities. </p>

<p>Obviously, if only raw materials and precursors leak from the
legitimate system, the illicit system will have to develop
illicit production capabilities to transform the raw materials
into finished goods. This will exert a slight centralizing trend,
for the knowledge and the equipment necessary to produce the
drugs constitute a form of capital that must be amortized and
that means those who possess these will stay in business long
enough and produce enough drugs to achieve this goal. The
break-even point may not require a very large or very durable
firm. The point is that the diversion of raw materials will be
associated with larger more durable firms than the diversion of
finished goods. </p>

<p>When finished goods are stolen, the firm may have no capital
to amortize, and may stay in business only long enough to dispose
of an existing quantity. Of course, a large theft, such as a
truck hijacking, can make a firm look like a major trafficker. If
the firm arranges to continue hijacking drug shipments, it may
become a major drug dealer with an unusual source of supply. In
the more likely case, however, a large theft of legitimate drugs
will produce a large, but transient firm. It will go out of
business shortly. </p>

<p>The other possibilities are that small quantities of finished
goods are diverted either continuously or irregularly from the
legitimate supply system. This form of diversion will produce
small firms that are either durable or transient depending on how
frequently they go back to the well. </p>

<p>Thus, the supply of drugs that have legitimate uses to illicit
markets will be decisively influenced by the size and character
of the leaks from the legitimate system. The earlier in the
process of production and distribution the leaks occur, the
larger and more continuous they are, the more the illicit supply
system will be composed of large durable firms. The later in the
process of distribution, and the smaller and more erratic the
leaks, the more the industry will be atomized. Thus, one might
expect the illicit market in tranquilizers and methadone to be
composed primarily of small, transient firms fueled by small
scale thefts. The illicit markets in amphetamines and
hallucinogens are likely to somewhat more concentrated with more
of the illicit supply in the hands of larger, more of the illicit
supply in the hands of larger, more durable firms. </p>

<p>Different Drugs, Different Industries </p>

<p>So far, our analysis of the illicit drug industry has
abstracted from the particular features of the principal drugs of
abuse in the United States. We have treated heroin, cocaine,
marijuana, hallucinogens, amphetamines, barbiturates and
tranquilizers in a similar analytic framework. But to analyze the
supply systems for these drugs from the same analytic perspective
is not the same as assuming that the supply systems will be
similar. It is only to assume that they will be pushed in similar
directions by the factors we have considered. Exactly how far
they will be pushed in one direction or another strongly depends
on all the factors we have considered, including how zealously
the illegal supply systems are controlled by regulatory and
criminal enforcement. </p>

<p>Heroin </p>

<p>Heroin, for example, seems to be primarily a problem of wholly
illicit production and distribution. The fields in which the
opium poppies are grown are generally illicit fields in countries
that cannot adequately enforce existing laws prohibiting the
cultivation of opium. Similarly, the processing of the raw opium
into heroin occurs principally in foreign countries - probably to
reduce the bulk of the material to facilitate international
smuggling. Because the volume of heroin is so small, it comes
into the United States through many different devices - in the
carry-on luggage of pilots, hidden in small cans of tomatoes and
olive oil, concealed in secret compartments built into cars, and
so on. In the United States the distribution systems seem
moderately tightly concentrated with significant local
monopolies, but little vertical integration. There is probably
some degree of horizontal integration at the importing stage, and
it is at this stage that the concentration of the distribution
system is probably the greatest. Perhaps the few largest firms in
any given city control more than two-thirds of the total volume
of heroin in the city, with some cities in the U.S. serving as
transshipment points for other cities. This relatively tight and
concentrated structure is the result of the fact that the
enforcement pressures are probably still the heaviest against
heroin dealers. </p>

<p>Cocaine </p>

<p>The cocaine supply system seems quite similar to the one for
heroin. It is principally a problem of wholly illicit production
and distribution. The sources of raw materials and finished
products are primarily foreign. The physical volumes to be
handled are small enough to make concealment of the drugs a
relatively trivial matter and to allow smugglers to use a variety
of different methods for bringing the drugs into the country. The
average size of the deals measured in terms of financial
requirements seem to be approximately the same as those that
occur in the heroin market. </p>

<p>The major difference between the heroin and the cocaine supply
systems seems to be that the cocaine system is less concentrated,
and more violent than the heroin market. There seem to be many
more entrepreneurs who enter the cocaine business on a short term
basis. Moreover, none of the groups operating on a more permanent
basis seems to have established predominance in the industry.
Thus, it is not surprising that this market is more violent than
the heroin market, for there are cash, drugs and market position
up for grabs in a way unlike the heroin market. </p>

<p>Marijuana </p>

<p>Marijuana is similar to heroin and cocaine in that it is a
wholly illicit system with predominantly foreign sources of raw
materials. Three principal differences seem to make the marijuana
supply system quite different, however. One crucial difference is
that the bulk of marijuana per dollar of value is so much greater
than that of heroin and cocaine that the smuggling problem is
enormously exacerbated. A hundred thousand dollars of heroin or
cocaine can easily be held in a suitcase, but to carry a hundred
thousand dollars worth of marijuana, one needs a small truck,
boat or plane. Because marijuana is so much more visible than
heroin or cocaine, the primary mode of smuggling is in large
loads landed between ports of entry rather than infiltrated
through ports of entry in the huge volume of cargo and people
that daily cross the U.S. borders. This also implies that many
specialized firms might grow up to cope with the special problems
of smuggling marijuana. </p>

<p>A second difference between heroin and cocaine on the one hand
and marijuana on the other is that the pressures in the illicit
industry seem less. It is not that marijuana dealers do not face
substantial financial risks. Indeed, it seems that quite the
opposite is true. The best current estimates indicate that
marijuana dealers lose from a quarter to a third of their
shipments to enforcement agencies. Instead it seems that the
losses are primarily financial, and primarily inflicted by the
government. Other criminals do not seem to prey on marijuana
traffickers in the same way that they attack heroin and cocaine
dealers. Moreover, even if the government seizes property and
arrests the dealers, the prison terms meted out to marijuana
traffickers seem less severe than for those who traffick in other
drugs. Since the marijuana dealers face smaller and less drastic
threats from both the government and other criminals, the
marijuana market seems less preoccupied by the problems of
secrecy, discipline and security than the heroin and cocaine
markets. The net result of this is an industry that is probably
less concentrated then either the heroin and cocaine market, and
almost certainly less violent. </p>

<p>The third important difference shaping the marijuana industry
is the existence of small scale domestic production and
distribution as well as foreign. Indeed, the potential for small
scale domestic cultivation of marijuana makes the marijuana
market more like the market for barbiturates and tranquilizers
than for heroin, because some portion of the overall illicit
demand will be met by those who grow their own. It is this fact
that guarantees the overall industry cannot become very
concentrated, just as it is the widespread availability of
barbiturates and tranquilizers through small scale diversion from
legitimate sources that prevents a concentrated illicit industry
in these drugs from developing. </p>

<p>Hallucinogens, Barbiturates and Amphetamines </p>

<p>The supply system for hallucinogens seems to be primarily
domestic illicit production, although it is possible that some
drugs come from Mexico or Canada. There is a degree of
concentration in this industry as a result of specialized
knowledge, and the creation of brand names to which consumers
become loyal. It seems to operate with relatively little reliance
on either violence or bribery, probably because the industry is
sufficiently small to not be worth the time of enforcement
officials or other criminals. </p>

<p>The industry that supplies barbiturates to illicit markets
seems to depend primarily on diversion from the legitimate
market. Thus, its structure mirrors the character of the leaks
from the legitimate system. This seems to produce a highly
atomistic market composed of small or transient firms. Again,
there is little reliance on either violence or corruption because
the economic stakes seem too small to warrant such risky conduct.
</p>

<p>The amphetamine industry seems to be a combination of the
supply system for hallucinogens and barbiturates. There seems to
be small scale illicit production and distribution that is
primarily domestic, but also from our near neighbors. There is
also diversion from the large legitimate supply system. The net
result is an industry that is high in performing, relative
atomistic in structure, and relies little on either violence or
corruption. </p>

<p>Designing a Strategy to Attack the Illegal Drug Industry </p>

<p>From the perspective of drug abuse policy the primary
objective of a strategy to attack the illegal drug industry is to
increase the effective prices of drugs in illicit markets. Given
our analysis of the factors shaping the structure, conduct and
performance of the industry, it is reasonable to suppose that
making the production and distribution of drugs illegal will tend
to make drugs more expensive and less available than they would
be if they were legal. The important policy question is how the
resources of the government - its diplomatic initiatives, its
interdiction efforts, and its criminal investigations - might be
deployed to maximize the impact of supply reduction efforts on
the effective prices of illicit drugs. </p>

<p>Priorities in Attacking the Illegal Drug Industries </p>

<p>One way to establish priorities is to determine which
particular drugs seem to be causing the greatest social problems,
and which present opportunities that would give supply reduction
efforts relatively powerful leverage. The worse the drug, and the
more powerful the leverage that can be exerted, the higher the
priority. </p>

<p>Of course, the question of which drugs pose the greatest
threat to the society is much debated. One way to resolve the
issue is to gauge the number of chronic users of each drug, and
to weight that number by the seriousness of the health, economic
and social problems that the chronic users of each drug suffer.
By this reckoning, heroin, amphetamines and barbiturates tend to
come out on top as the worst drugs. </p>

<p>A second standard would be to consider which drugs are most
widely used, and therefore operate as the principal transmitter
of an illicit drug culture and the most common introduction to
drug use for young children. By this standard, marijuana and
tranquilizers would probably come out on top. </p>

<p>A third standard would be to determine which drugs seem to be
associated with the most money, violence and corruption, and
attack that drug as the principal threat to the society. This
last standard would probably make cocaine and heroin the dominant
targets of drug policy. </p>

<p>In thinking about which of these standards night be
appropriate to use in deciding which drugs caused the greatest
social problems, it is worth trying to keep the separate
objectives of drug abuse policy and organized crime policy in
mind. The principal objective of drug use abuse policy is to
minimize the social problems associated with drug use. A key
instrument of that policy are criminal laws controlling the
supply of drugs. These policies succeed when there are few people
using drugs in patterns that create grave threats to their health
and economic welfare. In effect, we use criminal laws and
criminal enforcement to achieve a social welfare objective. </p>

<p>The principal objectives of organized crime policy are to
suppress the provision of illegal goods and services that
constitute the core of organized crime, to prevent the violence
and corruption that is more characteristic of organized crime
groups than other kinds of criminal activity, and to prevent the
emergence of very large, durable organizations with well
developed capacities for violence and corruption. </p>

<p>There is a substantial overlap in the goals of organized crime
policy and supply reduction efforts insofar as organized crime
policy takes the control of the supply of drugs as an important
objective, and insofar as the illicit supply systems included
violence, corruption and large firms. But to the extent that the
core of organized crime policy is really concerned with the
disruption of major criminal organizations, there is an overlap
between the core of drug abuse policy and organized crime policy
only insofar as the drugs are supplied by rich, violent and
powerful criminal organizations. As we have seen, that is true of
only a certain number of drugs, and not necessarily the drugs
that pose the greatest threats in terms of widespread and
dangerous consumption. </p>

<p>In fact, the third standard described above is closer to a
description of the core objectives of organized crime policy than
to the core objectives of drug abuse policy. In essence, the
society has to decide whether it means to go after the drugs that
cause it the most problem in illicit use, or whether it should
attack the drugs that are supplied by the nastiest and toughest
dealers. These are not necessarily the same. </p>

<p>The Instruments of a Strategy Against Illicit Drug Industries </p>

<p>Once the society has implicitly or explicitly established its
objectives, it must then look to the available instruments of a
supply reduction strategy. Again, there are many different ways
one can think about the available instruments. </p>

<p>Attacking Different Drugs. One way is to think about them in
terms of the particular drugs they attack. Thus, one can
distinguish the instruments of heroin policy (which include the
effective control of legitimate opium in Turkey, the suppression
of illicit crops in Mexico and Afghanistan, the encouragement of
crop substitution in Thailand, the creation of specialized heroin
detecting devices at U.S. ports of entry, and the targeting of
heroin importing and distributing organizations, and even the
occasional attacks on street level dealing in notorious areas of
a city) from the instruments of a marijuana control policy (which
includes diplomatic initiatives and foreign aid to Mexico and
Jamaica, the eradication of illicit fields, the training of
marijuana sniffing dogs to stand guard at the border, the
mobilization of the Navy and Coast Guard to aid in the
identification of ships engaged in large scale smuggling, and so
on). The point is that many policy initiatives are specific to,
or have their maximum impact on, one drug rather than another,
and it is a useful exercise to see how our efforts are deployed
against particular drugs. </p>

<p>Operating in Different Locations. A second dimension in which
strategies against the illegal drug industry can be described and
evaluated is geography. One can talk about the division between
the international drug control effort and the domestic
activities. Among the international efforts, one can talk about
policy towards Southeast Asia (which would be principally
directed at heroin), or towards Colombia (which would be
principally directed against cocaine), or towards Mexico (which
would embrace heroin, marijuana and amphetamines). Within the
domain of domestic supply reduction efforts, one can discuss the
allocation of enforcement efforts across major cities in the
United States, and this, too, has implications for the different
drugs attacked. Enforcement efforts in New York and Los Angeles
will probably give more emphasis to heroin and cocaine than
efforts in Kansas City or St. Louis. </p>

<p>Targeting Factors of Production. A third dimension in
characterizing and analyzing supply reduction policy instruments
is the factor of production and distribution that is the
principal target. Thus, one can distinguish eradication and crop
substitution programs, which are directed at raw materials; from
financial investigations, which attack the capital of illicit
dealers; from interdiction programs which attack goods in
transit, from conspiracy investigations, which are designed to
immobilize trafficking network; from street level enforcement
which is designed to discourage advertising and the development
of new markets. Of course, many instruments allow one to reach
other targets as well as its principal target. Indeed, conspiracy
investigations are often built from the discoveries made in
interdiction and street enforcement programs. The point is that
these different policy instruments have different factors of
production as their proximate targets. To the extent that some
factors of production and distribution are scarcer than others,
the relative importance of the different supply reduction
instruments in constricting the supply of drugs may be gauged and
appropriate adjustments made in the supply reduction strategy. </p>

<p>Relying on Different Agencies. A fourth way of thinking about
supply reduction policy instruments, and probably the most
common, is in terms of the agencies that are principally
responsible for carrying out different activities within the
overall supply reduction effort. Thus, one thinks in terms of the
international supply reduction program as the principal
responsibility of the State Department; the interdiction effort
as the primary responsibility of the U.S. Customs, Border Patrol,
and Coast Guard with occasional assistance from the U.S. Armed
Forces; the domestic investigation program as the primary
responsibility of DEA and the FBI; and the street level
enforcement effort as the primary responsibility of the nation's
thousands of local police departments. Thinking about the supply
reduction effort in these terms has the advantage of bringing
immediately to mind which agencies are available for supply
reduction efforts, and of suggesting approximately where they can
make a contribution both geographically and in terms of squeezing
particular factors of production and distribution. It has the
disadvantage, however, of not sharply distinguishing among the
different efforts in terms of either drugs or specific factors of
production and distribution. </p>

<p>The Strengths and Limitations of Alternative Instruments </p>

<p>For purposes of a broad brush strategic analysis, we will use
this last set of categories, since they are the terms in which
most of the policy discussions at the federal level are now being
carried out. Our task will be to determine the potential of each
area in minimizing the supply of drugs to illicit markets in the
U.S. That, in turn, depends on our ability to see how each of
these programs affects the factors of production and distribution
for the major drugs of abuse. </p>

<p>The International Program. The international drug control
program has two principal liabilities as an instrument of supply
reduction efforts. The first is that this program is inevitably
hostage to the interests and capabilities of foreign governments:
the U.S. can do no more in this area than other governments will
allow it to do. Of course, there are numerous ways in which the
U.S. government can increase the motivation and capacities of
foreign governments to control drugs that reach U.S. markets. The
U.S. can indicate the importance it attaches to drug control
among other interests it is pursuing within a given country; or
it can appeal to obligations a country has under international
treaties; or it can appeal to the country's self interest by
documenting the extent of the country's domestic drug problem. On
the capacity side, the U.S. can contribute money, or particular
kinds of equipment, or technical assistance in the forms of
specific on-site advice, or more generalized training of drug
control officials. These specific measures constitute the daily
activities of the international program. In the end, though, they
run up against more or less unmovable barriers, such as the
limited control of central governments over out-lying areas of a
country, or the inefficiency and corruption of government
agencies. Against these obstacles there is often little that the
U.S. government can do. </p>

<p>The second limitation is that the bulk of this program seems
too targeted on the raw materials for heroin, cocaine and
marijuana. Arguably, this is not particularly effective, since
there is not particular reason to believe that the raw materials
for these drugs are in long run short supply. Indeed, all our
experience and intelligence suggests that potential growing areas
for these drugs are widespread, and that the elimination of
fields in one place will fairly soon be replaced by cultivation
elsewhere. </p>

<p>These limitations are sufficiently severe that it would
probably be a mistake to rely on the international program as the
primary instrument in a supply reduction strategy. It simply
cannot do enough work reliably enough to merit that position.
Having said this, however, there are some very important things
the international program can do that will make an important
contribution to the overall effectiveness of supply reduction
efforts. </p>

<p>The first is that it will occasionally occur that the standard
efforts of the international program suddenly become effective.
This usually occurs when a country important in supplying drugs
to the United States suddenly becomes highly motivated to control
drugs. When this happens, support from the United States can
often result in a significant shortage of the drug. Typically,
the shortage lasts no longer than a year or two as the illicit
industry adjusts to the new conditions. But even so, that
shortage is worth producing. That is particularly true for drugs
that are unusually dependence producing, for the shortage means
that a cohort of children in the ages of maximum vulnerability
squirts through that period of relative shortages with much lower
probabilities of dependence or addiction. </p>

<p>Indeed, this is what happened in the early part of the 1970's,
when Turkey suddenly shut down its legitimate production of opium
and helped to produce a two to three year shortage in the supply
of heroin. The effect of this success was high effective prices
in the United States, reduced incidence of heroin use, and a
shift to Mexico and Southeast Asia as the principal sources of
supply, although for a while at lesser volumes than had been true
when Turkey was also a supplier. </p>

<p>Keeping open such opportunities, and being in a position to
exploit them when they come along, are the principal
contributions of the international drug program. Hut one cannot
always count on such successes. It is important, then, that the
international program continue, trying to increase the likelihood
that it can occasionally produce such successes, but no one
should rely on it as the principal supply reduction instrument. </p>

<p>A second way that the international program can be helpful is
by stepping up its efforts to support international criminal
enforcement. In essence, the focus of the international program
might usefully shift from crop eradication, to efforts to deny
international traffickers &quot;safe havens&quot; anywhere in the
world. This would mean concretely increased progress in
negotiating extradition treaties with countries that now harbor
traffickers, and improving operational coordination between
foreign and U.S. police agencies to take advantage of both
extradition and investigations and prosecutions within the host
country. </p>

<p>Such a thrust has potential for two reasons. First, it is a
narrowly focused program. It has none of the logistical and
bureaucratic difficulties of massive crop control programs.
Second, it is targeted against a factor of production and
distribution that is probably in long run short supply, namely
individuals with a sufficiently well established reputation for
both reliability in successful transactions and viciousness in
betrayals, who become the primary people with whom large drug
deals can be made. If this is the factor in long run short supply
in the illicit industry; and if the international program could
squeeze this factor even more by denying notorious dealers safe
havens anywhere in the world; then the international program
would have another more reliable and more powerful way of making
a contribution than cultivating the motivations and capacities of
foreign governments to control illicit crops. </p>

<p>Interdiction. In recent years, the interdiction program has
probably been the fastest growing component of the supply
reduction effort. The growth has come primarily as a result of
engaging the U.S. Coast Guard and other military agencies in the
pursuit of smugglers on the ocean and in the air. The results of
this effort can be seen in the dramatic difference in the price
of drugs landed in the U.S. as compared with the price of drugs
off-shore, or in foreign source countries. </p>

<p>The principal problem with interdiction as the dominant
instruction of supply reduction efforts is that it is principally
focused on a single drug - marijuana. That is particularly true
insofar as it concentrates on bulk shipments clandestinely landed
between ports of entry, for marijuana is the only drug whose
volume restricts smugglers to these methods of getting the drugs
across the borders. Smugglers of heroin and cocaine have many
more options, and much more of these drugs seem to come across in
relatively small containers through ports of entry. Thus, the
engagement of the Coast Guard, the Navy, the Air Force, and the
Federal Aviation Administration, turns out to be an initiative
that is primarily targeted against marijuana. To the extent that
one thinks marijuana is currently a high priority drug to
control, this may be counted a benefit rather than a problem. But
to the extent that one thinks other drugs are higher priority, or
to the extent one wanted flexible supply reduction instruments
that could be used for controlling several different drugs, the
current interdiction program has important limitations. </p>

<p>The interdiction program has a further limitation. It is
principally targeted on finished inventories of drugs. There is a
certain, concrete satisfaction in capturing drugs that would
otherwise reach illicit markets. But as in the case of crop
elimination, one can wonder whether the inventories are what is
in long run short supply. When we think about legitimate firms,
we don't think of their inventories of finished goods as being
particularly important. Obviously, the inventories have value,
and to the extent they are eliminated, the firm had less capital
than it otherwise would. But the inventories usually reflect only
a small portion of the total value of the firm. When Tylenol had
to be taken off the market, for example, no one expected the
company to go out of business, even though a month's worth of
production had to be written off, and their reputation had been
seriously tarnished. </p>

<p>Similarly, it is hard to understand why we think it is so
important when drugs are seized. This may be important if the
firm was a short term operation, and the seized shipment
represented a large fraction of its total assets, but there is no
particular reason to believe this. Most of the time it seems that
shipments are divided up precisely to hedge against the
possibility that he drugs will be seized, and this seems to be a
likely event. Current estimates indicate that somewhere between
one-quarter and one-third of all marijuana shipments are seized,
but this has had little impact on the effective price of
marijuana. Thus, our experience and our reasoning suggest that
finished goods are not a factor of production and distribution
that is in long run short supply. Consequently, a policy
instrument directed primarily against such inventories will not
exert enormous leverage on the long run effective price of drugs
in illicit markets. </p>

<p>Domestic Enforcement. The standard criticism of the domestic
enforcement program is that it is &quot;too far from the
source&quot; of drugs to allow effective control. By this
reckoning both the international and the interdiction programs
are preferred instruments because they attack the chain of
production and distribution at an earlier stage than domestic
enforcement. A second criticism is that the quantity of drugs
seized in the domestic enforcement program is too low to allow it
to have much effective control. A third criticism is that too
much of the effort within the domestic enforcement program goes
into low level cases, which are farthest from the source and
involve the smallest quantities of drugs. </p>

<p>The difficulty with these criticisms is that they rely on
assumptions - with little evidence or reasoning behind them -
about the best way to control the supply of drugs. In fact, they
emphasize physical over economic relationships. A priori there is
no particular reason to assume that resources are better spent
&quot;nearer the source.&quot; True, if one stops the drugs
earlier rather than later on need not worry about the later
stages; and, true, the drugs may be at their maximum
concentration with respect to volume at the point they are
processed into finished products. But neither point indicates
that he source is the most important point to attack. As we have
seen, it may be quite difficult to mount an attack at that point.
Moreover, both arguments place too much emphasis on the drugs and
not enough on the entrepreneurs and firms whose continued
determination and adaptability keep the drugs flowing, even if
production runs are spoiled and inventories seized. </p>

<p>If the principal difficulties that confront dealers in
producing and distributing drugs are risks posed by enforcement
agents and other criminals, then the crucial factors of
production and distribution are not raw materials and technology
and warehouses, but the determination and capacity to complete
transactions in this risky environment. Those may be qualities
possessed by specific individuals or trafficking networks - not
the raw materials, not the finished inventories, not even the
financial capital. If these observations are accurate, then any
instrument that attacked the capacities to complete risky trans
actions would be more effective than those that attacked raw
materials or inventories. </p>

<p>It is here that domestic enforcement operations have
advantages as an instrument in a supply reduction strategy. The
principal objective of domestic enforcement is the traffickers
themselves. The drugs are important only as convincing evidence
that will be sufficient to jail, and therefore presumably
immobilize, the traffickers. In addition, the tactics of domestic
enforcement operate principally on the capacity to execute
transactions. The principal tactics include informants,
undercover agents, and wiretap investigations. The first two
attack the ability to make transactions by forcing dealers to be
wary of associates, employees and customers, since any of these
might become an informant or an undercover agent. The third makes
it difficult for traffickers to communicate efficiently with
associates, employees and customers. Therefore domestic
enforcement presses hard on the factors of production and
distribution that seem in long run short supply. </p>

<p>It is worth noting that slowing transactions and forcing
dealers to be cautious has value at many different stages of
production and distribution. Even at the lowest levels of
distribution there are some advantages in forcing dealers to be
cautious, for it prevents the aggressive recruitment of new
customers and makes it more difficult even for regular consumers
to find drugs. In short, street level enforcement increases the
effective price of drugs in illicit markets. At intermediate or
high levels each transaction that is slowed reduces the overall
capacity of the system to supply drugs, and each trafficking
network that is eliminated results not only in loss of current
inventories, but also in future capacity to supply. </p>

<p>Moreover, it is possible that the same techniques of attacking
transactions, and immobilizing those networks that have developed
a continuing capacity to execute transactions in a risky
environment, would have enormous value in the international
program as well as in the domestic one. Indeed, while one cannot
assume that foreign countries have laws enforcement agencies that
allow them to attack criminal trafficking organizations, it seems
that it is primarily convention that makes us think of the
international program as focused on raw materials, and the
domestic program as focused on trafficking networks. In
principle, one could have a criminal enforcement program that
moved across national boundaries. And that might hold the best
chance not only for minimizing the supply of drugs to illicit
markets, but also for advancing the subjectives and using the
resources of organized crime policy. </p>

<p>An Alternative Approach to Attacking Illegal Drug Industries </p>

<p>If the right way to think about strategies against the illegal
drug industry is to guess which factor of production and
distribution is in long run short supply and then to devise a
strategy that presses hardest on that factor, and if the factor
in long run short supply is the capacity to make transactions
quickly and effectively, then a different way is opened to think
about the strategy against the illegal drug industry.
Specifically, the principal aim should be to frustrate
transactions and immobilize the largest trafficking
organizations. </p>

<p>With this as the principal aim the way that we think about
each of the other instruments changes. Of course, the
international efforts to control legitimate crops and eradicate
illicit fields retain their special, occasional importance, and
the separate arguments for maintaining pressure at the street
level remain strong. But we can also see that the international
program, interdiction, and domestic enforcement all represent
different opportunities to slice into the illicit industry, and
create possibilities for developing cases against illicit
traffickers. To see how this alternative strategy would work, it
is useful to introduce some different analytic terms. </p>

<p>Patrol versus Investigation. If the goal is to immobilize
trafficking organizations that are able to complete transactions
with ease and efficiency, the central problem is to determine who
the traffickers are and to develop evidence against them. This
sounds like a problem of criminal investigation, and so it is.
But all investigations must begin somewhere. In ordinary criminal
investigations the start is usually provided by a victim or
witness to the offense or by physical evidence available at the
site of the crime. In narcotics investigations there is no
victim, the witnesses are likely to be implicated in the crime,
and the physical evidence will not reveal much. On the other
hand, the traffickers are likely to continue committing offenses,
and therefore the opportunity to observe a crime occurring is
high, if the enforcement agencies can get themselves into
position to see it. </p>

<p>In practice this means that narcotics investigations are
extremely dependent on informants and undercover operators, who
can provide evidence themselves or produce sufficiently precise
and accurate information to justify a wire-tap or other less
intrusive but more expensive and less penetrating form of
surveillance. They can position the evidence-gathering
capabilities of enforcement agencies and how to infiltrate
undercover agents into the illicit industry. The question thus
becomes how to develop and use informants and how to use
informants and how to infiltrate undercover agents into the
illicit firms. </p>

<p>One answer to that question is to attack the illicit supply
systems in the places where it is least protected. This means on
the streets in central cities where the distribution system must
finally come into the open. Or, it means at the point that is
inherently vulnerable, where drugs are moved physically from one
place to another. Or, it means as raw materials are being
collected from remote fields in foreign countries. Surveillance
and undercover operations conducted in these areas will not only
frustrate transactions at these levels, and remove small stocks
of drugs, but they will also produce the rumors, the physical
evidence, and the potential informants who might provide the
basis for more intrusive and determined investigations of larger
networks. </p>

<p>This will not always work, of course. Many people arrested at
this level will be small scale, transient operators. Others will
be employees, but they may be unable to supply information. Still
others may know a great deal but be afraid to reveal it.
Moreover, there are other ways of developing informants. One can
offer large payments to those who are greedy, or protection to
those who are afraid, or both to potentially valuable sources.
And, just as low level enforcement operations against street
dealers, smugglers, and collectors in foreign countries can
produce potential informants,, all successful investigations
against medium and high level investigations can also yield
informants. Therefore, successful cases can be built from many
sources other than low level cases. </p>

<p>But the argument is that a high volume enforcement effort at
low levels is often quite valuable as a source of rumors,
intelligence and informants. In fact, there is an argument
supporting low level enforcement. Even more unexpectedly, there
is an argument for a low level enforcement that is not directed
or guided by intelligence about the operations of major
traffickers. </p>

<p>The strength of investigative efforts is their capacity to
make connections among known facts and inform enforcement
agencies how to position themselves to penetrate existing
trafficking organizations and develop evidence for a successful
prosecution. The weakness of investigation is that it becomes
increasingly narrow and discounts information that cannot be
related to something that is already known. In attacking
something as mysterious and dynamic as the illicit drug industry,
this tendency to become narrow is potentially very dangerous.
There is always the chance that one is concentrating on only a
small piece of the overall industry and that there is a newer or
better shielded piece that has so far escaped notice. If this is
true, the only way that enforcement agencies could discover this
is to look in areas where they didn't expect to find something.
That is the role of broad, untargeted low level enforcement
agencies. Like pickets and patrols sent out by a main military
force to maintain contact with a mysterious enemy force, agents
on the street, at the border, and in the bazaars of foreign
countries help the investigative forces stay in touch with the
emergence and development of new trafficking capabilities. </p>

<p>For analytic purposes it is useful to think of these broad,
low level enforcement operations as &quot;patrol&quot;
operations, which are scanning for drug offenses, and the
remaining pieces as &quot;investigative&quot; operations, which
can develop the leads into powerful cases that immobilize major
trafficking organizations. Moreover, in many ways, the patrol
operations perform better, if they are broad and random, rather
than narrowly targeted. A random strategy is more successful in
deterrence, and in disclosing previously unsuspected trafficking
networks. </p>

<p>The Role of Intelligence and Conspiracy Investigations. To
take full advantage of the potential relationship between
investigative and patrol functions and to produce the maximum
impact on trafficking organizations, it is necessary that some
previously neglected capabilities be more fully developed. Two
are particularly important: the intelligence function within the
investigative agencies, and the capacity to develop and prosecute
conspiracy cases within investigative and prosecutorial offices. </p>

<p>By the intelligence function, I mean the capacity to make
disciplined use of the information about trafficking networks
that is potentially available to the investigative agencies. This
is essential not only to take full advantage of any opportunities
that present themselves, but also to make sure the investigative
agencies are not misled by informants. As we have seen, there is
always an incentive for traffickers to inform on their
competitors. And there is always an incentive for enforcement
agencies to use the information and keep the informant alive.
This is acceptable as long as the informant is not more important
than the traffickers he is delivering to the enforcement
agencies. But if the informant is himself a dealer, then the
result of his informing looks like he and the enforcement agency
are colluding to maintain his position in the market. The only
way to guard against this is to have relatively accurate
information about both the informant and the target and to have
someone other than the case agent monitoring this situation. That
is something that a good intelligence analysis function could
provide. </p>

<p>The capacity to make conspiracy cases is essential because
there are many traffickers who can be revealed only through
conspiracy indictments. They may never be in direct contact with
drugs, or with the violence and corruption that provide the
structure within which the drugs can be confidently moved from
place to place and from person to person. In addition, conspiracy
cases have the advantage of simultaneously immobilizing many
pieces of a trafficking network, leaving no remnants from which a
new network might be constructed. If a single person is removed,
he may be replaced. If the entire network is eliminated,
replacement is more difficult because none of the personal
relationships that are so essential to successful trafficking
remain. </p>

<p>The challenges to investigators in making conspiracy cases are
partly matters of technique. Electronic surveillance is often an
essential ingredient, as are financial investigations. And each
require the development of special skills. Hut producing high
quality conspiracy investigations also requires a change in
attitude. They require patience - including situations where
enforcement agencies allow some dealers to continue operating
even though they are indictable. They also require risking
certain cases that are certain, for a future case that may or may
not develop. Finally, the prosecution of conspiracy cases often
depends on telling convincing stories rather than hard physical
evidence. Even though the stories night be a more accurate
account of what has been happening than the hard physical
evidence, it requires a real knack for analysis and inference to
make the story solid and convincing. In short, patience, a
willingness to take risks for an uncertain gain, and thought are
required, and these are not always qualities plentiful in
action-oriented enforcement agencies. Yet, without these, the
aggressive actions might have less impact than they otherwise
could. </p>

<p>Summary and Conclusions </p>

<p>Criminal statutes directed at illicit drug trafficking and use
are an important part of drug abuse policy. If they were
perfectly effective in discouraging people from drug trafficking
and drug abuse, there would be little need for any other
instruments. </p>

<p>The problem is that these laws are imperfectly effective: they
leave a residual market that consists of a continuing (but
smaller) demand for drugs, and a continuing (but smaller)
capacity to supply drugs to that market. To deal with the
continuing demand, the society relies on drug treatment and
preventive education programs. To deal with the continuing
supply, the country invests in diplomatic efforts to motivate
foreign countries to control drugs destined for the U.S.,
interdiction efforts to keep the drugs from landing on our
shores, domestic enforcement to disrupt trafficking networks and
discourage the aggressive marketing of drugs to non-users,
regulatory efforts to keep legitimate drugs contained in
legitimate channels of distribution and use. </p>

<p>These efforts on the supply side of the illegal drug market
are helpful in achieving the purposes of drug policy. They
increase the price and reduce the availability of drugs, and
therefore discourage new drug use and motivate older users to
abandon their drug use. But the laws create a problem for
organized crime policy, for they establish the soil from which an
illegal industry can grow. The firms that continue in the
industry will make a great deal of money as compensation for the
risks they run by continuing in the business. In addition, they
will engage in violence and corruption as crucial elements of
their strategies for surviving in an illicit industry. Finally,
some of the individuals and organizations involved in drug
trafficking may grow to become powerful criminal institutions
that seem to defy effective control by law enforcement agencies.
To the extent that these illicit firms become more adept at
dealing drugs, they may become not only an organized crime
problem, but an increased threat to the objectives of drug abuse
policy. Thus, the special instruments we associate with organized
crime policy must be deployed not only to deal with the organized
crime problem that is created by our drug abuse policy, but also
to prevent organized criminal groups from defeating the purposes
of drug abuse policy. </p>

<p>Viewed from the perspective of drug abuse policy, the central
objective of a strategy attacking the illegal drug industry is to
minimize the capacity of the illicit drug industry to supply
drugs to illicit markets. In terms of traditional analyses of
industrial organization, this objective can be described as
minimizing the &quot;performance&quot; of the illicit industry. </p>

<p>Viewed from the perspective of organized crime policy, the
central objectives are to prevent the development of wealthy and
powerful criminal groups and to reduce the violence and
corruption associated with the illicit drug industry. Again, in
the traditional analyses of industrial organization, these
objectives can be captured by attacking the structure and shaping
the conduct of the industry. </p>

<p>There may be some tension between the objectives of drug abuse
policy on the one hand, and organized crime on the policy on the
other. To the extent that the drug laws create the conditions
under which an illicit industry might arise, there is an obvious
conflict. Legalization of the drugs would almost certainly
increase the number of chronic, intensive drug users and
therefore make the drug problem worse. But it would also
eliminate drugs as an organized crime problem. Beyond this
observation is another paradox, however. From the perspective of
drug abuse policy, a highly concentrated industry may be
preferable to an atomized industry. A concentrated industry might
supply fewer drugs at higher prices than an atomized industry.
And, although each firm in the industry may be harder to attack
effectively, the impact of a successful attack might be larger
and more enduring than the results of ten successful attacks on
smaller firms that accounted for a smaller portion of the total
supply capacity and were easier to replace. From the perspective
of organized crime policy, however, a concentrated industry would
be worse because it would imply the existence of large, enduring
organizations of substantial power and influence. What is not in
conflict, however, is the need of both drug abuse policy and
organized crime policy to develop and use tactics that are
successful in attacking large, entrenched criminal organizations.
This is useful to drug policy and essential to organized crime
policy. </p>

<p>In controlling the supply of drugs to illicit markets the
United States relies on many instruments, in addition to
attacks&quot; on organized criminal groups that deal in drugs.
There is an &quot;international program&quot; that tends to focus
on the production of raw materials to produce heroin and cocaine.
This has the advantage of occasionally producing a significant
but short-lived result when a foreign country's increased
motivation and capacity to deal with the problem eliminates an
important source of supply to the U.S. But the value of the
instrument overall is limited by the widespread availability of
raw materials and the fact that U.S. objectives are always
hostage to the motivations and capacities of foreign governments.
</p>

<p>There is also an &quot;interdiction program&quot; designed to
intercept the drugs and shipment before they cross U.S. borders.
This has the advantage of creating a significant obstacle to
traffickers and inflicting economic losses on traffickers as a
result of seizures. It has the disadvantages of focusing
principally on the inventories of drugs rather than on the
organizations that continue to send them, and of being relatively
less successful in dealing with heroin and cocaine than with
marijuana. </p>

<p>Finally there is a &quot;domestic enforcement program&quot;,
designed to attack domestic trafficking organizations, and to
discourage the aggressive marketing of drugs through street level
enforcement. This program has the advantages of focusing on the
trafficking organizations and engaging the substantial resources
of the nation's 400,000 local police officers. It has the
disadvantages to being only occasionally successful in
eliminating major trafficking organizations. </p>

<p>What appears to be missing in this common conception of the
nation's strategy against the supply of drugs to illicit markets
is precisely the perspective that a focus on international
criminal organizations would bring. It seems likely that the
capacity to execute large scale transactions in the risky
environment of an illicit industry is in long run, short supply
in the illicit drug industry. The firms that can overcome these
difficulties are likely to be large scale, enduring,
organizations with a well established reputation for irresistible
violence. Thus, these firms - in all likelihood, international
firms - should become the main targets of a supply reduction/
organized crime policy. </p>

<p>If this is the principal target, one's view of how the society
should deploy it resources should change dramatically. The
interdiction and domestic enforcement programs are suddenly seen
principally as &quot;patrol operations&quot;, which can produce
intelligence and informants to be used in mounting attacks on
major trafficking organizations. Moreover, the focus of the
international program should shift from concerns about crop
control to the support of foreign enforcement efforts and the
negotiation of treaties, which would allow the more convenient
prosecution of drug traffickers whose crimes cross national
boundaries. Finally, major investments should be made in the
capabilities of intelligence agencies and an orientation towards
sustained conspiracy cases among investigators and prosecutors.
This strategy holds the greatest potential to achieve the
objectives of both drug abuse policy and organized crime policy.
Moreover, this strategy depends most heavily on the continuing
development of our capacity to deal with organized criminal
groups no matter what illegal goods and services they happen to
be supplying.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Winning the War Against Drugs </h2>

<p>By Mitchell S. Rosenthal, M.D. Submitted: October 1, 1985. Dr.
Rosenthal is President of the Phoenix House Foundation, a drug
rehabilitation program. </p>

<p>There is a popular perception these days that America is
locked in a &quot;no win&quot; struggle against drugs. This
notion of &quot;the endless battle,&quot; in which we seem unable
to prevail, that has prompted a good many lawyers, scientists,
and writers to suggest that it might be time for the United
States to quit. </p>

<p>Some Americans have always believed that the use of certain
illicit drugs is not such a terrible thing and others have argued
that the government has no right to tell citizens what they can
or cannot ingest. But the strongest opposition to the nation's
drug laws and policies has come from those who believe that they
should be scrapped because they do not work well. The latest
converts to this cause contend that legalization of marijuana and
cocaine (some would include heroin) would eliminate drug profits
and crime overnight and substantially reduce the costly burden of
enforcing drug laws. </p>

<p>The &quot;quit now&quot; crowd plainly does not recognize that
there is a world of difference between &quot;not winning&quot; a
war and &quot;losing&quot; one. The war against drugs, although
it is going badly at the moment, is far from lost. But quitting
now and attempting to solve the drug crime problem through
legalization would he tantamount to losing - at least in terms of
the impact on drug abuse. </p>

<p>The notion that we could make drugs legal, while
simultaneously mounting (as some advocates of legalization
suggest) a massive public education campaign to discourage their
use would give cocaine and marijuana the same status as
cigarettes. The most likely result, according to the former
director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, would be a
tenfold increase in cocaine use. There would be just about as
many Americans using cocaine as now smoke cigarettes. </p>

<p>Another reason not to give up the fight is because we can win.
After more than 20 years of treating and curing drug abuse, I see
enough evidence to convince me that the war is winnable - not
now, but in time. It is winnable because what denies us victory
today is the nature of the war we are waging and not the nature
of the enemy we are fighting. </p>

<p>The war is going badly for much the same reasons that any war
goes badly. In part, it is inappropriate strategy fighting the
wrong enemy, in the wrong place and with the wrong weapons. In
part, it is a failure of will. </p>

<p>We are on the defensive, with battle lines stretching along
our borders. Our main weapon is interdiction. Most of the billion
dollars a year the Federal government spends enforcing drug laws
(two-thirds of all it spends to fight drug abuse) goes to halt
the flow of illicit drugs into our country. </p>

<p>Yet, the drugs keep flowing, even though 13 tons of cocaine
and 1,500 tons of marijuana (with a total street value of $11
billion) were seized by federal agents last year. It would seem
that when $5 million or $50 million or $500 million worth of
drugs is impounded, the total available for distribution would he
reduced by a like amount. Hut that is not the case. Drugs lost
through seizure are instantly replaced by producers and
importers. The more Federal agents seize at our end of the
pipeline, the more drug traffickers feed into the other end.
Although interdiction efforts have expanded dramatically and vast
quantities of drugs have been seized, the flow to the street has
diminished hardly at all, and cost to consumers has actually
fallen. </p>

<p>In frustration, Americans have turned their ire on producing
nations. Apparently, we feel more comfortable and justified
pressuring Colombians, Peruvians and Bolivians to stop producing
cocaine than pressuring Americans to stop using it. </p>

<p>In spite of minimal success, we remain committed to battling
drugs primarily by reducing supply rather than by reducing
demand. Yet, the supply side is obviously harder to hit and to
hurt. Producers are beyond our reach. Major dealers are
sophisticated, secretive, and ruthless, willing to accept
enormous risks and enormous losses as long as profits remain
equally enormous. </p>

<p>The demand side, however, is easier to reach. It is vast,
barely concealed at all these days, and it consists of the more
than 20 million Americans who now regularly use illicit drugs.
What's more, the demand side is where all three weapons at our
disposal can be deployed - not only law enforcement, but drug
treatment and drug prevention as well. </p>

<p>Our reluctance to attack demand as vigorously as we attack
supply reflects nothing less than a failure of will - not on the
part of the administration, law enforcement agencies or drug
abuse professionals, but on the part of the American public.
Public attitudes and public expectations determine how we go
about fighting this war, limit how much we can do and how far we
dare go. </p>

<p>What limits drug treatment is not just reduced government
support. Even if resources were available, there is no way we
could help the great majority of drug abusers in this country to
overcome their drug dependency because most of them are not
seeking help. They are not seeking help because society does not
require them, and the law does not compel them. </p>

<p>Limits on what drug prevention can accomplish reflect what can
only be called a public demand for selective prevention the
prevention of some but not necessarily all drug use. Just about
everyone wants to prevent one kind of drug use or another. Most
parents believe that kids shouldn't use drugs. Most employers are
convinced that workers ought not use them. The public in general
would like to see criminals stop using drugs and stop stealing in
order to buy drugs. But, beyond this point, public demand softens
considerably and attitudes become ambivalent. </p>

<p>Nowhere is our ambivalence more evident than in our attitudes
towards law enforcement. We are content with a &quot;trickle
down&quot; approach - one that focuses almost exclusively on
putting major dealers behind bars. But we learned during the days
of strict enforcement in New York State during the 1960's and
from recent crackdowns on street dealers in New York City, that
the real victories of law enforcement are not the number of
dealers or users arrested or convicted but the number motivated
to seek treatment. We know that when it becomes too dangerous or
too difficult to sell drugs or to buy them, then a great deal of
drug use will simply disappear and demand for treatment will rise
rapidly to the level of real need. </p>

<p>Lenient or selective enforcement of drug laws - what amounts
to non-enforcement and de facto legalization - in some areas - is
a reflection of our ambivalence. It comes down to the way that
Americans feel personally about drugs - not only about our own
use, but about use by our grown and half-grown children and by
our friends, and about what is wrongheadedly called
&quot;recreational&quot; use of marijuana and cocaine. While it
may make us uncomfortable, most of us do not think of it in the
same way as we think about drug use by nine- and ten-year-olds or
about the heroin addiction of criminals. And we are generally
unwilling to see our friends and children at risk of arrest and
prosecution because of drug use. </p>

<p>But I do not believe we can win the war against drugs until we
have positive consensus on the strict enforcement of drug laws.
However, we need not make that decision any harder than it must
be. We don't have to agree that drug users should go to jail. The
purpose of drug laws is not punishment - certainly not when
applied to users. These laws serve what must be recognized as a
public health function - a means of controlling a contagious
disease by imposing on its carriers the requirement of whatever
it takes in the way of education and treatment to overcome their
drug use. </p>

<p>We are not likely to see this consensus come soon. Too many
drug-using young adults are still convinced they enjoy some
special &quot;right&quot; to use illicit drugs and believe they
can handle them. Too many Americans are torn between the urge to
condemn behavior, of which they disapprove, and the need to
tolerate behavior they have somehow come to believe is a matter
of individual freedom or simply none of their business. </p>

<p>But both drug users and drug tolerators ignore the contagious
nature of drug abuse. The hostess who overlooks a little discreet
after-dinner pot-smoking or the professional who pointedly
ignores covert coke-sniffing by his or her colleagues must
eventually come to realize that a person can no more tolerate a
little recreational drug use than he or she can tolerate a little
recreational smallpox. As for users, even those convinced that
their own drug habits are under control cannot guarantee that the
friends, coworkers or teenagers they influence will be able to
avoid drug dependency and the other high risks of drug use. Nor
is there any basis for them to believe that they will continue to
enjoy immunity from the costs of drug use - if indeed they enjoy
it now. </p>

<p>Broad societal disapproval of illicit drug use is needed
before we can come to a consensus about strict drug law
enforcement. Needless to say, active disapproval and the use of
informal social sanctions will make more aggressive law
enforcement irrelevant in most cases. The hostess who is certain
enough of her own unwillingness to tolerate pot smoking in her
home doesn't need to call the cops to keep her guests from
lighting up - no more than she need call them to stop her guests
from stealing the silver or spitting in the soup. Nor do
professionals who recognize the danger of drug use to their
colleagues, need to turn to the law. They have far more effective
ways of bringing the behavior of these colleagues into line -
once they accept the need to draw such a line. </p>

<p>In many ways our society resembles the American family in the
1960's. Many parents then believed they were doing their children
a favor by laying back and not taking a hard-line stand against
drugs. They allowed youngsters to stumble through the drug
experience. Only later they came to realize the costs. Those
costs ran high, both in chronic impairment and lost educational
and career opportunities. As a result, parental attitudes have
changed markedly. Parents are now taking the hard line, which is
really the loving line, one that shows responsible concern. </p>

<p>More recently, the Navy has demonstrated how to go about
attacking drug use on the demand side. While it brought heavy
weapons into play - drug tests and disciplinary actions - it also
effectively reduced widespread tolerance for drug use. By
stressing the interdependence of seamen, the Navy began replacing
this attitude with a far more responsible one expressed by the
motto: &quot;Not on my watch, not on my ship, not in my
Navy.&quot; </p>

<p>This is the kind of attitudinal change I expect to see
occurring throughout the country over the next decade. It is
already underway. Adolescents have become far more critical of
drug use by their friends, and this is the result not only of
better drug education in the schools, but also of more awareness
of drug dangers on the street. Employers are now responding to
increasing evidence of economic costs directly attributable to
drug use in the work force. </p>

<p>So, there is every reason to believe that public attitudes
about illicit drugs will become firmer and more responsible. As a
result, the limitations on what we have been able to achieve
through prevention, through treatment, and through law
enforcement, will gradually be removed. They will no longer
dictate strategy that prevent us from moving as aggressively
against domestic demand as we do against foreign supply. </p>

<p>If law enforcement is to work effectively in cooperation with
treatment and with prevention in this attack on the demand side,
then we need to adopt consistent goals. While we should certainly
persist in interdiction and target major dealers, we cannot focus
most of our energy and resources on these high visibility
efforts. It is on the street that the final battle is going to be
won, and it will be won by constant pressure, over time, that
will be felt by every drug dealer and every drug user. </p>

<p>This kind of pressure will not result in any impressive string
of convictions, but it will respond directly to the desperate
needs of drug-ridden communities. It will strengthen
drug-troubled families, and it will improve the quality of life
for millions of Americans. </p>

<p>This kind of pressure, supported by a popular mandate, will
result in the gradual erosion of the drug market and the gradual
decline of drug use. Demand for treatment will grow. Prevention
will cease to be selective but reach out broadly across all
society. And drug abuse, while it may never entirely disappear,
will cease to pose any substantial threat to the nation, its
youth.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Preventing Drug Abuse: What Can We Do? </h2>

<p>By Dr. Arnold M. Washton. Submitted: October 1, 1985. Dr.
Washton is Director of the Addiction Research and Treatment
Center, The Regent Hospital, New York, New York; and Research
Director of The National Cocaine Hotline &quot;800-COCAINE,&quot;
Fair Oaks Hospital, Summit, New Jersey. </p>

<p>The most dramatic increase in drug use has occurred since the
1960's, a time of radical change in political and social beliefs,
lifestyles and mores. Traditional values, authorities, and
restrictions on behavior were vehemently challenged. Psychoactive
drugs and the breakdown of traditional taboos against using them
became symbols of the rebellion against the established order. We
have come to recognize in the 1980's that we are paying a very
high price for the casual attitude towards drugs that developed
in the 1960's. Much misinformation has been corrected, and we
have begun to formulate a more realistic appraisal of the
problem, but now we must take specific actions to reduce the
demand for drugs. </p>

<p>Interventions that merely condemn drug use and try to frighten
children about the potential dangers (&quot;scare tactics&quot;)
are futile. The most effective prevention strategies are those
that address the factors that make drugs attractive and thwart
the process that leads youngsters to try them. Children use drugs
for many different reasons. Usually there are at least several
factors that enter into the decision to experiment or continue
with drug use. Drug use itself is no evidence that parents have
failed to properly raise their children. Many children with a
good family upbringing have yielded to the enormous outside
pressures to use drugs. The influence of peers can often override
even the best parental input. </p>

<p>Effective drug abuse prevention must address the most basic
and fundamental forces that promote drug-taking in our society.
These fall into two main categories: supply and demand. </p>

<p>Reducing Supply </p>

<p>Reducing the supply of illicit drugs is an obvious way of
curtailing use. Although this does little to alter the demand for
drugs, the widespread availability and abundant supplies of many
different types of powerful mood-altering substances makes it
easier for our citizens to become involved in drug use. It
reinforces the notion that illicit drugs are an expected part of
American life. People are more likely to try drugs when they are
surrounded by them - and children are no exception. Most American
adolescents know someone who &quot;deals&quot; drugs, uses drugs,
or is able to get them. </p>

<p>To counter the supply problem, we must continue to enforce and
strengthen our laws against the manufacture, sale, and possession
of drugs. We must also take a firmer stand against drug-producing
countries that receive American foreign aid. </p>

<p>The failure of Prohibition is a dramatic example of how
difficult it is to eliminate the use of a drug by law enforcement
efforts alone; especially when the drug is so well-entrenched in
society. Nonetheless, to legalize drugs, such as cocaine,
marijuana, or heroin would cause nothing short of a national
disaster. When drugs are cheaper and more readily available, more
people use them, become addicted to them, and suffer serious
consequences to their health and functioning. Legalization of
drugs would create an epidemic of unprecedented proportions. </p>

<p>Although enforcement efforts are necessary to check abuse,
they cannot prevent the problem by themselves. Neither can
treatment programs, which are utilized only after a serious drug
abuse problem has been identified. </p>

<p>Reducing Demand </p>

<p>Prevention of drug use in the United States must focus
intensively on the problem of demand. The cultural forces that
encourage and perpetuate drug use in our society must be
eliminated. We must recognize that drugs have become a
deeply-ingrained part of American life and that prevention cannot
occur unless social attitudes toward drug use change. Changing
social attitudes toward drugs is a difficult undertaking, but not
an impossible one. Many segments of society must become involved
in the effort. The message that drug use is unacceptable,
unhealthy, and unnecessary must be communicated in a credible and
consistent manner by the family, schools, media, business
community, medical and legal experts, politicians, professional
athletes, and other public figures. This message must be
reflected in every aspect of American life including education,
entertainment, business management practices, and law
enforcement. Being free of drugs must become a highly desirable
personal attribute: one that is seen as mandatory for success in
our society. One might hope that non-involvement with drugs would
become at least as desirable as physical fitness and
attractiveness. </p>

<p>Several prevention strategies are outlined below. </p>

<p>Recommendations </p>

<p>1. Public Education and Media Campaigns. The media is
potentially one of our most powerful prevention tools. It could
be used to better educate the public about the dangers of drugs
and to change attitudes about drug use through direct and
indirect communications. Public service messages, educational
programs, documentaries, and greater efforts to eliminate
pro-drug programs, might help to counteract accepting attitudes
toward drugs. </p>

<p>2. School-based Prevention Programs. Every school system in
the United States must have an active and creative drug abuse
prevention program. Prevention efforts, such as saying
&quot;NO&quot; to drugs and learning of their potential dangers,
must start in the early grades, not just in high school. Studies
show that drug use often starts before the 7th grade and that by
the time youngsters reach teenage it may be too late to change
their attitudes about drugs or their willingness to
&quot;try&quot; drugs. Nonetheless, early identification of
drug-abusing youngsters and swift efforts to ameliorate the
problem are essential in our nation's high schools. </p>

<p>In this regard, the &quot;Student Assistance Program&quot;
(SAP) in New York's Westchester County has served as a model
program to other school systems around the country. The SAP is
based on the EAP (Employee Assistance Program) model used
successfully in business and industry, utilizing on-site
substance abuse counselors, who are especially skilled at
identifying drug-abusing youngsters and providing the necessary
assistance or referral. </p>

<p>3. Education of Health Professionals. Despite epidemic levels
of drug abuse over the past two decades, most health
professionals receive no formal training in the diagnosis and
treatment of drug dependency. This situation must be corrected by
mandating that a core curriculum in the clinical management of
drug abuse problems be part of the training of physicians,
nurses, psychologists, social workers, and other health
professionals. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Drug Testing in DWIs. Currently, not a single state in
        the United States requires drug testing of drivers
        stopped for suspected driving under the influence of
        alcohol. Someone &quot;stoned&quot; on drugs may be able
        to pass a breathalyzer test with no difficulty, but still
        be too impaired to drive safely. </li>

<h1>Arguments and Answers - Page 1 </h1>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> This is a collection of actual arguments and answers from a
long chain of debates on drug policy. Somewhere in this archive,
every argument you ever heard in favor of the drug war is
encountered and rebutted. If I missed any, please send them to me
by e-mail: schaffer@smartlink.net </p>

<p> My opponent's comments are in <b>boldface</b>. My comments
are in plain text. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> <b>{{1. &quot;....After adjusting for covariants, the
marijuana group showed small but statistically significant
increased risk for all three catagories of conditions
(Respiratory, accidental injury, and other).&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> Other, longer studies, such as the Jamaican studies have
shown no statistically significant differences between marijuana
smokers and non-smokers, even when the marijuana smokers had an
average daily dose about 28 times that consumed by the average US
user. Therefore, one study is not going to break the back of the
collected research on marijuana. </p>

<p> The collected summation of marijuana research is this:
&quot;Marijuana, in its natural form, is probably the safest
therapeutically active substance known to mankind. It is safer
than many of the foods we commonly eat.&quot; -- Francis Young,
Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, after two years of review of all of the evidence
presented by the DEA and by those asking for reform. That is the
same conclusion supported by every major study of drug policy. </p>

<p> <b>{{2. &quot;Respiratory deposition of tar and adsorption of
carbon monoxide in experimental subjects were four and five times
higher, respectively, after smoking marijuana than after smoking
tobacco.&quot;}} </b> </p>

<p> Assuming this is true, how does this prove that throwing
millions of people in prison is the best approach to the problem?
</p>

<p> <b>{{3. &quot;Marijuana has repeatedly been found to be the
second most common drug, after alcohol, present in the blood of
nonfatally and fatally injured persons.&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> There might be a good, logical reason for this. Marijuana is
detectable in the blood for up to two months after a person
smokes a joint, even though the high is long since gone. It may
simply be an indicator that far more people are smoking marijuana
than you thought. You also have to remember that common over the
counter drugs will make people test positive for marijuana. </p>

<p> You will note that they did not say &quot;drivers.&quot; It
is irrelevant what the passengers were using. </p>

<p> And, by this sort of reasoning, the penalties for alcohol
sale and possession ought to be even higher than the pot
penalties. Why aren't you fighting even harder for alcohol
Prohibition? </p>

<p> <b>{{4. &quot;Laboratory studies have shown decreased
driving-related skills after smoking marijuana.&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> Repeated real world experience has shown that marijuana is
not a major factor in traffic accidents. The reason is fairly
simple -- pot has a very mild effect on people and does not
destroy coordination the way alcohol does. The real problem here
is that the people who want to throw people in prison for drugs
do not actually know anything about the drug and its effects. </p>

<p> <b>{{5. &quot;In a Swedish study following a cohort of 45,540
male military conscripts for 15 years, heavier cannabis users had
a nearly three times greater risk of death than nonusers....and
had an elevated risk of schizophrenia compared with
nonusers.&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> A Johns Hopkins study, just as credible, showed that
marijuana smokers were more ambitious than their peers and
usually succeeded better than the rest. </p>

<p> The question here is &quot;Death from what?&quot; Their
cannabis users could have been concentrated in those areas with a
higher risk of death, in light of the fact that they engage in
somewhat more risk taking than their peers. Like, for instance,
our soldiers who smoked pot in Vietnam. </p>

<p> As for schizophrenia -- Did the pot cause the schizophrenia,
or would it be more likely that a person with severe mental
problems would try all sorts of self-medication to stop the
voices in their head? I have a relative with schizophrenia and I
can tell you what the answer is. </p>

<p> And, if the person is developing schizophrenia -- for any
reason -- how does it help the situation to throw them in jail? </p>

<p> <b>{{&quot; The insoluable particulate (tar) phase of the
smoke from marijuana contains about 50% of some carcinogenic aryl
hydrocarbons, including benz[a]anthracene, and benzo[a]pyrene
then the smoke from a comparable quantity of unfiltered Kentucky
reference tobacco.&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> So? Should the prison sentences for tobacco be 50% of those
for pot? Or should we also account for the fact that pot smokers
typically smoke far fewer cigarettes than a tobacco smoker? Just
how long should we put tobacco smokers in jail, anyway? </p>

<p> <b>{{&quot;The smoking of one marijuana cigarette - 800 to
900 mg, 1% to 3% delta-tetrahydrocannabinol - led to the
deposition in the lower respiratory tract of about a four-fold
greater quantity of insoluable particulates (tar) than smoking a
filtered tobacco cigarette of comparable weight...&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> See above. </p>

<p> <b>{{&quot;...the authors [Polen, et al, of the accompanying
article] are the first to use a systematic review of medical
records to assess the health consequences of marijuana...Their
finding that near-daily marijuana smoking is a significant
independent risk factor for the development of respiratory
illness, injuries, and other medical problems requiring medical
attention CHALLENGES THE VIEW THAT MARIJUANA POSES INSIGNIFICANT
HEALTH RISKS.&quot;</b> }} </p>

<p> It will have to do a lot of challenging, because there is
alot of evidence to challenge. Actually, this is more evidence
for a change in the law because every major study of drug policy
said that prohibition only INCREASED the dangers which were
already present in illegal drugs. The more dangerous you assume
them to be, the more important it becomes to treat them in a
non-criminal manner. </p>

<p> But, of course, that is not really the point, anyway. Let's
suppose that I totally believed everything you just said. Why do
you automatically assume that putting millions of people in
prison is the best approach to the problem? If it wasn't a good
idea for alcohol, and we can see that it would be a dumb idea for
tobacco, why do you suppose it is such a great idea for any other
chemical? </p>

<p> <b>{{So, it would appear the marijuana is more dangerous than
tobacco. Itwould also appear that, given the statistics
concerning fatal accidents, that marijuana use can be deadly.}}</b>
</p>

<p> So how many people are actually killed by all these drugs in
a typical year, anyway? </p>

<p> And, while you're at it, there are perhaps thirty million
people who are regular users of pot. How many millions of people
do you think we ought to throw in prison in order to control this
problem? </p>

<p> And why was the most common agricultural crop in America made
illegal in 1937 in the first place? Was it because of these
&quot;dangers&quot;, or was it for some entirely different
reason? How did the most common crop in America suddenly become a
dreaded menace to society? </p>

<p> <b>{{}}Netherlands has fewer addicts per capita than the US.
So does almost every country in the world. So what?}}</b> </p>

<p> Gee, that would seem to argue that our prohibition isn't so
effective, wouldn't it? And you said it was easy to control!!! </p>

<p> <b>{{ Germany recently decriminalized possession of small
amounts of marijuana, as have several states in the U.S. So
what?}}</b> </p>

<p> Maybe you could tell me why hemp (and the other drugs for
that matter) were made illegal in the first place. </p>

<p> <b>{{&quot;When a heroin addicts can get precise doses at
regular intervals, he can function pretty normally.&quot; They
don't want to get high?}}</b> </p>

<p> Ever heard of Dr. William Halsted? Or Senator Joseph
McCarthy? What do they have in common? </p>

<p> <b>{{ I went and looked it up. You need 100 grams of heroin
to get a 5-year sentence or a whole kilo to get a 10-year
sentence. For cocaine, the figures were 500 grams and 5 kilos.
That's a lot of dope.}}</b> </p>

<p> See the 7-8-93 op-ed piece by Federal Judge Weinstein in the
NY Times. He points out that it varies from one city to another.
In some major metropolitan areas, 100 pounds will not get you any
jail time, while in others, a marijuana seed might mean life in
prison. </p>

<p> <b>{{ If there is no evidence that punishment reduces crime,
we should shut down the prisons entirely.}}</b> </p>

<p> There are thirty million illegal drug users. Just tell me the
most reasonable number to put in prison. </p>

<p> <b>{{ You say that junkies don't do any harm, but would you
want to live next door to one?}}</b> </p>

<p> A better question is if you would want to have a drug addict
(William Bennett) as a drug czar? </p>

<p> <b>{{ I keep hearing this. No one provides any evidence. It
doesn't seem logical that people who have so much trouble
supporting a drug habit *outside* somehow acquire the necessary
income when you lock them up.}}</b> </p>

<p> Talk to someone who has been in prison. </p>

<p> {{ Then why lock up drunk drivers? Or any criminal?
Generally, we lock people up because they are a menace to
society. It is *always* possible to lose a potential
&quot;contributing member&quot; in this way, but generally we are
more interested in the rights of potential victims: Who could be
you, me, or anyone.}} </p>

<p> Anyone who commits an offense against another person should
be tried for the offense. What should be different is that a
person on cocaine who commits a crime should not get life in
prison while a drunk would plead diminished capacity for the same
crime. We should have consistent standards for all drugs and we
should apply our limited resources to the part of the problem
where it will do the most good. For example, we don't lock up
wine drinkers to try to control drunk driving. Generally, we do
lock people up because they are a menace to others. Of course,
that never was the reason for the drug laws. </p>

<p> You are far more likely to be the victim of something related
to alcohol and tobacco than from the effects of the illegal
drugs. </p>

<p> <b>{{ The properties of heroin and alcohol are very
different, and the social context is also different. For example,
most people can use alcohol in moderate amounts without ever
becoming addicted. Also, alcohol can be brewed up in any bathtub,
or derived from common products such as after-shave and
mouthwash, so the potential for controlling abuse is much less.}}</b>
</p>

<p> Yes, the properties are different. Alcohol is just as
addicting and far more damaging to the health. </p>

<p> Yes, the social context is different. The illegal drugs were
outlawed primarily because they were associated (wrongly) with
racial minorities, while alcohol and tobacco were perceived as
&quot;white&quot; drugs. </p>

<p> The evidence shows that most drug users of all types use in
moderation. This can be shown quite quickly by a simple
comparison between the total number of users and the number of
addicts. </p>

<p> The fact that alcohol can be brewed in a bathtub is hardly a
sensible argument for any kind of policy. It is equally
nonsensical for other drugs. Does that mean we should legalize
marijuana because people can grow it in their closet? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Since &quot;every major study&quot; agrees with you, it
follows that youagree with &quot;every major study,&quot; for
example:</b> </p>

<p> <b>* The President's Commission on Organized Crime (1986)</b>
</p>

<p> <b>* The National Report of the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(1992)</b> </p>

<p> <b>* The President's Commission on Model State Drug Laws
(1993)</b> </p>

<p> <b>So, can I quote these studies as authoritative, or have
you suddenly changed your mind?}}</b> </p>

<p> <b>The first study has little to do with drug policy and
cannot be considered any kind of a study of the drug policy
issue.</b> </p>

<p> <b>The second is a statistical report with no consideration
of the historical or medical aspects of the problem (or many
other aspects for that matter.)</b> </p>

<p> The third did not do any real research on drug policy. </p>

<p> But, since I so rarely run into anyone who tries naming
anything, I will give you credit. Let's assume, for the sake of
argument, that all three studies were about drug policy and right
on the money. The score is now 10 to 3 against you. When you get
a little closer I will name some more on my side. </p>

<p> <b>{{ I believe your chronology is wrong. I remember reading
a book on the subject (_Chasing the Dragon_, as I recall), which
was published around 1985. Unfortunately I don't have it to hand
. . . But, as I recall, Britain had legalized prescription
narcotics in the 60s, and they were still legal at the time the
book was published. The result was an explosive increase in drug
use, along with the accompanying things that drug abusers like to
do: abuse their spouses, neglect their children and live off the
public dole. I believe it was the Majors administration, sometime
around 1990, which flirted with stricter drug enforcement (still
not very tough by American standards). Is this that what you're
talking about?}}</b> </p>

<p> The correct chronology is given in the text of the 60 Minutes
show contained in Hoover.zip. In the 80s, under US pressure, the
British adopted a get-tough policy. It was a disaster, causing
both health problems and rising crime. In Liverpool at the
current time, they prescribe heroin and cocaine to addicts. Most
of the addicts are healthy, employed, and living with their
families. One of the conditions of their treatment is that they
must not commit crimes. It works. They originally did it because
of the AIDS infection rates, and the infection rate has dropped
to less than one percent of the addicts -- while in the US the
rate is over fifty percent. They also found that Liverpool, which
had become famous for crime, was suddenly peaceful again. It is
happening now and about a half dozen of my friends (including
doctors) are now in England discussing it with them. </p>

<p> <b>}}The Dutch, may not be alone for long. Many other
European countries are looking to decriminalization; many have
signed the Frankfort Accord agreeing that is the best approach. I
dunno about that,}}</b> </p>

<p> The following countries have already either legalized drugs
or taken steps toward legalization: The Netherlands, Germany,
Switzerland, England, Italy, Spain, and Colombia. </p>

<p> <b>}}But it indicates that Germany is moving in the direction
of common sense, while we are not. Yeah, they are liberalizing
hash and persecuting the hard drug users. That's the direction of
common sense.}}</b> </p>

<p> Why is it common sense to persecute anyone? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Still, when soldiers returned to the States, where
drugs were neither cheap nor easy to find, they gave up the
habit.}}</b> </p>

<p> The studies of the issue said that all of the soldiers
surveyed reported they could get heroin after they got back any
time they wanted it. The reason they quit was because they were
no longer under stress. </p>

<p> <b>{{ And we also lock up left-handed people . . . as I have
already pointed out. However, there are very few people in prison
simply for being junkies; most of them have committed other
offenses.}}</b> </p>

<p> Absolutely not true. There are considerable numbers. See the
testimony of the Corrections Commissioner of New York in
Hoover.zip. See also the op-ed piece by Federal Judge Jack B.
Weinstein in the 7-8- 93 New York Times. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Not at all. It is you have ignored my objection: The
argument that expensive to lock up junkies ignores the experience
with drunk driving. The fact is that severe penalties discourage
crime, and therefore reduce the number of people who need to be
locked up.}}</b> </p>

<p> There are thirty million illegal drug users in the US (give
or take). How many millions do you propose to lock up? </p>

<p> <b>{{ More deceptive figures. According to my 1993 World
Almanac, only 7% of prisoners serving terms of 1 year or more are
in federal prisons.}}</b> </p>

<p> What does that have to do with the price of eggs? </p>

<p> <b>}}How many people must we imprison, and at what cost,
before you think we will have solved the problem? --I dunno. }}</b>
</p>

<p> You hit the nail on the head that time. You obviously never
thought about it. That is the problem in a nutshell. As President
Nixon's commission said, the real drug problem is not marijuana,
heroin, or cocaine. The real drug problem is the ignorance of our
public officials who have never bothered to read the evidence. </p>

<p> <b>{{}}There are way more alcholics than there are heroin
addicts however, and the cost to society is astronomical. This
has much to do with the relative cheapness and availability of
alcohol. Do you really want to make narcotics equally cheap and
available?}}</b> </p>

<p> Narcotics are freely available at reasonable prices to anyone
who wants them. </p>

<p> <b>{{There are way more alcoholics than there are heroin
addicts however, and the cost to society is astronomical. Doesn't
that fact support continuing constraints against heroin, before
it can cause damage on an &quot;alcohol&quot; scale?}}</b> </p>

<p> No, not necessarily, but it does make me wonder why you
aren't campaigning even harder for alcohol prohibition. </p>

<p> <b>{{ }}Prohibition of alcohol did not work...{{{</b> </p>

<p> <b>Depends what you mean by &quot;work&quot;.}}</b> </p>

<p> I will accept the Wickersham Commission's definition. They
said it was a hopeless disaster in all respects. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Alcohol consumption absolutely, positively went down
during</b> </p>

<p> <b>prohibition.}}</b> </p>

<p> Absolutely false. The Wickersham Commission found that
alcohol use went down in the first year of Prohibition, but rose
every year thereafter, and that alcohol-related health problems
were much more severe. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Society, however, preferred its legal drug and repealed
prohibition.}}</b> </p>

<p> No, the Wickersham Commission, which was originally empowered
to find ways to improve Prohibition, concluded that it was
hopeless folly which did more harm than if we did nothing at all.
</p>

<p> <b>{{ It is also societies right to keep the lid on the
Pandora's Box of legalization of cocaine and heroin.}}</b> </p>

<p> So, how many millions of people should we put in prison for
drugs? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Clearly prohibition DID reduce consumption.}}</b> </p>

<p> That wasn't right the first time. It is equally wrong the
second. </p>

<p> <b>{{ In Malaysia, they are executed (at least the dealers
are).}}</b> </p>

<p> In Malaysia, the authorities kill more people for drugs than
the drugs do. And they still have a growing problem. </p>

<p> <b>{{ I wouldn't be so quick to discount the deterrent effect
of draconian measures.}}</b> </p>

<p> Neither would I. How many people do you think we ought to
execute to solve a problem that kills about 5,000 people a year? </p>

<p> <b>{{ I would personally love to see an intoxicant developed
that was safe, not physically addicting and doesnt make you (too)
stupid. (I'm dead serious). Marijuana is almost OK, but I truly
believe it makes one stupid (while under the influence) and a lot
of kids would have their intellectual growth stunted if it were
legalized.}}</b> </p>

<p> The Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, after hearing years of arguments on the subject,
concluded that &quot;marijuana, in its natural form, may be the
safest therapeutically active substance known to man&quot; and
that it is &quot;safer than many of the foods we commonly
eat.&quot; There is no evidence to support what you said about
intellectual growth. In fact, marijuana was a common food in the
19th century. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Alcohol does not directly involve the brain's internal
&quot;reward via euphoria&quot; mechanism, opiates do. They are
much more &quot;fun&quot; and way more addicting.}}</b> </p>

<p> Nope. See the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit
Drugs for a good discussion of the issue. </p>

<p> <b>{{ The Liverpudlian addicts had to first come to the
doctor for help, before being registered. Are you suggesting that
potential heroin users come to the doctor for &quot;controlled
medically supervised doses&quot; before starting the habit - or
do they come after realizing they may have a problem?}}</b> </p>

<p> They come after they realize they have a problem. But the
program has dried up the sellers on the street, and it has
greatly reduced the number one source of new addicts -- old
addicts looking for recruits to support their habit. As a result,
crime rates, health problems, and addiction have dropped
dramatically. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Is it possible that heroin, at cigarette prices, may
lead to a lot of folks to suffer severe vocational and
interpersonal damage, before finally presenting themselves for
&quot;Controlled, medically supervised doses&quot;? The
experience during Prohibition is instructive.}}</b> </p>

<p> Is it possible that tobacco addicts under the same conditions
would behave in the same manner as junkies? The experience in
Europe, after WWII, when tobacco was scarce is instructive. The
experience of Prohibition is instructive. It was a failure in all
respects. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Despite the obvious problems associated with
prohibition, the rates of cirrhosis of the liver and of wife
beating plummetted.}} </b> </p>

<p> Wrong. See the report of the Wickersham Commission. </p>

<p> <b>{{I agree that substance abuse is the trigger for much
crime, violent and non-violent. In those cases, if you can
eliminate the abuse, you probably have a much better chance of
the individual becoming a contributing member. }}</b> </p>

<p> The great majority of such crime is due to the effects of
prohibition, not the effects of the drugs. </p>

<p> <b>{{Instead of spending the money to maintain them in
prison, some sort of supervisd home confinement, coupled with
vocational training, counseling for the abuse, and routine drug
testing. Clean 'em up, train 'em, put 'em to work. That may sound
to simplistic, but what we're doing now isn't working, IMO. }}</b>
</p>

<p> The vast majority of drug users do not need treatment any
more than the vast majority of wine drinkers need treatment. For
the others, treatment is at least seven times as cost effective
as prison, with a far greater rate of success. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Alcohol is addicting to those predisposed.}}</b> </p>

<p> Correct. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Heroin is addicting (if used for non-analgesic
purposes) in everyone. Cocaine is the most addictive of all.}}</b>
</p>

<p> Wrong. See the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit
Drugs for a good discussion. Heroin addicts commonly report that
it is much harder to kick tobacco than to kick anything else. Or
see the recent <a href="../library/basicfax.htm">NIDA rankings</a>
of addictive qualities. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Increased drinking during prohibition!! No way, no
evidence, makes no sense. The logistics of obtaining, and the
black market price of alcohol during prohibition were HUGE
natural constraints on drinking for the vast majority. (ie. for
all but the speakeasy crowd).}}</b> </p>

<p> See the Wickersham Commission report, or any of the other
studies I have mentioned. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Be careful who you say things like &quot; the deceptive
thing about... liver disease are DEGENERATIVE diseases which take
a little while to develop&quot; to {g}. In 20 yrs as a general
internist, I've treated plenty of alcohol relatedliver disease.}}</b>
</p>

<p> If you are a doctor, let me ask you a question. My mother
suffers from severe chronic pain as the result of a nerve injury
during surgery. It is bad enough that it has driven her to the
point of seriously considering suicide. She has been to the Mayo
Clinic, the National Pain Institute, the USC Pain Clinic and a
long list of others. She has tried a long list of treatments. You
name your best list, she has tried it. The doctors, and her own
experience, tell her that the best treatment for her condition is
either morphine or heroin. The doctors will not prescribe it to
her because they are afraid of the DEA -- they have said so. The
Department of Health and Human Services has issued two reports
which have stated that the undertreatment of pain is a national
tragedy and that is caused by fear. The California Medical
Association recently encouraged doctors to prescribe more
narcotics and said that the reason they did not was because of
fear of the police. </p>

<p> I will not ask you if you would prescribe morphine for my
mother because I have asked every other doctor who has appeared
here and they all copped out. I expect you would too. Just tell
me: Who should determine the medicine my mother gets -- her and
her doctors -- or the police? </p>

<p> <b>{{ It is clear that when prohibition was repealed, liver
disease jumped up within the year, because of resumed drinking.}}</b>
</p>

<p> No, alcohol use continued the rise that it had already
started during Prohibition. And, even if this was true, are you
recommending that we bring back alcohol Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<p> <b>{{ I'm sorry, but the statement that heroin is harmless
flies in the face of long-agreed-on clinical experience.}}</b> </p>

<p> What does your clinical experience tell you about the effects
of prison? Is it beneficial or harmful to someone with a drug
problem? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Show me the references. I will be willing to bet
anything, that they are not the result of well designed trials}}</b>
</p>

<p> Read any of the studies that I posted. I would suggest that
you start with the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit
Drugs, so you would understand how we got into this situation. </p>

<p> By the way, did you know that the medical community
unanimously opposed these laws when they were proposed and said
they would be a medical, social, and criminal disaster? Did you
know that one of the first actions of the drug police was to jail
more than 3,000 doctors, especially those who advocated drug
treatment? </p>

<p> And, can you tell me why hemp is illegal? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Historically technical question. Shouldnt be too hard
to look up. I doubt very much that it was the OVERT crime issue.
Society was not much affected by bootleggers killing other
bootleggers.}}</b> </p>

<p> One of the major factors was a campaign to &quot;save the
children.&quot; You see, the bootleggers discovered that they
could escape harsh penalties by having kids do the dirty work,
and there was quite a bit of concern about that. Sound familiar? </p>

<p> <b>{{ However one related factor may well have been society

<p> The actual figures appear to be about the same as for the
white population. However, the drug laws were originally intended
to target minorities (look it up) and they target minorities
above all other groups today. For example, about 95 percent of
all the people sentenced under the mandatory minimums are black
men. Over time, because of the police pressure on drugs, and
because of the limited economic opportunities for black men, many
of them will turn to drug dealing as a way to make a living and
then, with the first stint in jail their future is formed. Black
men who have been to prison are virtually permanently
unemployable, so they return to the streets and act as bad role

would also lead to a relative increase in cocaine use and
addiction by a factor of two or three or more. A more sweeping
policy that eliminates both seizures and arrests would certainly
reduce the criminal justice load, but would lead to a relative
increase in cocaine use and addiction by a factor of four to
eight or more.&quot;}} </b> </p>

<p> So, under the worst circumstances they cite, there would be
perhaps 10,000 to 20,000 deaths per year from cocaine (4 to 8
times the current 2,500), compared to more than 400,000 for
tobacco, and more than 100,000 for alcohol. For heroin the
numbers would be similar, and for marijuana 4 to 8 times zero is
still zero. On the other hand, we would not have an expensive and
futile policy to put millions of people in prison. In fact, for
the same money that it took to put one person in prison we could
provide treatment for about one hundred. </p>

<p> Relative to your earlier statements on treatment, perhaps you

recognized medical experts in the field who state that, except
for the fact that heroin produces addiction, otherwise it is
&quot;harmless&quot;. Their words, not mine. Can you tell me who

<p> <b>{{* Heroin is incredibly dangerous. A dose that is normal

<p> See above about &quot;harmless.&quot; The doctors in
Liverpool state that they have patients on &quot;massive
doses&quot; with no risk of overdose. They say &quot;heroin is
not a dangerous drug&quot; and they prescribe it every day. The
number of people killed by heroin in the US runs about 2,000 a
year or about one half of one percent of the number killed by
tobacco. Aspirin also kills about 2,000 people a year. The
Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs investigated
the issue of heroin &quot;overdoses&quot; and did not find a
single instance which they believed could be attributed to a true
&quot;overdose&quot;. Nearly all of the &quot;overdoses&quot;,
they said, had symptoms which were fundamentally incompatible
with an overdose, such as instant death, or pulmonary edema. They
said their research showed that the most probable cause of these
deaths was the impurities mixed with the heroin, not the her oin
itself. As the doctors in England put it, if an addict is buying
heroin on the black market which is 10 percent heroin and 90
percent cement, it does not take a genius to figure out what is
going to cause the most problems. </p>

<p> The low number of deaths from heroin is all the more
remarkable because it is usually taken in the most dangerous
manner possible. </p>

<p> Aspirin -- 2,000 </p>

<p> Heroin - 2,000 </p>

<p> Marijuana - No recorded deaths in human history. </p>

<p> The above figures do not include pneumonia type deaths. The
AMA published figures recently which stated that the total of all
such deaths for illegal drugs was about 20,000, still only a
small fraction of the damage caused by alcohol and tobacco. As I
have pointed out in other messages, there is a good deal of

identical, otherwise it's &quot;utterly different.&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> Kinda sums up your attitude about comparing us with other
countries, doesn't it? Singapore and Turkey are good comparisons
but the Netherlands is not. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Surprise! The study I have been referring too comes
from Wirral, which happens to be a suburb of Liverpool. You
insist, without having seen it, that this study is mistaken.
However the information from Liverpool, which you know about from
a 15-minute television episode, must be good and also relevant to
the situation in America.}}</b> </p>

<p> Then why did the British Association of Chiefs of Police --
including the Liverpool Chief of Police -- vote for
decriminalization? As I said above, members of our group are over
there right now - - for the second time -- talking with the
officials there. </p>

<p> <b>{{ You don't see any danger, then, from extrapolating from
a small, homogenous country to a large, unhomogenous one?}}</b> </p>

<p> Considering the same thing is happening all over Europe, that
kind of equates to a large, unhomogenous one, doesn't it? And, by
the way, what is the exact difference which would keep their
approaches from producing benefits here? That is, assuming you
know enough about what is happening over there to know the
difference. </p>

<p> <b>{{ They &quot;go to jail&quot; quite frequently; they
don't do much prison time unless they deal or commit some other
crime.}} </b> </p>

<p> There are at least 52 Federal judges who disagree with you. I
will take their word, and the word of the New York State
Corrections Commissioner, over yours. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Prescript ion was a miserable failure in England,
according to _Living With Heroin_.}}</b> </p>

<p> Check again, and this time talk to some of the people
actually involved, as we have done. </p>

<p> <b>{{ By and large, the Legalizers are disturbed, unhappy
people who have friends and loved ones who are in prison or
strung out. The aim of the Legalizers is simply to spread the
misery around as much as possible. The more druggies there are,
the more &quot;normal&quot; it is. The farther the web of
destruction spreads, the better. The more people they can ruin
and destroy, they happier they will be. The driving force behind
legalization is Revenge.}}</b> </p>

<p> Now we come down to the real driving force behind drug
prohibition -- bigotry and ignorance. Do you really think that it
is the desire of such organizations as the British Association of
Chiefs of Police? </p>

<p> <b>{{ To advocate legalizing narcotics isn't political
suicide (the surgeon general did it) . . . but it is incredibly
dumb.}}</b> </p>

<p> No she did not. I suppose then, that the British Association
of Chiefs of Police, the head of Interpol, and the Colombian
Attorney General, as well as the California Medical Association,
the California Society of Addiction Medicine, etc., etc., etc.,
etc., are incredibly dumb? (I could go on with a list of about 40
pages of such people, but why belabor the point?) </p>

<p> <b>{{ If I were strung out, it's entirely possible my own
family would turn me in. Lots of druggies get turned in by their
own families; it's the only way to ensure treatment.}}</b> </p>

<p> Judge Gray was on a radio show one night and one of the
callers was a heroin addict who wanted help to get off drugs. He
said he had called the police to ask for help but they just threw
him in jail when he was desperately ill (with things other than
drugs), he got a criminal conviction and no help at all. </p>

<p> The pity is that people who think they ought to throw people
in jail &quot;for their own good&quot; hardly ever get the same
favor granted to them. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Interesting study. The fact that everyone is doing
drugs has &quot;nothing to do with drug availability.&quot;
Presumably, then, they would do just as much if there were no
drugs to be found . . . clever.}}</b> </p>

<p> That is not going to happen, so why worry about it? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Even the most strung-out junkie still wants to get
high. They keep increasing their dosage, every chance they get.
Higher dosage -}more drug tolerance -} fewer highs -} higher
dosage. It's a vicious circle.}}</b> </p>

<p> So the solution is to throw millions of people in prison? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Heh, half of all drug arrests are for minors. How do
you propose to legalize drugs for adults and keep them away from
the kids?}}</b> </p>

<p> You admit it is not happening under the current system, so
what's the difference? You can't think of anyone who could
control the sales to children better than the current people who
sell drugs, right? </p>

<p> <b>{{ &quot;Worth more&quot; means more expensive. More
expensive means less demand . . . even if one assumes that people
in prison have just as to spend as those outside . . .}}</b> </p>

<p> More expensive means more profits -- enough to corrupt entire
law enforcement agencies, like the LA County Sheriffs who went to
prison. </p>

<p> <b>{{Perhaps you are correct in saying the vast majority
wouldn't become addicted. Perhaps. But then, I didn't like it
either, and I did become an addict. Was one for about 12 years.}}</b>
</p>

<p> It is as illegal as it can be and that didn't stop you, did
it? What makes you think it stops anyone else? Our policy, as it
is, does not seem to have benefited you. </p>

<p> Would your life have been improved if you had spent twenty
years in prison? By what you are recommending, you still probably
would not be out on the streets to engage in this conversation.
And, couldn't you still get your drugs if you decided you wanted
to? </p>

<p> <b>{{ I don't believe a non addict ever truly understands
what it is like.}}</b> </p>

<p> On the other hand, maybe it is the addict who does not
understand. In general, I don't believe that becoming an addict
gives anyone any great insights into national policy. That is
giving more credit to drugs than they deserve. </p>

<p> <b>{{ When you and Mona say that it isn't magical, you don't
know what you are talking about. When the first buzz of the drug
hits me, I become alive, and feel that I have become really
human. When straight, I do not have that feeling. }}</b> </p>

<p> That is not my experience with any of the drugs I have tried
and it is not the experience of the majority of people I know. If
you do not have the feeling of being human when you are straight
then it seems the problem is there whether you have the drug or
not. I (and most people I know) feel alive all the time so there
is not much need for drugs of any sort. </p>

<p> <b>{{ I continued using while convinced that I would die from
it. }}</b> </p>

<p> So prison, by comparison, would not do nearly as much to
dissuade you, would it? </p>

<p> <b>{{ However - I very rarely drove while high, because of
fear of getting caught. Addiction is _not_ logical. }}</b> </p>

<p> Another good reason why stiff penalties are unlikely to
dissuade addicts from using. Their behavior is not logical. </p>

<p> <b>{{ If it is legalized, there will be folks who will just
try it to see what it is like, and will never be straight again.
You do not account for those people. }}</b> </p>

<p> Yes I do. I don't like their behavior but I don't pretend
that putting them in prison is the proper approach to their
problem, either. </p>

<p> <b>{{Drugs _are_ magical to the addict. }}</b> </p>

<p> Lots of things are magical to the addict. The addicts I have
known used drugs of all types without regard for much of
anything. If they could not get heroin they would do other things
such as sniff gasoline, or inject coffee (quite a rush, they tell
me). That still does not mean that it is a good idea to throw
them in prison. </p>

<p> <b>{{}}As for inflicting pain, I must agree that is a noble
goal. </b> </p>

<p> <b>Sarcasm does not become you. If you never want to inflict
pain, then never raise a child. Never become a supervisor. Never
perform any function where you have the responsibility to modify
someone's behaviour. Pain, whether it be a swat on the butt, a
written reprimand, or a jail term, is an integral part of
behaviour modification.}} </b> </p>

<p> I don't believe in inflicting pain to the point where it
renders someone permanently unemployable and submits them to
things like gang rape, for trivial causes. Punishment, when used,
should be corrective, not destructive. </p>

<p> <b>{{I issue a mild protest over your figures on black male
drug use. You said 50% go to prison for drug abuse. Now you say
50% go to prison period, with drug use the single biggest cause.

}}</b> </p>

<p> No, you misinterpreted. I am very careful about what I say on
this subject, because I have been saying it for a long time to
lots of people. </p>

<p> <b>{{The two most dangerous? Do you think smoking a cigarette
is as dangerous as free basing cocaine? C'mon Cliff! Sure, a lot
more people die from tobacco, but that is because a whole lot
more people use that. Tobacco is legal and marketed. That is
something I want to avoid for cocaine.}}</b> </p>

<p> Compare the death rates. The death rate, per user, for
cocaine is less than that for tobacco. And, just for interest, I
quote from a study done in 1967 - &quot;Cigarette smoking is
unquestionably more damaging to the health than heroin.&quot; --
Drs. Vincent P. Dole and Marie Nyswander, Rockefeller Univ. </p>

<p> <b>{{What do you think about increasing educational efforts?
Teach school kids more about it. Pound home what it can do, and
what help is available. }}</b> </p>

<p> As all of the major studies have said, most of the
educational efforts have been based around ridiculous scare
tactics which the kids soon discovered were hokey and
disregarded. The main problem is a massive lack of accurate
information by the people teaching the courses. </p>

<p> <b>{{What about more money to help folks get straight? I
think it would be poetic to increase the taxes on tobacco and
alcohol to pay for this. }}</b> </p>

<p> A recent Rand study showed that every dollar spent on
treatment saved seven dollars in related social costs. How about
just increasing the taxes on alcohol and tobacco until they pay
their own costs? </p>

<p> <b>{{Judge Gray's idea is intriguing. If we were to go to
legalization, that would be a much better way to handle it then
just turning it over to the market. Of course, that would make
the government our pushers. Sounds a little scary. }}</b> </p>

<p> His basic thought is that drugs are here anyway, so we should
not kid ourselves that we are stopping them. The truth is that we
currentlyinflict smaller losses (percentage-wise) on the drug
dealers than K-Mart suffers from shoplifters. As you probably
know, shoplifters are not about to put K-Mart out of business.
Given the fact that they will be here forever, let's at least
guarantee that there are pure, reliable sources which will not
make the related problems worse, and which will provide a tax
basis for providing treatment. </p>

<p> Keep in mind that Judge Gray is a former prosecutor with
numerous drug convictions. He has also sentenced more than his
share of people to prison for drug offenses, and is not regarded
as lenient. </p>

<p> When he first came out for a change in policy a little over
two years ago, he was vilified by all kinds of people. He just
got back from the State Bar Convention and reported that the
atmosphere has changed completely. He says he is getting more and
more support from other judges and law enforcement officials.
They don't all agree on what would be a better response, but they
agree that our current policy is a failure and should be
abandoned. </p>

<p> <b>{{As to your repeated mentioning of the Netherlands and
Liverpool, I am reminded of another drug success story. According
to reports, we had found a way to successfully combat heroin
abuse. It was low cost, and supplied free to addicts. Am
referring to the methadone program. It took us a long time to
realize what a horrible waste it was. But all the reports were
glowing..... }}</b> </p>

<p> The medical authorities I have talked to, and the research I
have read (see the list) have indicated that the methadone
programs were a major improvement. Not perfect, but a major
improvement. Of the authorities I have talked to they have all
said that the biggest problems with the methadone program were
created by the government itself. First, they said, was a
consistent pattern of lies about the results. The European
authorities have reported the same thing about what the US
Government says about their programs. Second, there were
restrictions on methadone which, in effect, granted monopolies to
certain people and allowed them to abuse the situation. It would
be much better, they said, if addicts could go to their regular
doctors for prescriptions, like any other medication. </p>

<p> Also, many of them point to the methadone programs as proof
that the narcotics are not especially dangerous, because
methadone is prescribed routinely without any significant
overdose problem. </p>

<p> <b>{{Let us look at some of your stats. You say the death
rate for tobacco is 400,000. For alcohol it is 100,000. For
cocaine it is 2,500. You then answer my question by saying the
2,500 does not include pneumonia type deaths. What does it
include? No doubt (correct me if I am wrong) it is a count of
those who OD, and die. Probably from ER's. How many of the
400,000 tobacco deaths are based on that criteria? }}</b> </p>

<p> As I said, the AMA published figures on this subject, and
said that, using the same standards of classification for the
deaths, the comparable figure for illegal drugs is about 20,000,
to tobacco's 400,000+. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Only way to die of an OD of tobacco is to be in a
tobacco wharehouse as it burns down. So, using that criteria, the
death rate for tobacco is probably close to zero. }}</b> </p>

<p> Absolutely wrong. You must have missed the news shows that
reported on the problem of nicotine poisoning in people who work
in the fields and pick tobacco. There are far more people who
receive permanent nervous system damage (and even die) from that
than from most of the illegal drugs. Nicotine, you may have
forgotten, is an insecticide. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Now if we include lung cancer, etc, with the tobacco
deaths, we must also include pneumonia, suicides, traffic
accidents, dehydration, AIDS, etc, in the cocaine deaths.}}</b> </p>

<p> The AMA's figures included those causes. Tobacco still kills
at least 20 times as many people as the illegal drugs. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Many people become very aggresive on crack, and get in
fights - and get killed. That is a cocaine caused death.}}</b> </p>

<p> Wrong. A study done in NY during the height of the crack
epidemic showed that, of 414 homicides, only three could be
traced to the effects of cocaine in any form, and two of these
were victim- precipitated. For example, in one case the murder
victim tried to rape someone who was high on crack and got killed
in the process. The study showed the only drug with a real
connection to violence was alcohol. This was recently confirmed
by the DOJ report &quot;Psychoactive Substances and
Violence.&quot; </p>

<p> <b>{{ In the same way, how many alcohol deaths are caused by
OD? Maybe a few hundred?}}</b> </p>

<p> Wrong again. Alcohol overdose death is not at all uncommon,
especially on college campuses. Former HEW Secretary Joseph
Califano once estimated that about 40 percent of all hospital
care in the US is due to alcohol related conditions, including
overdoses. </p>

<p> <b>{{ It is not easy to OD on alcohol so badly you die. You
tend to pass out first.}}</b> </p>

<p> False. People are simply lucky if they pass out, but alcohol
overdose deaths are not at all uncommon. The main reason you
don't hear about them so much is because they are not news. </p>

<p> <b>{{ So your stats include liver disease, etc. I have met a
heroin addict, who was unconscious, half in a gutter, on a cold
night. If he had died of exposure, he should have been listed as
a heroin caused death. It, of course, wouldn't have been.}}</b> </p>

<p> So maybe we should adjust the death figures for heroin
downward. As I said, even if you assume that, for whatever
reason, the deaths from illegal drugs are grossly underestimated,
you still don't get anywhere near the deaths caused by alcohol
and tobacco. You should take a big clue from this. The reasons
for the drug laws never did have anything to do with the reasons
you are stating. When the laws were first passed, no medical
evidence was even presented to show that these drugs were harmful
and, in fact, the medical authorities in the US were opposed to
the laws. While we are on the subject of history, maybe you can
tell me why hemp was outlawed? </p>

<p> <b>{{Please see the above. Also, your figures are now
counting deaths only. Not fair for a discussion like this. How
many messed up lives do cocaine and heroin cause? If a man is
sent to prison, it does not kill him, it messes up his life. So -
lets compare like to like. }} </b> </p>

<p> So we take someone who already has a problem and mess up his
life some more? Interesting approach, but I fail to see how it
provides any benefit. </p>

<p> <b>{{You say there are approximately 1,000,000 people in
prison for drug abuse. That is 1,000,000 messed up lives.
According to your stats, that leaves 29,000,000 still abusing
drugs outside. That leaves 29,000,000 messed up lives. Now, to
save the 1,000,000 in prison, youwant to vastly increase the
29,000,000. }}</b> </p>

<p> The first point you should recognize from these stats is that
it is folly to believe that anything is under control right now.
So, basically, you are supporting a campaign that has no way to
achieve your stated goals, even if it was a good idea. The lives
messed up in prison are messed up permanently. Black men (by far
the majority of those prosecuted for drug offenses) are virtually
permanently unemployable once they have a prison record. They can
recover from a drug habit (and many do) but it is much more
difficult to recover from a stretch in prison. </p>

<p> And, as for the other 29,000,000, the vast majority of them
are not any more messed up than the average wine drinker. That
much is self-evident, or the problem would be far worse than it
is. </p>

<p> <b>{{Have you ever had a person you truly cared about who was
an addict? }}</b> </p>

<p> Sure, one of my aunts and a cousin I grew up with, among
others. I deplore their behavior and I wish they would stop but,
at the same time, I recognize that neither they nor society would
be better off if we spent a million dollars to put them in
prison. </p>

<p> <b>{{What do I think is a reasonable number of people to
imprison in order to stop drug abuse? Enough so that the overall
welfare of the country comes out ahead. }}</b> </p>

<p> I agree with that last part. So how many should we put in
prison to come out ahead? Just tell me what the number is so we
can make plans to build that many prison cells. </p>

<p> <b>{{ I think we are a long way from passing the point where
more people are messed up by the prison than by drug abuse. }}</b>
</p>

<p> How would you know if you admit you don't know the stats on
deaths or people in prison? </p>

<p> <b>{{How many additional deaths, resulting from the
legalization of drug use, would it take for you to cry &quot;Too
many!&quot; }}</b> </p>

<p> What evidence do you have to show that there would be
additional deaths? Other than your own opinion, that is. All the
evidence I have seen says that the death rate would probably go
down with a more intelligent policy. <br>

<h1>The Myth of Marijuana's Gateway Effect </h1>

<p><b>by John P. Morgan, M.D. and Lynn Zimmer, Ph.D.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>The Partnership for a Drug-Free America, in cooperation with
the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the White House
Office of Drug Control Policy, recently announced a new anti-drug
campaign that specifically targets marijuana. Instead of
featuring horror tales of marijuana-induced insanity, violence
and birth detects, this campaign is built upon the premise that
reducing marijuana use is a practical strategy for reducing the
use of more dangerous drugs. </p>

<p>The primary basis for this &quot;gateway hypothesis&quot; is a
recent report by the center on Addiction and Substance Abuse
(CASA), claiming that marijuana users are 85 times more likely
than non-marijuana users to try cocaine. This figure, using data
from NIDA's 1991 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, is
close to being meaningless. It was calculated by dividing the
proportion of marijuana users who have ever used cocaine (17%) by
the proportion of cocaine users who have never used marijuana
(.2%). The high risk-factor obtained is a product not of the fact
that so many marijuana users use cocaine but that so many cocaine
users used marijuana previously. </p>

<p>It is hardly a revelation that people who use one of the least
popular drugs are likely to use the more popular ones -- not only
marijuana, but also alcohol and tobacco cigarettes. The obvious
statistic not publicized by CASA is that most marijuana users --
83 percent -- never use cocaine. Indeed, for the nearly 70
million Americans who have tried marijuana, it is clearly a
&quot;terminus&quot; rather than a &quot;gateway&quot; drug. </p>

<p>During the last few years, after a decade of decline, there
has been a slight increase in marijuana use, particularly among
youth. In 1994, 38 percent of high school seniors reported having
ever tried the drug, compared to about 35 percent in 1993 and 33
percent in 1992. This increase does not constitute a crisis. No
one knows whether marijuana use-rates will continue to rise. But
even if they do, it will not necessarily lead to increased use of
cocaine. </p>

<p>Since the 1970s, when NIDA first began gathering data, rates
of marijuana and cocaine use have displayed divergent patterns.
Marijuana prevalence increased throughout the 1970s, peaking in
1979, when about 60 percent of high school seniors reported
having used it at least once. During the 1980s, cocaine use
increased while marijuana use was declining. Since 1991, when
data for the CASA analysis were gathered, marijuana use-rates
have increased while cocaine use-rates have remained fairly
steady. </p>

<p>The over-changing nature of the statistical relationship
between use-rate for marijuana and cocaine indicates the absence
of a causal link between the use of these two drugs. Therefore,
even if the proposed Partnership campaign were to be effective in
reducing marijuana use it would not guarantee a proportional
reduction in the number of people who use cocaine. To the extent
anti-drug campaigns are effective, they seem to be most effective
in deterring those people who would have been fairly low-level
users. There is no reason to believe that anti-marijuana messages
of any sort would deter many of those marijuana users --
currently 17 percent of the total -- who also develop an interest
in cocaine. </p>

<p>Nor is there reason to believe that the Partnership's new
campaign will actually reduce the overall number of marijuana
users. For a decade now, American youth have been subjected to an
unparalleled assault of anti-drug messages. They have seen
hundreds of Partnership advertisements, on television and in the
print media. They have been urged to &quot;just say no&quot; by
rock stars, sports heroes, presidents and first-ladies. They have
been exposed to anti-drug educational programs in the schools.
Yet this is the same generation of young people that recently
began increasing its use of marijuana. It seems unlikely that
many of them will be deterred by hyperbolic claims of marijuana's
gateway effect, particularly when it contradicts the reality of
drug use they see around them. </p>

<p>If the creators of American drug policy are truly interested
in reducing the risk of marijuana users using other drugs, they
should take a closer look at Holland, where drug policy since the
1970s has been guided by a commitment to diminishing any
potential gateway effect. Wanting to keep young marijuana users
away from cocaine and other &quot;hard drugs,&quot; the Dutch
decided to separate the retail markets by allowing anyone 18
years of age or older to purchase marijuana openly in
government-controlled &quot;coffee shops&quot; which strictly
prohibit the use and sale of other drugs. </p>

<p>Despite easy availability, marijuana prevalence among 12 to 18
year olds in Holland is only 13.6 percent -- well below the 38
percent use-rate for American high school seniors. More Dutch
teenagers use marijuana now than in the past; indeed, lifetime
prevalence increased nearly three-fold between 1984 and 1992,
from </p>

<p>4.8 to 13.6 percent. However, Dutch officials consider their
policy a success because the increase in marijuana use has not
been accompanied by an increase in the use of other drugs. For
the last decade, the rate of cocaine use among Dutch youth has
remained stable, with about .3 percent of 12-18 year olds
reporting having used it in the past month. </p>

<p>In the United States, the claim that marijuana acts as a
gateway to the use of other drugs serves mainly as a rhetorical
tool for frightening Americans into believing that winning the
war against heroin and cocaine requires waging &amp; battle
against the casual use of marijuana. Not only is the claim
intellectually indefensible, but the battle is wasteful of
resources and fated to failure. </p>

<h1>Arguments and Answers - Page 1 </h1>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> This is a collection of actual arguments and answers from a
long chain of debates on drug policy. Somewhere in this archive,
every argument you ever heard in favor of the drug war is
encountered and rebutted. If I missed any, please send them to me
by e-mail: schaffer@smartlink.net </p>

<p> My opponent's comments are in <b>boldface</b>. My comments
are in plain text. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> <b>{{1. &quot;....After adjusting for covariants, the
marijuana group showed small but statistically significant
increased risk for all three catagories of conditions
(Respiratory, accidental injury, and other).&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> Other, longer studies, such as the Jamaican studies have
shown no statistically significant differences between marijuana
smokers and non-smokers, even when the marijuana smokers had an
average daily dose about 28 times that consumed by the average US
user. Therefore, one study is not going to break the back of the
collected research on marijuana. </p>

<p> The collected summation of marijuana research is this:
&quot;Marijuana, in its natural form, is probably the safest
therapeutically active substance known to mankind. It is safer
than many of the foods we commonly eat.&quot; -- Francis Young,
Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, after two years of review of all of the evidence
presented by the DEA and by those asking for reform. That is the
same conclusion supported by every major study of drug policy. </p>

<p> <b>{{2. &quot;Respiratory deposition of tar and adsorption of
carbon monoxide in experimental subjects were four and five times
higher, respectively, after smoking marijuana than after smoking
tobacco.&quot;}} </b> </p>

<p> Assuming this is true, how does this prove that throwing
millions of people in prison is the best approach to the problem?
</p>

<p> <b>{{3. &quot;Marijuana has repeatedly been found to be the
second most common drug, after alcohol, present in the blood of
nonfatally and fatally injured persons.&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> There might be a good, logical reason for this. Marijuana is
detectable in the blood for up to two months after a person
smokes a joint, even though the high is long since gone. It may
simply be an indicator that far more people are smoking marijuana
than you thought. You also have to remember that common over the
counter drugs will make people test positive for marijuana. </p>

<p> You will note that they did not say &quot;drivers.&quot; It
is irrelevant what the passengers were using. </p>

<p> And, by this sort of reasoning, the penalties for alcohol
sale and possession ought to be even higher than the pot
penalties. Why aren't you fighting even harder for alcohol
Prohibition? </p>

<p> <b>{{4. &quot;Laboratory studies have shown decreased
driving-related skills after smoking marijuana.&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> Repeated real world experience has shown that marijuana is
not a major factor in traffic accidents. The reason is fairly
simple -- pot has a very mild effect on people and does not
destroy coordination the way alcohol does. The real problem here
is that the people who want to throw people in prison for drugs
do not actually know anything about the drug and its effects. </p>

<p> <b>{{5. &quot;In a Swedish study following a cohort of 45,540
male military conscripts for 15 years, heavier cannabis users had
a nearly three times greater risk of death than nonusers....and
had an elevated risk of schizophrenia compared with
nonusers.&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> A Johns Hopkins study, just as credible, showed that
marijuana smokers were more ambitious than their peers and
usually succeeded better than the rest. </p>

<p> The question here is &quot;Death from what?&quot; Their
cannabis users could have been concentrated in those areas with a
higher risk of death, in light of the fact that they engage in
somewhat more risk taking than their peers. Like, for instance,
our soldiers who smoked pot in Vietnam. </p>

<p> As for schizophrenia -- Did the pot cause the schizophrenia,
or would it be more likely that a person with severe mental
problems would try all sorts of self-medication to stop the
voices in their head? I have a relative with schizophrenia and I
can tell you what the answer is. </p>

<p> And, if the person is developing schizophrenia -- for any
reason -- how does it help the situation to throw them in jail? </p>

<p> <b>{{&quot; The insoluable particulate (tar) phase of the
smoke from marijuana contains about 50% of some carcinogenic aryl
hydrocarbons, including benz[a]anthracene, and benzo[a]pyrene
then the smoke from a comparable quantity of unfiltered Kentucky
reference tobacco.&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> So? Should the prison sentences for tobacco be 50% of those
for pot? Or should we also account for the fact that pot smokers
typically smoke far fewer cigarettes than a tobacco smoker? Just
how long should we put tobacco smokers in jail, anyway? </p>

<p> <b>{{&quot;The smoking of one marijuana cigarette - 800 to
900 mg, 1% to 3% delta-tetrahydrocannabinol - led to the
deposition in the lower respiratory tract of about a four-fold
greater quantity of insoluable particulates (tar) than smoking a
filtered tobacco cigarette of comparable weight...&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> See above. </p>

<p> <b>{{&quot;...the authors [Polen, et al, of the accompanying
article] are the first to use a systematic review of medical
records to assess the health consequences of marijuana...Their
finding that near-daily marijuana smoking is a significant
independent risk factor for the development of respiratory
illness, injuries, and other medical problems requiring medical
attention CHALLENGES THE VIEW THAT MARIJUANA POSES INSIGNIFICANT
HEALTH RISKS.&quot;</b> }} </p>

<p> It will have to do a lot of challenging, because there is
alot of evidence to challenge. Actually, this is more evidence
for a change in the law because every major study of drug policy
said that prohibition only INCREASED the dangers which were
already present in illegal drugs. The more dangerous you assume
them to be, the more important it becomes to treat them in a
non-criminal manner. </p>

<p> But, of course, that is not really the point, anyway. Let's
suppose that I totally believed everything you just said. Why do
you automatically assume that putting millions of people in
prison is the best approach to the problem? If it wasn't a good
idea for alcohol, and we can see that it would be a dumb idea for
tobacco, why do you suppose it is such a great idea for any other
chemical? </p>

<p> <b>{{So, it would appear the marijuana is more dangerous than
tobacco. Itwould also appear that, given the statistics
concerning fatal accidents, that marijuana use can be deadly.}}</b>
</p>

<p> So how many people are actually killed by all these drugs in
a typical year, anyway? </p>

<p> And, while you're at it, there are perhaps thirty million
people who are regular users of pot. How many millions of people
do you think we ought to throw in prison in order to control this
problem? </p>

<p> And why was the most common agricultural crop in America made
illegal in 1937 in the first place? Was it because of these
&quot;dangers&quot;, or was it for some entirely different
reason? How did the most common crop in America suddenly become a
dreaded menace to society? </p>

<p> <b>{{}}Netherlands has fewer addicts per capita than the US.
So does almost every country in the world. So what?}}</b> </p>

<p> Gee, that would seem to argue that our prohibition isn't so
effective, wouldn't it? And you said it was easy to control!!! </p>

<p> <b>{{ Germany recently decriminalized possession of small
amounts of marijuana, as have several states in the U.S. So
what?}}</b> </p>

<p> Maybe you could tell me why hemp (and the other drugs for
that matter) were made illegal in the first place. </p>

<p> <b>{{&quot;When a heroin addicts can get precise doses at
regular intervals, he can function pretty normally.&quot; They
don't want to get high?}}</b> </p>

<p> Ever heard of Dr. William Halsted? Or Senator Joseph
McCarthy? What do they have in common? </p>

<p> <b>{{ I went and looked it up. You need 100 grams of heroin
to get a 5-year sentence or a whole kilo to get a 10-year
sentence. For cocaine, the figures were 500 grams and 5 kilos.
That's a lot of dope.}}</b> </p>

<p> See the 7-8-93 op-ed piece by Federal Judge Weinstein in the
NY Times. He points out that it varies from one city to another.
In some major metropolitan areas, 100 pounds will not get you any
jail time, while in others, a marijuana seed might mean life in
prison. </p>

<p> <b>{{ If there is no evidence that punishment reduces crime,
we should shut down the prisons entirely.}}</b> </p>

<p> There are thirty million illegal drug users. Just tell me the
most reasonable number to put in prison. </p>

<p> <b>{{ You say that junkies don't do any harm, but would you
want to live next door to one?}}</b> </p>

<p> A better question is if you would want to have a drug addict
(William Bennett) as a drug czar? </p>

<p> <b>{{ I keep hearing this. No one provides any evidence. It
doesn't seem logical that people who have so much trouble
supporting a drug habit *outside* somehow acquire the necessary
income when you lock them up.}}</b> </p>

<p> Talk to someone who has been in prison. </p>

<p> {{ Then why lock up drunk drivers? Or any criminal?
Generally, we lock people up because they are a menace to
society. It is *always* possible to lose a potential
&quot;contributing member&quot; in this way, but generally we are
more interested in the rights of potential victims: Who could be
you, me, or anyone.}} </p>

<p> Anyone who commits an offense against another person should
be tried for the offense. What should be different is that a
person on cocaine who commits a crime should not get life in
prison while a drunk would plead diminished capacity for the same
crime. We should have consistent standards for all drugs and we
should apply our limited resources to the part of the problem
where it will do the most good. For example, we don't lock up
wine drinkers to try to control drunk driving. Generally, we do
lock people up because they are a menace to others. Of course,
that never was the reason for the drug laws. </p>

<p> You are far more likely to be the victim of something related
to alcohol and tobacco than from the effects of the illegal
drugs. </p>

<p> <b>{{ The properties of heroin and alcohol are very
different, and the social context is also different. For example,
most people can use alcohol in moderate amounts without ever
becoming addicted. Also, alcohol can be brewed up in any bathtub,
or derived from common products such as after-shave and
mouthwash, so the potential for controlling abuse is much less.}}</b>
</p>

<p> Yes, the properties are different. Alcohol is just as
addicting and far more damaging to the health. </p>

<p> Yes, the social context is different. The illegal drugs were
outlawed primarily because they were associated (wrongly) with
racial minorities, while alcohol and tobacco were perceived as
&quot;white&quot; drugs. </p>

<p> The evidence shows that most drug users of all types use in
moderation. This can be shown quite quickly by a simple
comparison between the total number of users and the number of
addicts. </p>

<p> The fact that alcohol can be brewed in a bathtub is hardly a
sensible argument for any kind of policy. It is equally
nonsensical for other drugs. Does that mean we should legalize
marijuana because people can grow it in their closet? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Since &quot;every major study&quot; agrees with you, it
follows that youagree with &quot;every major study,&quot; for
example:</b> </p>

<p> <b>* The President's Commission on Organized Crime (1986)</b>
</p>

<p> <b>* The National Report of the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(1992)</b> </p>

<p> <b>* The President's Commission on Model State Drug Laws
(1993)</b> </p>

<p> <b>So, can I quote these studies as authoritative, or have
you suddenly changed your mind?}}</b> </p>

<p> <b>The first study has little to do with drug policy and
cannot be considered any kind of a study of the drug policy
issue.</b> </p>

<p> <b>The second is a statistical report with no consideration
of the historical or medical aspects of the problem (or many
other aspects for that matter.)</b> </p>

<p> The third did not do any real research on drug policy. </p>

<p> But, since I so rarely run into anyone who tries naming
anything, I will give you credit. Let's assume, for the sake of
argument, that all three studies were about drug policy and right
on the money. The score is now 10 to 3 against you. When you get
a little closer I will name some more on my side. </p>

<p> <b>{{ I believe your chronology is wrong. I remember reading
a book on the subject (_Chasing the Dragon_, as I recall), which
was published around 1985. Unfortunately I don't have it to hand
. . . But, as I recall, Britain had legalized prescription
narcotics in the 60s, and they were still legal at the time the
book was published. The result was an explosive increase in drug
use, along with the accompanying things that drug abusers like to
do: abuse their spouses, neglect their children and live off the
public dole. I believe it was the Majors administration, sometime
around 1990, which flirted with stricter drug enforcement (still
not very tough by American standards). Is this that what you're
talking about?}}</b> </p>

<p> The correct chronology is given in the text of the 60 Minutes
show contained in Hoover.zip. In the 80s, under US pressure, the
British adopted a get-tough policy. It was a disaster, causing
both health problems and rising crime. In Liverpool at the
current time, they prescribe heroin and cocaine to addicts. Most
of the addicts are healthy, employed, and living with their
families. One of the conditions of their treatment is that they
must not commit crimes. It works. They originally did it because
of the AIDS infection rates, and the infection rate has dropped
to less than one percent of the addicts -- while in the US the
rate is over fifty percent. They also found that Liverpool, which
had become famous for crime, was suddenly peaceful again. It is
happening now and about a half dozen of my friends (including
doctors) are now in England discussing it with them. </p>

<p> <b>}}The Dutch, may not be alone for long. Many other
European countries are looking to decriminalization; many have
signed the Frankfort Accord agreeing that is the best approach. I
dunno about that,}}</b> </p>

<p> The following countries have already either legalized drugs
or taken steps toward legalization: The Netherlands, Germany,
Switzerland, England, Italy, Spain, and Colombia. </p>

<p> <b>}}But it indicates that Germany is moving in the direction
of common sense, while we are not. Yeah, they are liberalizing
hash and persecuting the hard drug users. That's the direction of
common sense.}}</b> </p>

<p> Why is it common sense to persecute anyone? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Still, when soldiers returned to the States, where
drugs were neither cheap nor easy to find, they gave up the
habit.}}</b> </p>

<p> The studies of the issue said that all of the soldiers
surveyed reported they could get heroin after they got back any
time they wanted it. The reason they quit was because they were
no longer under stress. </p>

<p> <b>{{ And we also lock up left-handed people . . . as I have
already pointed out. However, there are very few people in prison
simply for being junkies; most of them have committed other
offenses.}}</b> </p>

<p> Absolutely not true. There are considerable numbers. See the
testimony of the Corrections Commissioner of New York in
Hoover.zip. See also the op-ed piece by Federal Judge Jack B.
Weinstein in the 7-8- 93 New York Times. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Not at all. It is you have ignored my objection: The
argument that expensive to lock up junkies ignores the experience
with drunk driving. The fact is that severe penalties discourage
crime, and therefore reduce the number of people who need to be
locked up.}}</b> </p>

<p> There are thirty million illegal drug users in the US (give
or take). How many millions do you propose to lock up? </p>

<p> <b>{{ More deceptive figures. According to my 1993 World
Almanac, only 7% of prisoners serving terms of 1 year or more are
in federal prisons.}}</b> </p>

<p> What does that have to do with the price of eggs? </p>

<p> <b>}}How many people must we imprison, and at what cost,
before you think we will have solved the problem? --I dunno. }}</b>
</p>

<p> You hit the nail on the head that time. You obviously never
thought about it. That is the problem in a nutshell. As President
Nixon's commission said, the real drug problem is not marijuana,
heroin, or cocaine. The real drug problem is the ignorance of our
public officials who have never bothered to read the evidence. </p>

<p> <b>{{}}There are way more alcholics than there are heroin
addicts however, and the cost to society is astronomical. This
has much to do with the relative cheapness and availability of
alcohol. Do you really want to make narcotics equally cheap and
available?}}</b> </p>

<p> Narcotics are freely available at reasonable prices to anyone
who wants them. </p>

<p> <b>{{There are way more alcoholics than there are heroin
addicts however, and the cost to society is astronomical. Doesn't
that fact support continuing constraints against heroin, before
it can cause damage on an &quot;alcohol&quot; scale?}}</b> </p>

<p> No, not necessarily, but it does make me wonder why you
aren't campaigning even harder for alcohol prohibition. </p>

<p> <b>{{ }}Prohibition of alcohol did not work...{{{</b> </p>

<p> <b>Depends what you mean by &quot;work&quot;.}}</b> </p>

<p> I will accept the Wickersham Commission's definition. They
said it was a hopeless disaster in all respects. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Alcohol consumption absolutely, positively went down
during</b> </p>

<p> <b>prohibition.}}</b> </p>

<p> Absolutely false. The Wickersham Commission found that
alcohol use went down in the first year of Prohibition, but rose
every year thereafter, and that alcohol-related health problems
were much more severe. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Society, however, preferred its legal drug and repealed
prohibition.}}</b> </p>

<p> No, the Wickersham Commission, which was originally empowered
to find ways to improve Prohibition, concluded that it was
hopeless folly which did more harm than if we did nothing at all.
</p>

<p> <b>{{ It is also societies right to keep the lid on the
Pandora's Box of legalization of cocaine and heroin.}}</b> </p>

<p> So, how many millions of people should we put in prison for
drugs? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Clearly prohibition DID reduce consumption.}}</b> </p>

<p> That wasn't right the first time. It is equally wrong the
second. </p>

<p> <b>{{ In Malaysia, they are executed (at least the dealers
are).}}</b> </p>

<p> In Malaysia, the authorities kill more people for drugs than
the drugs do. And they still have a growing problem. </p>

<p> <b>{{ I wouldn't be so quick to discount the deterrent effect
of draconian measures.}}</b> </p>

<p> Neither would I. How many people do you think we ought to
execute to solve a problem that kills about 5,000 people a year? </p>

<p> <b>{{ I would personally love to see an intoxicant developed
that was safe, not physically addicting and doesnt make you (too)
stupid. (I'm dead serious). Marijuana is almost OK, but I truly
believe it makes one stupid (while under the influence) and a lot
of kids would have their intellectual growth stunted if it were
legalized.}}</b> </p>

<p> The Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, after hearing years of arguments on the subject,
concluded that &quot;marijuana, in its natural form, may be the
safest therapeutically active substance known to man&quot; and
that it is &quot;safer than many of the foods we commonly
eat.&quot; There is no evidence to support what you said about
intellectual growth. In fact, marijuana was a common food in the
19th century. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Alcohol does not directly involve the brain's internal
&quot;reward via euphoria&quot; mechanism, opiates do. They are
much more &quot;fun&quot; and way more addicting.}}</b> </p>

<p> Nope. See the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit
Drugs for a good discussion of the issue. </p>

<p> <b>{{ The Liverpudlian addicts had to first come to the
doctor for help, before being registered. Are you suggesting that
potential heroin users come to the doctor for &quot;controlled
medically supervised doses&quot; before starting the habit - or
do they come after realizing they may have a problem?}}</b> </p>

<p> They come after they realize they have a problem. But the
program has dried up the sellers on the street, and it has
greatly reduced the number one source of new addicts -- old
addicts looking for recruits to support their habit. As a result,
crime rates, health problems, and addiction have dropped
dramatically. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Is it possible that heroin, at cigarette prices, may
lead to a lot of folks to suffer severe vocational and
interpersonal damage, before finally presenting themselves for
&quot;Controlled, medically supervised doses&quot;? The
experience during Prohibition is instructive.}}</b> </p>

<p> Is it possible that tobacco addicts under the same conditions
would behave in the same manner as junkies? The experience in
Europe, after WWII, when tobacco was scarce is instructive. The
experience of Prohibition is instructive. It was a failure in all
respects. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Despite the obvious problems associated with
prohibition, the rates of cirrhosis of the liver and of wife
beating plummetted.}} </b> </p>

<p> Wrong. See the report of the Wickersham Commission. </p>

<p> <b>{{I agree that substance abuse is the trigger for much
crime, violent and non-violent. In those cases, if you can
eliminate the abuse, you probably have a much better chance of
the individual becoming a contributing member. }}</b> </p>

<p> The great majority of such crime is due to the effects of
prohibition, not the effects of the drugs. </p>

<p> <b>{{Instead of spending the money to maintain them in
prison, some sort of supervisd home confinement, coupled with
vocational training, counseling for the abuse, and routine drug
testing. Clean 'em up, train 'em, put 'em to work. That may sound
to simplistic, but what we're doing now isn't working, IMO. }}</b>
</p>

<p> The vast majority of drug users do not need treatment any
more than the vast majority of wine drinkers need treatment. For
the others, treatment is at least seven times as cost effective
as prison, with a far greater rate of success. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Alcohol is addicting to those predisposed.}}</b> </p>

<p> Correct. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Heroin is addicting (if used for non-analgesic
purposes) in everyone. Cocaine is the most addictive of all.}}</b>
</p>

<p> Wrong. See the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit
Drugs for a good discussion. Heroin addicts commonly report that
it is much harder to kick tobacco than to kick anything else. Or
see the recent <a href="../library/basicfax.htm">NIDA rankings</a>
of addictive qualities. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Increased drinking during prohibition!! No way, no
evidence, makes no sense. The logistics of obtaining, and the
black market price of alcohol during prohibition were HUGE
natural constraints on drinking for the vast majority. (ie. for
all but the speakeasy crowd).}}</b> </p>

<p> See the Wickersham Commission report, or any of the other
studies I have mentioned. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Be careful who you say things like &quot; the deceptive
thing about... liver disease are DEGENERATIVE diseases which take
a little while to develop&quot; to {g}. In 20 yrs as a general
internist, I've treated plenty of alcohol relatedliver disease.}}</b>
</p>

<p> If you are a doctor, let me ask you a question. My mother
suffers from severe chronic pain as the result of a nerve injury
during surgery. It is bad enough that it has driven her to the
point of seriously considering suicide. She has been to the Mayo
Clinic, the National Pain Institute, the USC Pain Clinic and a
long list of others. She has tried a long list of treatments. You
name your best list, she has tried it. The doctors, and her own
experience, tell her that the best treatment for her condition is
either morphine or heroin. The doctors will not prescribe it to
her because they are afraid of the DEA -- they have said so. The
Department of Health and Human Services has issued two reports
which have stated that the undertreatment of pain is a national
tragedy and that is caused by fear. The California Medical
Association recently encouraged doctors to prescribe more
narcotics and said that the reason they did not was because of
fear of the police. </p>

<p> I will not ask you if you would prescribe morphine for my
mother because I have asked every other doctor who has appeared
here and they all copped out. I expect you would too. Just tell
me: Who should determine the medicine my mother gets -- her and
her doctors -- or the police? </p>

<p> <b>{{ It is clear that when prohibition was repealed, liver
disease jumped up within the year, because of resumed drinking.}}</b>
</p>

<p> No, alcohol use continued the rise that it had already
started during Prohibition. And, even if this was true, are you
recommending that we bring back alcohol Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<p> <b>{{ I'm sorry, but the statement that heroin is harmless
flies in the face of long-agreed-on clinical experience.}}</b> </p>

<p> What does your clinical experience tell you about the effects
of prison? Is it beneficial or harmful to someone with a drug
problem? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Show me the references. I will be willing to bet
anything, that they are not the result of well designed trials}}</b>
</p>

<p> Read any of the studies that I posted. I would suggest that
you start with the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit
Drugs, so you would understand how we got into this situation. </p>

<p> By the way, did you know that the medical community
unanimously opposed these laws when they were proposed and said
they would be a medical, social, and criminal disaster? Did you
know that one of the first actions of the drug police was to jail
more than 3,000 doctors, especially those who advocated drug
treatment? </p>

<p> And, can you tell me why hemp is illegal? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Historically technical question. Shouldnt be too hard
to look up. I doubt very much that it was the OVERT crime issue.
Society was not much affected by bootleggers killing other
bootleggers.}}</b> </p>

<p> One of the major factors was a campaign to &quot;save the
children.&quot; You see, the bootleggers discovered that they
could escape harsh penalties by having kids do the dirty work,
and there was quite a bit of concern about that. Sound familiar? </p>

<p> <b>{{ However one related factor may well have been society
was very concerned about corruption in the police and judiciary.
It would have been scary, back then, to think this corruption was
about to become institutionalised.}}</b> </p>

<p> Prohibition gave us the institution of organized crime, which
is still with us 60 years later. </p>

<p> <b>{{ This doesnt seem to be much of a factor, however, in
our current &quot;prohibition&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> Where have you been? The entire narcotics squad of the LA
County Sheriff was sent to prison for corruption. The situation
is the same in New York and other major cities. I seriously doubt
if there is an honest drug enforcement agent living. I could go
on with stories of their corruption that would curl your hair. </p>

<p> <b>{{I don't like that picture very much at all.}}</b> </p>

<p> You painted a picture of what could happen. How about a
picture of what IS happening? According to the current rates of
incarceration, we will put more people in prison than Adolf
Hitler did, including about one-half of an entire generation of
black men. Do you want to continue with that? </p>

<p> <b>{{ No, only studies which are about legalizing drugs
conclude that it is important to legalize them.}}</b> </p>

<p> You obviously have not read them, have you? </p>

<p> <b>{{ &quot;Decriminalization&quot; is not the same as
&quot;legalization.&quot; The &quot;decriminalization&quot; of
small amounts of marijuana -- reducing possession to the status
of a traffic fine -- has already been tried in several states,
without stirring much controversy. This is a good deal different
from legalizing crack and heroin however. You really won't
impress anyone by trying to equate the two.}}</b> </p>

<p> The issue is not legalization or decriminalization (whatever
they may mean), because we don't know if we will do either, or
anything like them. The issue is prison, because that is what we

<p> The vast majority of drug users of all t ypes (except

the only two options. </p>

<p> The actual figures appear to be about the same as for the
white population. However, the drug laws were originally intended
to target minorities (look it up) and they target minorities
above all other groups today. For example, about 95 percent of
all the people sentenced under the mandatory minimums are black
men. Over time, because of the police pressure on drugs, and
because of the limited economic opportunities for black men, many
of them will turn to drug dealing as a way to make a living and
then, with the first stint in jail their future is formed. Black
men who have been to prison are virtually permanently
unemployable, so they return to the streets and act as bad role
models for the kids. </p>

prevalence, but neither would it alleviate the load on the
criminal justice system. A policy of reduced arrests at the
retail level probably would reduce the criminal justice load, but
would also lead to a relative increase in cocaine use and
addiction by a factor of two or three or more. A more sweeping
policy that eliminates both seizures and arrests would certainly
reduce the criminal justice load, but would lead to a relative
increase in cocaine use and addiction by a factor of four to
eight or more.&quot;}} </b> </p>

<p> So, under the worst circumstances they cite, there would be
perhaps 10,000 to 20,000 deaths per year from cocaine (4 to 8
times the current 2,500), compared to more than 400,000 for
tobacco, and more than 100,000 for alcohol. For heroin the
numbers would be similar, and for marijuana 4 to 8 times zero is
still zero. On the other hand, we would not have an expensive and
futile policy to put millions of people in prison. In fact, for
the same money that it took to put one person in prison we could
provide treatment for about one hundred. </p>

<p> Relative to your earlier statements on treatment, perhaps you
missed the recent study that said that treatment saves seven

ask them if they have used any illegal drugs (committed a felony)

<p> Wrong. I can cite a whole long list of internationally
recognized medical experts in the field who state that, except
for the fact that heroin produces addiction, otherwise it is
&quot;harmless&quot;. Their words, not mine. Can you tell me who
Dr. William Halsted is? </p>

<p> <b>{{* Heroin is incredibly dangerous. A dose that is normal
for one addict may kill another. Even a &quot;normal&quot; dose,

different environmental circumstances.}}</b> </p>

<p> See above about &quot;harmless.&quot; The doctors in
Liverpool state that they have patients on &quot;massive
doses&quot; with no risk of overdose. They say &quot;heroin is
not a dangerous drug&quot; and they prescribe it every day. The
number of people killed by heroin in the US runs about 2,000 a
year or about one half of one percent of the number killed by
tobacco. Aspirin also kills about 2,000 people a year. The
Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs investigated
the issue of heroin &quot;overdoses&quot; and did not find a
single instance which they believed could be attributed to a true
&quot;overdose&quot;. Nearly all of the &quot;overdoses&quot;,
they said, had symptoms which were fundamentally incompatible
with an overdose, such as instant death, or pulmonary edema. They
said their research showed that the most probable cause of these
deaths was the impurities mixed with the heroin, not the her oin
itself. As the doctors in England put it, if an addict is buying
heroin on the black market which is 10 percent heroin and 90
percent cement, it does not take a genius to figure out what is
going to cause the most problems. </p>

<p> The low number of deaths from heroin is all the more
remarkable because it is usually taken in the most dangerous
manner possible. </p>

<p> <b>{{* Tolerance for heroin declines rapidly after

Francisco have decided to openly violate state drug laws (at the

consistent for a long time show the following approximate annual
death rate: </p>

<p> Aspirin -- 2,000 </p>

<p> Heroin - 2,000 </p>

<p> Marijuana - No recorded deaths in human history. </p>

<p> The above figures do not include pneumonia type deaths. The
AMA published figures recently which stated that the total of all
such deaths for illegal drugs was about 20,000, still only a
small fraction of the damage caused by alcohol and tobacco. As I
have pointed out in other messages, there is a good deal of

according to _Living With Heroin_.}}</b> </p>

<p> Check again, and this time talk to some of the people
actually involved, as we have done. </p>

<p> <b>{{ By and large, the Legalizers are disturbed, unhappy
people who have friends and loved ones who are in prison or
strung out. The aim of the Legalizers is simply to spread the
misery around as much as possible. The more druggies there are,
the more &quot;normal&quot; it is. The farther the web of
destruction spreads, the better. The more people they can ruin
and destroy, they happier they will be. The driving force behind
legalization is Revenge.}}</b> </p>

<p> Now we come down to the real driving force behind drug
prohibition -- bigotry and ignorance. Do you really think that it
is the desire of such organizations as the British Association of
Chiefs of Police? </p>

<p> <b>{{ To advocate legalizing narcotics isn't political
suicide (the surgeon general did it) . . . but it is incredibly
dumb.}}</b> </p>

<p> No she did not. I suppose then, that the British Association
of Chiefs of Police, the head of Interpol, and the Colombian
Attorney General, as well as the California Medical Association,
the California Society of Addiction Medicine, etc., etc., etc.,
etc., are incredibly dumb? (I could go on with a list of about 40
pages of such people, but why belabor the point?) </p>

<p> <b>{{ If I were strung out, it's entirely possible my own
family would turn me in. Lots of druggies get turned in by their
own families; it's the only way to ensure treatment.}}</b> </p>

<p> Judge Gray was on a radio show one night and one of the
callers was a heroin addict who wanted help to get off drugs. He
said he had called the police to ask for help but they just threw
him in jail when he was desperately ill (with things other than
drugs), he got a criminal conviction and no help at all. </p>

<p> The pity is that people who think they ought to throw people
in jail &quot;for their own good&quot; hardly ever get the same
favor granted to them. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Interesting study. The fact that everyone is doing
drugs has &quot;nothing to do with drug availability.&quot;
Presumably, then, they would do just as much if there were no
drugs to be found . . . clever.}}</b> </p>

<p> That is not going to happen, so why worry about it? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Even the most strung-out junkie still wants to get
high. They keep increasing their dosage, every chance they get.
Higher dosage -}more drug tolerance -} fewer highs -} higher
dosage. It's a vicious circle.}}</b> </p>

<p> So the solution is to throw millions of people in prison? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Heh, half of all drug arrests are for minors. How do
you propose to legalize drugs for adults and keep them away from
the kids?}}</b> </p>

<p> You admit it is not happening under the current system, so
what's the difference? You can't think of anyone who could
control the sales to children better than the current people who
sell drugs, right? </p>

<p> <b>{{ &quot;Worth more&quot; means more expensive. More
expensive means less demand . . . even if one assumes that people
in prison have just as to spend as those outside . . .}}</b> </p>

<p> More expensive means more profits -- enough to corrupt entire
law enforcement agencies, like the LA County Sheriffs who went to
prison. </p>

<p> <b>{{Perhaps you are correct in saying the vast majority
wouldn't become addicted. Perhaps. But then, I didn't like it
either, and I did become an addict. Was one for about 12 years.}}</b>
</p>

<p> It is as illegal as it can be and that didn't stop you, did
it? What makes you think it stops anyone else? Our policy, as it
is, does not seem to have benefited you. </p>

<p> Would your life have been improved if you had spent twenty
years in prison? By what you are recommending, you still probably
would not be out on the streets to engage in this conversation.
And, couldn't you still get your drugs if you decided you wanted
to? </p>

<p> <b>{{ I don't believe a non addict ever truly understands
what it is like.}}</b> </p>

<p> On the other hand, maybe it is the addict who does not
understand. In general, I don't believe that becoming an addict
gives anyone any great insights into national policy. That is
giving more credit to drugs than they deserve. </p>

<p> <b>{{ When you and Mona say that it isn't magical, you don't
know what you are talking about. When the first buzz of the drug
hits me, I become alive, and feel that I have become really
human. When straight, I do not have that feeling. }}</b> </p>

<p> That is not my experience with any of the drugs I have tried
and it is not the experience of the majority of people I know. If
you do not have the feeling of being human when you are straight
then it seems the problem is there whether you have the drug or
not. I (and most people I know) feel alive all the time so there
is not much need for drugs of any sort. </p>

<p> <b>{{ I continued using while convinced that I would die from
it. }}</b> </p>

<p> So prison, by comparison, would not do nearly as much to
dissuade you, would it? </p>

<p> <b>{{ However - I very rarely drove while high, because of
fear of getting caught. Addiction is _not_ logical. }}</b> </p>

<p> Another good reason why stiff penalties are unlikely to
dissuade addicts from using. Their behavior is not logical. </p>

<p> <b>{{ If it is legalized, there will be folks who will just
try it to see what it is like, and will never be straight again.
You do not account for those people. }}</b> </p>

<p> Yes I do. I don't like their behavior but I don't pretend
that putting them in prison is the proper approach to their
problem, either. </p>

<p> <b>{{Drugs _are_ magical to the addict. }}</b> </p>

<p> Lots of things are magical to the addict. The addicts I have
known used drugs of all types without regard for much of
anything. If they could not get heroin they would do other things
such as sniff gasoline, or inject coffee (quite a rush, they tell
me). That still does not mean that it is a good idea to throw
them in prison. </p>

<p> <b>{{}}As for inflicting pain, I must agree that is a noble
goal. </b> </p>

<p> <b>Sarcasm does not become you. If you never want to inflict
pain, then never raise a child. Never become a supervisor. Never
perform any function where you have the responsibility to modify
someone's behaviour. Pain, whether it be a swat on the butt, a
written reprimand, or a jail term, is an integral part of
behaviour modification.}} </b> </p>

<p> I don't believe in inflicting pain to the point where it
renders someone permanently unemployable and submits them to
things like gang rape, for trivial causes. Punishment, when used,
should be corrective, not destructive. </p>

<p> <b>{{I issue a mild protest over your figures on black male
drug use. You said 50% go to prison for drug abuse. Now you say
50% go to prison period, with drug use the single biggest cause.
But it is not a big point - I was just very shocked at your stat.
}}</b> </p>

<p> No, you misinterpreted. I am very careful about what I say on
this subject, because I have been saying it for a long time to
lots of people. </p>

<p> <b>{{The two most dangerous? Do you think smoking a cigarette
is as dangerous as free basing cocaine? C'mon Cliff! Sure, a lot
more people die from tobacco, but that is because a whole lot
more people use that. Tobacco is legal and marketed. That is
something I want to avoid for cocaine.}}</b> </p>

<p> Compare the death rates. The death rate, per user, for
cocaine is less than that for tobacco. And, just for interest, I
quote from a study done in 1967 - &quot;Cigarette smoking is
unquestionably more damaging to the health than heroin.&quot; --
Drs. Vincent P. Dole and Marie Nyswander, Rockefeller Univ. </p>

<p> <b>{{What do you think about increasing educational efforts?
Teach school kids more about it. Pound home what it can do, and
what help is available. }}</b> </p>

<p> As all of the major studies have said, most of the
educational efforts have been based around ridiculous scare
tactics which the kids soon discovered were hokey and
disregarded. The main problem is a massive lack of accurate
information by the people teaching the courses. </p>

<p> <b>{{What about more money to help folks get straight? I
think it would be poetic to increase the taxes on tobacco and
alcohol to pay for this. }}</b> </p>

<p> A recent Rand study showed that every dollar spent on
treatment saved seven dollars in related social costs. How about
just increasing the taxes on alcohol and tobacco until they pay
their own costs? </p>

<p> <b>{{Judge Gray's idea is intriguing. If we were to go to
legalization, that would be a much better way to handle it then
just turning it over to the market. Of course, that would make
the government our pushers. Sounds a little scary. }}</b> </p>

<p> His basic thought is that drugs are here anyway, so we should
not kid ourselves that we are stopping them. The truth is that we
currentlyinflict smaller losses (percentage-wise) on the drug
dealers than K-Mart suffers from shoplifters. As you probably
know, shoplifters are not about to put K-Mart out of business.
Given the fact that they will be here forever, let's at least
guarantee that there are pure, reliable sources which will not
make the related problems worse, and which will provide a tax
basis for providing treatment. </p>

<p> Keep in mind that Judge Gray is a former prosecutor with
numerous drug convictions. He has also sentenced more than his
share of people to prison for drug offenses, and is not regarded
as lenient. </p>

<p> When he first came out for a change in policy a little over
two years ago, he was vilified by all kinds of people. He just
got back from the State Bar Convention and reported that the
atmosphere has changed completely. He says he is getting more and
more support from other judges and law enforcement officials.
They don't all agree on what would be a better response, but they
agree that our current policy is a failure and should be
abandoned. </p>

<p> <b>{{As to your repeated mentioning of the Netherlands and
Liverpool, I am reminded of another drug success story. According
to reports, we had found a way to successfully combat heroin
abuse. It was low cost, and supplied free to addicts. Am
referring to the methadone program. It took us a long time to
realize what a horrible waste it was. But all the reports were
glowing..... }}</b> </p>

<p> The medical authorities I have talked to, and the research I
have read (see the list) have indicated that the methadone
programs were a major improvement. Not perfect, but a major
improvement. Of the authorities I have talked to they have all
said that the biggest problems with the methadone program were
created by the government itself. First, they said, was a
consistent pattern of lies about the results. The European
authorities have reported the same thing about what the US
Government says about their programs. Second, there were
restrictions on methadone which, in effect, granted monopolies to
certain people and allowed them to abuse the situation. It would
be much better, they said, if addicts could go to their regular
doctors for prescriptions, like any other medication. </p>

<p> Also, many of them point to the methadone programs as proof
that the narcotics are not especially dangerous, because
methadone is prescribed routinely without any significant
overdose problem. </p>

<p> <b>{{Let us look at some of your stats. You say the death
rate for tobacco is 400,000. For alcohol it is 100,000. For
cocaine it is 2,500. You then answer my question by saying the
2,500 does not include pneumonia type deaths. What does it
include? No doubt (correct me if I am wrong) it is a count of
those who OD, and die. Probably from ER's. How many of the
400,000 tobacco deaths are based on that criteria? }}</b> </p>

<p> As I said, the AMA published figures on this subject, and
said that, using the same standards of classification for the
deaths, the comparable figure for illegal drugs is about 20,000,
to tobacco's 400,000+. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Only way to die of an OD of tobacco is to be in a
tobacco wharehouse as it burns down. So, using that criteria, the
death rate for tobacco is probably close to zero. }}</b> </p>

<p> Absolutely wrong. You must have missed the news shows that
reported on the problem of nicotine poisoning in people who work
in the fields and pick tobacco. There are far more people who
receive permanent nervous system damage (and even die) from that
than from most of the illegal drugs. Nicotine, you may have
forgotten, is an insecticide. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Now if we include lung cancer, etc, with the tobacco
deaths, we must also include pneumonia, suicides, traffic
accidents, dehydration, AIDS, etc, in the cocaine deaths.}}</b> </p>

<p> The AMA's figures included those causes. Tobacco still kills
at least 20 times as many people as the illegal drugs. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Many people become very aggresive on crack, and get in
fights - and get killed. That is a cocaine caused death.}}</b> </p>

<p> Wrong. A study done in NY during the height of the crack
epidemic showed that, of 414 homicides, only three could be
traced to the effects of cocaine in any form, and two of these
were victim- precipitated. For example, in one case the murder
victim tried to rape someone who was high on crack and got killed
in the process. The study showed the only drug with a real
connection to violence was alcohol. This was recently confirmed
by the DOJ report &quot;Psychoactive Substances and
Violence.&quot; </p>

<p> <b>{{ In the same way, how many alcohol deaths are caused by
OD? Maybe a few hundred?}}</b> </p>

<p> Wrong again. Alcohol overdose death is not at all uncommon,
especially on college campuses. Former HEW Secretary Joseph
Califano once estimated that about 40 percent of all hospital
care in the US is due to alcohol related conditions, including
overdoses. </p>

<p> <b>{{ It is not easy to OD on alcohol so badly you die. You
tend to pass out first.}}</b> </p>

<p> False. People are simply lucky if they pass out, but alcohol
overdose deaths are not at all uncommon. The main reason you
don't hear about them so much is because they are not news. </p>

<p> <b>{{ So your stats include liver disease, etc. I have met a
heroin addict, who was unconscious, half in a gutter, on a cold
night. If he had died of exposure, he should have been listed as
a heroin caused death. It, of course, wouldn't have been.}}</b> </p>

<p> So maybe we should adjust the death figures for heroin
downward. As I said, even if you assume that, for whatever
reason, the deaths from illegal drugs are grossly underestimated,
you still don't get anywhere near the deaths caused by alcohol
and tobacco. You should take a big clue from this. The reasons
for the drug laws never did have anything to do with the reasons
you are stating. When the laws were first passed, no medical
evidence was even presented to show that these drugs were harmful
and, in fact, the medical authorities in the US were opposed to
the laws. While we are on the subject of history, maybe you can
tell me why hemp was outlawed? </p>

<p> <b>{{Please see the above. Also, your figures are now
counting deaths only. Not fair for a discussion like this. How
many messed up lives do cocaine and heroin cause? If a man is
sent to prison, it does not kill him, it messes up his life. So -
lets compare like to like. }} </b> </p>

<p> So we take someone who already has a problem and mess up his
life some more? Interesting approach, but I fail to see how it
provides any benefit. </p>

<p> <b>{{You say there are approximately 1,000,000 people in
prison for drug abuse. That is 1,000,000 messed up lives.
According to your stats, that leaves 29,000,000 still abusing
drugs outside. That leaves 29,000,000 messed up lives. Now, to
save the 1,000,000 in prison, youwant to vastly increase the
29,000,000. }}</b> </p>

<p> The first point you should recognize from these stats is that
it is folly to believe that anything is under control right now.
So, basically, you are supporting a campaign that has no way to
achieve your stated goals, even if it was a good idea. The lives
messed up in prison are messed up permanently. Black men (by far
the majority of those prosecuted for drug offenses) are virtually
permanently unemployable once they have a prison record. They can
recover from a drug habit (and many do) but it is much more
difficult to recover from a stretch in prison. </p>

<p> And, as for the other 29,000,000, the vast majority of them
are not any more messed up than the average wine drinker. That
much is self-evident, or the problem would be far worse than it
is. </p>

<p> <b>{{Have you ever had a person you truly cared about who was
an addict? }}</b> </p>

<p> Sure, one of my aunts and a cousin I grew up with, among
others. I deplore their behavior and I wish they would stop but,
at the same time, I recognize that neither they nor society would
be better off if we spent a million dollars to put them in
prison. </p>

<p> <b>{{What do I think is a reasonable number of people to
imprison in order to stop drug abuse? Enough so that the overall
welfare of the country comes out ahead. }}</b> </p>

<p> I agree with that last part. So how many should we put in
prison to come out ahead? Just tell me what the number is so we
can make plans to build that many prison cells. </p>

<p> <b>{{ I think we are a long way from passing the point where
more people are messed up by the prison than by drug abuse. }}</b>
</p>

<p> How would you know if you admit you don't know the stats on
deaths or people in prison? </p>

<p> <b>{{How many additional deaths, resulting from the
legalization of drug use, would it take for you to cry &quot;Too
many!&quot; }}</b> </p>

<p> What evidence do you have to show that there would be
additional deaths? Other than your own opinion, that is. All the
evidence I have seen says that the death rate would probably go
down with a more intelligent policy. <br>

<h1>EVIDENCE FOUND OF ANCIENT MARIJUANA USE </h1>

<p>Albany (NY) Times Union, 20 May 1993 </p>

<p>(attributed to Newsday) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>The first physical evidence that marijuana was used as a
medicine in the ancient Mideast was reported Wednesday by Israeli
scientists who found residue of the drug with the skeleton of a
girl who apparently died in childbirth 1,600 years ago. </p>

<p>The researchers said the marijuana probably was used by a
mid-wife trying to speed the birth, as well as ease the pain.
Until now, the researchers wrote in a letter to the journal
Nature, &quot;physical evidence of cannabis (marijuana) use in
the ancient Middle East has not yet been obtained.&quot; </p>

<p>The seven researchers -- from Hebrew University, the Israel
Antiquities Authority and the National Police Headquarters
forensic division -- said references to marijuana as a medicine
are seen as far back as 1,600 B.C. in Egyptian, Assyrian, Greek
and Roman writings. But physical evidence that the hemp weed,
cannabis sativa, was used for that purpose has been missing. </p>

<p>The researchers' examination of an undisturbed family tomb
near Jerusalem dating to the fourth century AD indicated the
girl, about 14, died because her pelvis was too small to permit
normal birth. <br>

<h2>25 More pages of the Drug Legalization Debate </h2>

<p> by Clifford A. Schaffer </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> <b>But there is a more pressing argument. I know human nature
to at least some degree. People do things for many reasons, but
primarily because they get more pleasure than pain from the
thing. Your argument is that if you remove a whole lot of the
pain from drug use, that people will not use drugs more. Are you
therefore saying that making heroin illegal causes people to want
to use it more? Why? Do people enjoy paying fines? Do they like
prison?</b> </p>

<p> <b>Please provide me with some sensible reasons why you
believe people would not use drugs more, or would use them less,
if drugs were legal.</b> </p>

<p> The basic reason is the same simple reason that most people
do not spend their days staggering around on booze. I tried it
and realized that I enjoyed being sober a whole lot more. The
vast majority of the people are the same way. As I said before,
there is nothing magical about these drugs which causes them to
be hypnotically attractive. As a matter of fact, I don't think I
would like them much myself because one of the most common
effects is to make users puke. Maybe it is hard for other people
to understand, but I don't think that puking is much fun. </p>

<p> As for inflicting pain, I must agree that is a noble goal.
Take a group of people who are not well off anyway and make it
our goal to inflict as much pain on them as we can. </p>

<p> Let's consider a certain little statistical fact. The number
of people in prison is currently only a small fraction of the
total number of users. Therefore, the current system cannot
inflict pain on more than a small number of the users and must be
seen as quite ineffective in your stated goal. Without
considering the fact that our prisons are currently overloaded,
just tell me how many more millions of people we should put in
prison to inflict the proper amount of pain. </p>

<p> <b>Please also confirm your quote to me on the percentage of
black men going to prison on drug charges. You said it was 50%.
Is that accurate? If so, what percentage of black men, in total,
abuse drugs? If 50% go to prison, total use must approach 100%.
If not, what is the figure? (I guess this has one point in your
favor. If 100% of black males now are drug abusers, legalizing
drugs would not cause the percentage to go up.) </b> </p>

<p> About half of all black men in America will be incarcerated
at least once by the time they are thirty. The source of this is
information extrapolated from the DOJ report The Prevalence of
Imprisonment, and studies by the Sentencing Project that show
that about one-fourth of the black men under 30 are _currently_
in prison, on probation, or parole. Drug offenses will be the
single biggest cause for this. The figures on drug use through
the population are about the same for whites as it is for blacks.
The disproportionately high percentage of blacks arrested can be
accounted for by a number of factors. The first is that these
laws originally were intended to target minorities and the
tactics used to enforce them tend to target minorities over
whites. For example, it is easier to pick up twenty street
dealers in a minority community than it is to get the same number
by busting middle class white houses. Also, the drug business
provides a unique opportunity for young black men. These and
other factors create a situation where, in certain inner city
neighborhoods, ninety percent of the black men have already been
to prison at least once. Also, black men are more likely to be
convicted because of poor legal representation, and more likely
to be sentenced to prison when they are convicted. </p>

<p> <b>Okay!! Finally. What other options do you have in mind?
This has the possibility of being a very productive thread. No
snide insults or sarcasm. What other options are there? </b> </p>

<p> There are quite a few. The first point that I would make is
that we should have a consistent philosophy and approach to all
recreational drugs. That is, if you would not think it good for
7-11 clerks to sell cocaine to children, then we should be
equally tough about tobacco. At the same time, if you recognize
that throwing tobacco smokers in prison would be
counterproductive, then it stands to reason that it would be
counterproductive for other drugs. Figure out what would be a
good policy for the two most dangerous drugs -- alcohol and
tobacco -- and it will be easy to figure out what should be done
about the others. </p>

<p> Judge Gray has called for &quot;regulated distribution&quot;.
His idea is that drugs would be available at government regulated
stores of some sort at prices that would be low enough to
discourage the black market. Advertising would be prohibited
under his idea and all drugs would be sold in plain wrappers with
warning information and, most importantly, a number to call to
get help. </p>

<p> The Netherlands has taken a different approach. They still
have drug laws but make it a point not to enforce them except in
cases where there are bad drugs, or people are making themselves
obnoxious. Their primary purpose is to reduce the harm done by
drugs and part of their plan is to get people to come in for
treatment. </p>

<p> In Liverpool, they are prescribing heroin and cocaine to
addicts as part of the public health service. Part of the price
of getting the prescription is that addicts must agree to stop
committing crimes and to get their lives together. </p>

<p> With some drugs, such as marijuana, it is doubtful whether
any sort of regulation is even desireable. The Dutch ignore it to
the point of allowing it to be sold openly in coffee shops and it
does not seem to cause any problems. </p>

<p> <b>Now there are burglars in my neighborhood. Some of them do
the same crime for years - and will keep on doing it for more.
Is, therefore, the threat of prison not relevant? Should we
remove that threat? Should we legalize buglary, because prison
only makes it worse? I don't think so. You have indicated that
legalizing hard drugs would lower the rate of drug abuse. Perhaps
you also believe legalizing burglary would lower that crime. I
disagree on both counts. The threat of prison is a deterrent to
potential burglars, robbers, murderers, etc. I believe it is also
a deterrent to potential drug abusers. Once addiction has been
reached, that threat is less powerful. But that does not mean we
remove it. </b> </p>

<p> I get this tired, irrelevant argument a lot. First, burglary
is not the same as drug use so comparisons of the legal methods
for controlling them are silly. Second, if we had thirty million
burglars (or criminals of any kind) we would have to find another
method of dealing with the problem just because the criminal
justice system could not handle the load. In this case it doesn't
matter what you want to do, it is a matter of what you can do. </p>

<p> <b>You also indicated that I should be imprisoned as a drug
addict. I assume you are being sarcastic again. (Which, BTW, is
rude.) Since I have now been sober for 13 years, and 15 days,
prison is not called for. However, remember that drugs took 12
years of my life. If I had been jailed in year two or three, and
that huge shock had persuaded me to stay sober, I would have
gained 9-10 years of a productive life back. I, in retrospect,
really wish that had happened. I miss those 12 years a lot. </b> </p>

<p> No, I was not being sarcastic, I was simply following the
logical conclusion of what you said. I would point out that,
under the current laws you might have done a lot more than a
couple of years in jail. And, when you got out, you would be
virtually unemployable (at anything decent, anyway) which would
have severely impacted your attempts at recovery. </p>

<p> <b>You again brought up several times that legalizing drugs
(which you oppose) in other countries lowered the rate of drug
abuse. Because of my knowledge of the way people act, I find that
either I do not understand what you mean, or your stats are
simply wrong. As I said above, if you made burglary legal, would
there be fewer of them? If you sold hamburgers for 10cents, would
we buy fewer? I just find the idea that making hard drugs
controlled, legal, and cheap would result in less use of them. </b>
</p>

<p> My point again that you are not acquainted with all of the
facts on this issue. It is happening in Europe. As one Dutch
official put it, junkies are their own worst advertisement and
they really don't need much in the way of education to persuade
people that drug addiction is something they want to avoid. </p>

<p> As I said before, I recommend that you read the CU Report,
and see the A&amp;E special which recently aired on this subject.
</p>

<p> <b>You asked about your mother being unable to get the drugs
she needs. I do not know the situation at all. I believe that any
drug that would help your mother should be available to her,
including marijuana and heroin. Of course, that is not the point
here.</b> </p>

<p> Then you do not understand a whole lot about the drug war.
The repression of medical use and research into these drugs was
an integral part of the whole campaign from the very beginning.
When the laws were first passed the drug police jailed more than
3,000 doctors, specifically aiming at those who were treating
addicts, and those who voiced disagreement with the policy. They
effectively shut down all research into the medical uses and even
research into the causes and cures for drug addiction for over
fifty years (and it is still difficult to do honest drug research
in this country). It was a deliberate, calculated reign of terror
against the medical profession which is still intact today. </p>

<p> If you will research this a little you will discover why this
reign of terror exists. That is, if these drugs are under the
province of the medical profession where they really belong, then
the whole drug prohbition will fall apart quite rapidly. </p>

<p> As I said before, your assumptions about why these laws are
here are totally wrong. The reasons you have stated never did
have anything to do with the laws. </p>

<p> <b>We have discussed this. You play with stats to advance
your point, regardless of the intellectual integrity. </b> </p>

<p> You have not presented any stats in contrast to mine, so I
wonder how you can say this. </p>

<p> <b>You also said that eight times the number that die from OD
on drugs, die from that drug use for other reasons - pneumonia,
for example. You ignored my point that many deaths would not be
attributed to drug use because there was something else handy,
such as exposure, or AIDS.</b> </p>

<p> No I didn't. I quoted the AMA figures on the subject. You
have cited nothing but your own opinion in response. </p>

<p> <b>You have again cooked your figures. Lets say a policeman
pulls over the car of a junkie tonight for erratic driving. A
search shows five rocks in his pocket. He is arrested. Knowing he
is busted, he pleads guilty. According to your figures, that cost
$150,000. Balderdash. </b> </p>

<p> Aren't we deliberately missing some points here? For every
one which does what you suggested (and there are fewer of them as
the penalties go up) there are others who fight it all the way.
The AVERAGE cost is what is being cited. </p>

<p> <b>They then build a cell - especially for him. They can't
use the one that some burglar is now leaving. </b> </p>

<p> Well, yes they could. That is what is happening now --
violent offenders are being released early so we can throw more
drug users in prison. That doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?
Therefore, in order for the law not to cause more harm than good
(by releasing another offender early) we have to build a new
prison cell. </p>

<p> <b>No - that would mean you had to prorate the cost of the
cell by everyone who uses it. Would be an honest way, but would
not boost your cause. Balderdash again. </b> </p>

<p> By what you are saying, the total number of people sent to
prison would not increase beyond what it is today -- therefore no
beneficial effect from tougher penalties. </p>

<p> <b>An official in Oakland who desperatly wanted to show how
much money was being saved by his drug program as opposed to
prison, put the cost of prison at $20,000 per year. You say
$30,000. Balderdash. </b> </p>

<p> No, the figures I used come from the Wall Street Journal and
the DOJ. The figures vary somewhat from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction, and according to the type of prison but they are
all in the same range. You can get the most current figures
yourself by calling the National Clearinghouse and Data Center
for Drugs and Crime. </p>

<p> <b>In Phoenix they put folks in tents!! Its warm, and they
have many cots like in the army, but it is cheap. And a good
deterrent. Folks don't like it. So my guess for my addict above
is about $2,000 to arrest and and convict, $1,500 for the
prorated cost of the cell, and $10,000 for the six months he
would actually serve. Comes to $13,500, as opposed to your
$450,000. </b> </p>

<p> But, of course, your guess is not any more informed than some
of your other statements. Personally, I will take the testimony
of people like Thomas Coughlin, the New York State Commissioner
of Corrections, before I would accept yours. </p>

<p> <b>I am developing a deep mistrust for your facts and
figures. Many of them _may_ be correct, but when I find some to
be in error, I know that you would deliberatly mislead if you
felt you could get away with it. So now I divide by two, an then
doubt. </b> </p>

<p> So go read the resources I have mentioned yourself. If you
had done that in the first place, we wouldn't be having this
discussion now. </p>

<p> <b>Drugs are not magical in a literal sense. They just have a
profound effect on the minds of some people, that some of those
people have compared to magic. </b> </p>

<p> I thought so. But, of course, either way it does not indicate
that prison is the correct approach. </p>

<p> <b>PatI ask you - how many more deaths, and destroyed lives,
would it take before you said legalizing drugs was a bad idea?
Will await your answer. Please make it public. Thanks. </b> </p>

<p> <b>You have dodged this question about four times now. I am
not asking your opinion on whether you think legalizing drugs
would have that effect. I am asking _If it did._ Please answer. I
think the lurkers here deserve an answer. </b> </p>

<p> As I said, I never said I supported legalization, so the
question is misdirected. If legalization is what you have stated
then I wouldn't support it whatever the figures are. </p>

<p> The answer here depends upon what you mean by
&quot;legalizing drugs&quot;. If you mean that cocaine, heroin,
etc., would be sold as freely as convenience store clerks sell
tobacco to children then it is possible that addiction and deaths
would increase, although the evidence clearly shows that they
would still not approach the death rates imposed by alcohol and
tobacco. So, even in that case, one has to wonder why the major
push should not be against alcohol and tobacco first. </p>

<p> But, of course, I am asking you if you have any evidence
(besides your own opinion) that it would increase the deaths. So
far, you have not responded to that. </p>

<p> <b>You said it is not okay with you if a junkie frys his
brain, or dies, from drug abuse. Why not, if he chooses to take
the drug? I thought that was the core of your argument - that we
had no right to interfere with him, because he could choose what
he wanted, and endure the results. Where am I missing this?</b> </p>

<p> This point is not, and never was, the core of my arguments. I
really don't care what you think about anyone's individual
&quot;right&quot; to use recreational drugs, as long as you
recognize that prison is not the proper approach in any case. </p>

<p> But, to get back to this point, let's consider a specific
example. My mother is desperately ill with severe chronic pain. I
won't bore you with the medical history, so let it suffice to say
that she has been all over the US and talked to the nation;s
leading medical experts on the subject. They have all said that
the best medications for here condition are the narcotics -
heroin and morphine. She cannot get either one because the
doctors are afraid they will be prosecuted over any questioned
prescription. In these cases, don't you think that the people who
should be making the decision on the medical use of drugs should
be the doctors, in consultation with their patients? </p>

<p> Both the Dept. of Health and Human Services and the
California Medical Association have issued reports stating that
the undertreatment of pain in this country is a &quot;national
tragedy&quot; and the only reasons for it are the fear and
ignorance created by the drug war. </p>

<p> Can we at least agree that any policy which denies medicine
to sick people has something seriously wrong with it -- both
morally and practically? </p>

<p> <b>You said it was &quot;tyranny&quot; to send a person to
prison for drug abuse, because we would be denying him his right
to make choices. Tyranny is a judgemental word. Is it tyranny to
prohibit sexual harassment? </b> </p>

<p> I never used the word &quot;tyranny&quot;. Who are your
quoting? </p>

<p> <b>((Who are we to cram our views down the throat of some
poor, middle aged, overweight, pathetic, animal of a business
manager? We are a society. We look out for each other. I won't
let that manager hurt people if I can stop it. Why? Because I
care about the people he is hurting, more than I care about his
pride. Would be willing to bankrupt him in a lawsuit, to stop
him, and the others like him, from hurting people. That same
concern is why I want drugs to remain illegal. I care about the
people who are having their lives messed up by drugs. I want it
to stop. Yes, prison is not a good way to do this, but it is the
best way I see available to us right now. </b> </p>

<p> I agree that you have a paternalistic attitude toward
interfering in other people's lives. I don't agree that prison is
the correct approach, even if your attitude was either moral or
justified. </p>

<p> It is also obvious that you are not acquainted with all the
ways we might do this. Try reading some of the studies I have
mentioned. </p>

<p> <b>If you can come up with a way that will assuredly reduce
the amount of human suffering because of drug abuse, please share
it. You know by now that I don't buy the &quot;make it legal, and
people will stop using it&quot; argument. Okay - you don't buy
prison is better than legalization. Do you have any other ideas??
What can we brainstorm? Imagine you and I were co-dictators of
this country. We could change any law, as long as we both agreed.
What would we do about drug abuse??</b> </p>

<p> A good point here, which is why I was one of the co-authors
of the Hoover Resolution. It is true that we can come to a better
solution if we will all sit down, read the facts, and discuss
them. The immediate problem here is that you are not yet
acquainted with all the facts, or the possible options. First, I
would recommend that you take a trip to the local library and
read The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs. You
will find it fascinating, whatever your views may be. </p>

<p> Or, you may just want to check out what they are doing in
Europe. </p>

<p> <b>PatDo you think some adict who chokes to death on his own
vomit is not a victim?</b> </p>

<p> <b>PeterHe &quot;victimized&quot; himself.</b> </p>

<p> <b>PatYes, that is the core of the pro-legalization argument.
</b> </p>

<p> Absolutely false. There is a lot here that you don't
understand. </p>

<p> <b>I say so what? He is just as dead. Don't you care? That
_does_ make legalization seem much more attractive. If, say, an
additional 200,000 people die in the first year, the legalizers
would simply say they &quot;victimized&quot; themselves, and
therefore it is no big thing</b> </p>

<p> First, show me some evidence that this would happen. There is
no evidence anywhere that I can find. For openers, you might try
reading some of the studies I have mentioned. </p>

<p> Second, even if it did happen, there is even less evidence
that prison is the best approach to minimizing the problem. As I
have said many times before, all the major studies said that
prison was the worst approach. </p>

<p> Third, even if it did happen (which all major studies refute)
all major studies agreed that abandoning prison would still be a
better approach. </p>

<p> Fourth, as we have discussed before, legalization and prison
are not the only options. </p>

<p> . </p>

<p> <b>Please see this point. Responding that you don't think
more peole would die is not addressing this. I am asking you
&quot;What if they _do_ die?&quot; Is that even an issue to you? </b>
</p>

<p> Sure it is. That's why I want to see an approach which works
a whole lot better than what we are doing now. Every major study
agreed that the current system kills people from a whole lot of
causes. </p>

<p> <b>You referred back to Frank again, and said that Frank was
referring to &quot;responsible&quot; freedom. I had wondered
whether, if you were with Frank, drunk, and about to climb down a
cliff, whether he would smile and nod, or try to stop you by
whatever means necessary. Frank said &quot;a situation in which
any outside authority can proscribe the actions of an individual
agent, even if the motivation is to &quot;protect&quot; that
agent &quot;from himself&quot; is indefensible. It is a god-given
right to not only be wrong, but to also injury onself,
overtly/intentionally or covertly/unintentionally.&quot;</b> </p>

<p> We have already established that tough laws and big prisons
could not stop you from harming yourself with drugs. Should we
perhaps just attach a 24-hour bodyguard to you because you are a
known risk? How about isolation? </p>

<p> <b>Now, please, lets you and I get serious. Assume
legalization is _not_ an option. Can you think up options to
lower the amount of suffering caused by drug abuse? Visits to
LARC's by high school classes?</b> </p>

<p> <b>How about producing a very long lasting drug that makes
cocaine and heroin not function? Antabuse does a similiar thing
for alcoholics, but only stays in the system for about a week
after the last use. How about prison farms, where addicts are
seperated from the general population, and spend most of their
time in education and hard manual labor, for the duration of
their sentence? Any ideas at all????</b> </p>

<p> There are lots of ideas, some of which I have already shared
with you. In Europe they are trying even more than we have
discussed here and nearly all of those programs are having better
results than what we experience here. </p>

<p> As for the prison farms and hard manual labor, I suggest
again that (assuming you are right) we should start with the
addicts we know -- namely you. What's wrong with that? It would
improve your life greatly, wouldn't it? </p>

<p> <b>So, our government is wasteful and inept. That doesn't
preclude imprisonment as being a proper course of action.</b> </p>

<p> No, but the absolute futility of this approach, combined with
the fact that every major study of the issue says it does more
harm than good would preclude it as a proper course of action. </p>

<p> I would also like to ask you exactly when prison became a
&quot;proper course of action&quot; because no such fact was ever
established when these laws were first passed. </p>

<p> <b>I know of one who died from heroin. He was in my wedding
party. I know of another who died in an automobile wreck while
under the influence of cocaine. He was my best man. They're the
only two statistics I need to be familiar with. Unfortunately I
know more. Perhaps if they had been in jail, they would be
statistics.</b> </p>

<p> The obvious point here is that drugs are illegal as hell but
they did not stop either one of these tragedies. This makes it
all the more curious why you would support a policy that did
nothing for your friends. </p>

<p> <b>At the risk of sounding offensive, I dare say that until
you have lived and shared in the misery associated drug addiction
and abuse, you know absolutely nothing beyond the politically
slanted statistics that you've read or have access to. Perhaps
you do know something about this misery, in which case you've let
your mind lead your heart.</b> </p>

<p> I hear this a lot and it is BS from beginning to end. First,
let me assure you that I have a pretty fair amount of experience
with addicts, as do all of the doctors and others listed in
Signer.zip. I dare say that the experience of any one of them
would far outweigh the experience you have had. </p>

<p> I don't think that knowing someone who was an addict or even
being an addict yourself provides any great insights into a
proper national policy. That gives entirely too much credit to
drugs. </p>

<p> As for not knowing anything beyond the politically slanted
statistics, it is apparent that you have not been to the library
and read the studies I have mentioned many, many times. If you
had, you would find that the statistics -- and their
interpretation -- are quite clear to anyone who has bothered to
read the evidence. As President Nixon's own commission said, the
real problem is the ignorance of our public officials who have
never bothered to read the evidence. </p>

<p> <b>Increased &quot;incidence,&quot; not increased
&quot;reports.&quot; And yes, I expect that a 25% incidence of
narcotics would indicate harm to society.</b> </p>

<p> Perhaps you are wrong here, because the major studies of the
issue stated that, despite the widespread usage, it did not seem
to be a major problem. Furthermore, even if it was, there was no
evidence presented to Congress to show that the Harrison
Narcotics Act was an appropriate approach to the problem. In
fact, as stated earlier, the medical officials in this country
felt it was not the proper approach. Furthermore, if you will
read the Consumers Union Report (which you seemed to have missed
in your trips to the library) you will find that most members of
Congress did not realize that they were passing what would turn
out to be a Prohibition law. Similarly, when hemp was outlawed in
1937, most members of Congress did not realize that they were
outlawing a commercial crop which was grown in virtually every
state in the US. </p>

<p> <b>you equate the social, economic, and political milieu of
19th century China with that of modern day America</b> </p>

<p> <b>I am not doing anything of the kind.</b> </p>

<p> It seems to me you were. But, regardless, the information you
presented did not support the stated conclusions. </p>

<p> <b>I suggest you write to the Bureau of Justice Statistics
and tell them that their figures are in error.</b> </p>

<p> I suggest you research your facts a little better. You have
missed most of the major research on this issue. </p>

<p> <b>Drug abuse imposes its own costs on society.</b> </p>

<p> True enough. The point is that there is no evidence that
prison does anything to reduce those costs. In fact, every major
study of the issue (which you missed on your trip to the library)
said it only increases the costs. </p>

<p> <b>why we shouldn't help smokers and excessive drinkers kick
the habit</b> </p>

<p> <b>Sounds like a good idea. It's the Christian thing to do.</b>
</p>

<p> So let's get really Christian and throw them all in jail for
their own good. If you are a Christian, let me ask you a simple
question. If we gave this problem to Jesus, what would he do?
Would he build bigger prisons, or would he build hospitals and
schools? Would he punish people, or would he heal them? Before
you answer, please note that I have talked to a lot of members of
the clergy and they all come back with the same answer. As one
said, &quot;Put that way, the answer is obvious.&quot; </p>

<p> <b>When the smokers start robbing me at gun point, I'll start
to worry . . .</b> </p>

<p> Then you should start to worry the minute cigarettes come
under drug Prohibition. If you had read the major studies of the
issue you would know that tobacco users commit the same kinds of
anti-social behavior as other addicts when they are deprived of
their drug of choice. </p>

<p> <b>I don't think you understand that drug addiction is
physically harmful. _American Academic Encyclopedia_:
&quot;Tolerance develops to most of the effects of these drugs,
which means that the dose must be regularly increased to maintain
a constant effect.&quot; This leads to a gradual physical
deterioration which is generally obvious in long-time junkies.</b>
</p>

<p> The statement by the American Academic Encyclopedia does not
establish any harm to the body other than increased craving. Your
statement is easily proven wrong by the doctors I have talked to
(listed in Signer.zip) who are the world's leading experts on the
subject. </p>

<p> And, of course, I have been asking everyone on this board who
Dr. William Halsted is and how he is relevant to this issue. But,
of course, you don't know such basic facts as that, so there
ain't much point in asking you, is there? </p>

<p> <b>There are only 15,000 - 20,000 hard drug users in the
Netherlands. It's a small country. I have no figures on
mortality. However, I would expect they have a similar proportion

<p> In 1992 they had 28 deaths from heroin overdose in the entire
country. This is all the more remarkable when you consider that
heroin is usually injected and thus bypasses all the bodies
defenses against overdose. </p>

<p> <b>_Contemporary Drug Problems_ is not a &quot;book&quot; but
an academic journal. In this case, the author of the article

Leuw and Hans Nelen, who are introduced as follows:</b> </p>

<p> <b>. . .</b> </p>

<p> If you would like some more direct information, I can put you
in touch with Michael Hessing (former chief of police of
Rotterdam), Robert Van der Hoeven, the DA, etc., etc., etc. </p>

<p> <b>To accuse someone of lying would be rude, and so
naturally, I have not done so. I merely express a healthy degree
of skepticism as to Cliff's statements. As to his motives, I do
not care to speculate.</b> </p>

<p> Please read Signer.zip in library 13. I met with Friedman and
others on February 23, 1993 at the Hoover Institution and signed
what became known as the Hoover Resolution. I have become
reasonably well known for this, having persuaded such people as
William Von Raab, Dear Abby, and others to support the
Resolution. If you like, I will send you the transcript of the
radio show Hugh Downs did about me. I am fairly well known in
this field so, if you knew anything about it, you would run
across my name eventually. </p>

<p> As to my motives, I have stated them quite clearly on a
number of occasions. My mother cannot get the medicine she needs.
</p>

<p> <b>To begin with, there is no need to lock them all up, and
certainly not to imprison them all simultaneously. If you read
&quot;Narctics Reform,&quot; you understand that I never
advocated locking up *all* heroin users. First-time offenders
should be allowed treatment + probation, provided they have not
committed any other offense. Subsequent drug offenses would be
punished according to an accelerated schedule: Second-time
offenders would be obliged to do some jail time, third-time
offenders would get a longer sentence, and so on. Since the
recidivism rate for drug offenses is only 30%, this would reduce
the number of addicts requiring long-term confinement to a
relative handful.</b> </p>

<p> So, let's try the question again. How many people should be
locked up? Don't give me vague generalities, give me some
numbers. </p>

<p> <b>I have not expressed any opinion, pro or con, as to the
legalization or decriminalization of marijuana. However, eleven
states have already decriminalized simple possession of
marijuana, without any obvious harmful results.</b> </p>

<p> Of course, you are not familiar with how hemp or any of the
other drugs became illegal in the first place, are you? </p>

<p> <b>I believe that the difference between promoting the
legalization of narcotics and the use of narcotics is a very fine
distinction. One leads to the other.</b> </p>

<p> Correct me if I am wrong, but I think we have already
established that you have never read the major research on the
issue and therefore would not be quite qualified to make this
judgment. As it turns out, those who are now recommending
legalization are those who have spent decades trying to limit
drug abuse. </p>

<p> <b>You prefer being robbed at gunpoint? That is a false
economy.</b> </p>

<p> If someone commits a robbery, as my good friend Judge Gray
will tell you, that is an entirely different issue and they
should be brought before a court of law. Until then, however, it
is pointless to try to control private drug use with criminal
law. </p>

<p> <b>With stubborn cases who refuse to reform, that may be the
only alternative. These represent only a small minority, however.</b>
</p>

<p> So you still have not answered the simply question of how
many should go to jail. I bet you never thought about it, did
you? </p>

<p> <b>Child-molesting doesn't *necessarily* involve violence nor
threat of violence. In the case of teen prostitution, it's a
purely commercial arrangement.</b> </p>

<p> It may interest you to know that Joseph Califano, in a report
to the governor of New York in 1980, estimated that 70 percent of
all child molestation and abuse cases are related to alcohol. So
it again brings up the question of why you aren't campaigning for
alcohol prohibition. </p>

<p> <b>Well, er, no. Not quite. Cliff said exactly this --
&quot;Wait! You just convinced me that prison is the right
approach! We ought to start by throwing the known drug addicts
(that's you) into prison &quot;for their own good.&quot; A good
twenty year stretch in the pen will change your mind about how
appealing these drugs are.&quot; </b> </p>

<p> I told you that any time you thought it would be a good idea
for you to spend ten years locked in a small room as some thug's
sexual plaything I would be more than happy to do what you think
is the best thing for you. </p>

<p> <b>I thought he was being sarcastic, and replied &quot;You
also indicated that I should be imprisoned as a drug addict. I
assume you are being sarcastic again. (Which, BTW, is rude.)

not called for.&quot;</b> </p>

<p> Oh, but you are still a known risk for addiction aren't you?
How else are we going to protect you from yourself? </p>

<p> Dr. Andrew, </p>

<p> Re the issue of comparative toxicity of drugs, the following
might interest you. Marijuana is not included, of course, because
there are no recorded deaths from marijuana in human history
(source: DEA). Therefore, there would be little point in
reporting the death rate from pot. Because the death rate is
ZERO, there seems to be even less point in jailing people for its
use. </p>

<p> Actually, I think these numbers might be understated with
respect to the number of users of heroin and cocaine. Other
figures I have seen are somewhat higher and, as I mentioned, I
believe the survey method itself promotes underreporting of users
for several reasons. Therefore, it seems quite possible that the
death rates per user for heroin and cocaine may be somewhat lower
than the figures stated below. </p>

<p> With respect to the number of deaths by heroin, you may
recall that the CU Report stated that they could not find any
heroin &quot;overdose&quot; death in which they believed the
medical evidence supported the label of &quot;overdose.&quot;
Oooooops! Sorry! I forgot you haven't read the CU Report! </p>

<p> By the reasoning that you have given before (what little
actual reasoning we have seen) we ought to throw people in jail
for (fill in the blank) because this drug can kill people. By
those standards, the heaviest penalties ought to be for alcohol
and tobacco. </p>

<p> You are, of course, free to present any valid citable
information which would conflict with these figures -- but you
haven't done it yet, so I don't expect you to start now. </p>

<p> (a) &quot;Reducing the Health Consequences of Smoking: </p>

<p> 25 Years of Progress&quot; Surgeon General's Report (1989). </p>

<p> (b) Estimates vary greatly, depending upon whether all health
</p>

<p> consequences, or only those traditionally associated with </p>

<p> alcoholism, are considered. The Fifth Special Report to the </p>

<p> U.S. Congress on Alcoholism and Health from the Secretary of </p>

<p> Health and Human Services contains two references indicating </p>

<p> a death toll of 200,000: The report states, first, that
alcohol </p>

<p> &quot;plays a role in 10% of all deaths in the United
States,&quot; </p>

<p> which comes to about 200,000 deaths each year. P. vi. It
further </p>

<p> states that present estimates of the death toll from alcohol </p>

<p> abuse are as high as 93.2 per 100,000. Ibid., p. x. This </p>

<p> ratio translates into a total of about 210,000. </p>

<p> (c) These figures were determined as follows: Drug Abuse
Warning </p>

<p> Network (DAWN) heroin and cocaine fatalities for 1984, 1985, </p>

<p> and 1986 were averaged. The number of suicides was
subtracted. </p>

<p> The figures were discounted to account for deaths in which </p>

<p> both heroin and cocaine played a role. Since DAWN covers </p>

<p> about one-third of the nation's population but almost all </p>

<p> major urban areas where drug use florishes, totals were
doubled </p>

<p> to arrive at yearly estimates of 2,000 for heroin deaths and </p>

<p> 1,000 for cocaine deaths. Finally, these figures were dis- </p>

<p> counted by 80 percent in accordance with the analysis
presented </p>

<p> in the text. </p>

<p> <b>Cliff, I've been practicing medicine for 20+ yrs.</b> </p>

<p> <b>I'm also active in medical politics (currently
president-elect of the medical staff of a major tertiary care
hospital).</b> </p>

<p> <b>We have a rich tradition of communicating and discussing
among ourselves all matters relevant to clinical practice,
economics and ESPECIALLY governmental control.</b> </p>

<p> <b>The communication is accomplished via formal (peer
reviewed) journals as well as by a welter of &quot;popular&quot;
medical periodicals.</b> </p>

<p> As I said before, I will be more than happy to compare your
credentials on this subject against the credentials of the
doctors who made the statements. But let's start with the simple
points first; </p>

<p> The total amount of heroin you have prescribed in your career
is _______? Please fill in the blank. </p>

<p> If you are an average US doctor you have never laid your
hands or eyes on medicinal heroin and certainly have never
prescribed it. Therefore, it would seem obvious that your
knowledge is inferior to the doctors I have talked to who have
actually worked with it. As I also said, I will be happy to put
you in touch with some of them. As I suggested to Forrest
Johnson, you can call them yourself if you like. Try, for
instance, just calling the publich health service in Liverpool
and ask to speak with the doctors in charge of their program. I
would be interested to hear the response you get. </p>

<p> If you were really knowledgeable about the subject (like some
of the doctors I have talked to) you would also be able to tell
me about the supplies of heroin in the US which are legal, how
they got here, and what they are used for. But, of course, you
can't even tell me who Dr. William Halsted is (even though you
CLAIMED to have read the book which describes him in some detail)
so we will not move on to the hard questions. </p>

<p> Why is it that you have such a difficult time answering
simple questions? What is the problem here anyway? </p>

<p> <b>NOWHERE AND AT NO TIME HAVE I RUN ACROSS ANY MENTION OF
DOCTORS JAILED FOR TREATING PATIENTS OR VOICING DISAGREEMENT WITH
ANYTHING.</b> </p>

<p> As I said before, it is becoming increasingly apparent that
you have not read the Consumers Union Report or any of the other
studies I mentioned. If credibility is an issue, yours is fading
fast. Were you telling us all a big story when you said you read
it? </p>

<p> <b>We have one journal (Medical Economics) that searches out,
investigates and reports on ANY &quot;sensational&quot; aspect of
non-clinical MD related activity.</b> </p>

<p> <b>They would go nuts if they thought they were missing a
story such as this.</b> </p>

<p> Again, I say that you have not read the materials you said
you read. It did not happen last week, it happened immediately
after the laws were passed and had the effect of stopping all
drug research and treatment for several decades. (Did you perhaps
miss the part about &quot;several decades&quot;). </p>

<p> But, to go on to more recent matters -- It is also apparent
that you have not read the reports issued by the Department of
Health and Human Services about the undertreatment of pain, and
you are not familiar with the California Medical Association's
recent statements on the issue. Your communication is lacking.
You can get a full copy of the HHS report by calling
1-800-4CANCER. </p>

<p> Also, as I stated previously, Dr. Harvey Rose of Sacramento
was prosecuted for giving Darvon to an 84-year old woman with
crippling arthritis. It almost destroyed his practice. I will put
you in touch with him if you like. As a result of his experience,
he wrote California's Intractable Pain Treatment Act which seeks
to give doctors some protection against this kind of arbitrary
prosecution. </p>

<p> Also, in 1992, the DEA sent two Chicago doctors to prison for
prescribing Tylenol 3. As you may know (assuming you really are a
doctor -- we have had some pretenders here before) Tylenol 3 is
not even a prescription drug except in the US and South Africa,
and the US is the only country in the world which has ever jailed
a doctor for prescribing it. </p>

<p> You may also be interested in the case of Florida vs.
Martinez which appeared on Court TV and has been repeated several
times because it was such an interesting trial. Mr. Martinez is
an AIDS counselor who was handing out morphine to anyone who
would come in and ask for it. Mr. Martinez does not have any kind
of medical training (other than OJT as a AIDS counselor) and
freely admitted that he was violating both state and Federal drug
laws. His only defense was that his actions were a medical
necessity because of the barbaric policies on drugs. The
testimony was quite interesting. When the jury heard all of the
evidence they voted unanimously for acquittal and stated that Mr.
Martinez was a &quot;hero&quot;. </p>

<p> Also, my mother's doctors have stated that the specific
reason that they will not give her morphine (or heroin) is
because they are afraid of prosecution if they do. These doctors
have included the doctors at the Mayo Clinic, the National Pain
Institute, the USC Pain Clinic, etc., etc., etc. As you recall, I
asked you if you would prescribe it for her and got the usual
cop-out. Your credibility is lacking in more than one respect. </p>

<p> <b>Your inflammatory statement demands proof.</b> </p>

<p> <b>As I have said before, your credibility is fatally
jeopardized by these sorts of wildly improbable statements.</b> </p>

<p> The proof demands that you actually read the things you said
you read. Your credibility also hinges on whether you can answer
any of the simple questions I have put to you. For example: Who
was Dr. William Halsted and why is his story relevant to the
things you have said? (He asked for the umpteenth time.) </p>

<p> Frankly, I would think that anyone who had been in medical
practice for more than 20 years would be able to answer these
questions a whole lot easier. Why is it that a practicing
physician cannot answer simple questions on this issue when he
claims to be an expert? </p>

<p> <b>There was an article in my morning newspaper. . . .It
first reported that the heroin hitting the streets today is more
pure, costs less, and is more lethal. Cliff and Mona please note
- lethal means that heroin is not harmless.</b> </p>

<p> A newspaper article with an unsupported statement about drugs
</p>

<p> <b>They also quoted Lee Brown, the country's drug policy
director, as saying that since some of the stigma has been
removed, heroin is now more socially acceptable. It use is
increasing. He also said its use is increasing because you can
now get purer doses for less money. (That is fundamental economic
theory coming out again. Please note, as it gets to be a more
quality product, and the price goes down, its use goes up -
despite the Netherlands.) </b> </p>

<p> Heroin is more socially acceptable? Who does he hang around
with? </p>

<p> If quality is going up and price is going down, then
obviously the drug war is not having its desired effect. This
much seems obvious. </p>

<p> <b>He stated there are now 2.7 million hard-core, chronic
drug users in this country. </b> </p>

<p> That much is correct. How many of them do you want to put in
prison? - Recognizing, of course, that jailing them would require
TRIPLING the size of every prison and jail which now exists in
America. </p>

<p> <b>Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., was quoted ast calling
heroin a vicious drug that tempts its users into a lifetime of a
living hell. (Hmmmmmmm.... they don't, apparently, just stop the
first time they vomit.)</b> </p>

<p> Charles Schumer -- Now there is an informed, intelligent,
reliable, impartial source that you can rely on. (Being sarcastic
here, in case you didn't catch it. This guy is famous for his
ignorance of the subject.) </p>

<p> <b>Thomas Constantine, administrator of the DEA, who came
there from the New York State police, gave a short history on how
the quality and purity of heroin is increasing. Street heroin
purity has gone from 7% a decade ago to an average of 36% now. In
New York and Boston, it reaches 95%.</b> </p>

<p> So he said interdiction was not working. I think we covered
that before. </p>

<p> <b>Opium production has quadrupled in the last decade. </b> </p>

<p> Ten years ago the DEA estimated that only one percent of the
entire world's opium supply would be required to supply the
entire demand in the US. Now I guess it is down to one-fourth of
one percent. </p>

<p> <b>End of article. It appears that heroin is not harmless,
and as its quality goes up and its price goes down, its use goes
up. Lets keep it illegal. </b> </p>

<p> It appears that you have a newspaper article with a bunch of
unsubstantiated statements. Of course, even assuming that heroin
is as dangerous as stated, that still does not establish that
throwing people in prison is the best approach to the problem.
The example of alcohol is instructive in this regard. </p>

<p> So, in conclusion, you have leaped from one unsubstantiated
statement to a conclusion which would be a non-sequitir in any
case. </p>

<p> <b>You frequently take sentences one at a time, and respond,
thereby answering points I am not making. </b> </p>

<p> Yes, because the points you made in those sentences cannot be
substantiated by an evidence I have found. You proceed from wrong
information to wrong conclusions. Let's get the information right
first, and then we might be able to move on to correct
conclusions. </p>

<p> <b>Also, frequently your response is not responsive. If you
say &quot;Heroin is harmless!&quot; and I respond &quot;But
according to your stats, 20,000 people a year die from it!&quot;
it is _not_ appropriate to then say &quot;But putting them in
prisons doesn't work.&quot; Please respond to the thought, or
skip it. It is very hard to maintain a dialog when you jump
around. </b> </p>

<p> Please get it straight what I have said. I did not say that
20,000 people die every year from heroin. (If you can't get this
straight then there is all the more reason to question the other
things you say). </p>

<p> What I said was that the AMA estimated that 20,000 people die
from ALL illegal drugs from ALL causes, including overdose,
accidents, etc. </p>

<p> Simply stating the number of people who die does not provide
any support for the notion that prison is a beneficial approach.
As I have stated previously, far more people die from alcohol and
tobacco which, by your reasoning, would show that prison ought to
be an even better idea for these drugs. In order to show that
prison is a beneficial approach, it must be shown that the number
of deaths would decrease with more people put in prison -- in
some proportion that would provide a real benefit in terms of the
cost. (You know, a simple cost-benefit analysis -- which you have
stated previously you have never even seriously considered.) </p>

<p> <b>Perhaps not. The post was addressed to Mona, not you.
Please pay attention. </b> </p>

<p> You stated that a junkie's right to fry his own brains was
the core of the arguments for (for lack of a better word)
&quot;legalization&quot;. I pointed out that you are wrong. You
can take those arguments away entirely and prison is still not a
good idea. </p>

<p> <b>Okay, you are being cute. Since your true position appears
to be in favor of legalizing drugs, I will attribute that to you,
and simply ignore any more comments like the above. If I am
wrong, state your position on legalization. </b> </p>

<p> We have been over this ground before. My position is that we
should have one consistent philosophy and approach to all
recreational drugs. That would require re-thinking our approach
to not only heroin, cocaine, and marijuana, but alcohol and
tobacco as well. </p>

<p> <b>You cannot have everything both ways, Cliff. If you are
not being sarcastic, then you really do believe that I should be
imprisoned. For twenty years. Because I am an addict. Of course,
that thought is contrary to your beliefs most of the time. So do
you _really_ want me in prison because I am an _uppity_ addict?
The only things your really know about me are that I am an addict
(whom, you believe, should not be imprisoned), and I disagree
with you on this policy (and I should be imprisoned.) </b> </p>

<p> <b>Or, of course, maybe there is some hypocrisy in your
belief system. </b> </p>

<p> You are the first addict I have run across who believes that
spending ten years in a small cell as someone's girlfriend (hope
he doesn't have AIDS) would improve his life. If you really
believe it, I am willing to grant it. I don't see any other way
that we could protect you against all the harmful things you
might do to yourself. </p>

<p> <b>It is a common failure of those who get frustrated in a
discussion to take their opponents view, and change it to
something else, and then oppose that. Please stop doing that. </b>
</p>

<p> That's called setting up a straw man. You might want to take
your own advice here. </p>

<p> <b>I am truly dismayed. If an additonal 200,000 people died
in the first year alone, you would still say that your &quot;no
prison&quot; policy is best. Good grief, Cliff, how many would it
take? I was trying to pick a number high enough so you would say
&quot;If that many more people died, of course I would change my
mind about legalization.&quot; You didn't. That many deaths
wouldn't be enough. Am not sure what I can say. Doesn't make much
sense to keep raising the ante until you do say Enough. </b> </p>

<p> As I said, since I don't agree with the policy you are asking
about in the first place, then it doesn't make much sense to
answer such a question. </p>

<p> And, you seem to have missed the question that I have been
asking of everyone. What evidence do you have to show that this
(or any number of increased deaths) would happen? As I said, all
the evidence I have run across says the opposite -- and I have
named that evidence. Do you have any evidence? (Apparently
nothing besides your own opinion, right?) </p>

<p> <b>Can we at least agree that any policy which denies
medicine to sick people has something seriously wrong with it --
both morally and practically? </b> </p>

<p> <b>I agree wholeheartedly. </b> </p>

<p> See, we do agree on some things. Now let's proceed to the
next point. Why is this happening when everyone I talk to seems
to agree that it is wrong? </p>

<p> <b>Ok, an example. You state it costs an average of $450,000
to imprison someone for drug abuse. Part of that cost, according
to you, is $150,000 for building the cell. This implies that
every drug offender has to have a new cell built for him. All
must be in one man cells, and none of them are reused upon the
release of the drug abuser. This is clearly absurd. You stick by
it. I don't have to provide a stat for what the prorated use of a
cell would cost to see that. It is obvious. When I see you cook
stats like that, I then doubt all of your stats because of a
perceived lack of intellectual integrity. </b> </p>

<p> Those are the costs stated by people such as Thomas Coughlin,
the New York State Commissioner of Corrections. I will believe
him before I believe you, particularly when you have not
presented any evidence to back up your statements. </p>

<p> The cells may indeed be reused on the release of the drug
abuser, but you seem to miss the major point here. It would seem
obvious that we have not put enough of them in prison to stop the
problem. Sending a drug abuser (or better yet, a violent
criminal) out the back door when another drug abuser comes in the
front door does not accomplish anything. Therefore, the prison
population will have to increase significantly before this policy
becomes effective. The question is, at what level of prison
population will this program have a real effect? As you have
stated, you don't have a clue what the answer to that one is, so
it really doesn't matter what numbers I cite. </p>

<p> <b>Cliff, you clearly don't understand what addiction is
like. You don't understand how people become addicts. You don't
seem to be very concerned over messed up lives, or deaths, that
could be caused by legalizing drugs. If messed up lives, and
deaths, are not the issue, than what is? If those are not the
issue, than is it only the money angle? Is it the pride of your
position? What is your motivation? </b> </p>

<p> Aside from the fact that you seem to have missed my position
on this issue: </p>

<p> As I have stated, I have relatives who are addicts, including
one that I grew up with like a brother. As I have stated, while I
deplore their behavior I have to recognize that prison would not
benefit them or society. My objective is to make them whole
again, not to destroy them by turning them into someone's
girlfriend in a small steel room for ten or twenty years. You may
like that and think that is beneficial for you, but I do not
accept that as an appropriate remedy for the people I know. </p>

<p> My motivation is that I would like to </p>

<p> a) change the laws so my mother can get the medicine she
needs. Even you have agreed that denial of medicine is wrong.
(Now you need to understand why it is happening.) </p>

<p> b) develop a policy which helps people instead of destroying
them. </p>

<p> c) Destroy the mythology which surrounds this issue, which
was the original basis for these laws in the first place. It is
increasingly apparent that you do not understand how the laws
came about, and therefore have an incorrect understanding of
where we are today. </p>

<p> <b>You have asked a number of people about imprisoning
30,000,000 drug abusers. I believe that all the serious folks I
know of say they are willing to imprison enough to lower the
suffering rate. I know of no one who believes that would take
30,000,000. Am not sure how many it would take. </b> </p>

<p> That is exactly my point. The people who support this policy
(including you) have never bothered to answer (or even ask) such
basic questions as this. THAT IS THE PROBLEM. Don't feel lonesome
here, because I have asked every government official that I have
run across and all I ever get in response is a rather stupid
expression on their face. How good can this policy be if no one
has ever thought about where we are going with it? </p>

<p> <b>If I ever see that the rate of human misery is, overall,
going up because of putting drug abusers in prison, I would look
into overturning at least some of the laws. </b> </p>

<p> Then look again, and do it more closely. </p>

<p> <b>I know you have rejected my descriptions of addiction, and
how addicts act. </b> </p>

<p> Not so. I believe you completely. As I said, that is the
reason that the CU Report and others have said that drug
prohbition will not work -- because the addicts do not respond
rationally and, therefore, the laws don't mean much to them in
terms of deterrence. Obviously, the laws did not deter you. </p>

<p> <b>But please consider what I told Cliff (when he told me he
thought I should be thrown in prison). I was a practicing addict
for 12 years, and those years are now lost forever. If you had
thrown me in prison, for the typical sentence for a first time
possessor, I _might_ have been so rattled that I would have
sought help, and stopped. If you had done that in year two of the
twelve, you would have given me ten years of life back. Mona, I
really would like those years back. Prison would have been very,
very worth it. </b> </p>

<p> I have no doubt that you would like those years back. We
tried everything we could with law enforcement to give them to
you and our efforts did not succeed. That's why I think we should
have thought about it a little better and developed a plan which
might have helped you more than this one did. As far as I can
see, the only thing this policy did for you was to make treatment
less available because all the money is being spent on prisons. </p>

<p> Yes, we might have given you ten years of life back (assuming
you would respond to jail when you admit that the thought of your
own death did not deter you). You would have spent that ten years
locked in a small steel and concrete room playing the role of
someone's girlfriend. I don't know your personal sexual tastes
but, for the addicts I have known, I would not consider that as
an acceptable remedy to their problem. Most of the ones I have
seen who went through something like that wound up considerably
more screwed up than when they went in. <br>

<HTML><PRE>               <B>2. Under any analysis or "level of scrutiny," the</B> 
          <B>plaintiff should prevail.</B>

     The "privileges and immunities" clause couldn't be more 

straightforward:

       No law shall be passed granting to any citizen, class of 
       citizens, or corporation other than municipal, privileges 
       or immunities which upon the same terms shall not equally 
       belong to all citizens, or corporations.

Wash. Const. art. 1  12.

     The plaintiff's situation regarding medicinal marijuana may be 

phrased in several ways which invoke the clause:

The plaintiff is denied the privilege of ending his suffering by the 

  use of a therapeutic drug while others are granted the privilege 

  of ending their suffering with access to far more harmful and 

  addictive drugs, such as morphine, cocaine, amphetamines, 

  barbiturates and opium.  Additionally, patients who need THC and 

  may absorb it effectively through their gastro-intestinal tract 

  have the privilege of the relief of their suffering, while the 

  plaintiff, whose GI tract is not functioning when he needs THC, 

  is denied the privilege.

Other citizens are granted immunity from arrest for possession of 

  therapeutic but potentially harmful drugs by virtue of 

  prescriptions, while the plaintiff is denied that immunity.

     Whatever "level of scrutiny" the Court deems appropriate, the 

plaintiff's right to be free of discrimination by his own government 

is being violated, in that the plaintiff is being made to suffer 

physically for reasons which serve no legitimate government purpose.

<B>THE DISCRIMINATION INVOLVES A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AND IS ENTITLED TO</B> 
  <B>STRICT SCRUTINY.</B>

     As set forth in State v. Smith, supra, if government 

discrimination or classification involves a "fundamental right," the 

courts must apply "strict scrutiny," and uphold the classification 

only if it is "necessary to accomplish a compelling state interest."  

Id.  The Washington Supreme Court has found that a physician has a 

fundamental right to freely practice medicine.  Bering v. Share, 106 

Wn.2d 212, 721 P.2d 918 (1986).  Clearly, it is no stretch to state 

the corollary -- that a patient has a fundamental right to the aid 

of his physician to relieve suffering.  In any event, the court in 

Bering held that the state has a "substantial interest in ensuring 

its citizens unimpeded access to necessary medical care."  Id. at 

225.  That decision dealt with access to abortions; it is difficult 

for the plaintiff to see how that might be more "necessary" than 

ending the suffering of chemotherapy-induced, uncontrolled nausea 

and diarrhea.

     If the court finds that a fundamental right is involved and 

applies strict scrutiny, the state must justify maintaining 

marijuana in Schedule I as "necessary to accomplish a compelling 

state interest."  Frankly, the plaintiff is at a loss to anticipate 

what sort of argument the state might put forward, if the attorneys 

involved intend to keep straight faces while addressing the Court.

     What is the "compelling state interest" in having the plaintiff 

lying on the floor retching and defecating on himself when he could 

be sleeping peacefully?  What "compelling state interest" justifies 

forcing the plaintiff to endure 14-hour "highs" in an attempt to 

relieve his suffering with synthetics?  What is the "compelling 

state interest" to force the plaintiff to pay $5 per THC tablet, 

many of which disappear down the toilet undissolved?

     Or is the "compelling state interest" the larger one of 

controlling marijuana as a recreational drug?  If so, why is it not 

"necessary" to place cocaine, opium, morphine, barbiturates, and 

amphetamines also in Schedule I?  Note that the penalty for 

manufacture or possession with intent to deliver a Schedule I or II 

drug is exactly the same. RCW 69.50.401.  Clearly, the legislature 

attaches no symbolic or exemplary difference between the two crimes.  

Thus, any contention by the Attorney General that placing marijuana 

in Schedule II and permitting its prescriptive, medicinal use will 

"send a signal" that recreational use of the drug is condoned should 

be given the merit it deserves -- none.

     In short, the classification of marijuana in Schedule I 

violates a fundamental right of the plaintiff, and the state cannot 

show a necessary reason for the classification that accomplishes a 

compelling state interest.  Therefore, the plaintiff's motion for 

declaratory relief should be granted.

<B>IF THE COURT DOES NOT FIND THAT A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT HAS BEEN</B> 
  <B>VIOLATED, THE LAW SHOULD STILL BE STRUCK DOWN UNDER "INTERMEDIATE</B> 
  <B>SCRUTINY."</B>

     "Heightened" or "intermediate" scrutiny should apply even if 

"strict scrutiny" does not, because the classification involves an 

"important right," and because the plaintiff is in a class for which 

he cannot be held accountable -- he did not choose to be a cancer 

patient, or to have his physician place him on chemotherapy in an 

attempt to save his life.  State v. Smith, supra.

     The test is that the law must be seen as "furthering a 

substantial interest of the state."  As analyzed above, no state 

interest, substantial or otherwise, is not equally well served by 

placing marijuana in Schedule II.

<B>EVEN UNDER MINIMAL SCRUTINY, THE PLAINTIFF MUST PREVAIL, BECAUSE THE</B> 
  <B>CLASSIFICATION IS PURELY ARBITRARY.</B>

     Absent strict or heightened scrutiny, the test is whether a 

"rational relationship" exists between the challenged classification 

and a legitimate state interest.  What is the "legitimate" state 

interest in denying an end to the plaintiff's physical suffering?

     The classification must be "purely arbitrary" to overcome the 

presumption of constitutionality.  State v. Smith, supra at 279.  In 

fact, the classification is purely arbitrary.  As stated by Judge 

Young after taking hundreds of hours of testimony, reviewing 

thousands of pages of documents, and issuing a 68-page report:

       It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for the 
       DEA to continue to stand between those sufferers and the 
       benefits of this substance [marijuana] in light of the 
       evidence in this record.

Judge Young's report, supra at 68 (emphasis added).

     Thus, even under the "minimal scrutiny" test, the state can 

show no rational relationship between the classification and a 

legitimate state interest, and this court should find that the 

classification is purely arbitrary, and grant the declaratory relief 

requested.


     <B>C. THE PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO THE RELIEF REQUESTED UNDER</B> 
        <B>ARTICLE I  32, THE "FREQUENT RECURRENCE TO FUNDAMENTAL</B> 
        <B>PRINCIPLES" CLAUSE OF THE WASHINGTON CONSTITUTION.</B>

               <B>1. Gunwall factors analyzed.</B>

     The "Gunwall factors" have come to be, in Gunwall's progeny, 

required analysis and briefing at the superior court level in order 

for the Supreme Court to consider whether personal liberties are 

protected to a greater extent by the state's constitution, compared 

to the U.S. Constitution.  See, e.g., State v. Wethered, 110 Wn.2d 

466, 472, 755 P.2d 787 (1988); In re Mota, 114 Wn.2d 465, 472, 788 

P.2d 538 (1990).  The plaintiff adopted Justice Utter's analysis 

concerning the Privileges and Immunities clause, above, and here 

provides the Gunwall analysis of the "Frequent Recurrence to 

Fundamental Principles" clause:

     1. The textual language of the state constitution.

       The text of the state constitution may provide cogent 
       grounds for a decision different from that which would be 
       arrived at under the federal constitution. It may be more 
       explicit or it may have no precise federal counterpart at 
       all.

Gunwall at 61. Article 1  32 of the Constitution of the State of 

Washington reads in total:

       A frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is 
       essential to the security of individual right and the 
       perpetuity of free government.

     Since no "precise federal counterpart" exists, the Court may 

find greater protection under this factor, and the plaintiff argues 

strenuously that it should.

     2. Significant differences in the texts of parallel provisions 

of the federal and state constitutions.

          Such differences may also warrant reliance on the state 
       constitution.  Even where parallel provision of the two 
       constitutions do not have meaningful differences, other 
       relevant provisions of the state constitution may require 
       that the state constitution be interpreted differently.

Id.  Since no parallel provision may be found in the federal 

constitution, this factor does not seem to apply to either find or 

not find greater protection under the state constitution.

     3. State constitutional and common law history. 

          This may reflect an intention to confer greater 
       protection from state government than the federal 
       constitution affords from the federal government. The 
       history of the adoption of a particular state 
       constitutional provision may reveal an intention that will 
       support reading the provision independently of federal law.

Id.  The constitutional history of Section 32 remains somewhat of a 

mystery.  The constitutions of Wisconsin, New Hampshire and Illinois 

contained clauses referencing fundamental principles, but the 

connection to individual rights was unique to Washington.  Brian 

Snure, "A Frequent Recurrence to Fundamental Principles: Individual 

Rights, Free Government, and the Washington State Constitution," 67 

Wash. L. Rev. 669 (1992) at 676.

     The original proposed constitution by W. Liard Hill contained 

only 31 sections to Article 1.  Section 32 was proposed by George 

Turner, whose later speeches as a U.S. Senator lead to the 

conclusion that Turner, like others of his day, believed that 

constitutional interpretation often required a return to natural law 

principles beyond the four corners of the constitution.  Snure, Id. 

at 674, citing 32 Cong. Rec. 783, 785, 789 (1899)(statement of Sen. 

Turner against United States imperialism in the Philippines).

     The signers of Washington's constitution had witnessed a 

hundred years of what happens when power is concentrated in either 

government (federal) or private (corporate) bodies, and they clearly 

didn't like what they saw.  Thus, we have a clause in our "freedom 

to bear arms" clause stating that "nothing in this section shall be 

construed as authorizing individuals or corporations to organize, 

maintain or employ an armed body of men."  Wash. Const. art. 1  24; 

and the mention of "corporations, except municipal" in the 

Privileges and Immunities clause, discussed above.

     In the decade before the Washington Constitutional Convention, 

the territory had grown from a virtual wilderness of 75,000 settlers 

cut off from the nation's capital by a month's travel time, to a 

state of 350,000 citizens who could reach the east coast by a three-

day train ride.  Snure, supra, citing Dorothy Johnson, "Empire of 

the Columbia," (2d ed., 1967).  Most of the influx of settlers had 

experienced legislative abuse elsewhere, and in Washington as well.  

Snure, Id. at 671.  For example, during the 1862-63 territorial 

legislative session, the legislature passed no general laws, but 

enacted more than 150 pieces of general legislation for the benefit 

of "private interests against the general welfare."  Id.

     Nor did the delegates trust the other branches of government.  

Governors abused their patronage powers, and judges were appointed 

from afar and often absent.  Id., citing, inter alia, Charles H. 

Sheldon, "A Century of Judging: A Political History of the 

Washington Supreme Court," (1988).  Mining companies amassed armed 

guards to thwart unions activities, and railroads charged excessive 

rates to farmers.  Id., citing Gordon B. Ridgeway, "Populism in 

Washington," 39 Pac. N.W. Hist. Q. 284-91 (1948). 

     All of these infringements on personal liberties came about 

despite the guarantees of liberty and democratic government found in 

the U.S. Constitution.

     It is noteworthy that Washington's Declaration of Rights is not 

couched in terms of the federal Bill of Rights, which contains the 

repeated phrase "Congress shall make no law. . ."  Rather, rights 

are stated affirmatively:  "The right of petition. . .shall never be 

abridged," Art. 1  4; "Every person may freely speak, write and 

publish on all subjects. . ."  Art. 1  5.

     It is also noteworthy that Washington's constitution contains 

checks and balances on power missing from the federal constitution.  

The federal government now comprises four branches, the fourth being 

federal agencies created by Congress but accountable to nobody.  

This has been especially true since the U.S. Supreme Court decided 

INS V. Chadha 462 U.S. 919 (1982), which eliminated the "legislative 

veto."  Prior to that, Congress could set up agencies to administer 

programs, then oversee progress by way of committee or single-house 

vote.  In what constitutional scholar and University of Seattle Law 

School Prof. David Skover calls "the second most inane decision ever 

handed down," the U.S. Supreme Court virtually guaranteed the sort 

of petty tyranny that has resulted in this lawsuit.  (The Chadha 

decision did away with the "legislative veto," on the theory that 

not only must the enabling legislation withstand bicameral majority 

vote and presentment for veto, but each subsequent "fine-tuning" of 

the agency must be done the same way -- clearly an administratively 

impossible task.)

     Washington's constitutional delegates may not have had Chadha 

as an example, but they had seen where government power was headed.  

In Washington, the fourth branch of government is the people: agency 

heads such as the Attorney General, Secretary of State, Treasurer, 

Auditor, Superintendent of Public Instruction and Commissioner of 

Public Lands are elected, not appointed.  Judges, likewise, are 

elected.

     The framers had also seen the concept of "natural law" twisted 

until it faced the direction opposite any original concept; 

originally a guarantee of personal liberty (for example, as set 

forth in the Declaration of Independence as "inalienable rights"), 

under the influence of the robber barons of the 19th century 

"natural law" was the justification for imposition of laessez-faire 

economics, i.e., natural law prohibited the courts from interfering 

with the right of a laborer to contract for his labor, and never 

mind that the laborer starves while the company owner thrives.

     Thus, the mention of "a frequent recurrence to fundamental 

principles" being linked (uniquely at the time) to individual 

liberty, and the lack of any reference to "natural law" along with 

the absence of a separation-of-powers clause in Washington's 

constitution has led at least one scholar to argue persuasively that 

the phrase amounts to retaining the notion that natural law should 

be considered when protecting individual rights, but not when 

invoking natural law to prevent adherence with social or safety 

legislation.

       Section 32 designates extra-constitutional fundamental 
       principles as essential to the security of individual 
       right. 

Snure, supra, note 30, page 687.  Again, it is no stretch to extend 

the right to be free from unjust action when it originates from a 

federal agency as opposed to originating from a corporation or other 

state entity.

     4. Preexisting state law.

       Previously established bodies of state law, including 
       statutory law, may also bear on the granting of distinctive 
       state constitutional rights.  State law may be responsive 
       to concerns of its citizens long before they are addressed 
       by analogous constitutional claims.  Preexisting law can 
       thus help to define the scope of a constitutional right 
       later established.

Gunwall, supra, 106 Wn.2d at 61, 62.

     Much of the preexisting law leading to the "fundamental 

principles" clause is discussed above.  As for laws preexisting the 

state constitution regarding the use of marijuana, medically or 

otherwise, there were none.  Inhaling opium and operating a house 

where inhaling opium took place were made illegal by the territorial 

laws of 1881, seven years before the signing of the Washington 

constitution.  The earliest reference the plaintiff could find to 

marijuana ("cannabis") was in the Laws of 1951.  As discussed in 

Section II B 1 above, marijuana was widely and legally used in the 

last century and the early decades of this century, prohibited by 

neither state nor federal law.

     5. Differences in structure between the federal and state 

constitutions.

       The former is a grant of enumerated powers to the federal 
       government, and the latter serves to limit the sovereign 
       power which inheres directly in the people and indirectly 
       in their elected representatives.  Hence the explicit 
       affirmation of fundamental rights in our state constitution 
       may be seen as a guaranty (sic) of those rights rather than 
       as a restriction on them.

Gunwall, id.

     The plaintiff simply asks the Court to take these words at 

their face value, and look to fundamental principles, as required by 

Article I  32, to do justice.

     6. Matters of particular state interest or local concern.

       Is the subject matter local in character, or does there 
       appear to be a need for national uniformity?  The former 
       may be more appropriately addressed by resorting to the 
       state constitution.

     The plaintiff's physician is licensed to practice by the state.  

The plaintiff has undergone his cancer treatment in a state-owned 

and -regulated facility.  The state legislature has given the state 

Board of Pharmacy the power to place drugs in Schedules different 

from the federal government's determination, in RCW 69.50.201(e).  

And the state's constitution requires a "frequent recurrence to 

fundamental principles," which the federal constitution does not.  

All of these and more make clear that the plaintiff's access to 

medicine is an issue of local significance; Washington's citizens 

should not be made to suffer by bureaucratic fiat from 2,000 miles 

away.


               <B>2. Fundamental principles in Washington case law.</B>

     The state constitution requires a "frequent recurrence to 

fundamental principles," which raises the question, "What principles 

are fundamental?"

     Run the phrase "fundamental principles" through Westlaw or 

Lexis, and a sampling looks like this:

It is a fundamental principle that the imposition of business and 
  occupation tax liability must be as equitable as possible. 
  Fidelity Title Company v. State of Washington, Department of 
  Revenue, 49 Wn. App 662, 745 P.2d 530 (1987).  

<B>Reynolds Metal Company v. State, 65 Wn.2d 882, 400 P.2d 310.  Appeal</B> 
  <B>dismissed 382 US 1.60 (1965).</B>  

A fundamental principle of contract damages:  An insured should be 
  put in only as good  a position as he would have occupied had the 
  contract not been breached.  Greer v. Northwestern National 
  Insurance Company, 109 Wn.2d 191, 743 P.2d 1244 (1987).  

Fundamental principles of community property law dictate that each 
  spouse should upon his or her death have the right to dispose of 
  his or her one-half interest in community property.  Standard 
  Insurance Company v. Schwalbe, 47 Wn.  App 639, 737 P.2d 667 
  (1987).  

It is a fundamental principle that penal statutes will be strictly 
  construed as a means of assuring fairness to persons subjected to 
  the law by giving clear and unequivocal warning in language that 
  people generally would understand concerning actions that would 
  expose them to liability for penalties and what those penalties 
  would be.  State v. Enloe, 47 Wn. APp 165, 172, 734 P.2d 520 
  (1987). 

Law against discrimination (RCW 49.60) is not rooted in tort law, 
  but grows out of the fundamental principle that every citizen 
  deserves equal treatment without regard to race, color, religion, 
  sex or handicap.  Reese v. Sears Roebuck and Company, 107 Wn.2d, 
  563, 572, 731 P.2d 497 (1987).

To admit irrelevant, prejudicial evidence which would invite 
  speculation in a jury is contrary to the fundamental principles 
  of fairness and due process upon which our criminal justice 
  system is based.  State v. Smith, 106 Wn.2d 772, 780, 725 P.2d 
  951 (1986).

Fundamental principles applicable to a request for an injunction are 
  1) the proceeding is equitable and addressed to the sound 
  discretion of the trial court,  2)  The trial court is vested 
  with broad discretionary power to shape and fashion injunctive 
  relief to fit the particular facts, circumstances, and equities 
  of the case before it, and 3)  One of the essential criteria for 
  an injunctive relief is actual and substantial injury sustained 
  by the person seeking the injunction.  Brown v. Voss, 105 Wn.2d 
  366, 372, 715 P.2d 514 (1986).

General warrants and writs of assistance were "The worst instrument 
  of arbitrary power, the most destructive of English liberty and 
  the fundamental principles of law, that ever was found in an 
  English law book," and so far as they place "the liberty of every 
  man in the hands of every petty officer."  State v. Crandall, 39 
  Wn. APp 849, 855, 697 P.2d 250 (1985).  Citing the works of John 
  Adams 523-24(Chaz. F. Adams ed. Boston 1850; see also T. Taylor 
  Two Studies in Constitutional Interpretation 41 (1969)).

It is a fundamental principle regarding the attorney client 
  relationship that a fiduciary relationship exists as a matter of 
  law between an attorney and a client.  Estate of Larson, 103 
  Wn.2d 517, 520, 694 P.2d 1051 (1985).

There is a fundamental principle that every competent citizen is 
  under an obligation to further the administration of justice as a 
  matter of public policy when summoned by due process of law to 
  give evidence.  State v. Dibley, 38 Wn. APp 824, 828, 691 P.2d 
  201 (1984).

       The fundamental principle that "the required criminal 
       conduct must have existed when the conduct at issue 
       occurred" must apply to bar retroactive criminal 
       prohibitions emanating from courts as well as legislators.  
       State v. Gore, 101 Wn.2d 481, 489, 681 P.2d 227 (1984).

Fundamental principle of Washington Electoral Law is that in a 
  partisan contest there should be only one nominee from each 
  political party.  Democratic Party of Washington v. Spellman, 101 
  Wn.2d 94, 97, 675 P.2d 1222 (1984).

       It is a fundamental principle that no state may impose a 
       tax which discriminates against interstate commerce by 
       providing a direct commercial advantage to local business.  
       Department of Fisheries v. DeWatto Fish Company, 34 Wn. 
       APp 135, 146, 660 P.2d 298 (1983).

       It is a fundamental principle that when the state 
       condemns land for public use, no greater estate or 
       interest should be taken than reasonably necessary for 
       contemplated public necessity or use.  State v. McDonald, 
       98 Wn.2d 521, 530, 656 P.2d 1043 (1983).

     Clearly, case law analysis shows that "fundamental principles" 

may be found outside and in addition to the clear statements 

contained in documents such as the Bill of Rights.


               <B>3. Fundamental principles and the plaintiff's case.</B>
         
     Three cases citing Article I  32 bear on the case at bar:

The doctrine of stare decisis should not result in outmoded 19th 

  century precedents being forced to resolve 20th century disputes 

  -- automobiles should not be governed by horse and buggy laws.  

  Foote v. Grant, 55 Wn.2d 797, 806-7, 350 P.2d 870 (1960).

Likewise, in a case involving the "taking" of property by creating 

  loud jet noise in the airspace over it, the Supreme Court of 

  Washington held:

       The invention of the airplane and the development of modern 
       air transportation . . . have occurred somewhat 
       subsequently to the development of the legal concepts 
       emphasized in formulating early common law theories of 
       liability.  An awareness of these changes makes it 
       incumbent upon us to heed the advice of the framers of the 
       Washington constitution when they said: "A frequent 
       recurrence to fundamental principles is essential to the 
       security of individual right and the perpetuity of free 
       government."

Ackerman v. Port of Seattle, 55 Wn.2d 400, 407, 348 P.2d 664 

(1960)(citation omitted).  In both of the above cases, the 

correlation to the case at bar is clear: Times change, new 

information becomes known, and legal theories adequate in times past 

should be changed to do justice.

     As a direct parallel, it is a fundamental principle that a drug 

prohibited when it was believed to have no medicinal use should not 

remain prohibited after it is shown that it is beneficial, and 

indeed unique in its ability to relieve suffering.

In a much more recent case, the Supreme Court held that while 

  massive, intrusive searches of apartment buildings may in fact 

  enhance public safety,

       it is often when government is most eagerly pursuing what 
       it perceives to be the public interest that it is most 
       likely to sidestep constitutional safeguards or to 
       denigrate constitutional liberties.  For precisely such 
       reasons, our constitution wisely counsels us:

          A frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is 
       essential to the security of individual right and the 
       perpetuity of free government. . .

          We therefore cannot permit these warrants to be 
       executed, regardless of Seattle's pressing (and undoubtedly 
       laudable) desire to see its housing codes enforced.

City of Seattle v. McCready, 123 Wn.2d 260, 281, 868 P.2d 134 (1994) 

(citation omitted).

     This is precisely the case now before the Court.  The 

government "is most eagerly pursuing what it perceives to be the 

public interest" in retaining a valuable therapeutic drug in a 

prohibited category, and in doing so is violating the fundamental 

right of its citizens to be free of needless physical suffering.

     Other fundamental principles which the plaintiff asks the Court 

to consider, and recur to as the constitution requires, are these:

It is a fundamental principle that irrational laws breed disrespect 

  for the rule of law.  It is irrational to prohibit physicians 

  from prescribing marijuana while permitting them to prescribe 

  opium and cocaine.  It is irrational to force the plaintiff and 

  others in his situation to choose between physical suffering and 

  undertaking a criminal act.

Citizens of Washington who have a medical need for marijuana are 

  immune, under State v. Diana, supra, from prosecution.  It is a 

  fundamental principle that if a citizen foreseeably will not be 

  prosecuted, he should not be arrested, jailed, and put to the 

  expense, humiliation and vexation of dealing with criminal 

  charges.  This is especially true when, as is the case, the very 

  conditions which render them immune from prosecution make them 

  some of society's most helpless citizens, least able to deal with 

  such legal intrusions in their lives with any grace or dignity.

It is a fundamental principle that a physician should have access to 

  proven therapeutic drugs to relieve the suffering of his or her 

  patients.

It is a fundamental principle that the government of Washington 

  should not deny therapeutic drugs to its weakest and most 

  afflicted citizens merely to "match statutes" with federal laws 

  which are driven by political and irrational decisions, made by 

  bureaucrats who corrupt the process set forth in the enabling 

  statutes created by Congress.

It is a fundamental principle that the federal government should not 

  be permitted to withhold valuable medicine from Washington 

  citizens by first claiming that no scientific evidence supports 

  the therapeutic value of the medicine, then denying permission to 

  gather the scientific evidence to prove (or perhaps disprove) the 

  therapeutic value.


                        <B>IV. CONCLUSION</B>

     This Court, sitting in equity, should exercise its statutory 

and constitutional power to declare that the placing of marijuana in 

Schedule I, RCW 69.50.204, is a violation of the plaintiff's rights 

and liberties secured by Article I  12 and 32 of  the Constitution 

of the State of Washington.

<h2>25 More pages of the Drug Legalization Debate </h2>

<p> by Clifford A. Schaffer </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> <b>But there is a more pressing argument. I know human nature
to at least some degree. People do things for many reasons, but
primarily because they get more pleasure than pain from the
thing. Your argument is that if you remove a whole lot of the
pain from drug use, that people will not use drugs more. Are you
therefore saying that making heroin illegal causes people to want
to use it more? Why? Do people enjoy paying fines? Do they like
prison?</b> </p>

<p> <b>Please provide me with some sensible reasons why you
believe people would not use drugs more, or would use them less,
if drugs were legal.</b> </p>

<p> The basic reason is the same simple reason that most people
do not spend their days staggering around on booze. I tried it
and realized that I enjoyed being sober a whole lot more. The
vast majority of the people are the same way. As I said before,
there is nothing magical about these drugs which causes them to
be hypnotically attractive. As a matter of fact, I don't think I
would like them much myself because one of the most common
effects is to make users puke. Maybe it is hard for other people
to understand, but I don't think that puking is much fun. </p>

<p> As for inflicting pain, I must agree that is a noble goal.
Take a group of people who are not well off anyway and make it
our goal to inflict as much pain on them as we can. </p>

<p> Let's consider a certain little statistical fact. The number
of people in prison is currently only a small fraction of the
total number of users. Therefore, the current system cannot
inflict pain on more than a small number of the users and must be
seen as quite ineffective in your stated goal. Without
considering the fact that our prisons are currently overloaded,
just tell me how many more millions of people we should put in
prison to inflict the proper amount of pain. </p>

<p> <b>Please also confirm your quote to me on the percentage of
black men going to prison on drug charges. You said it was 50%.
Is that accurate? If so, what percentage of black men, in total,
abuse drugs? If 50% go to prison, total use must approach 100%.
If not, what is the figure? (I guess this has one point in your
favor. If 100% of black males now are drug abusers, legalizing
drugs would not cause the percentage to go up.) </b> </p>

<p> About half of all black men in America will be incarcerated
at least once by the time they are thirty. The source of this is
information extrapolated from the DOJ report The Prevalence of
Imprisonment, and studies by the Sentencing Project that show
that about one-fourth of the black men under 30 are _currently_
in prison, on probation, or parole. Drug offenses will be the
single biggest cause for this. The figures on drug use through
the population are about the same for whites as it is for blacks.
The disproportionately high percentage of blacks arrested can be
accounted for by a number of factors. The first is that these
laws originally were intended to target minorities and the
tactics used to enforce them tend to target minorities over
whites. For example, it is easier to pick up twenty street
dealers in a minority community than it is to get the same number
by busting middle class white houses. Also, the drug business
provides a unique opportunity for young black men. These and
other factors create a situation where, in certain inner city
neighborhoods, ninety percent of the black men have already been
to prison at least once. Also, black men are more likely to be
convicted because of poor legal representation, and more likely
to be sentenced to prison when they are convicted. </p>

<p> <b>Okay!! Finally. What other options do you have in mind?
This has the possibility of being a very productive thread. No
snide insults or sarcasm. What other options are there? </b> </p>

<p> There are quite a few. The first point that I would make is
that we should have a consistent philosophy and approach to all
recreational drugs. That is, if you would not think it good for
7-11 clerks to sell cocaine to children, then we should be
equally tough about tobacco. At the same time, if you recognize
that throwing tobacco smokers in prison would be
counterproductive, then it stands to reason that it would be
counterproductive for other drugs. Figure out what would be a
good policy for the two most dangerous drugs -- alcohol and
tobacco -- and it will be easy to figure out what should be done
about the others. </p>

<p> Judge Gray has called for &quot;regulated distribution&quot;.
His idea is that drugs would be available at government regulated
stores of some sort at prices that would be low enough to
discourage the black market. Advertising would be prohibited
under his idea and all drugs would be sold in plain wrappers with
warning information and, most importantly, a number to call to
get help. </p>

<p> The Netherlands has taken a different approach. They still
have drug laws but make it a point not to enforce them except in
cases where there are bad drugs, or people are making themselves
obnoxious. Their primary purpose is to reduce the harm done by
drugs and part of their plan is to get people to come in for
treatment. </p>

<p> In Liverpool, they are prescribing heroin and cocaine to
addicts as part of the public health service. Part of the price
of getting the prescription is that addicts must agree to stop
committing crimes and to get their lives together. </p>

<p> With some drugs, such as marijuana, it is doubtful whether
any sort of regulation is even desireable. The Dutch ignore it to
the point of allowing it to be sold openly in coffee shops and it
does not seem to cause any problems. </p>

<p> <b>Now there are burglars in my neighborhood. Some of them do
the same crime for years - and will keep on doing it for more.
Is, therefore, the threat of prison not relevant? Should we
remove that threat? Should we legalize buglary, because prison
only makes it worse? I don't think so. You have indicated that
legalizing hard drugs would lower the rate of drug abuse. Perhaps
you also believe legalizing burglary would lower that crime. I
disagree on both counts. The threat of prison is a deterrent to
potential burglars, robbers, murderers, etc. I believe it is also
a deterrent to potential drug abusers. Once addiction has been
reached, that threat is less powerful. But that does not mean we
remove it. </b> </p>

<p> I get this tired, irrelevant argument a lot. First, burglary
is not the same as drug use so comparisons of the legal methods
for controlling them are silly. Second, if we had thirty million
burglars (or criminals of any kind) we would have to find another
method of dealing with the problem just because the criminal
justice system could not handle the load. In this case it doesn't
matter what you want to do, it is a matter of what you can do. </p>

<p> <b>You also indicated that I should be imprisoned as a drug
addict. I assume you are being sarcastic again. (Which, BTW, is
rude.) Since I have now been sober for 13 years, and 15 days,
prison is not called for. However, remember that drugs took 12
years of my life. If I had been jailed in year two or three, and
that huge shock had persuaded me to stay sober, I would have
gained 9-10 years of a productive life back. I, in retrospect,
really wish that had happened. I miss those 12 years a lot. </b> </p>

<p> No, I was not being sarcastic, I was simply following the
logical conclusion of what you said. I would point out that,
under the current laws you might have done a lot more than a
couple of years in jail. And, when you got out, you would be
virtually unemployable (at anything decent, anyway) which would
have severely impacted your attempts at recovery. </p>

<p> <b>You again brought up several times that legalizing drugs
(which you oppose) in other countries lowered the rate of drug
abuse. Because of my knowledge of the way people act, I find that
either I do not understand what you mean, or your stats are
simply wrong. As I said above, if you made burglary legal, would
there be fewer of them? If you sold hamburgers for 10cents, would
we buy fewer? I just find the idea that making hard drugs
controlled, legal, and cheap would result in less use of them. </b>
</p>

<p> My point again that you are not acquainted with all of the
facts on this issue. It is happening in Europe. As one Dutch
official put it, junkies are their own worst advertisement and
they really don't need much in the way of education to persuade
people that drug addiction is something they want to avoid. </p>

<p> As I said before, I recommend that you read the CU Report,
and see the A&amp;E special which recently aired on this subject.
</p>

<p> <b>You asked about your mother being unable to get the drugs
she needs. I do not know the situation at all. I believe that any
drug that would help your mother should be available to her,
including marijuana and heroin. Of course, that is not the point
here.</b> </p>

<p> Then you do not understand a whole lot about the drug war.
The repression of medical use and research into these drugs was
an integral part of the whole campaign from the very beginning.
When the laws were first passed the drug police jailed more than
3,000 doctors, specifically aiming at those who were treating
addicts, and those who voiced disagreement with the policy. They
effectively shut down all research into the medical uses and even
research into the causes and cures for drug addiction for over
fifty years (and it is still difficult to do honest drug research
in this country). It was a deliberate, calculated reign of terror
against the medical profession which is still intact today. </p>

<p> If you will research this a little you will discover why this
reign of terror exists. That is, if these drugs are under the
province of the medical profession where they really belong, then
the whole drug prohbition will fall apart quite rapidly. </p>

<p> As I said before, your assumptions about why these laws are
here are totally wrong. The reasons you have stated never did
have anything to do with the laws. </p>

<p> <b>We have discussed this. You play with stats to advance
your point, regardless of the intellectual integrity. </b> </p>

<p> You have not presented any stats in contrast to mine, so I
wonder how you can say this. </p>

<p> <b>You also said that eight times the number that die from OD
on drugs, die from that drug use for other reasons - pneumonia,
for example. You ignored my point that many deaths would not be
attributed to drug use because there was something else handy,
such as exposure, or AIDS.</b> </p>

<p> No I didn't. I quoted the AMA figures on the subject. You
have cited nothing but your own opinion in response. </p>

<p> <b>You have again cooked your figures. Lets say a policeman
pulls over the car of a junkie tonight for erratic driving. A
search shows five rocks in his pocket. He is arrested. Knowing he
is busted, he pleads guilty. According to your figures, that cost
$150,000. Balderdash. </b> </p>

<p> Aren't we deliberately missing some points here? For every
one which does what you suggested (and there are fewer of them as
the penalties go up) there are others who fight it all the way.
The AVERAGE cost is what is being cited. </p>

<p> <b>They then build a cell - especially for him. They can't
use the one that some burglar is now leaving. </b> </p>

<p> Well, yes they could. That is what is happening now --
violent offenders are being released early so we can throw more
drug users in prison. That doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?
Therefore, in order for the law not to cause more harm than good
(by releasing another offender early) we have to build a new
prison cell. </p>

<p> <b>No - that would mean you had to prorate the cost of the
cell by everyone who uses it. Would be an honest way, but would
not boost your cause. Balderdash again. </b> </p>

<p> By what you are saying, the total number of people sent to
prison would not increase beyond what it is today -- therefore no
beneficial effect from tougher penalties. </p>

<p> <b>An official in Oakland who desperatly wanted to show how
much money was being saved by his drug program as opposed to
prison, put the cost of prison at $20,000 per year. You say
$30,000. Balderdash. </b> </p>

<p> No, the figures I used come from the Wall Street Journal and
the DOJ. The figures vary somewhat from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction, and according to the type of prison but they are
all in the same range. You can get the most current figures
yourself by calling the National Clearinghouse and Data Center
for Drugs and Crime. </p>

<p> <b>In Phoenix they put folks in tents!! Its warm, and they
have many cots like in the army, but it is cheap. And a good
deterrent. Folks don't like it. So my guess for my addict above
is about $2,000 to arrest and and convict, $1,500 for the
prorated cost of the cell, and $10,000 for the six months he
would actually serve. Comes to $13,500, as opposed to your
$450,000. </b> </p>

<p> But, of course, your guess is not any more informed than some
of your other statements. Personally, I will take the testimony
of people like Thomas Coughlin, the New York State Commissioner
of Corrections, before I would accept yours. </p>

<p> <b>I am developing a deep mistrust for your facts and
figures. Many of them _may_ be correct, but when I find some to
be in error, I know that you would deliberatly mislead if you
felt you could get away with it. So now I divide by two, an then
doubt. </b> </p>

<p> So go read the resources I have mentioned yourself. If you
had done that in the first place, we wouldn't be having this
discussion now. </p>

<p> <b>Drugs are not magical in a literal sense. They just have a
profound effect on the minds of some people, that some of those
people have compared to magic. </b> </p>

<p> I thought so. But, of course, either way it does not indicate
that prison is the correct approach. </p>

<p> <b>PatI ask you - how many more deaths, and destroyed lives,
would it take before you said legalizing drugs was a bad idea?
Will await your answer. Please make it public. Thanks. </b> </p>

<p> <b>You have dodged this question about four times now. I am
not asking your opinion on whether you think legalizing drugs
would have that effect. I am asking _If it did._ Please answer. I
think the lurkers here deserve an answer. </b> </p>

<p> As I said, I never said I supported legalization, so the
question is misdirected. If legalization is what you have stated
then I wouldn't support it whatever the figures are. </p>

<p> The answer here depends upon what you mean by
&quot;legalizing drugs&quot;. If you mean that cocaine, heroin,
etc., would be sold as freely as convenience store clerks sell
tobacco to children then it is possible that addiction and deaths
would increase, although the evidence clearly shows that they
would still not approach the death rates imposed by alcohol and
tobacco. So, even in that case, one has to wonder why the major
push should not be against alcohol and tobacco first. </p>

<p> But, of course, I am asking you if you have any evidence
(besides your own opinion) that it would increase the deaths. So
far, you have not responded to that. </p>

<p> <b>You said it is not okay with you if a junkie frys his
brain, or dies, from drug abuse. Why not, if he chooses to take
the drug? I thought that was the core of your argument - that we
had no right to interfere with him, because he could choose what
he wanted, and endure the results. Where am I missing this?</b> </p>

<p> This point is not, and never was, the core of my arguments. I
really don't care what you think about anyone's individual
&quot;right&quot; to use recreational drugs, as long as you
recognize that prison is not the proper approach in any case. </p>

<p> But, to get back to this point, let's consider a specific
example. My mother is desperately ill with severe chronic pain. I
won't bore you with the medical history, so let it suffice to say
that she has been all over the US and talked to the nation;s
leading medical experts on the subject. They have all said that
the best medications for here condition are the narcotics -
heroin and morphine. She cannot get either one because the
doctors are afraid they will be prosecuted over any questioned
prescription. In these cases, don't you think that the people who
should be making the decision on the medical use of drugs should
be the doctors, in consultation with their patients? </p>

<p> Both the Dept. of Health and Human Services and the
California Medical Association have issued reports stating that
the undertreatment of pain in this country is a &quot;national
tragedy&quot; and the only reasons for it are the fear and
ignorance created by the drug war. </p>

<p> Can we at least agree that any policy which denies medicine
to sick people has something seriously wrong with it -- both
morally and practically? </p>

<p> <b>You said it was &quot;tyranny&quot; to send a person to
prison for drug abuse, because we would be denying him his right
to make choices. Tyranny is a judgemental word. Is it tyranny to
prohibit sexual harassment? </b> </p>

<p> I never used the word &quot;tyranny&quot;. Who are your
quoting? </p>

<p> <b>((Who are we to cram our views down the throat of some
poor, middle aged, overweight, pathetic, animal of a business
manager? We are a society. We look out for each other. I won't
let that manager hurt people if I can stop it. Why? Because I
care about the people he is hurting, more than I care about his
pride. Would be willing to bankrupt him in a lawsuit, to stop
him, and the others like him, from hurting people. That same
concern is why I want drugs to remain illegal. I care about the
people who are having their lives messed up by drugs. I want it
to stop. Yes, prison is not a good way to do this, but it is the
best way I see available to us right now. </b> </p>

<p> I agree that you have a paternalistic attitude toward
interfering in other people's lives. I don't agree that prison is
the correct approach, even if your attitude was either moral or
justified. </p>

<p> It is also obvious that you are not acquainted with all the
ways we might do this. Try reading some of the studies I have
mentioned. </p>

<p> <b>If you can come up with a way that will assuredly reduce
the amount of human suffering because of drug abuse, please share
it. You know by now that I don't buy the &quot;make it legal, and
people will stop using it&quot; argument. Okay - you don't buy
prison is better than legalization. Do you have any other ideas??
What can we brainstorm? Imagine you and I were co-dictators of
this country. We could change any law, as long as we both agreed.
What would we do about drug abuse??</b> </p>

<p> A good point here, which is why I was one of the co-authors
of the Hoover Resolution. It is true that we can come to a better
solution if we will all sit down, read the facts, and discuss
them. The immediate problem here is that you are not yet
acquainted with all the facts, or the possible options. First, I
would recommend that you take a trip to the local library and
read The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs. You
will find it fascinating, whatever your views may be. </p>

<p> Or, you may just want to check out what they are doing in
Europe. </p>

<p> <b>PatDo you think some adict who chokes to death on his own
vomit is not a victim?</b> </p>

<p> <b>PeterHe &quot;victimized&quot; himself.</b> </p>

<p> <b>PatYes, that is the core of the pro-legalization argument.
</b> </p>

<p> Absolutely false. There is a lot here that you don't
understand. </p>

<p> <b>I say so what? He is just as dead. Don't you care? That
_does_ make legalization seem much more attractive. If, say, an
additional 200,000 people die in the first year, the legalizers
would simply say they &quot;victimized&quot; themselves, and
therefore it is no big thing</b> </p>

<p> First, show me some evidence that this would happen. There is
no evidence anywhere that I can find. For openers, you might try
reading some of the studies I have mentioned. </p>

<p> Second, even if it did happen, there is even less evidence
that prison is the best approach to minimizing the problem. As I
have said many times before, all the major studies said that
prison was the worst approach. </p>

<p> Third, even if it did happen (which all major studies refute)
all major studies agreed that abandoning prison would still be a
better approach. </p>

<p> Fourth, as we have discussed before, legalization and prison
are not the only options. </p>

<p> . </p>

<p> <b>Please see this point. Responding that you don't think
more peole would die is not addressing this. I am asking you
&quot;What if they _do_ die?&quot; Is that even an issue to you? </b>
</p>

<p> Sure it is. That's why I want to see an approach which works
a whole lot better than what we are doing now. Every major study
agreed that the current system kills people from a whole lot of
causes. </p>

<p> <b>You referred back to Frank again, and said that Frank was
referring to &quot;responsible&quot; freedom. I had wondered
whether, if you were with Frank, drunk, and about to climb down a
cliff, whether he would smile and nod, or try to stop you by
whatever means necessary. Frank said &quot;a situation in which
any outside authority can proscribe the actions of an individual
agent, even if the motivation is to &quot;protect&quot; that
agent &quot;from himself&quot; is indefensible. It is a god-given
right to not only be wrong, but to also injury onself,
overtly/intentionally or covertly/unintentionally.&quot;</b> </p>

<p> We have already established that tough laws and big prisons
could not stop you from harming yourself with drugs. Should we
perhaps just attach a 24-hour bodyguard to you because you are a
known risk? How about isolation? </p>

<p> <b>Now, please, lets you and I get serious. Assume
legalization is _not_ an option. Can you think up options to
lower the amount of suffering caused by drug abuse? Visits to
LARC's by high school classes?</b> </p>

<p> <b>How about producing a very long lasting drug that makes
cocaine and heroin not function? Antabuse does a similiar thing
for alcoholics, but only stays in the system for about a week
after the last use. How about prison farms, where addicts are
seperated from the general population, and spend most of their
time in education and hard manual labor, for the duration of
their sentence? Any ideas at all????</b> </p>

<p> There are lots of ideas, some of which I have already shared
with you. In Europe they are trying even more than we have
discussed here and nearly all of those programs are having better
results than what we experience here. </p>

<p> As for the prison farms and hard manual labor, I suggest
again that (assuming you are right) we should start with the
addicts we know -- namely you. What's wrong with that? It would
improve your life greatly, wouldn't it? </p>

<p> <b>So, our government is wasteful and inept. That doesn't
preclude imprisonment as being a proper course of action.</b> </p>

<p> No, but the absolute futility of this approach, combined with
the fact that every major study of the issue says it does more
harm than good would preclude it as a proper course of action. </p>

<p> I would also like to ask you exactly when prison became a
&quot;proper course of action&quot; because no such fact was ever
established when these laws were first passed. </p>

<p> <b>I know of one who died from heroin. He was in my wedding
party. I know of another who died in an automobile wreck while

know more. Perhaps if they had been in jail, they would be
statistics.</b> </p>

<p> The obvious point here is that drugs are illegal as hell but
they did not stop either one of these tragedies. This makes it
all the more curious why you would support a policy that did
nothing for your friends. </p>

<p> <b>At the risk of sounding offensive, I dare say that until
you have lived and shared in the misery associated drug addiction
and abuse, you know absolutely nothing beyond the politically
slanted statistics that you've read or have access to. Perhaps
you do know something about this misery, in which case you've let
your mind lead your heart.</b> </p>

<p> I hear this a lot and it is BS from beginning to end. First,
let me assure you that I have a pretty fair amount of experience
with addicts, as do all of the doctors and others listed in
Signer.zip. I dare say that the experience of any one of them
would far outweigh the experience you have had. </p>

<p> I don't think that knowing someone who was an addict or even
being an addict yourself provides any great insights into a
proper national policy. That gives entirely too much credit to
drugs. </p>

<p> As for not knowing anything beyond the politically slanted
statistics, it is apparent that you have not been to the library
and read the studies I have mentioned many, many times. If you
had, you would find that the statistics -- and their
interpretation -- are quite clear to anyone who has bothered to
read the evidence. As President Nixon's own commission said, the
real problem is the ignorance of our public officials who have
never bothered to read the evidence. </p>

<p> <b>Increased &quot;incidence,&quot; not increased
&quot;reports.&quot; And yes, I expect that a 25% incidence of
narcotics would indicate harm to society.</b> </p>

<p> Perhaps you are wrong here, because the major studies of the
issue stated that, despite the widespread usage, it did not seem
to be a major problem. Furthermore, even if it was, there was no
evidence presented to Congress to show that the Harrison
Narcotics Act was an appropriate approach to the problem. In
fact, as stated earlier, the medical officials in this country
felt it was not the proper approach. Furthermore, if you will
read the Consumers Union Report (which you seemed to have missed
in your trips to the library) you will find that most members of
Congress did not realize that they were passing what would turn
out to be a Prohibition law. Similarly, when hemp was outlawed in
1937, most members of Congress did not realize that they were
outlawing a commercial crop which was grown in virtually every
state in the US. </p>

<p> <b>you equate the social, economic, and political milieu of
19th century China with that of modern day America</b> </p>

<p> <b>I am not doing anything of the kind.</b> </p>

<p> It seems to me you were. But, regardless, the information you
presented did not support the stated conclusions. </p>

<p> <b>I suggest you write to the Bureau of Justice Statistics
and tell them that their figures are in error.</b> </p>

<p> I suggest you research your facts a little better. You have
missed most of the major research on this issue. </p>

<p> <b>Drug abuse imposes its own costs on society.</b> </p>

<p> True enough. The point is that there is no evidence that
prison does anything to reduce those costs. In fact, every major
study of the issue (which you missed on your trip to the library)
said it only increases the costs. </p>

<p> <b>why we shouldn't help smokers and excessive drinkers kick
the habit</b> </p>

<p> <b>Sounds like a good idea. It's the Christian thing to do.</b>
</p>

<p> So let's get really Christian and throw them all in jail for
their own good. If you are a Christian, let me ask you a simple
question. If we gave this problem to Jesus, what would he do?
Would he build bigger prisons, or would he build hospitals and
schools? Would he punish people, or would he heal them? Before
you answer, please note that I have talked to a lot of members of
the clergy and they all come back with the same answer. As one
said, &quot;Put that way, the answer is obvious.&quot; </p>

<p> <b>When the smokers start robbing me at gun point, I'll start
to worry . . .</b> </p>

<p> Then you should start to worry the minute cigarettes come
under drug Prohibition. If you had read the major studies of the
issue you would know that tobacco users commit the same kinds of
anti-social behavior as other addicts when they are deprived of
their drug of choice. </p>

<p> <b>I don't think you understand that drug addiction is
physically harmful. _American Academic Encyclopedia_:
&quot;Tolerance develops to most of the effects of these drugs,
which means that the dose must be regularly increased to maintain
a constant effect.&quot; This leads to a gradual physical
deterioration which is generally obvious in long-time junkies.</b>
</p>

<p> The statement by the American Academic Encyclopedia does not
establish any harm to the body other than increased craving. Your
statement is easily proven wrong by the doctors I have talked to
(listed in Signer.zip) who are the world's leading experts on the
subject. </p>

<p> And, of course, I have been asking everyone on this board who
Dr. William Halsted is and how he is relevant to this issue. But,
of course, you don't know such basic facts as that, so there
ain't much point in asking you, is there? </p>

<p> <b>There are only 15,000 - 20,000 hard drug users in the
Netherlands. It's a small country. I have no figures on

<p> In 1992 they had 28 deaths from heroin overdose in the entire
country. This is all the more remarkable when you consider that
heroin is usually injected and thus bypasses all the bodies
defenses against overdose. </p>

<p> <b>_Contemporary Drug Problems_ is not a &quot;book&quot; but

Leuw and Hans Nelen, who are introduced as follows:</b> </p>

<p> <b>To accuse someone of lying would be rude, and so
naturally, I have not done so. I merely express a healthy degree
of skepticism as to Cliff's statements. As to his motives, I do
not care to speculate.</b> </p>

<p> Please read Signer.zip in library 13. I met with Friedman and
others on February 23, 1993 at the Hoover Institution and signed
what became known as the Hoover Resolution. I have become
reasonably well known for this, having persuaded such people as
William Von Raab, Dear Abby, and others to support the
Resolution. If you like, I will send you the transcript of the
radio show Hugh Downs did about me. I am fairly well known in
this field so, if you knew anything about it, you would run
across my name eventually. </p>

<p> As to my motives, I have stated them quite clearly on a
number of occasions. My mother cannot get the medicine she needs.
</p>

<p> <b>To begin with, there is no need to lock them all up, and
certainly not to imprison them all simultaneously. If you read
&quot;Narctics Reform,&quot; you understand that I never
advocated locking up *all* heroin users. First-time offenders
should be allowed treatment + probation, provided they have not
committed any other offense. Subsequent drug offenses would be
punished according to an accelerated schedule: Second-time
offenders would be obliged to do some jail time, third-time
offenders would get a longer sentence, and so on. Since the
recidivism rate for drug offenses is only 30%, this would reduce
the number of addicts requiring long-term confinement to a
relative handful.</b> </p>

<p> So, let's try the question again. How many people should be
locked up? Don't give me vague generalities, give me some
numbers. </p>

<p> <b>I have not expressed any opinion, pro or con, as to the
legalization or decriminalization of marijuana. However, eleven
states have already decriminalized simple possession of
marijuana, without any obvious harmful results.</b> </p>

<p> Of course, you are not familiar with how hemp or any of the
other drugs became illegal in the first place, are you? </p>

<p> <b>I believe that the difference between promoting the
legalization of narcotics and the use of narcotics is a very fine
distinction. One leads to the other.</b> </p>

<p> Correct me if I am wrong, but I think we have already
established that you have never read the major research on the
issue and therefore would not be quite qualified to make this
judgment. As it turns out, those who are now recommending
legalization are those who have spent decades trying to limit
drug abuse. </p>

<p> <b>You prefer being robbed at gunpoint? That is a false
economy.</b> </p>

<p> If someone commits a robbery, as my good friend Judge Gray
will tell you, that is an entirely different issue and they
should be brought before a court of law. Until then, however, it
is pointless to try to control private drug use with criminal
law. </p>

<p> <b>With stubborn cases who refuse to reform, that may be the
only alternative. These represent only a small minority, however.</b>
</p>

<p> So you still have not answered the simply question of how
many should go to jail. I bet you never thought about it, did
you? </p>

<p> <b>Child-molesting doesn't *necessarily* involve violence nor
threat of violence. In the case of teen prostitution, it's a
purely commercial arrangement.</b> </p>

<p> It may interest you to know that Joseph Califano, in a report
to the governor of New York in 1980, estimated that 70 percent of
all child molestation and abuse cases are related to alcohol. So
it again brings up the question of why you aren't campaigning for
alcohol prohibition. </p>

<p> <b>Well, er, no. Not quite. Cliff said exactly this --
&quot;Wait! You just convinced me that prison is the right
approach! We ought to start by throwing the known drug addicts
(that's you) into prison &quot;for their own good.&quot; A good
twenty year stretch in the pen will change your mind about how
appealing these drugs are.&quot; </b> </p>

<p> I told you that any time you thought it would be a good idea
for you to spend ten years locked in a small room as some thug's
sexual plaything I would be more than happy to do what you think
is the best thing for you. </p>

<p> <b>I thought he was being sarcastic, and replied &quot;You
also indicated that I should be imprisoned as a drug addict. I
assume you are being sarcastic again. (Which, BTW, is rude.)
Since I have now been sober for 13 years and 15 days, prison is
not called for.&quot;</b> </p>

<p> Oh, but you are still a known risk for addiction aren't you?
How else are we going to protect you from yourself? </p>

<p> Dr. Andrew, </p>

<p> Re the issue of comparative toxicity of drugs, the following
might interest you. Marijuana is not included, of course, because
there are no recorded deaths from marijuana in human history
(source: DEA). Therefore, there would be little point in
reporting the death rate from pot. Because the death rate is
ZERO, there seems to be even less point in jailing people for its
use. </p>

<p> Actually, I think these numbers might be understated with
respect to the number of users of heroin and cocaine. Other
figures I have seen are somewhat higher and, as I mentioned, I
believe the survey method itself promotes underreporting of users
for several reasons. Therefore, it seems quite possible that the
death rates per user for heroin and cocaine may be somewhat lower
than the figures stated below. </p>

<p> With respect to the number of deaths by heroin, you may
recall that the CU Report stated that they could not find any
heroin &quot;overdose&quot; death in which they believed the
medical evidence supported the label of &quot;overdose.&quot;
Oooooops! Sorry! I forgot you haven't read the CU Report! </p>

<p> By the reasoning that you have given before (what little
actual reasoning we have seen) we ought to throw people in jail
for (fill in the blank) because this drug can kill people. By
those standards, the heaviest penalties ought to be for alcohol
and tobacco. </p>

<p> You are, of course, free to present any valid citable
information which would conflict with these figures -- but you
haven't done it yet, so I don't expect you to start now. </p>

<p> (b) Estimates vary greatly, depending upon whether all health
</p>

<p> consequences, or only those traditionally associated with </p>

<p> alcoholism, are considered. The Fifth Special Report to the </p>

<p> U.S. Congress on Alcoholism and Health from the Secretary of </p>

<p> Health and Human Services contains two references indicating </p>

<p> a death toll of 200,000: The report states, first, that
alcohol </p>

<p> &quot;plays a role in 10% of all deaths in the United
States,&quot; </p>

<p> which comes to about 200,000 deaths each year. P. vi. It
further </p>

<p> states that present estimates of the death toll from alcohol </p>

<p> abuse are as high as 93.2 per 100,000. Ibid., p. x. This </p>

<p> ratio translates into a total of about 210,000. </p>

<p> (c) These figures were determined as follows: Drug Abuse
Warning </p>

<p> Network (DAWN) heroin and cocaine fatalities for 1984, 1985, </p>

<p> and 1986 were averaged. The number of suicides was
subtracted. </p>

<p> The figures were discounted to account for deaths in which </p>

<p> both heroin and cocaine played a role. Since DAWN covers </p>

<p> about one-third of the nation's population but almost all </p>

<p> major urban areas where drug use florishes, totals were
doubled </p>

<p> to arrive at yearly estimates of 2,000 for heroin deaths and </p>

<p> 1,000 for cocaine deaths. Finally, these figures were dis- </p>

<p> counted by 80 percent in accordance with the analysis
presented </p>

<p> in the text. </p>

<p> <b>Cliff, I've been practicing medicine for 20+ yrs.</b> </p>

<p> <b>I'm also active in medical politics (currently
president-elect of the medical staff of a major tertiary care
hospital).</b> </p>

<p> <b>We have a rich tradition of communicating and discussing
among ourselves all matters relevant to clinical practice,
economics and ESPECIALLY governmental control.</b> </p>

<p> <b>The communication is accomplished via formal (peer
reviewed) journals as well as by a welter of &quot;popular&quot;
medical periodicals.</b> </p>

<p> As I said before, I will be more than happy to compare your
credentials on this subject against the credentials of the
doctors who made the statements. But let's start with the simple
points first; </p>

<p> The total amount of heroin you have prescribed in your career
is _______? Please fill in the blank. </p>

<p> If you are an average US doctor you have never laid your
hands or eyes on medicinal heroin and certainly have never
prescribed it. Therefore, it would seem obvious that your
knowledge is inferior to the doctors I have talked to who have
actually worked with it. As I also said, I will be happy to put
you in touch with some of them. As I suggested to Forrest
Johnson, you can call them yourself if you like. Try, for
instance, just calling the publich health service in Liverpool
and ask to speak with the doctors in charge of their program. I
would be interested to hear the response you get. </p>

<p> If you were really knowledgeable about the subject (like some
of the doctors I have talked to) you would also be able to tell
me about the supplies of heroin in the US which are legal, how
they got here, and what they are used for. But, of course, you
can't even tell me who Dr. William Halsted is (even though you
CLAIMED to have read the book which describes him in some detail)
so we will not move on to the hard questions. </p>

<p> Why is it that you have such a difficult time answering
simple questions? What is the problem here anyway? </p>

<p> <b>NOWHERE AND AT NO TIME HAVE I RUN ACROSS ANY MENTION OF
DOCTORS JAILED FOR TREATING PATIENTS OR VOICING DISAGREEMENT WITH
ANYTHING.</b> </p>

<p> As I said before, it is becoming increasingly apparent that
you have not read the Consumers Union Report or any of the other
studies I mentioned. If credibility is an issue, yours is fading
fast. Were you telling us all a big story when you said you read
it? </p>

<p> <b>We have one journal (Medical Economics) that searches out,
investigates and reports on ANY &quot;sensational&quot; aspect of
non-clinical MD related activity.</b> </p>

<p> <b>They would go nuts if they thought they were missing a
story such as this.</b> </p>

<p> Again, I say that you have not read the materials you said
you read. It did not happen last week, it happened immediately
after the laws were passed and had the effect of stopping all
drug research and treatment for several decades. (Did you perhaps
miss the part about &quot;several decades&quot;). </p>

<p> But, to go on to more recent matters -- It is also apparent
that you have not read the reports issued by the Department of
Health and Human Services about the undertreatment of pain, and
you are not familiar with the California Medical Association's
recent statements on the issue. Your communication is lacking.
You can get a full copy of the HHS report by calling
1-800-4CANCER. </p>

<p> Also, as I stated previously, Dr. Harvey Rose of Sacramento
was prosecuted for giving Darvon to an 84-year old woman with
crippling arthritis. It almost destroyed his practice. I will put
you in touch with him if you like. As a result of his experience,
he wrote California's Intractable Pain Treatment Act which seeks
to give doctors some protection against this kind of arbitrary
prosecution. </p>

<p> Also, in 1992, the DEA sent two Chicago doctors to prison for
prescribing Tylenol 3. As you may know (assuming you really are a
doctor -- we have had some pretenders here before) Tylenol 3 is
not even a prescription drug except in the US and South Africa,
and the US is the only country in the world which has ever jailed
a doctor for prescribing it. </p>

<p> You may also be interested in the case of Florida vs.
Martinez which appeared on Court TV and has been repeated several
times because it was such an interesting trial. Mr. Martinez is
an AIDS counselor who was handing out morphine to anyone who
would come in and ask for it. Mr. Martinez does not have any kind
of medical training (other than OJT as a AIDS counselor) and
freely admitted that he was violating both state and Federal drug
laws. His only defense was that his actions were a medical
necessity because of the barbaric policies on drugs. The
testimony was quite interesting. When the jury heard all of the
evidence they voted unanimously for acquittal and stated that Mr.
Martinez was a &quot;hero&quot;. </p>

<p> Also, my mother's doctors have stated that the specific
reason that they will not give her morphine (or heroin) is
because they are afraid of prosecution if they do. These doctors
have included the doctors at the Mayo Clinic, the National Pain
Institute, the USC Pain Clinic, etc., etc., etc. As you recall, I
asked you if you would prescribe it for her and got the usual
cop-out. Your credibility is lacking in more than one respect. </p>

<p> <b>Your inflammatory statement demands proof.</b> </p>

<p> <b>As I have said before, your credibility is fatally
jeopardized by these sorts of wildly improbable statements.</b> </p>

<p> The proof demands that you actually read the things you said
you read. Your credibility also hinges on whether you can answer
any of the simple questions I have put to you. For example: Who
was Dr. William Halsted and why is his story relevant to the
things you have said? (He asked for the umpteenth time.) </p>

<p> Frankly, I would think that anyone who had been in medical
practice for more than 20 years would be able to answer these
questions a whole lot easier. Why is it that a practicing
physician cannot answer simple questions on this issue when he
claims to be an expert? </p>

<p> <b>There was an article in my morning newspaper. . . .It
first reported that the heroin hitting the streets today is more
pure, costs less, and is more lethal. Cliff and Mona please note
- lethal means that heroin is not harmless.</b> </p>

<p> A newspaper article with an unsupported statement about drugs
</p>

<p> <b>They also quoted Lee Brown, the country's drug policy
director, as saying that since some of the stigma has been
removed, heroin is now more socially acceptable. It use is
increasing. He also said its use is increasing because you can
now get purer doses for less money. (That is fundamental economic
theory coming out again. Please note, as it gets to be a more
quality product, and the price goes down, its use goes up -
despite the Netherlands.) </b> </p>

<p> Heroin is more socially acceptable? Who does he hang around
with? </p>

<p> If quality is going up and price is going down, then
obviously the drug war is not having its desired effect. This
much seems obvious. </p>

<p> <b>He stated there are now 2.7 million hard-core, chronic
drug users in this country. </b> </p>

<p> That much is correct. How many of them do you want to put in
prison? - Recognizing, of course, that jailing them would require
TRIPLING the size of every prison and jail which now exists in
America. </p>

<p> <b>Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., was quoted ast calling
heroin a vicious drug that tempts its users into a lifetime of a
living hell. (Hmmmmmmm.... they don't, apparently, just stop the
first time they vomit.)</b> </p>

<p> Charles Schumer -- Now there is an informed, intelligent,
reliable, impartial source that you can rely on. (Being sarcastic
here, in case you didn't catch it. This guy is famous for his
ignorance of the subject.) </p>

<p> <b>Thomas Constantine, administrator of the DEA, who came
there from the New York State police, gave a short history on how
the quality and purity of heroin is increasing. Street heroin
purity has gone from 7% a decade ago to an average of 36% now. In
New York and Boston, it reaches 95%.</b> </p>

<p> So he said interdiction was not working. I think we covered
that before. </p>

<p> <b>Opium production has quadrupled in the last decade. </b> </p>

<p> Ten years ago the DEA estimated that only one percent of the
entire world's opium supply would be required to supply the
entire demand in the US. Now I guess it is down to one-fourth of
one percent. </p>

<p> <b>End of article. It appears that heroin is not harmless,
and as its quality goes up and its price goes down, its use goes
up. Lets keep it illegal. </b> </p>

<p> It appears that you have a newspaper article with a bunch of
unsubstantiated statements. Of course, even assuming that heroin
is as dangerous as stated, that still does not establish that
throwing people in prison is the best approach to the problem.
The example of alcohol is instructive in this regard. </p>

<p> So, in conclusion, you have leaped from one unsubstantiated
statement to a conclusion which would be a non-sequitir in any
case. </p>

<p> <b>You frequently take sentences one at a time, and respond,
thereby answering points I am not making. </b> </p>

<p> Yes, because the points you made in those sentences cannot be
substantiated by an evidence I have found. You proceed from wrong
information to wrong conclusions. Let's get the information right
first, and then we might be able to move on to correct
conclusions. </p>

<p> <b>Also, frequently your response is not responsive. If you
say &quot;Heroin is harmless!&quot; and I respond &quot;But
according to your stats, 20,000 people a year die from it!&quot;
it is _not_ appropriate to then say &quot;But putting them in
prisons doesn't work.&quot; Please respond to the thought, or
skip it. It is very hard to maintain a dialog when you jump
around. </b> </p>

<p> Please get it straight what I have said. I did not say that
20,000 people die every year from heroin. (If you can't get this
straight then there is all the more reason to question the other
things you say). </p>

<p> What I said was that the AMA estimated that 20,000 people die
from ALL illegal drugs from ALL causes, including overdose,
accidents, etc. </p>

<p> Simply stating the number of people who die does not provide
any support for the notion that prison is a beneficial approach.
As I have stated previously, far more people die from alcohol and
tobacco which, by your reasoning, would show that prison ought to
be an even better idea for these drugs. In order to show that
prison is a beneficial approach, it must be shown that the number
of deaths would decrease with more people put in prison -- in
some proportion that would provide a real benefit in terms of the
cost. (You know, a simple cost-benefit analysis -- which you have
stated previously you have never even seriously considered.) </p>

<p> <b>Perhaps not. The post was addressed to Mona, not you.
Please pay attention. </b> </p>

<p> You stated that a junkie's right to fry his own brains was
the core of the arguments for (for lack of a better word)
&quot;legalization&quot;. I pointed out that you are wrong. You
can take those arguments away entirely and prison is still not a
good idea. </p>

<p> <b>Okay, you are being cute. Since your true position appears
to be in favor of legalizing drugs, I will attribute that to you,
and simply ignore any more comments like the above. If I am
wrong, state your position on legalization. </b> </p>

<p> We have been over this ground before. My position is that we
should have one consistent philosophy and approach to all
recreational drugs. That would require re-thinking our approach
to not only heroin, cocaine, and marijuana, but alcohol and
tobacco as well. </p>

<p> <b>You cannot have everything both ways, Cliff. If you are
not being sarcastic, then you really do believe that I should be
imprisoned. For twenty years. Because I am an addict. Of course,
that thought is contrary to your beliefs most of the time. So do
you _really_ want me in prison because I am an _uppity_ addict?
The only things your really know about me are that I am an addict
(whom, you believe, should not be imprisoned), and I disagree
with you on this policy (and I should be imprisoned.) </b> </p>

<p> <b>Or, of course, maybe there is some hypocrisy in your
belief system. </b> </p>

<p> You are the first addict I have run across who believes that
spending ten years in a small cell as someone's girlfriend (hope
he doesn't have AIDS) would improve his life. If you really
believe it, I am willing to grant it. I don't see any other way
that we could protect you against all the harmful things you
might do to yourself. </p>

<p> <b>It is a common failure of those who get frustrated in a
discussion to take their opponents view, and change it to
something else, and then oppose that. Please stop doing that. </b>
</p>

<p> That's called setting up a straw man. You might want to take
your own advice here. </p>

<p> <b>I am truly dismayed. If an additonal 200,000 people died
in the first year alone, you would still say that your &quot;no
prison&quot; policy is best. Good grief, Cliff, how many would it
take? I was trying to pick a number high enough so you would say
&quot;If that many more people died, of course I would change my
mind about legalization.&quot; You didn't. That many deaths
wouldn't be enough. Am not sure what I can say. Doesn't make much
sense to keep raising the ante until you do say Enough. </b> </p>

<p> As I said, since I don't agree with the policy you are asking
about in the first place, then it doesn't make much sense to
answer such a question. </p>

<p> And, you seem to have missed the question that I have been
asking of everyone. What evidence do you have to show that this
(or any number of increased deaths) would happen? As I said, all
the evidence I have run across says the opposite -- and I have
named that evidence. Do you have any evidence? (Apparently
nothing besides your own opinion, right?) </p>

<p> <b>Can we at least agree that any policy which denies
medicine to sick people has something seriously wrong with it --
both morally and practically? </b> </p>

<p> <b>I agree wholeheartedly. </b> </p>

<p> See, we do agree on some things. Now let's proceed to the
next point. Why is this happening when everyone I talk to seems
to agree that it is wrong? </p>

<p> <b>Ok, an example. You state it costs an average of $450,000
to imprison someone for drug abuse. Part of that cost, according
to you, is $150,000 for building the cell. This implies that
every drug offender has to have a new cell built for him. All
must be in one man cells, and none of them are reused upon the
release of the drug abuser. This is clearly absurd. You stick by
it. I don't have to provide a stat for what the prorated use of a
cell would cost to see that. It is obvious. When I see you cook
stats like that, I then doubt all of your stats because of a
perceived lack of intellectual integrity. </b> </p>

<p> Those are the costs stated by people such as Thomas Coughlin,
the New York State Commissioner of Corrections. I will believe
him before I believe you, particularly when you have not
presented any evidence to back up your statements. </p>

<p> The cells may indeed be reused on the release of the drug
abuser, but you seem to miss the major point here. It would seem
obvious that we have not put enough of them in prison to stop the
problem. Sending a drug abuser (or better yet, a violent
criminal) out the back door when another drug abuser comes in the
front door does not accomplish anything. Therefore, the prison
population will have to increase significantly before this policy
becomes effective. The question is, at what level of prison
population will this program have a real effect? As you have
stated, you don't have a clue what the answer to that one is, so
it really doesn't matter what numbers I cite. </p>

<p> <b>Cliff, you clearly don't understand what addiction is
like. You don't understand how people become addicts. You don't
seem to be very concerned over messed up lives, or deaths, that
could be caused by legalizing drugs. If messed up lives, and
deaths, are not the issue, than what is? If those are not the
issue, than is it only the money angle? Is it the pride of your
position? What is your motivation? </b> </p>

<p> Aside from the fact that you seem to have missed my position
on this issue: </p>

<p> As I have stated, I have relatives who are addicts, including
one that I grew up with like a brother. As I have stated, while I
deplore their behavior I have to recognize that prison would not
benefit them or society. My objective is to make them whole
again, not to destroy them by turning them into someone's
girlfriend in a small steel room for ten or twenty years. You may
like that and think that is beneficial for you, but I do not
accept that as an appropriate remedy for the people I know. </p>

<p> My motivation is that I would like to </p>

<p> a) change the laws so my mother can get the medicine she
needs. Even you have agreed that denial of medicine is wrong.
(Now you need to understand why it is happening.) </p>

<p> b) develop a policy which helps people instead of destroying
them. </p>

<p> c) Destroy the mythology which surrounds this issue, which
was the original basis for these laws in the first place. It is
increasingly apparent that you do not understand how the laws
came about, and therefore have an incorrect understanding of
where we are today. </p>

<p> <b>You have asked a number of people about imprisoning
30,000,000 drug abusers. I believe that all the serious folks I
know of say they are willing to imprison enough to lower the
suffering rate. I know of no one who believes that would take
30,000,000. Am not sure how many it would take. </b> </p>

<p> That is exactly my point. The people who support this policy
(including you) have never bothered to answer (or even ask) such
basic questions as this. THAT IS THE PROBLEM. Don't feel lonesome
here, because I have asked every government official that I have
run across and all I ever get in response is a rather stupid
expression on their face. How good can this policy be if no one
has ever thought about where we are going with it? </p>

<p> <b>If I ever see that the rate of human misery is, overall,
going up because of putting drug abusers in prison, I would look
into overturning at least some of the laws. </b> </p>

<p> Then look again, and do it more closely. </p>

<p> <b>I know you have rejected my descriptions of addiction, and
how addicts act. </b> </p>

<p> Not so. I believe you completely. As I said, that is the
reason that the CU Report and others have said that drug
prohbition will not work -- because the addicts do not respond
rationally and, therefore, the laws don't mean much to them in
terms of deterrence. Obviously, the laws did not deter you. </p>

<p> <b>But please consider what I told Cliff (when he told me he
thought I should be thrown in prison). I was a practicing addict
for 12 years, and those years are now lost forever. If you had
thrown me in prison, for the typical sentence for a first time
possessor, I _might_ have been so rattled that I would have
sought help, and stopped. If you had done that in year two of the
twelve, you would have given me ten years of life back. Mona, I
really would like those years back. Prison would have been very,
very worth it. </b> </p>

<p> I have no doubt that you would like those years back. We
tried everything we could with law enforcement to give them to
you and our efforts did not succeed. That's why I think we should
have thought about it a little better and developed a plan which
might have helped you more than this one did. As far as I can
see, the only thing this policy did for you was to make treatment
less available because all the money is being spent on prisons. </p>

<p> Yes, we might have given you ten years of life back (assuming
you would respond to jail when you admit that the thought of your
own death did not deter you). You would have spent that ten years
locked in a small steel and concrete room playing the role of
someone's girlfriend. I don't know your personal sexual tastes
but, for the addicts I have known, I would not consider that as
an acceptable remedy to their problem. Most of the ones I have
seen who went through something like that wound up considerably
more screwed up than when they went in. <br>

                          <B>I. INTRODUCTION</B>

     Plaintiff Ralph Seeley, a lawyer, brought this action pro se, 

seeking a declaration that the placing of marijuana in "Schedule I" 

in RCW 69.50.204 is a violation of the liberties guaranteed by the 

Washington constitution.  The plaintiff has standing to sue because 

he is a cancer patient, facing ongoing treatment for his disease, 

who has a legitimate need for marijuana to relieve suffering, and 

cannot legally obtain it.

     The plaintiff contends that two sections of Article I of the 

Washington constitution should protect him from the withholding of a 

valuable therapeutic herb.  In brief:

Persons who need opium, cocaine, morphine, barbiturates or 

  amphetamines have the privilege of using the drugs and immunity 

  from arrest with a doctor's prescription; the plaintiff needs 

  cannabis in its vegetable state (marijuana), and has neither 

  privilege nor immunity available to him.  Article I  12, the 

  "privileges and immunities" clause, specifically prohibits such 

  arbitrary classification.

Article 1  32 states in full, "A frequent recurrence to fundamental 

  principles is essential to the security of individual right and 

  the perpetuity of free government."  Prohibiting physicians from 

  providing needed medicine to sick people has created legal and 

  social consequences which should be changed as a matter of 

  fundamental principle.

     The parties agreed to the procedural course now undertaken -- 

to file for summary judgment with simultaneous briefs, with the 

losing party to seek direct review by the Supreme Court.


                             <B>II. FACTS</B>     

     <B>A. FACTS REGARDING THE PLAINTIFF'S MEDICAL HISTORY AND USE OF</B> 
        <B>MARIJUANA.</B>

     The plaintiff was diagnosed with chordoma, a rare form of bone 

cancer, in 1986.   He has undergone eight surgeries on his spine, 

two lung surgeries (including the removal of one lung), neutron 

radiation, electron radiation, and several bouts of chemotherapy.  

Declaration of Ernest Conrad, Exhibit A; Declaration of Ralph 

Seeley, Exhibit B.

     In the course of chemotherapy, the plaintiff became so 

violently ill that he considered discontinuing the treatment and 

allowing the disease to run its course.  At the suggestion of one of 

his physicians, and after discussion with other cancer patients, he 

smoked marijuana before the next injection of chemicals.  The result 

was overwhelming.  Without smoking marijuana, the plaintiff's 

suffering from chemotherapy included hours of agony ending with 

minutes of helplessly lying in his own vomit and excrement on the 

floor, unable to summon the energy to pull the "nurse call" cord 

inches away.  After smoking marijuana, the same regimen of 

chemotherapy resulted in a mildly uncomfortable hour followed by a 

restful night's sleep.  Declaration of Seeley, Exhibit B.

     With synthetic THC (Marinol or dronabinol) and other 

antiemetics, the relief was not as effective, and the side effects 

were much more troubling.  There are three principal problems with 

legal, synthetic THC as opposed to illegal, vegetable-state 

marijuana:

The synthetic drug takes a long time to take effect -- from two to 

  four hours.  Smoking marijuana brings results in five to ten 

  minutes.

The synthetic drug dose is impossible to "titrate," or adjust, and 

  the lowest dosage supplied results in a more debilitating "high" 

  than smoking marijuana.

The "high" from the legal synthetic lasts about 14 hours, while it 

  is typically gone in four to five hours with smoked marijuana.

Declaration of Seeley, Exhibit B; Declaration of Grinspoon, Exhibit 

C.

     To stay legal, then, a patient must take the synthetic drug at 

least two hours before the chemotherapy; then plan on at least 14 

hours of being "out of commission."  If you don't take the drug two 

hours before the chemotherapy, the violent nausea takes over.  Id.

     In the two to four days following weekly chemotherapy, the 

plaintiff would undergo unpredictable onsets of violent nausea and 

diarrhea. Trying to take the prescribed synthetic THC was futile, 

because the tablets were vomited up whole.  Declaration of Seeley, 

Exhibit B.

     It cannot be over-emphasized that chemotherapy-induced nausea 

is not "an upset tummy."  It is violent, unrelenting retching and 

gagging, often accompanied by an uncontrollable release of bowel 

control.  The plaintiff underwent adriamycin/cysplatin chemotherapy 

at the University of Washington, one of the most sophisticated 

cancer-care facilities in the nation.  Yet with legal THC, he still 

wound up on the treatment room floor, as described above.

     The non-medical realities for the plaintiff during chemotherapy 

were these:

During his first bout of chemotherapy, he used legal antiemetics.  

  He was in the second  semester of the first year of law school, 

  and wrote barely passing grades.

During the second bout of chemotherapy (same chemo regimen), he 

  smoked marijuana instead of or in addition to taking prescribed 

  medications.  The chemotherapy lasted most of the law-school 

  semester, and he smoked marijuana virtually every day.  He made 

  the Dean's List, as well as winning an AmJur award for what his 

  professor stated was "the best evidence exam I have ever seen."

During the first chemotherapy, the THC tablets cost 84 cents each.  

  Later, the cost went to more than $5 each, from the same 

  pharmacy.  (The plaintiff will produce the pharmacy vials at oral 

  argument.)  This cost increase of ___ percent coincides with the 

  timing of the end of a federal program for supplying sick people 

  with vegetable-state marijuana.  The plaintiff paid nothing for 

  the vegetable-state marijuana, which was donated.  (Vegetable-

  state marijuana is typically free to sick people, since it costs 

  virtually nothing -- other than risk of imprisonment -- to 

  produce, and numerous people grow it for the exclusive use of 

  sick people.)


     <B>B. FACTS REGARDING THE LEGAL HISTORY OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA.</B>

              <B>1. Marijuana as medicine, pre-prohibition.</B>

     As summarized from Grinspoon, Marijuana, the Forbidden 

Medicine, pp 1-23 (attached to Declaration of Grinspoon, Exhibit C):

     Cannabis has been used as a soporific (sleep-inducement), 

analgesic (pain reduction), for constipation, to relieve headaches 

and nausea and numerous other health problems in various cultures 

throughout the world for more than 5,000 years.  In all those 

centuries, there has never been a death recorded as a result of 

overdose, making it one of the safest, if not the safest chemicals 

ever ingested in human beings for healing purposes.

     The first Western physician to take notice of the plant was an 

English doctor who observed its use in India, and concluded that it 

was safe and helpful.  In a report published in 11839, he wrote that 

it was an effective analgesic, and that its muscle relaxant 

properties made it "an anticonvulsive remedy of the greatest value."

     Cannabis was considered a routine part of the physician's 

pharmacopea in this country and others in the 18th and 19th 

centuries; it was even prescribed for Queen Victoria by her court 

physician.  It was listed in the United States Dispensatory in 1854.  

Commercial cannabis preparations could be bought in drug stores.

     Numerous favorable reports on the drug were published in the 

second half of the last century, remarking on how the drug differed 

from narcotics such as opium by not causing debilitating side 

effects such as loss of appetite and constipation, not causing 

addiction, and not requiring higher doses to be effective over time.

     Several developments led to the discontinuance of marijuana as 

medicine.

     First, the advent of the hypodermic syringe led to quicker 

results in pain relief by injection of narcotics -- not possible 

with cannabis because it is not soluble in water.  Next, the 

invention of synthetic drugs such as aspirin, chloral hydrate and 

barbiturates in the early part of this century had two results: 

First, as a plant, marijuana/hemp can't be patented, so profits 

drove pharmaceutical companies toward synthetics; and second, the 

dose could not be determined as specifically as with something such 

as an aspirin tablet.  (It should be noted that between 500 and 

1,000 people die of aspirin-induced bleeding every year in America, 

and barbiturates are, of course, even more dangerous.  Thus, in 

hindsight, we may question the wisdom of replacing cannabis with 

synthetics.)

     Thus, when Congress was considering the Marijuana Tax Act of 

1937, few voices in the medical community were raised in protest, 

because it appeared that no problems would be created; the act was 

aimed at recreational users.  The film Reefer Madness may be a joke 

to sophisticated people today, but it was a genuine effort on the 

part of the government to sway the public about "dangerous and 

addictive" marijuana at the time.

     The effect of the Act was to make obtaining marijuana for 

medicinal use so administratively burdensome that its use fell off 

to virtually nonexistent, and the drug was removed from the United 

States Pharmacopoeia and National Formulary in 1941.

              <B>2. Marijuana as medicine, post-prohibition.</B>

     Two social forces converged in the 1960s which have led to 

reconsideration of marijuana as medicine.  One was the "coming out 

of the closet" of recreational marijuana users, which led to the 

discovery by some ill, recreational users that smoking it helped 

more and cost less than prescribed medicines.  This led to a fund of 

"anecdotal evidence" that marijuana was effective in the treatment 

of glaucoma and spasticity from diseases such as multiple sclerosis.  

The other social force was the advent of chemotherapy for the 

attempted cure of cancer.  (Since the plaintiff has standing as a 

cancer patient, this brief will primarily deal with that aspect of 

the issue.)

     Chemotherapy is, in a word, poison.  Nurses who administer the 

chemicals wear protective clothing, face shields, and doubled rubber 

gloves, then inject the chemical directly into the patient's blood.  

Declaration of Seeley, Exhibit B.

     The concept of the treatment (roughly the same as radiation) is 

that the poison kills faster-dividing cells before it kills 

normally-growing cells.  Since tumors are virtually defined by their 

characteristic runaway, uncontrolled growth, theoretically an amount 

of poison can be administered which kills the tumor but not the 

"host organism" (in this case, the plaintiff).  The patient can only 

withstand a given amount of the therapy before dying of the cure, 

and in the process, the patient gets very sick, as described above, 

and tends to lose appetite and the ability to hold down food and 

digest it just when doing so to maintain strength and fight off the 

effects of the poison is most critical.

     A study by the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of 

Sciences released in 1981 noted the potential for therapeutic use 

and recommended further research:

       Until 10 or 15 years ago, there was virtually no 
       systematic, rigorously controlled research on the human 
       health-related effects of marijuana and its major 
       constituents.  Even now, when standardized marijuana and 
       pure synthetic cannabinoids are available for experimental 
       studies, and good qualitative methods exist. . .well-
       designed studies on human beings are relatively few.

                             * * *

       Our major recommendation is that there be a greatly 
       intensified and more comprehensive program of research into 
       the effects of marijuana on the health of the American 
       people.

"Marijuana and Health," U.S. Institute of Medicine, Washington D.C., 

prepared for National Institutes of Health, Bethesda MD, Dec. 1981, 

pages 4-5.

     Despite such recommendations by such a prestigious body of 

scientists, little research has been done, and the federal 

government has erected one roadblock after another to prevent the 

gathering of legitimate, scientific evidence, discussed further 

below.

     From the scientific studies available despite the efforts of 

the federal government, smoked marijuana has been shown to be an 

extremely effective and inexpensive remedy to counter the truly 

horrific effects of undergoing cancer chemotherapy.  Affidavit of 

Grinspoon, Exhibit C.  It is, however, illegal.


              <B>3. State statutory law.</B>

     Washington adopted the Uniform Controlled Substances Act in 

1971, under which drugs are listed in "schedules," allegedly 

depending upon their therapeutic value and the potential safety.  

RCW 69.50.  The "scheduling" of the drugs is allegedly done by the 

Board of Pharmacy.  However, this is largely a fiction, since the 

schedules simply follow the federal model, as provided under RCW 

69.50.201(a)(2); 201(e).  If any drug has been scheduled differently 

in Washington than by the federal government, it remains mysterious 

to this plaintiff as to what that drug might be.

     Marijuana is listed as a "Schedule I" drug, meaning that (1) it 

has no currently accepted therapeutic use, (2) has a high potential 

for abuse, and (3) is not safe to use under medical supervision.  

RCW 69.50.203.  (It is listed for some mysterious reason as a 

""hallucinogenic substance." RCW 69.50.204(c)(14)).  Synthetic THC, 

amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, morphine and opium are 

Schedule II drugs, meaning they have "high potential for abuse," 

"currently accepted medical use,", and "the abuse of the substance 

may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence."   RCW 

69.50.205, 206.  Barbiturates are Schedule III drugs.  RCW 

69.50.208.  In simple terms, doctors may prescribe synthetic THC, 

cocaine, morphine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, barbiturates and 

opium, but may not prescribe marijuana.

     Numerous states, including Washington, enacted legislation to 

provide marijuana to medically certified patients as a combination 

of experimental and compassionate legislation.  The Washington 

Controlled Substances Therapeutic Research Act became law in 1979 

(RCW 69.51), stating

       The legislature finds that recent research has shown that 
       the use of marijuana may alleviate the nausea and ill 
       effects of cancer chemotherapy and glaucoma.  The 
       legislature further finds that there is a need for further 
       research and experimentation regarding the use of marijuana 
       under strictly controlled circumstances. 

     The statute created a board of physicians to administer the 

program, in conjunction with federal agencies.  It was amended in 

1989 for "housekeeping" reasons (changing "department" to "board" 

and so forth), but long before, in 1981, for reasons that defy 

explanation on the surface, the legislature killed the program by 

not funding it.  Exhibit D, letter to plaintiff from Donald 

Williams, Executive Director, Board of Pharmacy.

     The alleged reason is that the research proved that THC was 

effective, and THC was synthesized and marketed as dronabinol or 

Marinol, therefore no further need for vegetable-state "smokeable" 

marijuana was required.

     For reasons set forth in Section A above, and in the 

Declaration of Grinspoon, Exhibit C, the contention is absurd.


               <B>4. State case law.</B>

     When Samuel Diana was arrested in 1977 for possession of a 

small amount of marijuana, he argued that it helped him cope with 

his multiple sclerosis better than prescribed medications.  The 

Court of Appeals held that necessity is always a potential defense 

to a crime, and remanded the case for determination, by a 

preponderance of the evidence, 

whether (1) the defendant reasonably believed his use of marijuana 

was necessary to minimize the effects of his disease; (2) whether 

the benefits derived from the drug's use are greater than the harm 

sought to be prevented by the controlled substance law; and (3) that 

no other drug is as effective in minimizing the effects of the 

disease. State v. Diana, 24 Wn. App. 908, 604 P.2d 1312 (1979). 

     With the current state of the literature on the subject, 

(especially since the release of the report of the DEA's Chief 

Administrative Law Judge in 1988, discussed further below), any 

person with glaucoma, multiple sclerosis (or other spasticity 

problems), chemotherapy-induced nausea or the AIDS "wasting 

syndrome" has no problem whatsoever meeting the first and third of 

those, leaving judges only to grapple with the issues of relative 

harm.  The result is that described in the Declaration of Andrew 

Subin, Exhibit E: Persons who need cannabis for medicinal purposes 

end up using it quasi-legally, after being arrested, posting bail, 

paying an attorney, and having their supply confiscated and not 

returned.  See also, State v. Cole, 74 Wn. App. 571, ___ P. 2d ___ 

(1994), in which (1) Division II specifically adopted the legal 

reasoning of Division III in State v. Diana, (2) the court held that 

a marijuana user's own testimony is more than a "scintilla" of 

evidence, and requires the issue of his reasonableness in using the 

drug to go to the jury, and (3) in the "facts" section of the 

opinion, it is established that a superior court judge stated, "I 

hope they get you a prescription for marijuana if that's the only 

thing that works. . .[y]ou cannot in the future grow marijuana for 

your own consumption without a prescription."  Cole at 573.  This 

demonstrates the sort of misunderstanding among judges exemplified 

in the Declaration of Subin, Exhibit E, and which results in 

unintentional but real injustice on sick and helpless people.      

     This bizarre state of affairs is a keystone to the legal 

arguments below concerning both the privileges and immunities clause 

and the "frequent recurrence to fundamental principles."


              <B>5. The federal farce.</B>

     The history of medical marijuana and federal law over the past 

three decades has resulted in untold unnecessary suffering among 

some of society's most sick and helpless individuals and their 

families; has diminished respect for the rule of law; and has 

resulted in appointed bureaucrats corrupting the system Congress set 

in place.

     The suborning of the rule of law to the hysteria of the "war on 

drugs" reads like Franz Kafka interpreting  "Through the Looking 

Glass."  It goes approximately like this:

1972: The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws 
  (NORML) petitioned the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs 
  (precursor to the DEA) to reclassify medical marijuana.  The 
  agency refused to act on the petition.  NORML appealed to the 
  U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit.

1974: The court held that the agency's position had no merit, and 
  that the petition should be processed.  NORML v. Ingersoll, 497 
  F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974).

1975: The DEA (replacing the BNDD) dismissed the petition without 
  hearing testimony.  NORML appealed.

1977: The Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal, criticizing the 
  DEA for not providing scientific and medical evaluations as 
  required by law, which were to be provided by the Department of 
  Health, Education and Welfare (HEW).  NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d 735 
  (DC Cir. 1977).

1979: Unreasonable delays resulted in NORML filing motions to 
  compel, against both DEA and HEW.  Facing sanctions, HEW produced 
  a response.  DEA then dismissed the petition once again with no 
  hearings.  NORML appealed again.

1980: The Court of Appeals for the third time reprimanded the DEA 
  and affirmed NORML's right to a "full and fair" hearing. 

1981: NORML filed another motion to compel.  Within three days the 
  agencies announced the approval of synthetic THC 
  (Marinol/dronabinol), and promised a "legislative type hearing" 
  would be forthcoming.

       1982: With no hearing yet held, NORML filed yet another 
       motion to compel.  The Court of Appeals issued a Mandatory 
       Progression Order requiring the DEA and HEW to provide 
       them with 90-day progress notes.

1986: Hearing procedures were finally set.

1987: Written affidavits, evidence and exhibits filed.  Hearings 
  were held in New Orleans and San Francisco.

1988: Further evidentiary hearings were held in Washington, D.C.  
  Oral arguments were held before the DEA's Chief Administrative 
  Law Judge, Francis L. Young.  In September, Judge Young issued 
  the 68-page "Opinion And Recommended Ruling, Findings Of Fact, 
  Conclusion Of Law And Decision Of Administrative Law Judge In The 
  Matter Of Marijuana Rescheduling Petition, Docket No. 86-22, U.S. 
  Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration."  
  (Hereinafter, "Young Opinion.") Judge Young concluded:

       The evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana 
       has been accepted  as capable of relieving the distress of 
       great numbers of very ill people, and doing so with safety 
       under medical supervision.  It would be unreasonable, 
       arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to continue to stand 
       between those sufferers and the benefits of this substance 
       in light of the evidence in this record.

  Young Opinion, page 68.  Judge Young recommended unequivocally 
  that marijuana be rescheduled as a Schedule II therapeutic drug.  
  Id.

1989: The head bureaucrat at the DEA rejected Judge Young's 
  recommendation and refused to reclassify marijuana, 
  characterizing its medical use as "a cruel and dangerous hoax."  
  54 Federal Register 53767-53785, Dec. 29, 1989, p. 53784.  NORML 
  and the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics immediately appealed.

1991: The Court remanded the case to the DEA, noting the circularity 
  of the alleged logic: The DEA administrator refused to reschedule 
  the drug because, inter alia, it did not meet the requirement for 
  "general availability of the substance" and "recognition of its 
  clinical use in generally accepted pharmacopoeia, medical 
  references, journals and textbooks," and for "recognition and use 
  of the substance by a substantial segment of the medical 
  practitioners in the United States."  The court pointed out the 
  impossibility of showing that a drug enjoys "availability" or 
  "use" when it is illegal for doctors to obtain it by virtue of it 
  being a Schedule I drug.  Likewise, the drug is not going to show 
  up in any manual or pharmacopoeia if it is illegal to prescribe 
  and illegal to possess.  Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. 
  DEA, 930 F.2d 936 (DC Cir. 1991).

1992: DEA head bureaucrat Robert Bonner issued a new Denial of 
  Petition leaving out the circular logic, but asserting boldly and 
  in direct contradiction of his Chief Administrative Law Judge's 
  opinion, that his response was based on common sense:

       Smoking causes lung cancer and other deadly diseases.  
       Americans take their medicines in pills, solutions, sprays, 
       shots, drops, creams and sometimes suppositories, but never 
       by smoking.

  Final Rule, Denial of Petition for Marijuana Rescheduling, March 
  18, 1992.

     In summary: Congress created an agency with the power to 

"schedule" drugs and to change the scheduling as new information 

became available; the agency refused to follow the mandates of 

Congress by investigating new information until forced by citizens 

to do so through court action over a span of two decades; the 

recommendation to make the change based on research and information 

was ignored by a bureaucrat relying on his own belief, superstition, 

or other imponderable reality.

     During most of the above-described decades, the federal 

government had in place a program by which some qualified sick 

people could obtain marijuana on a compassionate/experimental basis.  

It was discontinued, and no new applicants are permitted to obtain 

the drug.

1995 - The final irony:

     Through the decades, the feds have been citing a "lack of 

scientific evidence," especially since the approval of synthetic THC 

-- i.e., "there is no scientific evidence that the benefits of 

smoked marijuana are superior to those of synthetic THC."  (This 

Court may expect virtual litany of such nonsense from opposing 

counsel as these briefs are written and filed.)

     Dr. Donald Abrams of the University of California San Francisco 

spent three years obtaining the approval of the Food and Drug 

Administration for a study on that exact issue, regarding the effect 

of the two regimens (smoked versus oral) on the AIDS "wasting 

syndrome."  In April of this year, the federal government rejected 

the proposal by refusing to supply the marijuana for the experiment.  

Affidavit of Doblin, Exhibit F.

     Thus, the government contends that the prohibition of marijuana 

as medicine is justified based on lack of scientific evidence, while 

prohibiting the gathering of scientific evidence. This circular and 

cynical manipulation of logic and legal argument at the expense of 

suffering and helpless people is another cornerstone of the 

"fundamental principles" argument set forth below.


                    <B>III. LAW AND LEGAL ARGUMENT</B>

     The plaintiff is petitioning this Court for equitable relief, 

by way of a declaration that his right to be free of suffering is 

being unreasonably withheld in violation of the "privileges and 

immunities" clause of the Washington Constitution, the "frequent 

recurrence to fundamental principles" clause, or both.

     The Court's power to issue such a declaration is set forth in 

Article 4,  6 of the Constitution of the State of Washington, and 

RCW 7.24, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act.


     <B>A. THE WASHINGTON CONSTITUTION CONTAINS SAFEGUARDS TO</B>
        <B>INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY NOT FOUND IN THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.</B>

     It is well-established law that the U.S. Constitution's Bill of 

Rights, tacked on as an afterthought years after the Constitution 

itself was ratified, protects individual liberty to a lesser extent 

than Washington's constitution, in which the "Declaration of rights" 

is the first section.  Article I  1 states unequivocally that

       All political power is inherent in the people, and 
       governments. . .are established to protect and maintain 
       individual rights.

     The Supreme Court of Washington has held that even where the 

language of the two constitutions is similar, greater protection may 

be found under the state's constitution.  State v. Gunwall, 106 

Wn.2d 54, 720 P.2d 808 (1986).

     The plaintiff asks no more than to have this Court protect his 

individual right to be free of needless physical suffering, now 

being caused by his own government.


     <B>B. THE PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT UNDER</B> 
        <B>ARTICLE 1  12 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF</B> 
        <B>WASHINGTON, WHICH PROHIBITS SPECIAL PRIVILEGES AND</B> 
        <B>IMMUNITIES.</B>

               <B>1. Washington's "privileges and immunities" clause is</B> 
          <B>entitled to a more liberal interpretation to protect</B> 
          <B>individual rights than the federal constitution's</B> 
          <B>counterpart.</B>

     The "privileges and immunities" clause of the state's 

constitution is analyzed in the same manner as the "equal 

protection" clause of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 

State v. Smith, 117 Wn.2d 263, 814 P.2d 652 (1991).  That three-

prong analysis involves "levels of scrutiny" which are typically 

determinative of outcome, outlined in Smith at pages 277-79:

"Strict scrutiny" is required when a statute affects a "suspect 

  class or a fundamental right."  A law may be upheld only if it is 

  "necessary to accomplish a compelling state interest."

"Heightened" or "intermediate" scrutiny typically applies to gender-

  based classifications, but has been held to apply when the 

  challenged law affects both an important right(such as liberty) 

  and a semi-suspect class not accountable for its status (such as 

  the poor).  The test is that the law must be seen as "furthering 

  a substantial interest of the state."

Minimal scrutiny is applied absent any reason for applying the 

  higher levels.  The test is whether a "rational relationship" 

  exists between the challenged classification and a "legitimate 

  state interest."  The classification must be "purely arbitrary" 

  to overcome the presumption of constitutionality.

     In State v. Gunwall, supra., the Washington Supreme Court set 

out what have become known as "the Gunwall factors," six areas of 

analysis required to be raised and briefed before the state's 

Supreme Court will consider invoking higher standards of personal 

liberty protection under the state constitution, compared to that 

provided by the U.S. Constitution. 

     In State v. Smith, supra, Justice Utter's concurring opinion 

provided a complete analysis of the state's privileges and 

immunities clause as contrasted to the 14th Amendment analysis 

above, and concluded that all six Gunwall factors were met, 

requiring an independent analysis to determine whether a challenged 

law violates Article 1,  12.  While the majority rejected his 

analysis based on Oregon constitutional analysis (our privileges and 

immunities clause was derived from Oregon's), there was no statement 

by the majority that Washington's privileges and immunities clause 

does not provide a higher level of protection for individual rights 

than the 14th Amendment, only that "several recent decisions hold[] 

that the privileges and immunities clause and the equal protection 

clause are substantially identical and considered by this court as 

one issue.  We decline to interpret Const. art 1  12 independently 

of the Fourteenth Amendment in this decision as well."

     The plaintiff adopts Justice Utter's analysis by incorporation, 

and has attached a copy of the opinion for the convenience of the 

Court, as Exhibit G.</PRE><hr><FONT SIZE=3><A HREF="seeley-2.html">Click here for part 2</A></FONT></HTML>
