<title>Tour de Sol Rules</title>

<H1>Tour de Sol Rules</H1>
<img src="graphics/line.gif" width=98%><p>

<H3>Who Can Enter?</H3>
Anyone with an electric, hybrid electric or solar electric motorcycle, sedan, utility vehicle, or mass transit vehicle. Energy storage systems may include batteries, fuels cells, flywheels, and on-board generators using liquid or gaseous fuel.<p>


<H3>The Race: How It Work & Scoring:</H3>
Each day, the vehicles will be required to drive 60-70 miles. At the stopovers, cars may drive extra miles to accumulate "Tour Miles. "Tour Miles' is the sum of distance run within a given time frame, minus distance penalties for arrival time variations and rule infractions, as well as distance credits for successfully completed optional laps. The scoring system makes efficiency and driving range the key to winning. Speed is a factor, however, as there is a restricted amount of driving time. Range capabilities, and efficiency will be measured and acknowledged.<p>

Please see ATdS Rules for complete details.<p>

<OL>
<LI>PRODUCTION CATEGORY<br>
An electric or solar assisted electric vehicle that is for sale, and is being driven as it will be sold. Five, essentially identical vehicles, must have been sold prior to the race. Motorcycles, sedans, utility vehicles and mass transit vehicles may enter.<p> 

<LI>DISCOVERY CHANNEL COMMUTER CATEGORY<br>
A practical two or more seater electric or solar assisted electric vehicle. Conversions and purpose-built sedans, trucks and vans may enter. There are no restrictions on the energy storage system, which may be batteries, fuel cells, or flywheels.<p> 

<LI>SOLAR RACING CATEGORY:<br> 
One person solar electric vehicle that can travel at regular road speeds (25-60 mph) Tour de Sol and Sunrayce vehicles may enter. Grid charging is permitted, but a severe penalty will be levied.<p>

<LI>HYBRID CATEGORY<br>
Vehicles which use an electric motor, as well as using some other liquid or gaseous fuel used in a generator, or fuel cell, or use a flywheel.<p> 

<LI>OPEN CATEGORY:<br>
Vehicles that conform to the aims of the event but do not fall into any of the above categories. These vehicles might be two wheeled vehicles such as mopeds, motorcycles, or one-person electric vehicles.<p>
</OL>
<B>All Vehicles:</B>
<UL>
<LI>All vehicles, with the exception of the Solar Racing category vehicles, will recharge their batteries nightly by plugging into the electrical panel supplied by the race officials.
<LI>All vehicles will be registered and insured.
<li>All vehicles must pass extensive pre-event technical testing held May 20-21 in Waterbury, CT.
</UL>
<B>The Prizes:</B><p>

<OL>
<LI>"BEST PERFORMANCE" prizes will be awarded in each category based on Tour Miles. Within each category,  prizes will be awarded to various sized vehicles (sedans vs utility vehicles) with a second breakout will acknowledge the capabilities of various energy storage systems (lead acid batteries vs advanced energy storage systems such as advanced batteries, fuel cells, and flywheels)<p> 

<LI>RANGE: Greatest distance traveled in a single day without "refueling."
Present records include:
107 miles Open Category: Team New England '94

<li>NESEA ENERGY CHALLENGE will acknowledge vehicles that use the least amount of energy to travel down the road regardless of energy source or storage system. The prize will be based on efficiency as calculated from "the well to the wheels." Efficiency will be communicated as equivalent mpg of gasoline. A prize will be awarded to various vehicle sizes.<p>
</OL>

<UL>
<LI>EFFICIENCY $2,000 prize money from US DOE
based on miles/kwh (1 kilowatt hr = 8-12 cents)<p>

<UL>
<LI>Crowd Estimates: The final day of the American Tour de Sol saw crowds turn
out in each race location. An estimated 1,300 people were on hand as vehicles
left Dover, NH for the final leg of the five day race. 
<LI>Nearly 3,000 people
greeted the winning vehicles as they crossed the finish line in downtown
Portland, ME. The crowd roared loudest as a local high school entry from
Falmouth, ME arrived.
<LI>Weather, Road Conditions: Entire course overcast, dry roads.
<LI>Special Events or Occurrences: First vehicle across the finish line was the
Solectria Sunrise, the same car that set the event range record of 238 miles
without charging in yesterday's competition. 
<LI>Of the nearly four dozen
entrants, only a few (3) were unable to reach the end of the race under their
own power. "This has been the most successful events we've ever had," said
race director Nancy Hazard. "Vehicle performance has been outstanding and the
public reaction has been overwhelming wherever we went." 
<LI>Race officials
estimate more than 45,000 people turned out to view vehicles along the race
route and at public displays along the way.
<LI>Preview of Next Day: All the competing vehicles will be on display throughout
the day in downtown Portland. Tomorrow, Saturday, vehicles will be on display
and will compete in local events as part of the Maine Solar Blast Festival.

<H3>NOTES ON TODAY'S COMPETITION:</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Crowd Estimates: Morning display and start line at Minuteman Sci.-Tech. H.S.
in Lexington, MA brought out more than 1,500 people despite some early
showers. Later, in Exeter, NH a huge, cheering crowd estimated at nearly
3,000 people greeted the race teams.
<LI>Weather, Road Conditions: Entire course overcast, wet roads, challenging for
solar vehicles.
<LI>Special Events or Occurrences: Exeter is a tiny town in Southern NH (pop.
about 9,000) but nearly 3,000 people visited the midday display and starting
line. "There were so many people crowded around every vehicle, you could
hardly see any of the vehicles," said Nancy Hazard, race director. ATdS
<LI>Technical Director Dr. Rob Wills reports that special measurements are being
done as vehicles recharge. The measurements are part of an electric
utility-sponsored research program to prepare local electric companies for
increased demand for power as electric cars become more common. "The electric
companies know that electric vehicles are on the horizon," said Wills. "They
want to make sure they know how to handle them properly right from the
beginning." 
<LI>In addition to the large crowds, Exeter, NH had a bandstand and
live music. 
<LI>Race vehicles had to be carefully guided through crowds of
dancing youngsters as they began their afternoon trip to Dover, NH.
<LI>Preview of Next Day: After spending the evening in Dover, NH, nearly four
dozen race vehicles will be on display Friday morning in Dover. At 10 a.m.,
cars will race the final leg to downtown Portland, ME. After crossing the
finish line, there will be a public display at Monument Square throughout the
afternoon. Vehicles will be on display and compete in events at the Maine
Solar Blast on Saturday.

<LI>Crowd Estimates: Morning display and start line in Keene, NH brought out more
than 2,000 people.
<LI>Weather, Road Conditions: Entire course sunny, mild, optimum conditions for
all vehicles.
<LI>Special Events or Occurrences: Overall vehicle performances continue to
surprise race officials. "There is no doubt," says technical director Dr.
Robert Wills, "that the people working in electric vehicles are making great
strides each year as measured by their vehicles' performance in this event."
<LI>Hundreds of school children visited the electric and solar vehicle display in
Keene. For the first time in event history, youngsters sought autographs from
race team members. College and high school teams were especially popular with
kids. "We were amazed to see children chasing after drivers to get
autographs," said race director Nancy Hazard. "It was so exciting to see our
teams treated like celebrities. They were all surprised and pleased at the
attention." Youngsters gathered around race teams and spent nearly two  hours
asking questions about cars, batteries, solar-power and environmental issues.
<LI>Largest crowds gathered around the futuristic-looking solar-powered racing
cars.
<LI>Preview of Next Day: Thursday, displays in Lexington, MA; Exeter, NH; and
Dover, NH. Because of the number of race "legs" on Thursday, several teams
will have an opportunity to set range and distance records. Friday, nearly
four dozen vehicles are expected to cross the finish line in downtown
Portland, ME.

<H3>History:  The history of electric cars is longer than that of internal combustion vehicles.</H3>

<DIR>
<LI>The first electric car was built in Scotland in 1837, by Robert Davidson.
<LI>EV's were widely produced in the 1880's when the lead acid battery was perfected.
<LI>2,000 taxi cabs were manufactured for New York's Fifth Avenue Coach Co.
<LI>1892 - First production electric car created a sensation when exhibited in Chicago.
<LI>1899 - Belgian-built electric racing car "La Jamais Contente" (Never Satisfied) set a world land speed record of 68 mph.  In 1902 that record was broken by a gasoline powered car, and the gas car has retained that record.
<LI>1910 - electric vehicle's first heyday and were a favorite of the women.  They were clean, quiet and easy to start.
<LI>1913 - twenty companies were producing 6,000 electric vehicles and trucks per year.
<LI>By 1930, the introduction of the electric starter, and Ford's Model T had virtually eliminated electric vehicle companies.
<LI>1973 - Oil Embargo and a resurgence of interest in electric vehicles.
<LI>1976 - Congress passed the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Research and Development Act over protests from Detroit, and the veto of then President Gerald Ford.
<LI>By 1977, Japan had 13,000 EV's in operation, Great Britain had 70,000 and the United States had 3,000 with projections of 25 million by the year 2000.  Gas prices were then lowered and the electric car declined again.
<li>The 1980's saw the resurgence of the electric car as races such as the Tour de Sol in Switzerland started in 1982, and the World Solar Challenge in Australia in 1987.
</DIR>

<H3>Other proposed Alternatives:</H3>
 <DIR>
<LI>Cars that run on ethanol, methanol and compressed natural gas produce less emissions than conventional automobiles, but savings are only in the 20-50% range, and do not appreciably reduce carbon dioxide the greenhouse gas. (Source: Environmental Action, July 1989)
<LI>Electric rail can reduce emissions by 50-90%.
<LI>(Source: Mass Transit: Clean Air Alternative, a report by the American Public Transit Assn.)

<B>Efficiency</B> - the efficiency of an electric car is measured in miles per kilowatt hour (kwh) of electricity, which typically costs 8-12 cents.  Efficiency usually refers to the amount of energy drawn from the battery to enable the car to drive down the road. Typically, an electric sedan can drive 4-9 miles on one kwh. Utility vehicles such as vans and pick-ups drive 1-5 miles on one kwh. Motor scooters, one person solar racing cars can achieve driving efficiencies of 18-26 miles per kwh, or 250 miles for $1.00.  Efficiency depends on the weight and aerodynamics of the car, and the efficiency of the motor and drive train. Other efficiencies which are not considered above, but are looked at by the NESEA Energy Challenge, include electrical generation, electrical distribution, charger and battery efficiencies.<P>

<B>Electric Vehicle (EV)</B> - a car, bus, van, or motorcycle with an electric motor which is powered by electricity stored in a battery, flywheel  or fuel cell.<P>

<B>EV</B> - see electric vehicle<P>

<B>Flywheel</B> - a mechanical device that stores energy by spinning an object at very high speeds.<P>

<B>Fuel Cell</B> - battery-like unit that converts a fuel, such as hydrogen or methanol directly to electricity.<P>

<B>Grid, or Electric grid</B> - network of transmission lines, substations, distribution lines, and transformers used in transmitting electricity from power plants to users.<P>

<B>Grid Power</B> - electricity generated and distributed by a large electric utility company.<P>

<B>Grid Charged</B> - charged from electricity generated by a large electric utility company.<P>

<B>Hybrid Electric Cars</B> - a car that has both an electric motor and a small fossil fuel powered internal combustion engine generating electricity, or flywheel, or fuel cell. The fossil fuel powered generators run at constant speed so they are very efficient, usually complying with the ULEV (Ultra Low Emission Vehicle) specifications set by California.<P>


<B>LEV</B> - Low Emission Vehicle as defined by the California Air Resources Board (CARB)<P>

<B>Non-polluting</B> - does not produce substances commonly recognized as harmful to humans or the earth.  Common air pollutants are carbon dioxide, sulfurous oxides, nitrous oxides, hydrocarbons, and CFC's (see FACT SHEET: Transportation, Energy and the Environment)<P>

<B>Photovoltaics, or PV</B> - a device that converts light directly into electricity.  Photovoltaics produce direct current or DC current and are sometimes referred to as solar cells, photovoltaic cells, or PVs.<P>
 
<B>Production Prototype</B> - a product, or car, which is being considered for mass production.<P>

<B>PV</B> - see photovoltaics.<P>

<B>Range</B> - the distance an electric car can travel before the batteries need to be recharged.<P>

<B>Solar</B> - of, derived from, or relating to the sun.  Produced or operated by the action of the sun's light or heat.  Electricity generated directly from the sun's light = solar electricity.<br>

      Heat generated by the sun = solar thermal energy.  Solar thermal energy may ultimately be converted to electricity.  Some people consider wind a form of solar energy.<P>

<B>Solar Car, Solar/electric Car, or Solar-assisted Electric Car</B> - an electric car whose batteries are charged wholly or partially by electricity produced by photovoltaic cells which are installed on the car.  PV panels can produce enough electricity to travel from 5-250 miles per day.  The range is dependent upon the size (sq. ft) and efficiency of the PV cells, and the efficiency of the car itself.  Commuter cars typically gain 5-15 miles per day, while some racing cars can travel 250 miles on a sunny day.<P> 
 
<B>Solar Electricity</B> - electricity which is produced by the light from the sun.  The photovoltaic cell is the mechanism used for the electrical generation.<P>

<B>Solar Cells</B> - see photovoltaics.<P>

<B>Torque</B> - a force that produces, or tends to produce rotation and the measure of the effectiveness of that force.<P>

<B>ULEV</B> - Ultra Low Emission Vehicle as defined by the California Air Resources Board (CARB)<P>

<B>ZEV</B> - Zero Emission Vehicle as defined by the California Air Resources Board (CARB)<P>

<H3>The American Tour de Sol</H3> The American Tour de Sol is an eight day
electric and solar vehicle road rally event from Connecticut to Maine,
with free public displays in nine different communities. It was started in
1989 by the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association of Greenfield, MA to 
bring practical electric vehicles into everyday use.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=left HSPACE=3 SRC="graphics/gas.gif" WIDTH=148 HEIGHT=205> The
event has grown from a back-yard event with six solar racing cars, to a
rally of international significance, showcasing 50 vehicles built by major
auto manufacturers, electric vehicle manufacturers, individuals and
students from North America and abroad. With over 55% of the air pollution
in the Northeast caused by fossil-fueled transportation, electric
transportation offers a practical solution today.<p>

There were thousands of interested spectators along the route and you can
read about the impressive results through these web pages.  NESEA wishes
to thank <A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/">NREL</A> and its director, Dr.
Charles Gay, for supporting this web site.<P>

<H3>NEWS RELEASE<br>
FOR RELEASE: May 20, 1995--CONTACT: Jack Groh (401)732-1551</H3>
                               
<H3>NATIONAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHAMPIONSHIP AT STAKE:<br>
DOZENS OF TEAMS COMPETING IN FIVE-STATE ROAD RALLY</H3>

WATERBURY, Conn. - The cream of the electric vehicle crop is racing through
the Northeast United States during the weeklong American Tour de Sol. The
race begins Monday May 22 in Waterbury, Connecticut. The winning vehicles
will cross the finish line in Portland, Maine five days later. This year's
race features entries from major automakers (Ford), a celebrity race team
(headed by actor Dennis Weaver), top student teams and entries from as far
away as Japan and Germany.<P>

        The American Tour de Sol ends on Memorial Day weekend and provides an
interesting contrast to the Indy 500 race run on the same weekend. "At the
same time Indy cars are roaring to victory in the national spotlight," says
Nancy Hazard of the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association, "these electric
cars are quietly revolutionizing auto technology. They can help ease the
United States trade deficit by cutting oil imports and create jobs here at
home. At the same time, they keep the country cleaner and can cut the cost of
treating air pollution-related illness. This isn't some starry-eyed dream -
the technology is available today!"<P>

        One of the key goals of the American Tour de Sol is to show that these 
new vehicle technologies are viable. "A major concern about electric cars has
been their driving range," says Hazard, "but after more than ten thousand
miles of daily commuter use in Vermont, the state's electric vehicle project
has yet to log one complaint tied to vehicle range." Over the six-year
history of the American Tour de Sol, range records have been consistently set
and broken. In last year's event, a Ford Ecostar traveled 189 miles and a
Solectria Force traveled 214 miles, both without recharging. Both of these
companies have electric vehicles available on the market.<P>

        Nearly fifty vehicles will run through two days of testing in Waterbury
prior to the race start. Along the route, there will be nearly a dozen local
stops where the race cars will be displayed to the public. Once the race ends
in Portland, another day is set aside for displays and exhibits. Vehicles
competing this year include solar-powered racers, practical commuter
vehicles, production cars already on the market, hybrid vehicles which use
electric motors in combination with an auxiliary generator, and special
vehicles such as buses, motorcycles and scooters.<P>

        Speed, range and efficiency are all factored into the scoring system.
Vehicles that travel the farthest and use the least electricity per mile have
the advantage. In fact, one of the many prizes offered is called the "NESEA
Energy Challenge." This prize is given to the vehicle that uses the least
amount of energy to drive the entire 300 mile course.<P>

        Daily updates including photos, background articles, in-depth profiles 
of individual teams and entries, and even soundbites from race officials are
available, starting May 17, on the World Wide Web. The ATdS Home Page is
provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado. The
internet address is <http://nesea.nrel.gov><P>

        Major sponsors of the 1995 American Tour de Sol include the United 
States Department of Energy, the Waterbury (Connecticut) Region Visitor and
Convention Bureau, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, the
Federal Highway Administration, the Maine Solar Blast and the Discovery

<H3>NATIONAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE RECORDS BROKEN:<br>
CHAMPIONSHIP EVENT PROMPTS DOUBLE CELEBRATION</H3>

DOVER, N.H. - Electric vehicle race teams are celebrating tonight in this
small Southern New Hampshire town. Two vehicles competing in the national
championship American Tour de Sol road rally broke event records late on
Thursday, one day before the end of this annual competition. One team
represents a top electric vehicle manufacturer, the other a small high school
in Connecticut.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=left HSPACE=3 SRC="graphics/solar63.GIF" WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=162>
<br>
        A four-seater sedan built by Solectria Corporation of Massachusetts 
traveled
a record 238 miles without stopping to recharge during day four of the five
day race. The car, known as the Sunrise, is a pre-production prototype which
the company is developing for the U.S. market. It is powered by advanced
nickel metal hydride batteries manufactured by Ovonic of Troy. MI.<p> [This picture was taken in Lexington and as you can see, it's hard to see it due to the number of people admiring it.]<br><p>
        Another event record was set by a team of veteran electric vehicle 
builders
and designers from Bolton (CT) High School. Their vehicle, called the Solar
Bolt, traveled 143 miles, a record performance for a vehicle powered only by
common, lead-acid batteries - the same type of batteries used to start
regular gasoline powered cars. The Bolton High School students have built and
raced electric vehicles for three years and broke the record they set
themselves in last year's race.<p>
        "We have been waiting all week for this to happen," said race technical
director Dr. Rob Wills. "In pre-race testing we were all impressed by these
vehicles and knew they had the capability of breaking records. Today, the
suspense ended." Groups of drivers and race officials stood and cheered as
the two vehicles returned to a display area set up in Dover, NH.<p>
        Both record-setting vehicles are entered in the Discovery Channel 
Commuter
Category, designed for practical, commuter-style electric vehicles capable of
carrying more than one passenger.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=right HSPACE=3 SRC="graphics/solar63a.GIF" WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=216>
        "We wanted to show that we can produce an electric car with range, 
comfort
and affordability - and the Sunrise is that car," said Solectria spokesperson
Mark Dockser. "When the electric vehicle mandates go into effect in 1988, we
want to give buyers the option they've been looking for."<p>
        The race began Monday, May 22 in Waterbury, CT and ends Friday, May 26 
in
downtown Portland, ME. This is the seventh annual American Tour de Sol, the
premier electric vehicle competition in North America.<p>
        The American Tour de Sol is organized by the Northeast Sustainable 
Energy
Association (NESEA), the nation's leading regional association involved in
promoting awareness, understanding and development of non-polluting,
renewable energy technologies. Headquartered in Greenfield, Massachusetts,
NESEA is celebrating its 20th year of working successfully in the fields of
transportation, building construction and energy.

<H3>WINNING VEHICLES BREAK RECORDS:<br>
ELECTRIC CAR CHAMPS CROSS FINISH LINE</H3>
<IMG ALIGN=left HSPACE=3 SRC="graphics/winner.GIF" WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=162>

PORTLAND, Maine - Nearly three thousand spectators cheered and shouted as the
winning electric vehicles crossed the finish line in downtown Portland on
Friday.<p>

 First vehicle across the finish was the Sunrise, a pre-production
prototype car built by Massachusetts-based Solectria Corporation which, one
day earlier, had set the event record, traveling 238 miles without
recharging. The Sunrise was also the overall top finisher in the week-long
American Tour de Sol national championship road rally for electric and solar
electric vehicles.<P>

        The second top finisher was a Solectria-built Force GT raced and 
sponsored
by a team from the Virginia Power Company. The third finisher and also the
top finishing utility vehicle in the event, was a Ford Ecostar sponsored and
raced by Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities. Both the Force GT and the
Ecostar are currently in production and available on the market.<P>

<IMG ALIGN=right HSPACE=3 SRC="graphics/bolton.GIF" WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=162>
        Among students entries, the top scoring vehicles were from Mt Everett 
High
School in Sheffield, MA, Bolton (CT) High School and the Salisbury School in
Connecticut. The Mt. Everett vehicle was the top hybrid vehicle, one that
runs on electricity and also carries an on-board generator to recharge
batteries while on the road.<P>

        The Bolton High School entry was the top scoring student entry in the
Discovery Channel Commuter Category - the largest category in the American
Tour de Sol. This vehicle, called the Solar Bolt, also set an American Tour
de Sol record for vehicles powered by common, lead-acid batteries by
traveling 143 miles without recharging.<P>

        The other top student entry, built by students of the Salisbury School, was
the winning solar racing vehicle in this year's event. The solar racers are
designed with large "wings" covered with solar cells. These vehicles, built
specially for competition, run entirely on sunlight.<P>

        "This was the top field of electric vehicles we've ever had in the 
American
Tour de Sol," said race technical director Dr. Rob Wills. "There is no doubt
in my mind that what we've seen develop here is a technology and an industry
that can effectively meet transportation and environmental needs." Dr. Wills
said race officials were particularly impressed by the Solectria Sunrise.
"This may be the one everybody's been waiting for. Something that's clean
running, attractive and performs even better, in many ways, than a
gasoline-powered car."<P>

        Major sponsors of the 1995 American Tour de Sol include the United 
States
Department of Energy, the Waterbury (Connecticut) Region Visitor and
Convention Bureau, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, the
Federal Highway Administration, the Maine Solar Blast and the Discovery
Channel.<P>

        The American Tour de Sol is organized by the Northeast Sustainable 
Energy
Association (NESEA), the nation's leading regional association involved in
promoting awareness, understanding and development of non-polluting,
renewable energy technologies. Headquartered in Greenfield, Massachusetts,
NESEA is celebrating its 20th year of working successfully in the fields of
transportation, building construction and energy.

<H3>NEWS RELEASE<br>
FOR RELEASE: June 8, 1995--CONTACT:  Jack Groh (401)732-1551</H3>
<H3>ELECTRIC CARS PROVEN
TWICE AS EFFICIENT AS GASOLINE MODELS</H3>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=3 SRC="graphics/batpower.gif" width=216
height=162>GREENFIELD, Mass. - For the first time, gasoline and
electric-powered cars have been tested against each other in real-world
conditions - and the electric cars ran away with the prize. A week-long
series of tests found the top-ranked electric vehicles twi


ce as energy efficient as even the best gasoline-powered subcompact cars.<P>

	Testing was done during the annual American Tour de Sol electric vehicle race in May. During that event, four dozen vehicles - electric, solar and hybrid electric - raced more than 300 miles through the Northeast in road-rally style. They were joined by 









a "control" car - a 1995 Geo Metro sedan, one of the best mileage cars produced in the U.S. The gasoline-powered Metro traveled 35.8 miles per equivalent gallon while another Geo Metro, converted to electric power by Solectria Corporation in Massachusetts









, turned in an incredible 65.2 miles per equivalent gallon.<P>

	"This is the first time anyone has done a head-to-head test like this," according to race director Nancy Hazard. "We now know the electric cars make sense for energy conservation as well as environmental quality."<P>

	The top performer in the entire race was a four-seater, pre-production prototype vehicle also built by Solectria. This car, called the Sunrise, achieved a record 70.7 miles per equivalent gallon - a performance that exceeds President Clinton's challenge 









to triple the fuel efficiency of the present automobile by the year 2004. The Sunrise also won the first annual "NESEA Energy Challenge" award. Northeast Sustainable Energy Association (NESEA) offered the prize for the most efficient vehicle in each of fo









ur categories: two-seater and four-seater sedans, utility vehicles (truck or van) and motorcycles.<P>

	"Although we have been collecting efficiency data for the past six years at the American Tour de Sol, this is the first time we had the equipment necessary to compare energy use of electric, hybrid electric, and conventional gasoline vehicles," said Dr. 









Robert Wills, technical director of the race. "After collecting the data, we used crude oil as a benchmark and adjusted for the losses involved in refining gasoline or producing and transmitting electricity. We call this the  'well to wheels' efficiency o









f the vehicle."<P>

	The 1995 Geo Metro was chosen as a control vehicle because it is state-of-the-art and very efficient and it is often used as the basis for electric conversions. During the American Tour de Sol, it traveled 45 miles to the gallon which translates to 35.8 









miles per equivalent gallon after adjusting for losses incurred when making gasoline from crude oil. To translate energy use of the electric vehicles to equivalent miles per gallon, the efficiency of a similarly state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power pl









ant (51 percent efficient) and transmission losses of 7.5 percent were used.<P>

	In other words, a gallon of crude oil turned into gasoline gets you 35 miles down the road. But turning the same gallon of crude oil into electric vehicle power and you travel 70 miles down the road.<P>

	Other award winners included the Ford Ecostar, the most efficient utility vehicle, which drove 58.7 miles per equivalent gallon. The motorcycle prize went to the Schiller Group from Germany whose pre-production prototype, the Erange, traveled 245 miles p









er equivalent gallon.<P>

	This year's three hybrid vehicles where less efficiency than was hoped for, but the expected broad field of hybrids in next year's event should demonstrate the potential of this technology.<P>

	The "NESEA Energy Challenge" was created to bring attention to the importance of using the least energy possible to power our transportation system which accounts for 62 percent of the oil usage in the United States. Improving the efficiency of automobil









es can substantially cut our trade deficit, one-third of which is caused by imported oil.<P>

		The Northeast Sustainable Energy Association (NESEA) is the nation's leading regional association involved in promoting awareness, understanding and development of non-polluting, renewable energy technologies. Headquartered in Greenfield, Massachusetts,









 NESEA is celebrating its 20th year of working successfully in the fields
of transportation, building construction and energy.

<H1>Tour de Sol Email from the Race</H1>


Date: Sun, 21 May 1995 13:26:25 -0400
From: Michael H Bianchi <bianchi@bellcore.com>

<H3>Subject: American Tour de Sol, 1995: Day 1 </H3>

Whoever is in charge of ordering the weather this year once again gets our
praise.  It was a perfect spring day Sunday at Library Park in Waterbury CT.
The event promises to be more interesting than ever, with a bus, several
custom made cars, 3 hybrid powered cars, a car constructed by an ELEMENTARY(!) school team, plus cars from Japan, the Czech Republic, and Canada in the race.<P>

But, I arrived before most of the cars were here, so I started my interviews
with Jay Tarler who was working on the charging panel that was donated by
General Public Utilities, General Electric and Northeast Utilities to NESEA
last year.  This panel has a capacity of over 600 amperes, 3-phase (delta).
There are 4 subpanels and 81(!) plugs.  Most of the plugs are rated either 120
volts at 20 or 30 amps or 240 at 15, 20, and 30 amps, plus a couple of 3-phase 50 amp outlets used last year by the Chrylser mini-vans.  All the outlets are protected by Ground Fault Interrupters (GFIs).  <P>

This year, each car's charger will be connected to it's own Watt-hour meter, they can measure exactly how much energy was delivered to each car.  Each car also has its own Watt-hour meter on the leads to the motor, so the energy actually delivered to the motor will also be measured.  In this way, the total energy used for charging can be compared to the energy that actually results in propelling the car and thus the efficiency of the charging/storage/controller system can be calculated.<P>
  
In
addition, the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association (NESEA, the sponsor of
the race) has issued what American Tour de Sol (ATdS) Director Nancy Hazard
calls the "NESEA Energy Challenge".  The idea is to quantify the amount of
energy (measured in equivalent barrels of oil) it takes to move different cars
down the road.  This metering will let them calculate a "wells to wheels
energy (measured in equivalent barrels of oil) it takes to move different cars
down the road.  This metering will let them calculate a "wells to wheels
efficiency rating" for traditional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles,
pure Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Hybrid-Electric Vehicles (HEVs).<P>

        Bob Goodrich, who built the original ATdS charging panels, now retired
from Northeast Utilities, will be doing the calculations, which will include
estimates for the efficiency of the power plant (modeled as a modern turbine
oil-fired plant), the transmission line loss, etc.  The results will be in a
paper to be presented at the Sustainable Transportation/Solar and Electric
Vehicles conference this fall.  The efficiency study is funded by the Electric
Power Research Institute (EPRI).          <P>

In addition to the vehicle system
efficiency measures, there is an additional test, funded by a grant from the
Electric Vehicle Research Network, that looks at the "quality" of the
electricity at the charging station.  Of particular interest is the so-called
"charger harmonics".  At last year's race, several cars wound up not getting
full charges because the circuit breakers kicked out.  The culprit was rumored
to be the "harmonics", essentially electrical noise created by the charger on
the electric line, that caused the breakers to trip.  Look for more on all
this later.<P>

Ah, but you probably really wanted to hear about cars!<P>

The Solar Bolt, number 61 from Bolton High School, Bolton CT, is the
returning
Lead-Acid battery Champion.  In the 1994 ATdS, this car did 141.7 miles on a
single charge on a 120 Volt, Trojan T145 battery, Advanced DC motor and a
Curtis controller.  Tom Aitkin and Brad Koerner said that, in fact, the
Curtis
controller died a couple of days ago, and they have replaced it with the new
500 amp Curtis.  Other than that, it is the same electrical system, including
the same batteries.  The only modification is an extension to the belly pan
to
close an air-gap.  The car itself is adapted from a 1974 Fiat, found rusting
in the woods.<P>

Another returning vehicle, after skipping last year's race is number 83, the
Sol Survivor III by the ConVal Solar Race Car Team which will be in the Solar
Racing category.  (No plugging in allowed!)  Paul Waterman, and advisor to the
high school team from Dublin, NH, said that they haven't been idle.  Last year
the car climbed Mt. Washington in the "Race to the Clouds".  The car has been
much improved.  It now has a second motor as a result of the hill climbing
experience, better instrumentation to aid in energy management, and a student
team with each member performing specific functions; mechanics, electricals,
cooks, first aid, etc.  The car body is somewhat modified from two years ago,
with a larger spoiler (topped with solar cells) that is moved rearward quite a
distance so as not to shadow the solar cells on the roof.  There are also
solar cells on the hood, and a panel that is carried in the car that can be
set up at each stop to collect some extra rays.  The solar panels total 680
watts.  The energy system charges 60 Volts of GNB sealed gel-pack batteries.
The two motors are each 6 Horse Power (HP) brushed DC motors which drive the
wheels through a two-speed transmission.  Top speed is somewhere above 50
mph,
but the most efficient speed is closer to 30 mph.  And when it climbed Mt
Washington, it made about 25 mph.<P>

Larry Dussault is the editor of the Great Lakes Electric Auto Association (GLEAA) and the Great Lakes Electric Auto News (GLEAN), although he claims
the
GLs now stand for GLobal, since they have over 3,000 members from around the
world.  He and Michael Beebe are here from Ohio with the ZeeVee 88, number
67.
Why 88?  "8 hours to recharge, and we are looking for 80 miles to a charge."
The car has a Honda Civic frame, with an added integrated roll cage around
the
driver, a custom fiberglass body, two seats, convertable hard-top, and a
gross
weight of 2300 pounds (with driver).  The 120 Volt Genisis battery system
consists of 3 strings in parallel (30 of the 26 amp-hour units!).  The Curtis
500-amp controller drives an Advanced DC motor.  It is for sale!  A mere
$30,000 will get you this beautiful, bright red car.  513 599-1233. Michael Beebe earns at least some of his living by testing vehicles.  He and
Bob Batson gave a very compelling pair of safety talks at the ST/SEV
conference last fall.  At the ATdS this year, Michael and Gary Carr are going
to judge the high school cars and hand out safety plaques for the best.<P>

Michael Orr is also here from Ohio, with number 73, the Electric Fiero,
sponsored by the Cincinnati Gas and Electric Co.  It is a gold 1986 Pontiac
Fiero, converted using 9-inch Advanced DC motor, 12 12-Volt sealed GNB
batteries, Curtis 1231 500-amp controller, and a Michael's on custom designed
charger, "because it was cheaper."  The adaptation is very clean.  The trunk
is still there (as much as a Fiero trunk ever was ;-) ), the motor is bolted
directly to the transmission, and all the original gauges still work.  "The
car still has all its crashworthiness and safety."  Stop speed is 75 mph, and
a range of "40 miles in a hilly area."  (That is going to be quite a
challenge considering some of the legs of the race are over 65 miles.)<P>

Number 93, Helios the Heron II, comes from the Riverside School in
Lyndonville
VT, an <b>elementary</b>  school, grades 4 through 8, of 43 students.  I spoke
with Anna Van Fleet, one of the students.  The new car looks nothing like the
car this school entered in the ATdS last year (and which never actually ran)
but in fact it shares a skeletal frame, the motor, and battery from the
original.  The whole school got involved with the project again, and a few
are
lucky enough to come along for the race.  Forest Reider, in the 7th grade,
said, "The car has 6 16 Volt solar panels made from used solar cells (which
are brown instead of the usual blue)."  "(It also has) 9 12-Volt batteries, a
motor that requires 120 volts.  It took us 5 million, billion, quadrillion
rivets and a lot of time, a lot of Bondo, and a lot of duct tape," according
to Anna.  According to the flyer handed out by the students, the parts of
this
year's car come from a Ford Festiva, which the students "ripped apart."
Shocks, struts, steering linkage and column.  The motor chain drives the
single rear wheel.  Since none of the students is old enough to drive, the
car
is driven by their Latin/English/Phys-Ed teacher Karen Budde.
          When I saw the car, it was moving under its own power, although it
was making a popping sound (that sounded sort of like back-firing(?)) and by
the time it climbed the small hill up the grass to the testing area, the
front
wheels were leaning in a most disconcerting manner.  A bolt through the wheel
hub was not holding properly, but did not break or strip.<P>

Number 70 is the SUN-BUNNY, is a converted VW Rabbit.  The project by the
Fall Mountain High School in Alstead, NH.  Aaron Blake told me that it has a
144 Volt system made of Deka Dominator batteries, the 500 amp Curtis
controller, and the 9-inch Advanced DC motor.  The car has been on the road 3
days, so this is the first real test of its capabilities.  Why so late, if
they started working on the project in October?  "We got our money on April
20th.  So we got the call that our grant was accepted and cut POs (purchase
orders) 2 seconds later," Aaron told me.<P>

Number 64 is the Kineticar II, returning again from Connecticut Solar
Electric
Racing Team/Nougatuk Valley Community Technical College (CSERT-NVCTC).
 Arthur
Gagnon told me that this has the same battery pack as last year, and the
aging
seems to have helped.  They also added sway bars that have improved their
stearing performance.  Again we have 20 6-Volt batteries, 400-amp Curtis
controller, and an 9-inch Advanced DC motor.<P>

Number 74 is the Lightning Volt from Parkland High School/Leigh County Vo-
Tech.  This bright red, shiny S-10 conversion is actually the same one that
raced in the 1994 ATdS.  Jeromia Jarecke and Monique Polk told me that the
team put a lot effort into body work, including a sun roof (added when
someone
sanded through the roof), a new interior, slightly more efficient solar
panels, and a laptop to plot data from the Watt-hour meter as they drive.
They also added regenerative braking by putting a magnetic clutch on the
motor
which engages a belt drive to an alternator.  When going down a hill, they
down-shift to get the motor spinning really fast, engage the clutch and put
about 11 amps back into the batteries.<P>

Number 89, Envirocycle III is from Central Conneticut State University
(CCSU).
Dave Kohlen, Evan Anozine, Alfred Yeats and Glen Dobbs told me about this
motor cycle that started life as a Szuzuki JS6R-1100 that now runs on 72
Volts
provided by lead-acid gel-cell batteries.  They power an 11 HP Uniq brushless
DC permanent-magnet motor that drives the rear wheel through a grip-notch
toothed belt.  They expect a range of about 100 miles, with a maximum speed
of
75 mph, although they have geared it for most-efficient speed of 35 to 40
mph.
They don't really know what they are going to get because the bike arrived
with 5 miles on it.  The students designed the bike during the fall and
actually started building it during the spring semester.  The frame is
augmented with steel to help take the extra 300 pounds of the batteries.
 CCSU
arrived with their "traditional" portable building.  This huge trailer comes
complete with a small machine shop and, new this year, some bunk beds.  In
the
past, the chargers have not always worked properly during the overnight
charging, so now they will station someone at the charging station to deal
with any problems that arise overnight.<P>

David Fabricatore represents the Connecticut Commuter Electric Vehicle
Demonstration Program.  They are going to have 5 Solectria Force cars to test for commuter uses within the state.  This 18 month project will have
volunteers using the cars for commuting and carpooling.  In the ATdS, they
have two Forces.  Number 50 is powered has the Electrosource Horizon
batteries.  It was finished up Friday night and driven to Waterbury by
Solectria this morning.  It is a 156 Volt system with 14,400 Watt-hours of
capacity.  Number 51 is running a 156 Volt pack of Interstate wet-cell
batteries, to deal with the 70 mile days in the race, and will be driven by
students from the Ethel Walker school in Simsbury.  (In the project, number
51
will be running Sonnenschein gel-cell batteries which do not require
maintenance, but don't have quite as much range.)<P>

<H1>Tour de Sol Email from the Race</H1>


Date: Mon, 22 May 1995 
From: Michael H Bianchi <bianchi@bellcore.com>

<H3>Subject: American Tour de Sol, 1995: The Race Begins</H3> 

I have no official results yet, but I thought I would at least tell you that
the race did in fact start and most of the vehicles made it from Waterbury CT
to Northampton MA. Various tid-bits:<P>
<UL>
<LI>      The electric bus did not run the first leg, as planned.  With it's very
          limited range and speed, it was decided that it will only start running
           today; at least that is my unofficial understanding.
<LI>     The "Wild Cherry" motor bike run by the WE'RE IT team was not ready at
           the start.  They were having trouble with their DC-DC converter and
           wiring.  
<LI>     The Electric Fiero had problems with 3 overheating batteries and                       decided to quit after about 30 miles.  They are going to try again tomorrow.
<LI>     The Envirocycle III didn't have enough torque to climb a long hill at
           the beginning of the course.  
<LI>     The Solar Flyer blew a tire.  The support vehicle for the Polytech
           Charger, number 75, (which I haven't written about yet), had an old
           fashioned vulcanizing patching kit, and Solar Flyer was able to continue
           on its way.
<LI>     Wooster's Charge (also not reported on yet) made it all the way, but had
            problems with their brakes overheating.  After those long hills to climb, there were long hills to decend, at 20 to 35 mph.  They stopped,
  cooled their brakes with water, and then continued to the finish.
<LI>     At one point I saw the Ottowa Orange trailer, but could not see the car.     I thought they  might  be in the trailer, but a few miles down the road
  there was Ottowa Orange, going along just fine.  They made it all the way   to the finish line.
<LI>     I saw the Mach .05 sitting at the side of the road, and thought they     might be in trouble, but they said they were just collecting some sun to
    boost the batteries a bit more.  I don't know if they made it all the way.
   By the way, Mach .05 is 38 mph, which was the top speed of the car last
   year.  Now it can do 47.2 mph according Jason Butterfield, a team member.
<LI>     The ERANGE motor bike was about 5 miles from the finish, at the side of
    the road, resting their batteries.  I think they eventually crossed the
   finish line.

<H1>Tour de Sol Email from the Race</H1>


Date: Tues, 23 May 1995
From: Michael H Bianchi <bianchi@bellcore.com>

<H3>Subject: American Tour de Sol, 1995: Day 3 </H3>
<P>
<hr width=40%)
<p>
<br>

<I>Mike continues to describe additional vehicles in the race-ed</I>.<p>

Greenwich High School's Solar Flair I is number 68, returning for the third
year.  Mark Smith described it as having a 9-inch Advanced DC motor powered by
20 6-Volt Trojan T145 batteries through a Curtis 1221 controller, in a 1978
Volkswagon Rabbit body with a Rabbit diesel transmission.  This year they have
added a radio (take care of the important things :-), replace the speedometer,
and added hold-down straps for the batteries.  And watch
next year for their all solar car.<P>

Becky Guartha is one of the students from Mt. Everett High School's Project e-
(pronounced "E Minus").  This Chevy S-10 conversion is the same vehicle as
raced last year, but it is not the same.  As Becky described it, what was
once a purely plug-in-to-charge electric vehicle is now a series hybrid.  They
have added a propane-fueled 22 horsepower (12 kW) Kohler internal combustion
engine that drives a Fisher 3 phase, 12 kW, 120 volt, 92 amp generator.  (The
engine/generator system is sold by Solar Car Corporation in Melbourne,
Florida.) It either idles or is manually throttled up to charge the batteries
or take up some of the motor load while underway.  The projected range is 300
to 500 miles on a 10 gallon tank of propane.  There are 20 6-Volt batteries
and the motor is a 28 HP Advanced DC.  A 30 amp alternator with electric
clutch adds regen braking.<P>

        Becky and Rachele Batacchi are the school's first female navigator and
driver team.  Rachele spoke about having to watch the amp meter and the
tachometer to decide when to shift for best efficiency.<P>

        Jake Dupont is a mechanic on the team.  He said that when the
batteries are fully charged a regulator detects that and automatically
throttles back the engine to idle to prevent overcharging.<P>

The Ecovox is from Dartmouth University is number 95.  Jeff Braciak described
this series hybrid vehicle, meaning that only the batteries drive the wheels.
The batteries are charged by a 1.4 kW Honda generator which was converted to
ethanol from a tank that I guess is about 1 gallon.  The driver has a single
switch to start and stop the generator.  The 120 Volt AC output is run through
a diode bridge and voltage regulator to get it to the 72 Volts DC needed to
charge the batteries.<P>

        The car body looks like one you would see on a solar car.  It is a
thin tappered tube, about 12 feet long, with two wheels in the front and a
single driven wheel in the rear.  The electric motor is a 7 HP brushless DC,
supplied by 6 small Sears DieHard tractor batteries.  Before the race, the
electric drive had gone about 200 miles, and the generator system had about 50
miles.  It can do 45 to 55 mph. During inspection the Ecovox had a ground fault which took a couple of
hours to isolate and repair.<P>

RHAM is number 76, from Rham Science and Technical High School.  John Dudek is
the faculty advisor and this car is back for (at least) its third year.
What's different this year?  The battery pack has been increased from 96 Volts
to 120.  Same old controller, same old motor.  (Presumably a Curtis 400 amp
and an Advanced DC 9-inch.)  Last year, John was praising the `BATT juice'
battery additive (from B.A.T Technologies) that he was using in his batteries.
He felt they were giving him something extra.  This year, he added the extra
batteries late, and so did not have time to get the additive into the new
ones, thus they are running with a mixed system: new batteries without
additive plus old batteries with.  But the new batteries will get "juiced"
after the race.  Why?  "Because we got 23.76 kiloWatts out of a 96 Volt system
last year, with Trojan T145s," says John.<P>

Ottawa Orange II is number 37 again this year, basicly the same chassis and
solar panel arrangement as last year, but with some differences.  Josh Ike,
James Merriweather, and Randy Mahar told me they increased the battery pack
from 32 Volts to 74 Volts, using Advotech batteries.  They also replaced the
wooden plank which is the flexible element of the front wheels suspension in
the 3-wheeled vehicle, and put in a new braking system.  The solar panel has
been increased to 1300 Watts and the instrumentation has been localized so the
driver can easily see every gauge.  The box tubing frame is the same as last
year, although the mylar fabric cover is now thicker, and the nose is more
aerodynamic to reduce drag.  This 800 pound vehicle has been tested up to 65
mph, and the range has been tested at 200 miles(!).  The first day of testing,
Saturday, the solar panel was cutting out as it flexed while being driven.  By
the time they figured out what was wrong, almost all the stores were closed.
At the last minute, they found some curtain rods (the rectangular cross-
section sheet metal types) and used them to brace the outside edges of the
panel against the lower frame of the car, forming your classic triangular
brace.  The team was 13 students with specialties of mechanical, electrical,
body, design, business, and coordinator.  The project was completed for an
estimated cost of $20,840.  (Many of the student vehicles have handouts with
the vital statistics, participants, advisors, sponsors, etc.  The Ottawa
Orange II is one of the best.  It is also dedicated to Dwakeely S. McMillan,
February 20, 1976 - March 12, 1995.)<P>

Erik Wachtmeister is the co-president of the team that built Photon, number
86, which won the Tour de Sol racing class in the 1994 ATdS.  "This year the
front wheels have been redone completely.  They are two inches taller, have
new rims, new centers, new tubes that are Kevlar reinforced and are racing
slicks.  There is a better seat which is more comfortable, the lights are more
aerodynamic, we now have two rearview mirrors instead of one, and have rigged
up a helmet communication system between the driver and the chase vehicle.  We
now have more a more accurate reading of the power consumption that is hooked
up to a computer that periodically saves the information" for later analysis.
A fan on the back helps keep the motor cool.<P>

        The battery is a 84 Volt pack built from 7 Sears DieHard deep cycle
RV/Marine batteries.  The 8 HP brushless DC motor and controller are made by
Solectria.  The frame is welded aluminum tubing covered with a vacuum bag
molded body made of 6 pieces.  The body skin is two layers of Kevlar with a
foam core.  The front suspension is off a Yamaha Blaster ATV, the rear
suspension is off a Yamaha 176 motorcycle.  The solar panel is made up of 8
modules of 20 Volts and 60 Watts each.  All the above is the same as last
year.<P>

        The team was made up of 30 students, with 5 faculty advisors.  Various
subteams tackled the improvements listed above.  For example, the new seat was
done by underclassmen.<P>

Angelo Esposito built Fulmine, number 69, after helping Scott Isgar build his
"Solar Delivery" Volkswagon Vanagon conversion that raced in the ATdS last
 65Angelo Esposito built Fulmine, number 69, after helping Scott Isgar build his
"Solar Delivery" Volkswagon Vanagon conversion that raced in the ATdS last
year.  Fulmine is a conversion of a 1980 Hundai donated to him.  The primary
reason for doing the conversion was to let Angelo experiment with his own
transmission design.  After about 700 miles of testing, he removed the
transmission and gave it to a machine shop to build as a final product, which
is in the works right now.  Just for the race, he reinstalled the original
Hundai transmission.  The battery pack is 10 12-Volt Deka Dominators type
8GHD, huge beasts which weigh 161 pounds each!  The car has an overall
weight of 3500 pounds and can carry 600 pounds.  These drive a 400 amp Curtis
controller which in turn drives a 9-inch Advanced DC motor.  Angelo is hoping
for 100 to 120 miles range.<P>

Robert Larsen from Argonne National Lab is the boss of Spencer Quang and
Nicole LeBlanc, who were doing the safety test.  Argonne is doing several
things new this year.  DOE, through Argonne, provided free ampere-hour meters
for all the student-built vehicles this year, and worked very hard with NESEA
to be sure that almost all the rest of the vehicles would also have them.  The
result is that the energy consumption readings will be much easier to acquire
and compare.  (Two years ago, I remember watching the testing teams going
slightly crazy trying to figure out how they were going to connect the amp-
hour meters in for a quick [well, it was supposed to be quick] energy use
measurement, and the various owners worrying that the act of installing and
removing the wiring and shunt would somehow mess up their car!)  On top of
that, they encouraged NESEA to instrument the charging station for both
power consumption and power quality, which will now allow them to do a much
better job of performing from-the-wall-plug-to-the-wheel energy use analysis.
(In the past power quality has meant power factor and power factor has
been measured as the phase angle between the voltage and current waveforms.
[Shades of Electric Machines 101!]  As we will see later, it is now
much more complex than that, and a very real problem in EV charging.
In particular, some charges induce huge voltage and current spikes on the
AC line, call "harmonics" that can cause real problems.)<P>

Bob does not believe there has ever been such a large group of EVs connected
to one charging station, although the APS 500 races have also been a learning
experience.  Another purpose is to start educating the teams and the EV
 81to one charging station, although the APS 500 races have also been a learning
experience.  Another purpose is to start educating the teams and the EV
community to be aware of these issues and how important it is to have very
efficient chargers.  Bob says they have seen chargers with efficiencies as
high as 90% and as low as 30%; a huge variation.<P>

        Again this year they have 8 data collection memory modules that they
will be putting into selected cars, as they did at the 1994 ATdS.  These
modules record second-by-second data such as motor current and voltage,
battery current and voltage, plus there is a Global Positioning System (GPS)
receiver that lets them collect position, velocity and acceleration from the
GPS link.<P>

        I asked Bob what he thought of the field this year.  In general he
thought the overall quality of the cars is very much better this year.  The
Solectria prototype Sunrise is of particular interest, because it points
towards the future.<P>

        Bob is also one of the designated drivers of the most polluting car in
the race.  A Geo Metro LSI sedan, number 10, is being driven in the race and
being timed as if it were a race vehicle.  (The Metro is the base vehicle for
many conversions, including those that Solectria and BAT Technologies
produce.)  By using this car as a control vehicle, they will have a very good
benchmark for the NESEA Energy Challenge, looking for the car with the best
overall energy efficiency and hence the highest oil-well-to-wheel-well
equivalent miles-per-gallon of oil.  The results of this and other tests will
be presented at the Sustainable Transportation Conference in Providence RI
this fall and then at the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) conference
about 5 weeks later.<P>

        Speaking of papers, the DOE has been writing EV and Hybrid-EV papers
over the years and many are published through the SAE, which has an excellent
on-line search system.  Contact the SAE for more information.<P>

        Bob also had high praise for NESEA's organization and operation of the
ATdS.  "As far as we are concerned, this is biggest bang for the buck that DOE
gets.  I hope that budget considerations will allow us to be a major sponsor
in future years."<P>

Number 49 is ERANGE, is a motor scooter built by Helmut Schiller and  Wolfgang
Woitowicz, who built the CityCat that won the Open Category in the 1994 ATdS.
ERANGE claims a range over 100 miles, speed up to 50 mph, weighs 300 pounds,
is 100% recharge in 30 minutes, and an efficiency of over 35 miles per
kiloWatt-hour.  The power comes from 3 12-Volt Horizon batteries delivering
3.4 kiloWatt-hours.  This scooter uses the next generation of the motor used
on the CityCat.  This permanent motor, which boasts 95% efficiency, uses a
low-voltage, high-amperage disk armature that uses copper plates instead of
copper wires.  The permanent magnets provide the stator (non-rotating) field
and the armature has 8 brushes and 129 fields on the commutator which gives
very, very smooth acceleration.  The controller is a pulse-width modulated
type of their own design, but for the ATdS they are using a Curtis controller
because that way they can easily get a spare.  As I understand it, their
intention is to offer a power-train package (motor, controller, and
instrumention) that would be licensed exclusively to a scooter manufacturer to
create a line of electric scooters and 3-wheeled vehicles.<P>

<H1>Tour de Sol Email from the Race</H1>


Date: Sat, 27 May 1995
From: Michael H Bianchi <bianchi@bellcore.com>

<H3>Subject: American Tour de Sol, 1995: Rob Wills </H3>
<P>
<hr width=40%)
<p>
<br>
Dr. Robert Wills is the technical director of the American Tour de Sol.  He
has overall responsibility for the technical rules that the cars must meet and
the inspection process that verifies their compliance.<p>

        But Rob is also heavily involved in the electrical usage measurements
being taken as the plugged-in vehicles charge every night.  I posted earlier
about the NESEA Energy Challenge tests, where they are collecting data to
compare how far a vehicle goes when a gallon of oil taken from the ground is
used to power a gasoline vehicle and when a gallon of oil is used to power an
electric vehicle.<p>

        Rob mentioned that they are also looking at the energy usage through
the night.  The assumption that electric vehicles will charge at night is a
good one, but if the vehicle is plugged in the moment it gets home, it will
draw it's heaviest load early in the evening and tapper off over the night.
And if that's you and me and the girl next door all coming home in our EVs,
then that presents a significant early evening load.  So, they should get some
very interesting data on kiloWatt-hours used for charging, measured every 15
minutes, for 50 cars at once, as part of the oilwell-to-wheels research.<p>

        Rob spoke at length about the Power Quality measurements.  Years ago
when the loads on electric transmission systems were mostly motors, light
bulbs, resistive heaters (that is mostly inductive and resistive loads), the
power drawn from the grid had the same shape (waveform) as the voltage from
the grid; both were sinusoidal.  And the current was pretty much in phase with
the voltage, that is it had a `good power factor'.  (When the power factor is
`good', a watt measured with a watt meter, which essentially multiplies
instantaneous voltage times instantaneous current, represents the amount of
energy that is actually being delivered by the grid to the load.  When the
power factor is bad, the current leads or lags the voltage, and the watt-meter
doesn't reflect the amount of energy being delivered.)  You still have the
same amount of current, the same amount of heating in the wires, and the same
losses from the current, but the electric company cannot collect money for it.
It is then called `reactive power' or `imaginary power'.  The common fixes
were applied at the power plant or by putting capacitors on the lines af the
substations.<p>

        Life in recent years has gotten more complicated.  In large office
buildings up to 30% of the loads can be the plug-loads of computers and things
like that which only take their energy at the peak of the voltage waveform.
So, instead of having a sinusoidal current waveform, you have something that
looks like a little bump and only happens for a part of the cycle.  Those
current bumps, because they are not pure sine waves, have lots of harmonics,
mostly at 3 and 5 times the voltage frequency, which is 180 and 300 Hertz (in
power systems that operate at 60 Hz).  Transformers have higher losses at
higher frequencies, so it is necessary to derate transformers designed for
pure sinusoidal loads when they are faced with these spikey loads.<p>

        What's this got to do with EVs?  Well, we were seeing chargers popping
20 amp circuit breakers when the normal, average current reading meters said
they were only drawing 15 amps.  But with a special true RMS current meter,
which gives the equivalent heating value of the current, we were seeing 25
amps.  And the waveforms involved were very, very spikey with a sharp current
peak at the most positive and most negative parts of each voltage cycle;
probably only 15 degrees of conduction in each 180 degree portion of the
cycle.<p>

        Electric utilities are concerned about this not only because it can
cause overheating, but it can also cause distortion in the voltage waveform
that can cause problems in other equipment on the same circuit, as far back as
the step-down transformer on the pole!.<p>

        Another related problem is caused by the 3-phase power distribution
systems used by utilities.  In a wye-wired system, if the loads on the 3 legs
of the distribution power was equal, the current in the neutral would be zero.
Because of this effect, systems were commonly designed with the neutral leg
undersized by about 20%, to save the expense of copper that "never would be
used";  a practice allowable by the electrical code.  Many old buildings are
wired that way.  But when people started using lots and lots of computers the
neutral started to get overloaded and hot!  The reason is that while the first
harmonic waveforms, the 60 Hz waveforms, add to zero in the neutral when the
loads are in balance, but the third harmonic waveforms sum additively creating
3 times the original current in the neutral leg.  So new power system
practices in buildings require the neutral conductor to be larger than the
phase conductor, and power transformers now come in harmonic or non-linear
ratings to accommodate the extra neutral conductor load.<p>

        While simple battery charges may cause the same problem as computers,
it doesn't have to be so.  The traditional fix is to use ferro-resonant
transformer.  An additional winding on the transformer is used to control the
spikes and produces a rather triangular current waveform.<p>

        Modern power supplies and battery charges now use high frequency
Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) techniques that can align their current waveforms
to the voltage waveforms and are called "power factor correcting power
supplies."<p>

        So, during the overnight charging of the cars in the race, there will
be a harmonic analyzer, made by Basic Measuring Instruments (BMI) from
California (Sunnyvale?), looking at the entire charging station.  They will
collect data on overall power, power factor, and harmonic spectrum of each
phase of the main feed at hourly intervals, and also watch how the voltage
on the feed changes as they bring on individual car chargers.  During the race
they will also measure every individual charger and capture its harmonic
spectrum.  There is a wide variety of chargers here, from Solectria's which
are pretty well power factor corrected, to a number of old ferro-resonant
chargers, to some that are straight rectifier chargers, to some that are SCR
controlled and phase-angle controlled that can have poor power factor but still
have reasonable waveform.  The biggest part of the problem is the spikey
waveform, because that is what causes transformer and neutral overheating.<p>

        There is a UL/IEEE standard, number 519, that says that you shall not
have more than 5% harmonic distortion which means 95% of the current going
into a load must be in-phase, fundamental current.<p>

        A couple of good sources of articles on these topics are the magazines
called "The Electrical Inspector's Journal" and also "Electrical Apparatus"
which has great articles by one Richard Nailen.<p>

        I asked Rob which cars had caught his attention (before the race had
actually started).  He said the 3 hybrids where very interesting, because he
wanted to see how they did in the NESEA Energy Challenge.  Hybrid design is
not simple, but we are already hearing 80-to-90 miles per gallon numbers from
other races.  Until the `silver bullet' battery appears on the market, hybrids
may well be the path to the future.

<H1>Tour de Sol Email from the Race</H1>


Date: Sat, 27 May 1995
From: Michael H Bianchi <bianchi@bellcore.com>

<H3>Subject: American Tour de Sol, 1995: Solectria Sunrise </H3>
<P>
<hr width=40%)
<p>
<br>

I caught James Worden, CEO of Solectria, who is here with the Solectria
Sunrise, an all composite purpose built EV.  Solectria is also represented by
at least a couple of their E-10 pickup trucks (conversions of the Chevy S-10)
and no fewer than 4 Forces (conversions of the Geo Metro and Metro LSI).<p>

        I asked him what the state of the Universal Motor Controller (UMoC,
pronounced "You-Mock").  He announced this all-software controlled controller
design a couple of years ago, and I have been asking where it was in its
development every time I run into him or any of the engineers from Solectria.
As it turns out, the first beta version has shown up here at the American Tour
de Sol (ATdS) in Tom Hopper's "Hopper EV", number 94.  Tom swapped out the
brushless DC motor and controller and has installed the UMoC and an AC
induction motor.  James says that Tom wants to eventually go back to the
brushless DC motor, but when he does, he will be able to simply reprogram an
Erasable Programmable Memory (EPROM) through the serial port on the
controller.  In fact, that is the "universal" part of the UMoC.  The idea is
that the operational logic for controllers for all sorts of motors (brushed
DC, brushless DC, AC induction) of all sorts of power ranges could be built in
a single, mass produced (and hence inexpensive) logic unit which would be
attached to a power unit suitable to the task at hand (low, medium, high
power; single or multi-phase).  James expects that the Solectria trucks will
have the UMoC by the end of the year.  He also expects it to be for sale to
the EV conversion market in the fall.<p>

        The Sunrise is the all composite vehicle that Solectria announced at
EVS-12 last December.  The car is bright yellow with a tan "skirt" around the
bottom fifth of the side and back.  It is very rounded and very smooth 2 door,
4 passenger car that weighs 1694 pounds; gross weight capacity is 2376 pounds
giving a 682 pound payload.  It has one 42 kW nominal/50 kW peak AC induction
motor and front wheel drive.  It has the Ovonic nickel metal hydride battery
and James says that their goal is to break 200 miles per charge during the
race.  (They in fact did that on Thursday with 228.1 miles on a charge.  That
is the NESEA number from Friday morning's data sheet.  James was saying that
it was 238.  Both maybe right if James drove farther after the official lap
was completed, but the NESEA number most likely to be quoted since it was
refereed.)<p>

        I had heard that even the springs were composite, but that is not the
case.  "We haven't gone to the very extremes," says James, "but we are trying
to take weight out as practically as possible without going to too many high
cost methods."  They already had a pretty light drive train, but managed to
shave some more weight off it.  The body is a mix of all different composites
and plastics, some aluminum and a tiny, tiny bit of steel.  One of the tricks
for keeping weight down is to make parts serve two and three purposes.  So a
fender may also serve as insulation and as an interior panel.<p>

        The goal is to build a comfortable four passenger vehicle with very
high efficiency.  The people who are interested in making this happen like
Boston Edison, the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium (NAVC), and ARPA
think that a tiny car is not going to be as salable as mid-sized or full-sized
car, which the Sunrise is.<p>

        The vehicle in the race is a prototype to learn if these things can
actually be done and made to work.  As such, there are some peculiarities in
this car that would not exist when it is done for real.  For instance, the
roof has simulated solar cells on it, although a solar panel sits on the rear
deck under the rear window and powers an air circulating fan.  The door
windows do not roll down, so air conditioning is absolutely a must.  The
Hughes MagnaCharge paddle socket was not yet in place under the license plate
in the rear, although the 110 VAC and the 220 VAC charging plugs were.  (I
understand that the Sunrise is actually being charged using the MagnaCharge
system, but obviously not in the final configuration.  The MagnaCharge people
have been following us throughout the race.]) The body appears seamless, with
the only lines being those around the small hood, the small trunk lid, and the
rather large doors.  There are no strips of chrome to hide the fact that two
body panels are mating.  It is actually made of several pieces, but "the goal
is to keep the part count down because that keeps the joints and the weight
down and hopefully makes it simple to build as opposed to making millions of
parts cheap and having it expensive to build." "Steel is good, it has been
proven to be safe, even in electric vehicles, but these materials can get
better safety with considerably less weight."<p>

        The Sunrise is using the same control system as was in the Solectria
Force.  The drive train was developed for this project, but it is now being
put in the new Force cars.  A lot of work went into making the interior very
quite (I suspect because you don't have the engine noise to mask all the
other noises sources) and also into making the doors work exactly right.  The
doors "slam" differently from most cars, because the are so much less massive.
But the mate to the door opening perfectly and latch with the slightest
pressure.  James indicated that it took a lot of work to get that just right,
but of course it is absolutely essential to give a quality look and feel to
the car.<p>

        Looking under the hood is almost disappointing.  Things are so
uncluttered and simple it doesn't look complicated.  (Of course that is good,
but it is so much easier to be impressed by all the stuff under the hood of a
high-power car.) The usual Solectria controller is there, the usual looking
Solectria motor, although with a special dual shock dampener that isolates
motor vibration from the body, and the other few support components such as
the power brake pump and the DC-DC converter for the 12 Volt loads.<p>

        All the batteries are in a tunnel that runs down the center of the car
and between the left and right passengers.  A cooling fan forces air down the
tunnel when the batteries get warm, and turns off automatically when they cool.<p>

        I tried to draw a comparison between this and the GM Impact.  James
immediately said, "no.  This is a much bigger car."  The aerodynamic shapes
are similar, but the fact that the Impact is 2 passenger and the Sunrise is 4
puts them in very different classes.<p>

       There is no separate bumper, but James said that the car will meet the
Department of Transportation tests, including the 5 mph bumper where no damage
that costs money can be inflicted.<p>

        The second Sunrise is being built now and it will be crash tested this
summer.  The third will be built as refined prototype based on what is learned
from the first two.<p>

        James made very clear that he was indebted to his sponsors.  Boston
Edison, NAVC and ARPA.  Their interest in this and other related projects,
such as earlier drive train projects, accelerated this work considerably.
Nick Karditsas is from Ovonic, the company that provided the Nickel Metal
Hydride batteries in the Sunrise.  It is an advanced battery for EVs,
developed under funding of the United States Advanced Battery Consortium.
Nickel Metal Hydride batteries have an energy density of about 75 Watt-hours
per kilogram, as compared to 25 Wh/kg for lead acid batteries.  The Sunrise
has a 25 kWh pack composed of 18 10-cell, 12 Volt, 120 amp-hour modules in a
single Volt string.  Beyond that, the power train is the usual Solectria AC
induction motor system.  The charger uses the Hughes MagnaCharge inductive
coupler system.<p>

        An unusual aspect of NiMH batteries is that the discharge chemistry is
actually slightly endothermic;  the chemistry actually > cools < the battery
as it discharges.  According to Nick, the effect is apparent at a C/6 (20
ampere) rate.<p>

<H1>Tour de Sol Email from the Race</H1>


Date: Sat, 27 May 1995
From: Michael H Bianchi <bianchi@bellcore.com>

<H3>Subject: American Tour de Sol, Team Interviews </H3>
<P>
<hr width=40%)
<p>
<br>
 
Greg Perry with the Sol Survivor III team told me about their first day drive.
I saw them at one point and thought they might be having problems since they
were not moving very fast.  But Greg pointed out that since the car has
climbed Mount Washington, the hills on the route were no problem.  In fact,
what was going on was they were budgeting their energy very carefully since
this was the longest route the car has ever driven.  They made it all the way
through the route.<p>

Number 72 is Sungo from New Hampshire Technical Institute and is back for (at
least) the third year.  Spencer Allen explained that this year the wiring has
been improved, a new steering box has improved the handling, fixed problems
they had had with their solar panel and added new instrumentation, and up
graded the batteries up to 120 Volts.  Sungo is the only car this year with
separate motors for each of the rear wheels, each with a separate controller.
The brushless DC motors from Solectria have an electronic differential to keep
the rear wheels coordinated when under way.  The controllers also have a
low/high torque switch, which changes the motor wiring from wye to delta.
They claim the car has 100+ mile range, 75 mph top speed, carries two people +
200 pounds of luggage, has a 96 Watt solar array and 10 Trojan 27TMH deep-
cycle marine batteries with 9600 Watt-hour capacity.  It weighs 1365 pounds.<p>

        They won the efficiency award for the Discovery Commuter class one day
at 9 miles per kiloWatt-hour.<p>

Sunpacer from Cato-Meridian High School in Cato NY is number 92, back for the
3rd or 4th year.  According to Kevin Malda, this year it has new solar cells,
and a cleaned up electrical system.  They experimented with regenerative
braking but it was not operational at the start of the race.  The system is 32
Volt system of Deka Dominator batteries driving a 6 HP series Advanced DC
motor through a Sevcon controller.<p>

Mellisa Downs with the Darmouth Ecovox team explained what caused the ground
fault that caused difficulties during pre-race testing.  It was in the 12 Volt
system, which is not as big a deal as when it is in the traction system, and
rewiring the 12 Volt driver's meter so that the grounds were isolated fixed
the problem.  Mellisa worked on putting the batteries in, installing the
ethanol tank, and the fire extinguisher system.<p>

Mike Fabio (no relation) is with the Electric Hare built by the Falmouth
Wattsmen from Falmouth ME.  The first day they milked the car into the finish
line because the had trouble charging.  Their K&W transformerless charger has
very spikey waveforms that kept tripping the circuit breakers.   A fix was to
lower the charging rate to about 10% of the maximum rate, which leaves them
undercharged for the race, and worried.<p>

        The vehicle is a Volkswagon Rabbit converted with the kit from Electro
Automotive, and one that is very neatly done.  The 21 kWh batteries are from
US Battery, the motor from Advanced DC, and the Controller from Curtis.  (And
Mr. Gigi does their hair.)  The conversion is very, very clean and these guys
were the hit of Portland ME, showing up on the local TV shouting, "Now we're
going to Disney World!."<p>

Project e-, the propane fueled hybrid S-10 conversion, had a problem on the
first day because the had a valve leak that caused them to run out of fuel,
although it did not prevent them from finishing.<p>

        I had forgotten to ask earlier if, when they added the generator, did
they remove any of the batteries.  After all, that is one of the motivations
for using the engine driven generator; you can get by on fewer batteries.
Rachele Batacchi said that they kept all the batteries they had in their non-
hybrid version.  This proved useful here because they were able to run 16
miles just on the batteries.  The team is also plugging in each night, so the
fuel is used strictly for range extension.<p>

At least a couple of people took the scenic route the first day (read "got
lost").  I know that Genesis I missed a turn, and Hopper EV decided to visit
the Interstate 84, which took him 11 miles out of the way.  (The race
generally avoids the interstates, toll roads, and other high-speed roads.  The
40 mph minimum speed on such roads precludes many of the solar racers from
using them.  Hopper EV had no problem there.)<p>

Hopper EV had a more serious problem.  For some reason, not well understood,
it blew 3(!) chargers at the end of Day 1.  The guess was that there was some
kind of feedback coming from the controller that was interacting badly with
the charger.  By disconnecting the controller and rebuilding one of the
chargers Tom Hopper was able to get a charge and run the Day 2 leg late, but
with no difficulty.<p>

Number 53, the Elfa Electra, turned in very good performance.  Thomas Faul was
expecting a 50 mile range and first day they managed 69 miles with no problem.<p>

Dr. Fred Whitridge is a self-made man.  He holds an honorary doctorate that he
bestowed upon himself, as a gag "to keep the NESEA people from going to crazy
with thier beaurocracy and their rules.  For example, rule 12.1.6 says you
shall carry electrolyte neutralizer at all times.  So Dr. Fred and his partner
Dr. Rob have been wearing a box of Arm and Hammer baking soda on their arm
everywhere they go, figuring they will the only ones left in the race because
all the other teams only have their baking soda in the car and will hence be
disqualified.  When not racing, Fred is an investor in Greenwich CT.<p>

        Fred's car is number 60, the Millenium Falcon, by the Blue Sky Club, a
group from the Yale School of Management class of 1983 that have worked
together on a number of projects, some gags, some real that try to address
some societal concern such as pollution.  The car is a 1985 Volkswagon
Cabriolet that at 97,000 miles was blowing a lot of oil.  "My 8-year-old and I
did the conversion, starting with Mike Brown's (Electro Automotive) kit, which
has been modified almost beyond recognition."  It uses an 8-inch Advanced DC
motor, Curtis 1221B ("no problems when mounted on a 2-inch heat sink with a
fan"), and a 96 Volt pack of Trojan T145s, with a trailer added just for the
race holding an additional 24 Volts.  It also has a radio and a heater.<p>

        The car was finished in May, 1994, and is used for daily commuting.
It accumulated 3800 miles in that year.<p>

        Fred told a story where he went away on business and called home to
see how things were going.  When he asked his 8-year-old what he had been
doing, he said, "driving around in the electric car."<p>

        "You and who?"<p>

        "Me and Mom."<p>

        "But Mom doesn't know how to drive the electric car."<p>

        "I taught her."<p>

Number 71 is the S-15 Truck from Minuteman Science-Technology High School in
Lexington MA.  David Pichulo expained it to me.  He worked on the control
board and did the fund racing.  The conversion is based on the design that Bob
Batson of Electric Vehicles of America does.  The car is actually named
"George", but that name never shows up on the standings.  They started the car
in March when a teacher suggested it as a project.  They got a lot of things
donated, including the GMC S-15 Sierra from the Conservation Division from the
town of Lincoln MA, who will get the EV truck at the end of the race.  They
finished working on the truck the Saturday before the race and so the 20
Trojan T145 batteries are very new and haven't quite gotten up to full
capacity, so they didn't finish the first few days.  It weighs 3500 pounds.
About 40 people from the shop class worked on it.<p>

Rank is position within the CATEGORY, based on Miles.
Overall is overall standing, across all CATEGORIES, based on Miles.
Number is the vehicle number.
Miles is called Pole Miles on the sheet this is taken from, and (I believe)
Tour Miles on earlier sheets.  It is the adjusted overall score, summing up
starting banner-to-finishing banner distance, plus extra laps, plus extra
credit items, minus penalties.
Award is the cash component of the NESEA prize.  It also includes display
space at and pre-paid registrations to the Sustainable Transportation/Solar
and Electric Vehicle conference this fall in Providence RI.<p>

Rob Wills pointed out that one would expect the ZAP Powered Rotator to win
the 2 wheel category, especially given they were not measuring the energy that
Myhee, the cyclist, was consuming as food.  But, ZAP only got 242.7 m/g
because their charger was far less efficient than the one used by ERANGE.
Rob also pointed out that the heavier hybrids did not do as well as one might
expect.

                        Project e-                9.5<P>

(I expect that Tempest's extra complexity cost them a lot, and the fact that
Project e- did not remove any of their lead-acid batteries when they added the
propane tank, engine and generator, and also charged from the grid may have
given them to worst of both worlds.)<P>

<B>Best, Most Autonomous, Practical Car, NESEA award:</B><P>

                        Sol Survivor III</pre><P>

(This car had large solar panels, and to supplement their battery charge
during the race.  It raced in the 2-passenger COMMUTER category against
cars that had to plug in.)  Nancy Hazard, director of the ATdS, said she would
like to create a new category for "practical, solar-electric, 2-seater,
autonomous car" to compete with Sol Survivor III.
<UL>
<LI>Sol Survivor III was recognized as having the most outrageous paint job.
(Hot pink and electric blue.)
<LI>Sofix Design was acknowledged as the car with the most batteries and the most electrical connections to trouble-shoot.  (180 nickel-zinc batteries.)
<LI>The Old Timer Award to the only car that has been in every ATdS:  Suntech
The Most Inches Of Ink (press coverage):  Electric Hare from Falmouth, ME.
<LI>The Tough Luck Award:  Wild Cherry. This scooter came from Austin TX, and had problems that ended with a burned out motor that they were unable to replace.
<LI>The Best T-Shirt and Strangest Arrest Award:  Mach .05.
A Maine citizen tried to make a citizen's arrest of Mach .05 for being
"illegal in the state of Maine" for driving too slowly.
<LI>The Bullwinkle Award for the Recognition of the Largest Non-Human Life Form Encountered During the American Tour de Sol:  Fulmine. Angelo Esposito, from Staten Island NY, saw a full-sized moose during the race.
(Welcome to Northern Exposure, Southeast)
<LI>Rob Wills commented that it is sometimes too easy to see Solectria as a
corporation and separate from the student racing community.  But he reminded
the audience that it was born in a hole-in-the-wall lab at MIT, and he hoped
that, especially the younger people such as the Helios team, would remember
that fact.  Someday some of them would form their own car companies, or work for a car company, "and help make beautiful cars."

Personal comments:<br><P>

        The Sunrise, a static model just 6 months ago, showed itself to be a
very real contender and I think points the way to at least a portion of the
future.  I suspect I will someday tell folks about when I first saw the 
Sunrise-a very real contender and a vehicle that I think points the way to at least a portion of the
future.<P>

        2 high school projects, Project e-, a hybrid, and Solar Bolt,
a lead-acid battery car, are in overall positions 4 and 5, ahead of some of
the PRODUCTION cars.  The Tempest, a college hybrid, also placed up amidst
the PRODUCTION entries.<P>

        Personal projects, such as Genesis I and Millenium Falcon did very well
overall.<P>

        And Helios the Heron may have come in (almost) dead-last, but
the kids were wonderful and I would not be surprised to see some of them go on
to do really marvelous things in the future.<P>

So that's it.  I hope you folks have found this as interesting as I did.
The American Tour de Sol is a place where you can see Electric Vehicles in
a wide variety of forms, on the hoof, dealing with the real world pretty
much as we find it.<P>

        Next year's race is scheduled to go from New York City to Washington
DC; contact NESEA for details.<P>

I extend my thanks all those who generously gave of their time and thoughts for
these interviews, NESEA for their support in this project, and Bill Lord for
cross-posting all this stuff to the World Wide Web.

</h3></center>

<i>Palaetiology</i>: ``The term `palaetiology' was coined in 1837 by
English philosopher, historian, and educator William Whewell (1794-1866)
to refer to those sciences which have as their object the reconstruction
of the past based on the evidence of the present.  Whewell's two
exemplary palaetiological sciences were geology and comparative
philology, but he recognized that many different disciplines had
palaetiological divisions.'' [Robert J. O'Hara, <a
href="http://rjohara.uncg.edu/palaetiology.html">Palaetiology</a> on the
<a href="http://rjohara.uncg.edu/">Darwin-L Web Server</a>.]

<p>
I am convinced, for reasons which I hope will eventually be made clear on 
this web server and elsewhere, that law, like language, can only be 
understood by taking a palaetiological approach--that law, and especially
our Common Law, can only be understood by studying how it has evolved
over the centuries.  We can only understand the past by studying the 
"evidence of the present" and we can only understand the present by 
understanding how we came to be where we are right now.  

<p>
I am convinced that we can only 
understand the present by understanding the past.

<p>
The key resource on the web for the comparative study of the historical 
sciences is the Darwin-L Web Server maintained by Robert J. O'Hara:

There are many Buddhist resources available on the Internet and the
World Wide Web:

<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://coombs.anu.edu.au/WWWVL-Buddhism.html">
Buddhist Studies WWW Virtual Library </a>
(The Internet Guide to Buddhist Studies) 

<li><a href="http://www.psu.edu/jbe/jbe.html">Journal of Buddhist Ethics</a>
(Buddhist ethics is to ethics as Buddhist theology is to theology)
<p>
<li><a href="/links/ol.html#bd">Other Links</a> Relating to the Buddhadahrma
</ul>

<p>
Here is an article that I presented at the 
<a href="http://www.psu.edu/jbe/confer2.html">
Online Conference on Buddhism 
and Human Rights </a>that was sponsored by the 
<a href="http://www.psu.edu/jbe/jbe.html">Journal of Buddhist Ethics</a> 
and held on October 1-14, 1995.  (For the moment this is just a link
to the ASCII text as it was presented at the confernce and included in
the <a href="http://www.psu.edu/jbe/papers.html">
Conference Papers</a>.  In time I hope to make it available in postscript and
in HTML format.)

Since the 1996 Fall Term has ended and the page for the course in Computers 
and the Law has gotten very cluttered and will need drastic revision by
next Fall and---more importantly---since the transfer of controls over
the export of crytographic software has been transferred to the 
Department of Commerce, it seems best to create a new page where links
to all my materials relating to the regulation and licensing of 
cryptographic software are collected.  This is that page.

Eventually this site will contain materials for use in, or that are
relevant to, the course in Computers and the Law taught by Peter
D. Junger at CWRU Law School.  But at the moment it needs extensive
revision.

The most important current issue involves the conflict between the export
regulations on cryptographic software and the freedoms of speech and of
the press, and as to this matter there is now a
separate web page collecting all the materials relating to <a
href="crypto_export/">Free Speech and the Export of Crypto</a>.
<p><hr>

<p>
The materials will eventually include law cases, legislative
materials, reports, and other textual materials that are stored on
this server as well as links to materials stored on other servers.

<p> Related to this portion of the course is the suit that I have
brought, with the aid of Gino Scarselli, Raymond Vasvari, and Kevin
O'Neill to enjoin the enforcement of those provisions of the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the <a href="/itar.html">
"ITAR"</a>) that require one to obtain a license or a waiver of
jurisdiction--that is, a so-called ``Commodity Jurisdiction
Determination''--before one may publish or otherwise disclose
information about cryptography to a foreign person or transmit such
information outside the United States. <em>See</em><a href="jvc">
<em>Junger</em> v. <em>Christopher</em></a>.

Here is an explanation of the problem that I have with the ITAR and a

<p>
A Case Western Reserve University law professor filed suit today in
federal court, challenging government regulations which restrict his
ability to teach a course in computer law.  Peter Junger, a twenty-five
year veteran of the law school faculty, filed a federal civil rights
action this morning in the United States District Court in Cleveland. 
The suit names the Department of State and the secretive National
Security Agency, which administer federal regulations limiting
Professor Junger's ability to teach.

<p>

The case involves federal regulations which restrict the export of
military arms.  Under federal law, computer software which encodes
messages to preserve the privacy of messages on the Internet can be
declared a military export.  The regulations are so strict that even
discussing the technical aspects of such software in the presence of
foreign nationals may be a felony, punishable by up to ten years in
prison.  Professor Junger, whose class at Case Western Reserve focuses
on the legal aspects of computer use and software development, plans to
turn away any foreign students who register for the course this fall,
largely because the law is uncertain as to what he may teach, and to
whom.


<p>
The restrictions at issue are administered by the Department of State,
in cooperation with the ultra-secret National Security Agency, the
organization charged with eavesdropping on foreign governments.   


<p>
Under the restrictions, Junger may not teach foreign students about
even simple software capable of encoding messages.  Such software is
vital to maintaining the privacy of communications and financial
transactions on the Internet, and Junger believes that lawyers need to
understand how it works in order to prepare to practice in an
increasingly technological world.


<p>
The information that Junger wishes to disclose is widely available on
the Internet and elsewhere.  "It's not as though we are talking about
classified information,"  explained Gino Scarselli, one of three
lawyers representing Junger in the case.  "The material at issue in
this case can be found in any university library,  but the regulations
make no exceptions for even the most basic software,"  Scarselli noted.
  The lawsuit does not challenge the government's right to restrict
access to classified information.


<p>
Junger is also represented by Raymond Vasvari and Kevin Francis
O'Neill, two Cleveland attorneys with considerable experience in First
Amendment issues.   As Vasvari explained, the suit presents important
First Amendment questions about the government's ability to regulate
academic life.  "These regulations allow the government to dictate what
a professor may and may not teach, even though the material involved
poses no threat to national security," Vasvari explained.  


<p>
The suit charges that by requiring Junger to apply for a federal
license to discuss cryptography with foreigners, the government is
violating a well-established First Amendment rule which prohibits the
government from licensing expression.  


<p>
Because computer cryptography is expected to play an important role in
the economic development of the Internet, the case is being closely
watched by industry leaders in the Silicon Valley.  Scarselli has
worked closely with attorneys affiliated with the San Francisco based
Electronic Frontier Foundation in preparing the suit, and Junger and
his lawyers have  been in frequent contact with founder John Gilmore,
formerly of Sun Microsystems, who has offered his assistance as a
technical advisor in the case.

<p>
     A Case Western Reserve University law professor filed suit today in
     federal court, challenging government regulations which restrict
     his ability to teach a course in computer law.  Peter Junger, a
     twenty-five year veteran of the law school faculty, will file a
     federal civil rights action this afternoon in the United States
     District Court in Cleveland.  The suit names the Department of
     State and the secretive National Security Agency, which administer
     federal regulations limiting Professor Junger's ability to teach.

<p> The case involves the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or
     <a href="/itar.html">ITAR</a>, federal regulations which
     restrict the export of military technology.  Under the ITAR,
     cryptographic computer software, which encodes text to preserve the
     privacy of messages on the Internet, is considered a "munition" and
     subject to strict export control.  The regulations raise
     significant First Amendment questions by defining "export" to
     include discussing technical information about non-classified
     software with foreign nationals, such as students registered for
     Professor Junger's course.

<p>
     In recent months, the State Department has sent a series of letters
     threatening possible criminal action to a Florida man who posted a
     simple cryptographic algorithm to the "sci.crypt" Usenet Newsgroup,
     an Internet site popular with cryptography enthusiasts.  These and
     similar incidents have caused Professor Junger to limit his
     discussions of cryptographic material with foreign colleagues, for
     fear of violating the ITAR.  Penalties for unlicenced disclosure of
     cryptographic information are severe: federal law provides ten year
     prison terms and One Million Dollar fines for those convicted of
     violating the Arms Export Control Act, the legislation under which
     the ITAR was promulgated.

<p> Professor Junger, whose <a href="../index.html">class</a> at Case
     Western Reserve focuses on the legal aspects of computer use and
     software development, plans to turn away any foreign students who
     register for the course this fall, largely because the law is
     uncertain as to what he may teach, and to whom.

<p>
     The restrictions at issue are administered by the Department of
     State, in cooperation with the ultra-secret National Security
     Agency, the organization charged with eavesdropping on foreign
     governments.   Under the ITAR, Junger may not teach foreign
     students about even simple software capable of encoding messages.
     Such software is vital to maintaining the privacy of communications
     and financial transactions on the Internet, and Junger believes
     that lawyers need to understand how it works in order to prepare to
     practice in an increasingly technological world.

<p>
     The information that Junger wishes to disclose is widely available
     on the Internet and elsewhere.  "It's not as though we are talking
     about classified information,"  explained Gino Scarselli, one of
     three lawyers representing Junger in the case.  "The material at
     issue in this case can be found in any university library,  but the
     regulations make no exceptions for even the most basic software,"
     Scarselli noted.   The lawsuit does not challenge the government's
     right to restrict access to classified information.

<p>
     Junger is also represented by Raymond Vasvari and Kevin Francis
     O'Neill, two Cleveland attorneys with considerable experience in
     First Amendment issues.   As Vasvari explained, the suit presents
     important First Amendment questions about the government's ability
     to regulate academic life.  "These regulations allow the government
     to dictate what a professor may and may not teach, even though the
     material involved poses no threat to national security," Vasvari
     explained.

<p>
     The suit charges that by requiring Junger to apply for a federal
     license to discuss cryptography with foreigners, the government is
     violating a well-established First Amendment rule which prohibits
     the government from imposing prior restraints on expression without
     clear, narrowly drawn standards distinguishing prohibited
     expression from permissible speech.  The United States Supreme
     Court has consistently held that such prior restraints face a heavy
     burden in court, and that standardless licencing schemes allowing
     officials broad discretion in restriction speech are
     unconstitutional.

<p>
     Because computer cryptography is expected to play an important role
     in the economic development of the Internet, the case is being
     closely watched.  Scarselli has worked closely with attorneys
     affiliated with the San Francisco based Electronic Frontier
     Foundation in preparing the suit, and Junger and his lawyers have
     been in frequent contact with John Gilmore, formerly of Sun
     Microsystems, who has offered his assistance as a technical advisor
     in the case.  

<p>
     At issue is not only Junger's right to discuss cryptography with
     foreigners, but also his and other's right to publish and
     distribute such information both in traditional forms and on the
     internet.

<p>
     Professor Junger's suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief,
     prohibiting the government from interfering with his, or any other
     person's, discussing non-classified cryptographic information with
     foreign persons or from publishing that information.  Lawyers for
     Junger have moved the court for a preliminary injunction.  Junger's
     course begins in the fall semester, later this month.

<hr>

<P>
Cleveland, Ohio, Oct. 1 -- Lawyers for Professor Peter D. Junger today
filed a brief and a motion for summary judgment in Junger v.
Christopher, the case challenging the licensing of the communication of
``cryptograhic software'' that is pending before Judge Donald C. Nugent
in the Federal District Court here.

<P>
Junger seeks an injunction against the enforcement of provisions of
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations that require him to get
the permission of the State Department's Office of Defense Trade
Controls (the "ODTC") before he can communicate information about
cryptographic software to foreign persons, ``whether in the United
States or abroad.''  The penalty for failing to get such permission
before disclosing the information can be as great as a fine of one
million dollars and imprisonment for ten years.  These provisions
effectively prevent Junger from admitting foreign students to the
course that he teaches about Computers and the Law at Case Western
Reserve Law School in Cleveland, Ohio, and keep him from publishing
his course materials and articles containing cryptographic software,
or explaining what it does, how and where to get it, and how to use
it.

<P>
The challenged licensing scheme threatens the long-run viability of
the United States software industry and, according to a blue-ribbon
panel of the National Research Council, already costs that industry at
least ``a few hundred million dollars per year ..., and all
indications are that this figure will only grow in the future.''  The
regulations have been extensively criticized by industry and bills to
repeal or limit them are now pending in Congress.  

<P>
Junger's legal challenge is not based, however, on the economic damage
that the ITAR's cryptographic licensing scheme imposes on the software
industry and the nation's economy, but rather on the unconstitutional
restraints that it imposes on anyone who wants to speak or write
publically about any computer program that has, in the words of the
ITAR, the ``capability of maintaining secrecy or confidentiality of
information or information systems.''  Junger does not challenge the
constitutionality of requiring one to get a license before exporting a
physical cryptographic device: ``It isn't unconstitutional for the
Office of Defense Trade Controls to damage the computer industry and
our economy by requiring export licenses for cryptographic hardware,
but information about cryptographic software is, as the National
Research Council has pointed out, `pure knowledge that can be
transported over national borders inside the heads of people or via
letter.' Requiring the permission of the government before one can
communicate knowledge is unconstitutional.  Such a prior restraint is,
in fact, the paradigmatic example of a violation of the First
Amendment.''

<P>
<center>
<STRONG>THE GOVERNMENT ARGUES THAT PLAINTIFF MUST APPLY FOR PERMISSION
           TO SPEAK BEFORE HE CAN CHALLENGE THE REQUIREMENT
                  THAT HE APPLY FOR SUCH PERMISSION
</STRONG>
</center>

<P>
In motions and briefs submitted August 21st, the government has asked
the court to dismiss the lawsuit, or in the alternative, to grant the
government judgment prior to trial.

<P>
The government makes the initial argument that Junger lacks standing
to claim that the provisions of the ITAR requiring him to get a formal
license or other permission from the ODTC before he publically
communicates information about cryptographic software, including the
contents of the software itself, are unconstitutional.  And it also
argues that that claim is neither ``ripe'' nor ``colorable'', because
Junger has not applied to the ODTC for such permission.

<P>
Junger takes the position that as a law teacher who venerates the
First Amendment it would be as improper for him to request the federal
censors for permission to speak and publish as it would be for him
openly violate the law.  As he puts it: ``My duty is to challenge
these unconstitutional regulations, not to give in to them nor to
violate them in an act of civil disobedience.''  His lawyers point out
in their briefs that few propositions of constitutional law are better
established than the rule that a plaintiff does not have to submit to
an unconstitutional restraint on speech and on the press before
challenging it in court.

<P>
``Those arguments by the government are rather strange,'' says Gino
J. Scarselli, one of Junger's lawyers, ``they seem to be based on
their argument that cryptographic software is actually hardware
because it is functional.''  And then he adds, ``Of course, that
argument is also rather strange.''


<P>
<center><strong>
       THE GOVERNMENT ARGUES THAT SOME OF THE MATERIAL AT ISSUE
                       IS EXEMPT UNDER THE ITAR
</strong></center>

<P>
The government also contends that some of the information at issue may
be exempt from the ITAR's licensing requirements as technical data
that is in the ``public domain'' because it is available to the public
through ``fundamental research in science and engineering'' or through
``sales at newsstands and bookstores.''

<P>
``That hardly is a defense,'' says Scarselli, ``since it is quite
clear that the government will not concede that all of the information
that Professor Junger wants to be able publish and discuss is in the
public domain.  And to make matters worse, the only way that Professor
Junger can actually find out whether the government will treat
particular information as being exempt from the formal licensing
requirements is to apply to the ODTC for what it calls a Commodity
Jurisdiction Determination, which in reality is just another form of
license.''

<P>
``It is not as if I am engaged in fundamental research in science and
engineering.'' Junger adds.  ``What I want to publish and discuss has
to do with the political and legal issues that are raised by computer
technology, including, of course, cryptography.  

<P>
``For just one example, since lawyers have a legal and ethical duty to
protect the confidences of their clients, I am convinced that lawyers
who use electronic mail or other computer technologies to communicate
with their clients, or to store information supplied by their clients,
are in some circumstances ethically, and perhaps even legally,
required to use cryptography to maintain the confidentiality of that
information.  And yet I cannot publically explain to law students and
lawyers--and lawyers cannot publically explain to their clients--how
to obtain and use effective cryptographic software without first
getting the government's permission to disclose that information.
And, of course, if the cryptographic software really is effective,
then there is little or no chance that the government will permit its
disclosure.''


<P>

               IS NOT PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT
                       BECAUSE IT IS FUNCTIONAL
</strong></center>

<P>
There is no law in the United States that forbids or regulates the use
of cryptography.  Yet the government argues that the information in
texts containing cryptographic software, including recipes for
creating such software, can be used in a computer to preserve secrecy
and confidentiality, and concludes that cryptographic software is
``conduct'' and ``functional'' and is thus not a text that is
constitutionally protected as speech.

<P>
Junger's lawyers, on the other hand, say that his claims do not relate
to the conduct of running a cryptographic program on a
computer--conduct that is not regulated by the ITAR, after all--and
that he only challenges the restraints that the ITAR impose on the
communication of information about how to carry on such legal conduct.

<P>
``Expressive conduct is exactly what is protected by the First
Amendment,'' says Raymond Vasvari, another of Junger's lawyers.  ``And
if that expression were not functional, if it were not effective,
there would be no need to protect it.  The government's argument turns
two hundred years of First Amendment jurisprudence on its head.''

<P>
``The government's arguments about software being conduct and
functional are striking examples of the sort of confusion that
pervades the whole area of Computers and the Law,'' Junger says.
``Trying to clear up such confusion is my major goal in my course in
Computers and the Law.  In fact, when I started teaching that course
in 1993, I wrote some cryptographic software to assist my students in
grasping the distinction between software as a text that can be
communicated, and that is protected by copyright law and the First
Amendment, and software as a process that runs in a computer's central
processor that can be protected by patents, but not by copyrights.  If
it weren't so frustrating, it would almost be funny that I cannot
publish that software because of the prior restraints imposed by the
defendants' interpretation of the ITAR, even though it is perfectly
legal for me, or for any one else, including `foreign persons,' to
actually run such software on a computer.  The government's confusion
is so extensive that an agent of the ODTC has actually told me that
software, cryptographic software, is actually hardware.''

<P>
``It is quite clear to me,'' Junger adds, ``that the State Department
and the National Security Agency and other elements in the executive
branch of the government are attempting to restrain the communication
of information about cryptographic software not only abroad, but also
within the United States, because they do not want us actually to be
able to use cryptography to preserve the privacy of our thoughts and
our communications.  It is as if the government required one to get a
license before explaining how to make or use an envelope, even though
it did not forbid the use of envelopes themselves.  After all, all
that cryptographic software is is a way of making electronic
envelopes.''

<P>
<center><STRONG>ORAL ARGUMENT SCHEDULED</STRONG></center>

<P>
Junger v. Christopher has been placed on a fast track by Judge Nugent.
On September 5 he established a briefing schedule: the plaintiff's
brief was due and was filed today and the government's response is due
on Friday, October 18.

<P>
Oral argument is scheduled for Wednesday, November 20.

<P>
Judge Nugent's decision is expected before the first of the year.


<P>
<center><STRONG>BACKGROUND ON THE LITIGATION</STRONG></center>

<P>
Litigation is expensive.  Professor Junger and his volunteer lawyers
were only able to bring the suit because of a generous gift by an
anonymous donor of $5,000 that was used to create the ITAR Legal
Attack Fund.  Additional donations by Professor Junger and others have
increased that fund to more than seven thousand dollars.

<P>
Scarselli and Vasvari are lawyers in private practice in Cleveland who
have dedicated much of their professional lives to the protection of
First Amendment freedoms.  The third lawyer on the team is Kevin
O'Neill, a law professor at Cleveland State University and the former
legal director of the Ohio Chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union.

<p> 1.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief
brought by a law professor to protect his rights and the rights of
others to teach, publish and otherwise disclose unclassified
cryptographic information to foreign students and other foreign
persons without first obtaining a license or approval from the
government. The plaintiff challenges the constitutionality of specific
provisions of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR,"
"the regulations"), 22 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 120 <I>et seq.</I>, that
require a license or approval from the government before "exporting"
cryptography and seeks to enjoin the defendants from using, or
threatening to use, such provisions to restrict him and others from
disclosing cryptographic information.<BR> <BR> <CENTER>JURISDICTION,
VENUE AND PARTIES<BR> <BR> </CENTER>2.  This action arises under the
First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the
constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Declaratory relief is
sought under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2201-02. The jurisdiction of this
Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331.<BR> 3.  The
plaintiff resides in the Northern District of Ohio.  Since this is a
suit against officials and/or agencies of the federal government,
venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1391(e).<BR> 4.  The plaintiff,
Peter D. Junger, is a citizen of the United States and a professor of
law at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland,
Ohio.<BR> 5.  The individual defendants are members of the executive
branch of the government of the United States.  The individual
defendants are sued as officers or employees of the United States
acting under color of law in their official capacities.<BR> 6.  Warren
Christopher is the United States Secretary of State.<BR> 7.  William
J. Lowell is the Director of the Department of State's Bureau of
Politico-Military Affairs, Office of Defense Trade Controls
("ODTC").<BR> 8.  Lt. General Kenneth A. Minihan is the Director of
the National Security Agency ("NSA").<BR> 9.  The defendants and their
respective agencies (also referred to as "the government") are
responsible for the interpretation and administration of the ITAR
provisions at issue in this complaint.<BR><BR> <CENTER>BACKGROUND<BR>
<I><BR> </CENTER></I><BR> 10.  The plaintiff teaches a course entitled
"Computers and the Law" at the Case Western Reserve University Law
School ("CWRU Law School"). The plaintiff has offered this course in
the fall semester of each year since 1993 and is scheduled to offer it
again this fall.<BR> 11.  In May 1993, the plaintiff wrote a short
encryption program that he intended to use in his class the following
fall.<BR> 12.  On numerous occasions beginning on or about May 7,
1993, the plaintiff contacted the Department of Commerce, Department
of State, the ODTC and the NSA to determine whether his program was
subject to export regulations.  To the best of plaintiff's knowledge
and information, any answer that the plaintiff received, or may have
received, from the persons he contacted is not binding on their
respective agencies and thus cannot be relied on by the plaintiff or
anyone else.<BR> 13.  The plaintiff has prepared, and continues to
prepare, materials for his computer law course. These materials
include (i) a casebook, which the plaintiff is currently revising for
use in class this coming fall, (ii) handouts supplementing and
extending the information contained in the casebook and (iii)
duplicates of some of those materials and additional materials that
will be available on the plaintiff's World Wide Web ("WWW," "Web")
server at http://samsara. law.cwru.edu or other WWW servers linked to
the plaintiff's server. <BR> 14.  These materials referred to in the
above paragraph currently include, or will include, the source code,
algorithm and representations of machine code for the encryption
program initially created by the plaintiff in May 1993 along with the
source codes, application programs and algorithms for other
cryptographic systems, including the Diffie-Hellman key distribution
protocol, the Hellman-Merkle public-key "knapsack" system (U.S. Patent
Number 4,218,582) and the RSA and RC4 algorithms. The materials will
also contain information on how to obtain and how to use programs
implementing the DES, triple-DES, or RSA algorithms, such as the
encryption program "Pretty Good Privacy" ("PGP").  The cryptographic
information<a name="F1"><a
href="#FN1"><sup><fontsize=-2>1</font></sup></a></a> included in the
plaintiff's materials, other than his program, was taken from public
sources, including materials published in books, journals and on
internet.<BR> 
15.  For fear of violating ITAR, the plaintiff has
refrained from disclosing his program and other cryptographic
information to foreign persons other than some Canadian students that
he allowed to enroll in his computer and law class in 1994 under the
belief that disclosure to Canadians was exempt from ITAR. For the same
reason, the plaintiff has not disclosed his program and other
cryptographic information at faculty discussions in the presence of
foreign colleagues and, other than the Canadian students in 1994, he
has not allowed foreign students to enroll in his computer and law
class.  The plaintiff has required, and continues to require, that
students taking the class certify that they are citizens of the United
States or admitted to permanent residence in the United States.  <BR>
16.  In class, the plaintiff has disclosed, and will continue to
disclose, cryptographic information, including source codes,
representations of machine code, and information on how to use and
where to obtain functioning encryption programs to his students.  For
class this coming fall, the plaintiff will require students to
participate in exercises that require them to obtain and have some
hands on experience with cryptographic software.<BR> 
 17.  In discussions on the internet, the plaintiff has been forced to
be very careful not to disclose cryptographic information to foreign
persons for fear of violating ITAR.  Thus, for example, on or about
August 22, 1994, after Paul Leyland of Oxford University Computing
Services in Oxford, England, posted a short encryption program written
in the "C" programming language and which performs the same encryption
function as the plaintiff's program, to the sci.crypt.research
newsgroup, the plaintiff could not respond, as he wished, by posting
his program to the newsgroup.  Moreover, when the plaintiff sent
Mr. Leyland an email message requesting permission to include
Mr. Leyland's program in his course materials, the plaintiff could not
disclose his program or Mr. Leyland's program to Mr. Leyland without
violating ITAR.<BR> 
18.  The plaintiff wants to publish his course
materials as a text book and has begun writing a law review article on
ITAR and cryptography that will include his program and other
cryptographic information. For fear of violating ITAR, the plaintiff
hesitates to publish his course materials and any law review article
that contains cryptographic information.  <BR> 
19. For fear of
violating ITAR, the plaintiff has refrained from making his course
materials available to others with whom he would like to share
information.  Thus, on or about May 29, 1996, Peter M.  Gerhart, who
was then the Dean of CWRU Law School, requested a copy of the
plaintiff's course materials for a colleague in the People's Republic
of China. The plaintiff was forced to deny this request since the
materials contained information that could not be sent to China
without a license or other permission from the ODTC.<BR> 
20.  None of
the cryptographic information that the plaintiff seeks to teach,
publish or otherwise disclose is classified information, and all of
it, other than the plaintiff's program, is available in books,
libraries and on the internet.<BR> 
21.  The plaintiff has been
informed and believes that the defendants have taken the position that
software that contains no cryptographic routines whatsoever, but which
could be modified to include cryptographic routines, (also referred to
as "crypto with a hole") is subject to regulation under ITAR.<BR> 
22.
The plaintiff is required to register for a fee with the ODTC and
obtain a license or approval before he can lawfully "export" his
program or other cryptographic information that is not specifically
exempted under ITAR. <BR> 
 23.  The definition of "export" in 22 C.F.R. &#167; 120.17 includes
"sending or taking a defense article out of the United States in any
manner," 22 C.F.R. &#167; 120.17(a)(1), "[d]isclosing (including oral
or visual disclosure) or transferring technical data to a foreign
person, whether in the United States or abroad, 22 C.F.R. &#167;
120.17(a)(4), and "performing a defense service on behalf of, or for
the benefit of, a foreign person," 22 C.F.R.  &#167; 120.17(a)(5).<a
name="F2"><a href="#FN2"><sup><fontsize=-2>2</font></sup></a></a><BR>
 24.  Cryptographic software is
classified as a "munition" under Category XIII of the United States
Munitions List ("USML"), 22 C.F.R. &#167; 121.1, and, thus, a "defense
article" under 22 C.F.R. &#167; 120.6.<BR> 
 25.  At least some, if not
all, of what is included under the definition of "cryptographic
software" is included under the definition of "technical data" in 22
C.F.R. &#167; 120.10, which is also listed on the USML under Category
XIII and, thus, is a defense article. The furnishing of cryptographic
software and cryptographic technical data to foreign persons may also
constitute a "defense service," as defined in 22 C.F.R. &#167;
120.9.<BR> 
 26.  Under 22 C.F.R. Part 122, a person who intends to
export a defense article or provide a defense service "on behalf of,
or for the benefit of, a foreign person" must register with the ODTC
for a fee of at least $250.00 even if that person is not in the
business of manufacturing or exporting defense articles or defense
services.<BR> 
 27.  Under 22 C.F.R. Parts 123-25, a person must obtain
a license or written approval from the ODTC before exporting a defense
article, defense service or technical data unless some specific
exemption applies.  <BR> 
 28.  Thus, absent some exemption, a person
must register with the ODTC and obtain a license or written approval
from the ODTC before exporting cryptographic software and/or technical
data.<BR> 
 29.  The public domain exemption in 22 C.F.R. &#167; 120.11
and the exemption for general scientific, mathematical or engineering
principles in 22 C.F.R.  &#167; 120.10(a)(5) do not exempt all of the
cryptographic information that the plaintiff seeks to disclose.<BR>
 30.  22 C.F.R. &#167; 127.1 makes it is unlawful <BR> <BLOCKQUOTE>to
export or attempt to export from the United States any defense article
or technical data or to furnish any defense service for which a
license or written approval is required ...  without first obtaining
the required license or written approval from the Office of Defense
Trade Controls.</BLOCKQUOTE> <BR> 
 31.  Under the provisions of ITAR
referred to in the paragraphs above, the defendants can require a
license or government approval prior to the dissemination of privately
developed, unclassified cryptographic software and/or technical data
to any foreign person within the United States and to anyone, without
limitation, outside the United States.<BR> <CENTER><BR> <BR> CLAIMS
FOR RELIEF<BR> <BR> <I>Count One: Prior restraint</I><BR> </CENTER><P>
 32.  The plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein paragraphs 1 to
31 as if fully rewritten.<BR> 33.  The plaintiff has been, and is,
compelled to exclude students who are "foreign persons" from his
computer law course because it would be a violation of the ITAR for
him to disclose cryptographic software and/or cryptographic technical
data that is not specifically exempted under ITAR to foreign students
without first applying for and obtaining a license or approval from
the ODTC.<BR> 
 34.  The plaintiff is prohibited from disclosing
cryptographic software and/or cryptographic technical data that is not
specifically exempted under ITAR to foreign students, lawyers,
professional colleagues and all other foreign persons without first
applying for and obtaining a license or approval from the ODTC.<BR>
 35.  The plaintiff is prohibited from publishing his course materials
and law review articles that contain cryptographic software and/or
cryptographic technical data that is not specifically exempted under
ITAR if the course materials and law review articles are available to
foreign persons within the United States or available outside the
United States without first applying for and obtaining a license or
approval from the ODTC.<BR> 
 36.  The plaintiff is prohibited from
publishing cryptographic software and/or cryptographic technical data
that is not specifically exempted under ITAR on the internet without
first applying for and obtaining a license or approval from the
ODTC.<BR> 
 37.  The plaintiff must register for a fee with the ODTC
before disclosing cryptographic software and/or technical data that is
not specifically exempted under ITAR to foreign students and foreign
colleagues or publishing cryptographic software and/or technical data
on the internet.<BR> 
 38.  ITAR's restrictions on the export of
"cryptographic software" and "technical data" without a license or the
government's approval have chilled the plaintiff's speech and have
caused him to restrict his research and censor his publications and
communications with foreign persons.<BR> 
 39.  There is no provision of
ITAR that allows for judicial review of ODTC decisions.<BR> 
40.  The
provisions of ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above constitute a
prepublication registration and licensing scheme, and thus a prior
restraint on free expression, in violation of the First Amendment to
the United States Constitution.
 <BR> <CENTER><BR> <I>Count Two:
Overbreadth and Vagueness</I><BR> <BR> <BR> </CENTER>
 41.  The
plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein paragraphs 1 to 40 as if
fully rewritten<BR> 
 42.  The provisions of ITAR referred to in the
paragraphs above, as written and as interpreted by the defendants,
control a substantial amount of speech.  The provisions in question
govern all disclosures of cryptographic software and all disclosures
of cryptographic technical data that are not specifically exempted,
including disclosures of unclassified information.<BR> 
 43.  The
provisions of ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above, as written and
as interpreted by the defendants, have been drafted and applied in
such a confusing way that the plaintiff cannot be sure what
cryptographic information is exempt from ITAR and what requires a
license or written approval from the ODTC. As a result, the
plaintiff's speech has been, and continues to be, chilled.<BR> 
 44.
The provisions of ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above, as written
and as interpreted by the defendants, have been drafted and applied in
such a confusing way that persons other than the plaintiff cannot be
sure what cryptographic information is exempt from ITAR and what
requires a license or written approval from the ODTC. The plaintiff is
informed and believes that, as a result, the speech of others has
been, and continues to be, chilled.<BR> 
 45.  To the best of
plaintiff's knowledge and information, there are no published criteria
or standards available to him or the public on which the defendants
base their decisions to grant or deny licenses for the export of
cryptographic information other than guidelines for the export of mass
market encryption software.<BR> 46.  The provisions of ITAR referred
to in the paragraphs above are overbroad and vague, facially and as
applied to the plaintiff's conduct, and are thus unconstitutional in
violation of the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States
Constitution.
 <BR> <CENTER><BR> <I>Count Three: Restrictions on
Academic Freedom and Political Speech</I><BR> <BR> <BR> </CENTER>
 47.
The plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein paragraphs 1 to 46 as
if fully rewritten.<BR> 
 48.  The provisions of ITAR referred to in the
paragraphs above restrict the plaintiff's rights to teach, research
and publish unclassified cryptographic information in whatever manner
he chooses and to whom he chooses.<BR> 
 49.  The provisions of ITAR
referred to in the paragraphs above also restrict and the rights of
the plaintiff and others, particularly foreign students and foreign
professors within the United States, to receive and discuss
unclassified cryptographic information.  <BR> 
 50.  A knowledge of
cryptography is important for understanding and evaluating government
efforts to establish key escrow systems, such as the Clipper Chip,
that have significant consequences for individual rights.  Thus,
cryptographic information is a matter of public debate, and in the
context of a public debate, restrictions on cryptographic information
are restrictions on political speech. <BR> 
 51.  The provisions of ITAR
referred to in the paragraphs above are not narrowly drawn, and the
government does not have a compelling interest to regulate all
unclassified cryptographic information.<BR> 
 52.  The provisions of
ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above are unconstitutional
restrictions on academic and political speech in violation of the
First Amendment .
 <BR> <CENTER><I><BR> Count Four: Freedom of
Association<BR> </I><BR> </CENTER><I> </I><BR> 
 53.  The plaintiff
realleges and incorporates herein paragraphs 1 to 52 as if fully
rewritten.<BR> 
 54.  The provisions of ITAR referred to in the
paragraphs above require that the plaintiff apply for, and obtain, a
license or approval from the government before allowing foreign
students to enroll in his class, before allowing foreign professors to
attend faculty discussions where cryptographic software and other
cryptographic information is discussed and before posting
cryptographic software and/or other cryptographic information on the
internet where it may be available to foreign persons. <BR> 55.  The
provisions of ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above restrict the
rights of the plaintiff and U.S. citizens and permanent residents to
freely associate with foreign persons to discuss cryptographic
information and further restrict the rights of foreign persons within
the United States to discuss cryptographic information with
U.S. citizens and permanent residents. <BR> 56.  The plaintiff and
anyone else intending to disclose cryptographic information for which
a license is required, other than those exporting mass encryption
software, must identify each and every recipient of the information,
including every foreign persons within the United States who receives
the information, in order to obtain a license from the ODTC.<BR> 57.
By requiring the identification of all recipients of cryptographic
information, the defendants are compelling the disclosure of foreign
persons who pose no threat to national security and with whom the
plaintiff and others communicate.<BR> 58.  It is practicably
impossible for the plaintiff to name each recipient of cryptographic
information that receives the information from the plaintiff's web
site or FTP server.<BR> 59.  The provisions of ITAR referred to in the
above paragraphs violate the plaintiff's and other's freedom of
association rights under the First Amendment.
 <BR> <BR>
<CENTER><I>Count Five: Separation of Powers<BR> </I><B><BR>
</CENTER></B><BR> 
 60.  The plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein
paragraphs 1 to 59 as if fully rewritten.<BR> 
 61.  The provisions of
the ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above allow the defendants to
control the dissemination of cryptographic information within the
United States and on the internet. <BR> 
 62.  The authority of the
defendants to implement and enforce ITAR is based on &#167; 38 of the
Arms Export Control Act ("AECA"), 22 U.S.C. &#167; 2778. <BR> 
 63.  The
AECA does not authorize the registration or licensing of disclosures
of unclassified cryptographic information within the United States,
including disclosures of unclassified cryptographic information on the
internet.<BR> 
 64.  By requiring registration and a license prior to
the disclosure of unclassified cryptographic software or cryptographic
technical data within the United States, the defendants are engaged in
controlling the exchange of cryptographic information between persons
within the United States, including the dissemination of cryptographic
information on the internet.  The defendants have therefore adopted
a<I> de facto</I> policy of restricting the domestic dissemination of
unclassified cryptographic information which has the direct effect of
restricting the availability of cryptographic software within the
United States.<BR> 
 65.  Congress, and not the Executive, is
constitutionally responsible for formulating and determining domestic
policy on cryptography and for placing restrictions on the
availability of cryptographic software within the United States.<BR>
 66.  Congress has not delegated its responsibility referred to in the
paragraph above to the President or the defendants. <BR> 
 67.  By
designating unclassified cryptographic software and technical data as
defense articles, the defendants are regulating information and
expression as defense articles.<BR> 
 68.  Section 2778(h) of the AECA
precludes judicial review of the designation of items as defense
articles.  <BR> 
 69.  To the extent that the AECA authorizes the
defendants to regulate disclosures of unclassified cryptographic
software and cryptographic technical data within the United States,
&#167; 2778(h) of the AECA unconstitutionally deprives the Judiciary
of its responsibility to review potential restrictions on information
and expression.<BR> 
 70.  Thus, the defendants act in violation of the
constitutional doctrine of separation of powers by regulating
unclassified cryptographic information in violation within the United
States.
 <BR> <CENTER> <BR>
 PRAYER FOR
RELIEF<BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
</CENTER></B>     WHEREFORE, the plaintiff demands
that judgment be entered against the defendants.  Specifically, the
plaintiff demands such declaratory, injunctive and other relief as
follows:<BR>
<BR>
(1)     A declaration that the provisions of the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 120 <I>et
seq.</I>, referred to in the paragraphs above that require registration and
a license or government approval before the "export" of unclassified
"cryptographic software" and "cryptographic technical data," as those terms
are defined in ITAR, are unconstitutional in violation of the First and
Fifth Amendments and the constitutional doctrine of separation of
powers.<BR>
(2)     A declaration that, to the extent that the Arms Export
Control Act, 22 U.S.C. &#167; 2778, authorizes the regulation of
unclassified cryptographic software and cryptographic technical data within
the United States, &#167; 2778(h) is unconstitutional in violation of the
constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.<BR>
(3)     Preliminary
and permanent injunctions enjoining the defendants from interpreting,
applying, and enforcing the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22
C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 120 <I>et seq.</I>, to require that the plaintiff and
his students register or obtain a license or approval from the defendants
before disclosing to any person or persons by speech, publication or any
other means or by any medium, any unclassified information about
cryptography, whether or not that information is included within the
definition of "software" or "technical data" as those terms are defined in
ITAR.<BR>
(4)      A permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from
interpreting, applying and enforcing the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations, 22 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 120 <I>et seq.</I>, to require that any
person or persons register or obtain a license or approval from the
government before disclosing to any other person or persons by speech,
publication or any other means or by any medium, any unclassified
information about cryptography, whether or not that information is included
within the definition of "software" or "technical data" as those terms are
defined in ITAR; <BR>
(5)      An award of attorney fees pursuant to the
Equal Access to Justice Act, costs and such other relief as the Court deems
proper.<BR>

 <h2><a name="s1">1 What Computers and the Law Is All About</a></h2>

 <p> I don't suppose that it often happens that at the end of a course the
  instructor feels the need that I now feel to explain what the course
  is really all about.  After all, most courses in law school are about
  so many things that they are not really about any particular thing,
  while those courses, like Law and the Chicken,<a name="F1"><a href="#FN1"><sup><fontsize=-2>1</font></sup></a></a>  for example, that are about some one
  thing, are clearly about that thing, and need no further explanation.

 <p> But the course in Computers and the Law is not about everything under
  the sun (and is not even about everything that the instructor's whim
  might lead him<a name="F2"><a href="#FN2"><sup><fontsize=-2>2</font></sup></a></a> to discuss).  On the
  other hand, the course in Computers and the Law is not really about
  computers, but rather about what we<a name="F3"><a href="#FN3"><sup><fontsize=-2>3</font></sup></a></a> make of them, or do
  with them, or can do with them---and how we do it.  That is,
  Computers and the Law is not about a ``thing''---not about
  anything---like a <em>computer</em>, but rather about a process---about
  a ``doing''---like the process that we, rather
  infelicitously,<a name="F4"><a href="#FN4"><sup><fontsize=-2>4</font></sup></a></a> call <em>computing</em>.  And, of
  course, the course is also about the law, but that too is not a
  tangible thing that just sits there like a bread box or a lump of
  iron, for the law too is a process, something that we, especially we
  lawyers, do.

 <p> One of the things that I am striving to teach---or, rather, to assist
  the students in understanding---in the course in Computers and the
  Law<a name="F5"><a href="#FN5"><sup><fontsize=-2>5</font></sup></a></a> is the
  importance of being able to distinguish between the tangible
  computer, sitting there like a lump of plastic and hardware on the
  desk, and the things that we do with computers---the processes that
  we run on computers.

 <p> But this distinction between the tangible thing and the intangible
  process is not the major theme of the course.  It is, after all, not
  that difficult in most cases to tell the dancer from the
  dance.<a name="F6"><a href="#FN6"><sup><fontsize=-2>6</font></sup></a></a>  And even if the distinction
  between the computer and what it does is not always that easy to
  make, one is not likely to confuse the two in practice.<a name="F7"><a href="#FN7"><sup><fontsize=-2>7</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> The critical distinction has to do, not with computers themselves,
  not with the hardware, but with the so-called software,<a name="F8"><a href="#FN8"><sup><fontsize=-2>8</font></sup></a></a> the programs
  that run on a computer.  That distinction is the distinction between
  software as a text<a name="F9"><a href="#FN9"><sup><fontsize=-2>9</font></sup></a></a> and software as a process.<a name="F10"><a href="#FN10"><sup><fontsize=-2>10</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> That distinction---which is also, when one gets right down to it, the
  distinction between the law in books and the law in
  action<a name="F11"><a href="#FN11"><sup><fontsize=-2>11</font></sup></a></a>---is the major subject of the course, and thus of this
  article.

 <p>

 <h2><a name="s2">2 The Importance of Distinguishing Between Text and Process</a></h2>

 <p> The distinction between between software as text and software as a
  process is critical to an understanding of how the law of copyright
  applies---or should apply---to computer programs.<a name="F12"><a href="#FN12"><sup><fontsize=-2>12</font></sup></a></a>  That distinction, or one very
  similar, is also critical to an understanding of how patent law
  applies to computer programs.<a name="F13"><a href="#FN13"><sup><fontsize=-2>13</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> The distinction, however, has its greatest importance---at least for
  a course in Computers and the Law offered in the United States---when
  one tries to understand how the First Amendment of the federal
  constitution applies to computer programs.

 <p><h3><a name="s2.1">2.1 The First Amendment and Computer Programs</a></h3>
 <p> Once one recognizes the distinction between software as a text and
  software as a process, one would think that the question of how the
  First Amendment applies to computer programs could easily be
  resolved: the First Amendment, like the Copyright
  Act,<a name="F14"><a href="#FN14"><sup><fontsize=-2>14</font></sup></a></a> quite obviously protects software as a
  text, but not as a process, and, of course, it does not protect the
  tangible, kickable hardware.<a name="F15"><a href="#FN15"><sup><fontsize=-2>15</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> The difficulty that people have with this distiction, however,
  appears to lie in recognizing it at all, rather than in figuring out
  how the First Amendment (or, for that matter, the Copyright Act)
  applies once the distinction has been made.  People seem to believe
  that software is software, a program is a program, and they just do
  not see that it makes any difference whether it---whatever ``it'' may
  be---is being communicated as a text or run as a process.

 <p> Before we go on and examine why it is difficult for many lawyers and
  law students---and others---to recognize this distinction, it
  probably would be best to point out that the issue of whether the
  First Amendment protects software is not a purely academic matter.
  At least one sort of software, ``cryptographic software'' very
  broadly defined,<a name="F16"><a href="#FN16"><sup><fontsize=-2>16</font></sup></a></a>  is subject, at the time I write these words, to a
  licensing scheme under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations
  (hereinafter the ``ITAR'') that would, I submit, clearly be
  unconstitutional were it to be applied to more traditional texts like
  political pamphlets or Harlequin romances or Playboy magazine.  I
  will discuss this licensing scheme and the particular problems that
  it presents hereafter<a name="F17"><a href="#FN17"><sup><fontsize=-2>17</font></sup></a></a>, but at this time I want to bring your attention to two
  statements that President Clinton made in an <em>Executive Order</em>
  and in an accompanying <em>Memorandum to the Vice President</em>
  ordering the transfer of the administration of this licensing scheme
  from the State Department to the Department of Commerce:
 <blockquote>
  Because the export of encryption software, like the export of other
  encryption products described in this section, must be controlled
  because of such software's functional capacity, rather than because
  of any possible informational value of such software, such software
  shall not be considered or treated as ``technology,'' as that term is
  defined in section 16 of the EAA (50 U.S.C. App. 2415) and in the EAR
  (61 Fed. Reg. 12714, March 25, 1996)[.]<a name="F18"><a href="#FN18"><sup><fontsize=-2>18</font></sup></a></a>
 </blockquote>
  and
 <blockquote>
  Because encryption source code can easily and mechanically be
  transformed into object code, and because export of such source code
  is controlled because of the code's functional capacity, rather than
  because of any ``information'' such code might convey, the Final
  Regulations shall specify that encryption source code shall be
  treated as an encryption product, and not as technical data or
  technology, for export licensing
  purposes.<a name="F19"><a href="#FN19"><sup><fontsize=-2>19</font></sup></a></a>
 </blockquote>

  <h3><a name="s2.2">2.2 Functional Capability <em>Versus</em> Informational  Value</a></h3>

 <p> The distinction that President Clinton attempts to make in the
  <em>Executive Order</em> between the ``functional capability''---or the
  ``functional capacity''---of the software, on the one hand, and its
  ``informational value''---or ``the `information' . . . [it] might
  convey''---, on the other, is pretty much the distinction between the
  process---the execution of instructions contained in the software---,
  on the one hand, and the text containing those instructions, on the
  other.  Quite clearly,<a name="F20"><a href="#FN20"><sup><fontsize=-2>20</font></sup></a></a> the President makes this distinction
  because he recognizes that the First Amendment protects the
  communication of information, even information about cryptography,
  but does not so clearly protect, and arguably does not protect at
  all, the process of running a cryptographic program on a
  computer.<a name="F21"><a href="#FN21"><sup><fontsize=-2>21</font></sup></a></a>

  The problem that the Administration faces can be easily, if not
  succintly, stated.<a name="F22"><a href="#FN22"><sup><fontsize=-2>22</font></sup></a></a>  They<a name="F23"><a href="#FN23"><sup><fontsize=-2>23</font></sup></a></a> want to be
  able to eavesdrop on communications throughout the world and to read
  any stored information, which is difficult to do if the
  communications and the information are encrypted.<a name="F24"><a href="#FN24"><sup><fontsize=-2>24</font></sup></a></a>  So they
  would like to outlaw the use of encryption, which they probably
  cannot do within the United States because Congress will not go along
  with it,<a name="F25"><a href="#FN25"><sup><fontsize=-2>25</font></sup></a></a> and which they could not do, even if Congress went
  along with it, in any effective manner outside of the United States.
  But the Administration---the Executive Branch---does have the
  authority to regulate exports, both as a matter of its own inherent
  authority<a name="F26"><a href="#FN26"><sup><fontsize=-2>26</font></sup></a></a> and under the authority of the Arms
  Export Control Act<a name="F27"><a href="#FN27"><sup><fontsize=-2>27</font></sup></a></a> (``AECA'') and the Export
  Administration Act,<a name="F28"><a href="#FN28"><sup><fontsize=-2>28</font></sup></a></a> (``EAA'') even if the
  latter act has expired and is no longer actually in
  force.<a name="F29"><a href="#FN29"><sup><fontsize=-2>29</font></sup></a></a>  So the solution would seem at first
  glance to be to forbid the export of devices that are capable of
  encrypting communications and information, <em>i.e.</em>, that are, in
  the words of the ITAR, capable of ``maintaining secrecy or
  confidentiality of information or information
  systems''.<a name="F30"><a href="#FN30"><sup><fontsize=-2>30</font></sup></a></a>

  But that solution will not work---and not only because there are many
  foreign enterprises that are capable of making dedicated
  cryptographic devices and that would be delighted not to have
  competition from United States firms---for the fact of the matter is
  that any general purpose computer---even the old 8088 laptop, which
  is not nearly powerful enough to run MSWindows and which has a
  dysfunctional battery to boot, that I keep by the telephone and use
  as an address book---is capable of being programmed to maintain
  secrecy and confidentiality.  Every programmable computer is a
  potential cryptographic device.  And, though the Administration may
  be willing to forbid the export of a few high-end super-computers, it
  is not willing to---and probably as a political, if not a legal, matter
  is not able to---forbid the export of all computers.  That, after
  all, would almost certainly have disastrous consequences for the
  economy of the United States.

 <p> So, if it is not possible to forbid the the export of computers that
  are capable of running cryptographic programs, why not just forbid
  the export of the programs themselves, <em>i.e.</em>, of information
  about how to use a computer as a cryptographic device?<a name="F31"><a href="#FN31"><sup><fontsize=-2>31</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> There are, however, a couple of objections to this approach, though
  the first is easily solvable by an Administration that believes that
  among its inherent powers is that of Humpty Dumpty to have words mean
  only what they want them to mean.<a name="F32"><a href="#FN32"><sup><fontsize=-2>32</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> The first objection is that ordinarily it is only tangible
  goods---tangible devices, like computers---that are exportable.  The
  solution, of course, is to define ``export'' so that it includes the
  communication of information, even the communication of information
  within the United States if the communication is to a foreign
  person---or to a public that inevitably includes foreign persons---as
  being an export.<a name="F33"><a href="#FN33"><sup><fontsize=-2>33</font></sup></a></a> 
  So that takes care of the first problem.<a name="F34"><a href="#FN34"><sup><fontsize=-2>34</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> But the other problem is trickier, because it is not just a matter of
  definitions.  The difficulty is that the government's requiring one
  to get a license before communicating information publically---before
  publishing information---is the classic example of an
  unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the First
  Amendment.<a name="F35"><a href="#FN35"><sup><fontsize=-2>35</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> ``But,'' says our President, ``I am not forbidding the communication
  of information, I am just forbidding the communication of the
  functionality.''  

 <p> As if one could communicate anything other than information.

 <p> As if the information that may be ``conveyed'' by software is
  anything other the way it functions.

 <p> Still I am quite sure that, at least in this instance, the President
  is being sincere.  Those who are not familiar with the way that
  computers work---and some of those who have that familiarity---just
  don't get it.  And I am afraid that that group includes the
  President.<a name="F36"><a href="#FN36"><sup><fontsize=-2>36</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> But sincere incomprehension of what it is that computers do---even
  when coupled with a sincere dislike of the whole <em>infra dig</em>
  idea of ever having even to touch a computer<a name="F37"><a href="#FN37"><sup><fontsize=-2>37</font></sup></a></a>---hardly is sufficient justification, as
  a legal matter, for denying the protection of the First Amendment to
  the authors and publishers<a name="F38"><a href="#FN38"><sup><fontsize=-2>38</font></sup></a></a> of computer programs, especially when it is not
  only cryptographic software that would be deprived of First Amendment
  protection were the courts to accept this argument from ignorance.
  If the government can forbid the communication of the text of
  computer programs that have the capability of ``maintaining secrecy
  or confidentiality of information or information
  systems''<a name="F39"><a href="#FN39"><sup><fontsize=-2>39</font></sup></a></a>
  then it would seem that it could forbid the communication of the
  <em>text</em> of any computer program whose <em>use</em> it finds
  objectionable.<a name="F40"><a href="#FN40"><sup><fontsize=-2>40</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> 
  <h4><a name="s2.2.1">2.2.1 On Not Getting It</a></h4>
 <p> The question naturally arises, if the distinction betweeen programs
  as text and programs as process is as clear and as important as I
  claim, why is it that so many don't get it?

 <p> The short answer, of course, is that they don't get it because they
  haven't taken my course in Computers and the Law.<a name="F41"><a href="#FN41"><sup><fontsize=-2>41</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> A better answer is that most of those who fail to grasp the
  distinction between a program as a text and a program as a
  process<a name="F42"><a href="#FN42"><sup><fontsize=-2>42</font></sup></a></a> have never knowingly<a name="F43"><a href="#FN43"><sup><fontsize=-2>43</font></sup></a></a> read or written
  a computer program.

 <p> There is an old story about the professor who admitted, with some
  embarassment, that he did not know how a radio worked.  One of his
  students, surprised at such ignorance, said:  ``But that's easy.  You
  just push the on switch and then turn the dial to the station that
  you want to hear.''

 <p> OK.  So you know how to turn a computer on, and slip in a floppy
  disk, and use the mouse to click on the icon for whatever word
  processor it is that you use.<a name="F44"><a href="#FN44"><sup><fontsize=-2>44</font></sup></a></a>
  But that does not mean that you know anything about computer
  programs or programming.

 <p> Surely that is enough to explain why the ordinary computer user does
  not grasp the distinction between programs as texts and programs as
  processes. 

 <p><h4><a name="s2.2.2">2.2.2 What Do Digital Programmable Computers Do?</a></h4>

 <p> My course in Computers and the Law<a name="F45"><a href="#FN45"><sup><fontsize=-2>45</font></sup></a></a> is not about all forms of computers, for it does not deal
  with slide rules and abaci and so-called ``neural-nets''.
  It is only about digital, programmable computers.

 <p> Now to the ordinary user<a name="F46"><a href="#FN46"><sup><fontsize=-2>46</font></sup></a></a> of such a computer,
  the terms ``digital'' and ``programmable'' may sound familiar, but
  they are not likely to be very meaningful, since the user seldom
  comes across data in digital form and has neither the occasion nor
  the ability to do any programming.  So one of the first things I to
  do in the course is to introduce the students to those concepts and
  even try to give them a little hands-on experience, which is not that
  easy in a course with no lab component.<a name="F47"><a href="#FN47"><sup><fontsize=-2>47</font></sup></a></a>

  Fortunately one can run simple computer programs in one's head and
  simulate their operations on a blackboard, stepping through the
  instructions one by one.<a name="F48"><a href="#FN48"><sup><fontsize=-2>48</font></sup></a></a>  One can also explain about digits, using one's
  fingers or some marks on a blackboard as an example.  And one can
  explain enough about logic gates---with a little hand-waving and the
  use of some truth-tables---to let the students understand enough
  about how computers manipulate digits for the purposes of the
  course.<a name="F49"><a href="#FN49"><sup><fontsize=-2>49</font></sup></a></a>

 The first case that we deal with in the course,<a name="F50"><a href="#FN50"><sup><fontsize=-2>50</font></sup></a></a> <em>Gottschalk</em> v.
  <em>Benson</em>,<a name="F51"><a href="#FN51"><sup><fontsize=-2>51</font></sup></a></a> supplies
  the motivation for studying this material.  It holds that an
  algorithm,<a name="F52"><a href="#FN52"><sup><fontsize=-2>52</font></sup></a></a> even one that specifies a
  process<a name="F53"><a href="#FN53"><sup><fontsize=-2>53</font></sup></a></a> that runs on a computer, cannot be patented, and computer
  programs are basically algorithms written as a set of instructions to
  a computer.<a name="F54"><a href="#FN54"><sup><fontsize=-2>54</font></sup></a></a>  So <em>Benson</em> appears to hold that
  computer programs cannot be patented,<a name="F55"><a href="#FN55"><sup><fontsize=-2>55</font></sup></a></a> which is a good reason for trying to
  figure out what computer programs are and what they do.

 <p> <em>Benson</em> serves as a good introduction for another reason: it is
  an excellent demonstration of the operations that are actually
  performed by a computer: the rearrangement of signs---of the binary
  digits ``1'' and ``0''---that we interpret as symbols.  The algorithm
  in <em>Benson</em> specified a method for converting binary coded
  decimal number symbols into the corresponding binary coded number
  symbols.<a name="F56"><a href="#FN56"><sup><fontsize=-2>56</font></sup></a></a>  In other words, a program implementing the
  algorithm would contain a set of instructions that, when implemented,
  would cause a computer that was fed a certain pattern of one's and
  zero's to spit out another pattern of such binary digits, patterns
  that we can treat as symbolizing---as representing---numbers, or. if
  we wish, as representing letters or the key to a secret code.

 <p> All that digital computers do, all that they can do, is receive a
  pattern of ones and zeros, which we may choose to interpret as being
  the binary representation of a number, and then, in accordance with
  the instructions<a name="F57"><a href="#FN57"><sup><fontsize=-2>57</font></sup></a></a> that comprise their program, produce a pattern---a string of
  one and zeros---, which we may also choose to interpret as a binary
  representation of a number, or as an English phrase, or as one of the
  innumerable names of God.

 <p> And <em>nota bene</em> that both the input and the output are simply a
  text, text that contains a number, or an English phrase, or a
  computer program, or some of the innumerable names of God.

 <p> Now, as you have probably noticed, I do not seem to be able to do a
  good job of explaining these matters in this article.  It is much
  easier to actually demonstrate the points at a blackboard, by
  stepping through the algorithm and showing how, if one just follows
  the instructions, one pattern gets converted to another.

 <p> I must confess, however, that I have never been able to actually step
  through the <em>Benson</em> algorithm and get the right result.  I am
  not very good at that sort of thing, and anyway we have computers to
  do jobs like that.<a name="F58"><a href="#FN58"><sup><fontsize=-2>58</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> So I solved that problem by writing a program<a name="F59"><a href="#FN59"><sup><fontsize=-2>59</font></sup></a></a> that implements a much
  simpler algorithm---in fact, the simplest useful algorithm that I
  have ever come across---an algorithm for encrypting a plain text
  message by using a one-time pad.  The program itself is very short,
  the actual machine code is only 111 bytes<a name="F60"><a href="#FN60"><sup><fontsize=-2>60</font></sup></a></a> in length.
  The source code in assembly language is much longer, but that is
  mainly because it contains a lot of comments explaining how it
  works.  And the instructions for using the program are also given as
  comments in the source code.  

 <p> I include the program in my course materials<a name="F61"><a href="#FN61"><sup><fontsize=-2>61</font></sup></a></a> so that my students can read it<a name="F62"><a href="#FN62"><sup><fontsize=-2>62</font></sup></a></a> and then in
  class we step through<a name="F63"><a href="#FN63"><sup><fontsize=-2>63</font></sup></a></a> the instructions---just the three or four critical
  instructions<a name="F64"><a href="#FN64"><sup><fontsize=-2>64</font></sup></a></a>---and observe how they cause a byte
  taken from the plain text---from the unencrypted message---to be
  twiddled<a name="F65"><a href="#FN65"><sup><fontsize=-2>65</font></sup></a></a> together
  with a byte taken from the one-time pad and the result to then be put
  in the file that contains the encrypted text.

 <p> Besides the source code in assembly language, the materials also
  include a hexidecimal<a name="F66"><a href="#FN66"><sup><fontsize=-2>66</font></sup></a></a> representation of the
  program's machine code, the product of running the source code
  through an assembler program.<a name="F67"><a href="#FN67"><sup><fontsize=-2>67</font></sup></a></a>  I do not expect the students to read this text---few people
  can actually read 8086 machine code---but I do require them to input
  it, hexidecimal digit by hexidecimal digit, using the primitive
  hexidecimal editor included in the MSDOS utility known as DEBUG, and
  to save it as a file known as TWI.COM.

  TWI.COM is thus an actual working version of my little encryption
  program.  The students can get further hands-on experience by running
  it.  Initially I supply them with a plain text<a name="F68"><a href="#FN68"><sup><fontsize=-2>68</font></sup></a></a>  and a key,
  <em>i.e.</em>, a one-time pad.<a name="F69"><a href="#FN69"><sup><fontsize=-2>69</font></sup></a></a> Using TWI.COM and the key
  to decrypt the secret message contained in the text produces another
  copy of the TWI.COM program.

 <p> A little more experimenting with the program should be enough to
  convince one of the contra-intuitive fact that, if one has a text
  that is n bytes long, with the approriate key one can demonstrate
  that that text contains any other text of the same length.  Thus, for
  example, one can show that the first few lines of <em>Hamlet</em>
  contain the secret message: ``This here play was written by me, the
  Earl of Oxford'', and that the electronic edition of <em>Alice in
  Wonderland</em> is actually an encrypted version of the help-file
  included in MicroSoft Windows 95.<a name="F70"><a href="#FN70"><sup><fontsize=-2>70</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> And by these means I hope that the students in my course in Computers
  and the Law do obtain a working knowledge of what programs are, and
  understanding of the nature of programs both as text and as working
  processes.

 <p> 
  <h4><a name="s2.2.3">2.2.3 Reading and Writing Computer Programs</a></h4>
 <p> The Jargon File contains the following three definitions:
 <blockquote>
  program: n. 1. A magic spell cast over a computer allowing it to turn
  one's input into error messages. 2. An exercise in experimental
  epistemology. 3. A form of art, ostensibly intended for the
  instruction of computers, which is nevertheless almost inevitably a
  failure if other programmers can't understand
  it.<a name="F71"><a href="#FN71"><sup><fontsize=-2>71</font></sup></a></a>
 </blockquote>

 <p> The first of these definitions defines ``program'' from the point of
  view of a user; the third defines the term from the point of view of
  a programmer.<a name="F72"><a href="#FN72"><sup><fontsize=-2>72</font></sup></a></a>  From a programmer's
  point of view, a program is a text that the programmer writes that,
  though it contains instructions that are intended ultimately to be
  run on a computer,  must be comprehensible at least to its author and
  normally also to other programmers.  

 <p> If the programmer does not understand how the program works, then one
  can be pretty sure that it won't work at all, and even if it does
  work, the programmer will never be able to modify it or improve
  it. If one is going to write a program successfully, one has to be
  able to step through the program in one's own head.  If one cannot do
  that, one can hardly expect to know what the program will do or how
  it can be debugged.  Most programs of any significance, moreover, are
  written by a team of programmers or, if they are written by a single
  author, are part of a larger project.  So it is not only the original
  author who has to be able to read and understand the program, it is
  all the other programmers on the team.

  Those whose job it is to maintain the program and get it to work with
  other programs also have a need to read it and understand it.  Even
  if the original author never reads the program, all the support
  personnel who maintain it are going to have to read
  it.<a name="F73"><a href="#FN73"><sup><fontsize=-2>73</font></sup></a></a>  It is only the poor user who cannot read it and usually
  does not have access to it.  And that is why users are so often
  losers.<a name="F74"><a href="#FN74"><sup><fontsize=-2>74</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> Writing programs hardly differs from writing other functional texts.
  It is very much like legal drafting<a name="F75"><a href="#FN75"><sup><fontsize=-2>75</font></sup></a></a>, or writing technical manuals
  or instructions on how to assemble a lawn mower, or preparing tables
  of useful information like the values of the sine of x for varying
  values of x or the opening and closing prices of all issues of
  stock sold on the New York Stock Exchange for each day of the last
  three years, or compiling the white pages of a Telephone Directory or
  a book of recipes entitled ``How to Cook a Seagull''.  But surely no
  one<a name="F76"><a href="#FN76"><sup><fontsize=-2>76</font></sup></a></a>
  would argue that a book containing mathematical tables or a sheet of
  paper containing the instructions for assembling a lawn mower or a
  cookbook is not a text entitled to the protection of the First
  Amendment, just because it is functional.

 <p> Consider that book of mathematical tables.  In the good old days
  BC<a name="F77"><a href="#FN77"><sup><fontsize=-2>77</font></sup></a></a> one would use it to find the value of
  \sin x for whatever value of x you were interested in.  Today you
  would probably use a computer program to calculate that
  value.<a name="F78"><a href="#FN78"><sup><fontsize=-2>78</font></sup></a></a> Thus the computer program and the book of mathematical tables
  have exactly the same functionality.<a name="F79"><a href="#FN79"><sup><fontsize=-2>79</font></sup></a></a> The book and
  the computer program are both texts, while looking something up in
  the book or running the computer program is a process.

 <p> As you may recall, President Clinton in his <em>Memorandum to the
  Vice President</em> stressed that the new Commerce Department regulations
  licensing the ``export'' of cryptography applied to source code
  ``[b]ecause source code can easily and mechanically be transformed
  into object code, and because export of such source code is
  controlled because of the code's functional capacity, rather than
  because of any ``information'' such code might
  convey[.]''<a name="F80"><a href="#FN80"><sup><fontsize=-2>80</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> This passage succinctly, if rather cryptically, restates an argument
  that has repeatedly been made by the government's lawyers in
  cases---including the one I brought<a name="F81"><a href="#FN81"><sup><fontsize=-2>81</font></sup></a></a>---challenging the constitutionality of those
  provisions of the ITAR that treat the publication, or other
  disclosure to foreign persons, of cryptographic software as an
  ``export'' that is subject to the licensing requirements of the ITAR
  and of the Arms Export Control Act.<a name="F82"><a href="#FN82"><sup><fontsize=-2>82</font></sup></a></a>

 <p>  The problem that the government has in those cases, or at least in
   <em>Karn</em><a name="F83"><a href="#FN83"><sup><fontsize=-2>83</font></sup></a></a> and
   <em>Bernstein</em>,<a name="F84"><a href="#FN84"><sup><fontsize=-2>84</font></sup></a></a> that inspired this argument is
   that the cryptographic programs at issue in those cases were
   written---and would, if the plaintiffs prevail in those suits, be
   published---not as working programs that would actually run on a
   computer, but as ``source code'' written in a fairly high level
   computer language known as ``C''.<a name="F85"><a href="#FN85"><sup><fontsize=-2>85</font></sup></a></a> Such source code is written
  by human beings<a name="F86"><a href="#FN86"><sup><fontsize=-2>86</font></sup></a></a>
  in the C ``language'' and is intended to be read by other human
  beings<a name="F87"><a href="#FN87"><sup><fontsize=-2>87</font></sup></a></a> as
  well as to be compiled into so-called ``object code'' or ``machine
  code'', instructions represented as binary numbers that can actually
  be executed by the computer (and that are more difficult for a human
  being to understand, and much more difficult for for a human being to
  modify, than the corresponding instructions in the source code.)
  Thus, before the government could argue---or at least assert---that
  it was imposing its licensing requirements on the program's
  functionality rather than on its text---or on the information
  contained in its text---, it had to argue---or at least assert---that
  source code, which clearly does and is intended to convey information
  to other human beings, has ``functional capability''.

 <p> And, of course, source code does have functional capability, but so
  does a book of legal forms or a cookbook.  You copy out a form on a
  xerox machine, fill in the blanks with your ball point pen, and then
  sign it in front of witnesses and---voila!---there you have a new
  will.  You compile the source code of Paul Leyland's program in two
  lines of C,<a name="F88"><a href="#FN88"><sup><fontsize=-2>88</font></sup></a></a> which might
  not be quite as easy a job as President Clinton claims, feed it a
  chunk of plain text and a one-time pad, and---voila!---out pops an
  encrypted message.  You clean the seagull, place it in a large pot with
  two pounds of parsnips, a large onion, and a pint chicken broth, add
  a number two can of kidney beans and a bay leaf, place a cover on the
  pot, and leave it to simmer for four hours, just as the recipe says,
  and, after two hours---oops!---the whole mess explodes and you have a
  good cause of action against the cookbook's author who never told you
  that you should open that can of beans.

  The fact that the source code can be compiled into object code does
  not make that source code less of a text.  I am, after all, writing
  this text in the form of LaTeX source code and it is only after I
  ``easily and mechanically'' transform that source code by running it
  through the LaTeX program to create a .dvi file---which is not what
  I would call humanly readable---, and easily and mechanically
  transform that .dvi file by running it through the DVIPS program to
  create a PostScript file---which is nearly as hard to read as the
  .dvi file---, and then send that file to a PostScript printer that
  ``easily and mechanically'' prints out the hard-copy version of this
  article, all nicely typeset, that there is a text in the form that
  you are reading it.  Yet all those various forms---the LaTeX file,
  the .dvi file, the PostScript file, and the hard-copy
  version---are texts, and are really all the same text, since they all
  contain the same information, <em>viz.</em>, this article.<a name="F89"><a href="#FN89"><sup><fontsize=-2>89</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> And the fact that the object code---the machine code---is not easily
  humanly readable does not keep it from being a text.  In fact, in
  <em>Apple Computer, Inc.</em> v. <em>Franklin Computer
  Corp.</em><a name="F90"><a href="#FN90"><sup><fontsize=-2>90</font></sup></a></a> the court held that
  object code is not only a text, but a ``literary work'' and
  copyrightable as such.<a name="F91"><a href="#FN91"><sup><fontsize=-2>91</font></sup></a></a>  And the fact that machine code
  is difficult to read does not mean that it is never read; quite the
  contrary.  If one wants to find out how a program works, and one does
  not have access to the source, then all one can do is decompile or
  disassemble the machine code, which one can do mechanically, if not
  easily, and get back something that more or less resembles the
  original source code without any comments or helpful mnemonic
  labels.  And then one can read that decompiled or disassembled
  machine code and find out how the program works.

 <p> This ability to decompile or disassemble the machine code has
  generated some interesting legal issues, for software publishers that
  only supply machine code versions of their programs often claim both
  that the machine code is protected by copyright and that it is
  protected as a trade secret.  But if one can decompile the machine
  code and figure out how it works, it is not much of a secret is
  it?<a name="F92"><a href="#FN92"><sup><fontsize=-2>92</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> Now frankly I would not be too upset if the courts were to grant less
  constitutional protection to machine code than to source code.  That
  would mean that almost all the programs that I use would still be
  constitutionally protected since they are supplied in source code
  form.<a name="F93"><a href="#FN93"><sup><fontsize=-2>93</font></sup></a></a> And it would mean that that the commercial programs that are
  supplied by outfits like Micorsoft without source code would not be
  protected.

 <p> There would be a certain justice in that result.  But I do not see
  how it could be constitutionally justified.  Microsoft's programs
  are, when they are being sold to some unfortunate user, texts, and
  just because those texts may be badly written and quite unreadable
  and contain little functional capability does not mean that they
  should not be protected as texts.  I mean, if we insisted that texts
  be readable, then few law review articles would be entitled to
  constitutional protection.

 <p>

 <h2><a name="s3">3 Copyright</a></h2>

 <p> The distinction between text and process, which is, or so I contend,
  critical to an understanding of computers and the law, is made most
  clearly in the law of copyright. Thus the Copyright Act provides:
 <blockquote>
  Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in
 original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of
 expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be
 perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or
 with the aid of a machine or device.<a name="F94"><a href="#FN94"><sup><fontsize=-2>94</font></sup></a></a>
 </blockquote>
  Although the term is not used, it would be hard to find a better
  definition of ``text'' than ``a work of authorship''.  The Copyright
  Act also provides:
 <blockquote>
    In no case does copyright protection for an original work of
  authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of
  operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form
  in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such
  work.<a name="F95"><a href="#FN95"><sup><fontsize=-2>95</font></sup></a></a>
 </blockquote>
  And there we have the specific statement that copyright protection
  does not extend to a ``process.''

 <p> But there we also come across a problem with my claim that the major
  distinction is between texts, or works of authorship, on the one
  hand, and processes, or procedures and methods of operation, on the
  other, for the Copyright Act lumps processes and similar concepts
  together with ideas, concepts, principles, and discoveries, which,
  though they are clearly not texts, are as clearly not what most of us
  mean by the term ``processes''.  

 <p> In the law of copyright the traditional distinction has not been
  between texts and processes, it has been between ideas and the
  expression of ideas.  Thus, for example, in <em>Mazer</em> v.
  <em>Stein</em><a name="F96"><a href="#FN96"><sup><fontsize=-2>96</font></sup></a></a> the Supreme Court said:
  ``Unlike a patent, a copyright gives no exclusive right to the art
  disclosed; protection is given only to the expression of the
  idea---not the idea itself.''<a name="F97"><a href="#FN97"><sup><fontsize=-2>97</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> There is, however, a couple of good reasons for my not treating the
  idea/expression dichotomy as fundamental.  In the first place, that
  distinction applies only to copyrights, and not to First Amendment or
  to Patent rights.  In the second place, if one takes the distinction
  seriously, one is likely to get bogged down in serious metaphysical
  problems:<a name="F98"><a href="#FN98"><sup><fontsize=-2>98</font></sup></a></a> I mean, how on earth can one have an idea without
  expressing it?  How can one tell the idea from its expression?

 <p> If we were only discussing copyright law we could say that the
  fundamental distinction is between texts and whatever it is---idea,
  system, or process---that the text might be said to contain.  It is
  only when one tries to find a distinction that applies to copyright,
  to patent, and to First Amendment law, that the text/process
  dichotomy seems to be the fundamental distinction.  I am not, after
  all, claiming that this distinction actually exists in some sort of
  Platonic reality, I am only suggesting that it is a useful tool when
  one tries to understand the subject matter of my course in Computers
  and the Law.

 <p> In that context, the major issue in copyright law has to do with
  distinguishing between protecting a computer program as a
  text<a name="F99"><a href="#FN99"><sup><fontsize=-2>99</font></sup></a></a> and not
  protecting it as a process.<a name="F100"><a href="#FN100"><sup><fontsize=-2>100</font></sup></a></a>
  The Supreme Court has never considered this issue and the circuits
  have not treated it consistently.

 <p> In <em>Apple Computer, Inc.</em> v. <em>Franklin Computer
  Corp.</em><a name="F101"><a href="#FN101"><sup><fontsize=-2>101</font></sup></a></a> the Third
  Circuit held that Franklin's copying of the Apple II <em>operating
  system</em><a name="F102"><a href="#FN102"><sup><fontsize=-2>102</font></sup></a></a> was
  an infringement of Apple's copyright, despite the clear language of
  the statute that the protecion of copyright does not extend to
  systems and methods of operation.  On the other hand, in <em>Lotus
  Development Corporation</em> v. <em>Borland International,
  Inc.</em><a name="F103"><a href="#FN103"><sup><fontsize=-2>103</font></sup></a></a> the First Circuit held
  that Borland's copying of the ``computer menu command hierarchy'' in
  Lotus 1-2-3 was not an infringement of Lotus's copyright, because the
  Lotus menu command hierarchy is a system, method of operation,
  process, or procedure.

 <p> There is obviously an exam question or two lurking there.

 <p>

 <h2><a name="s4">4 Patents</a></h2>



 <p> Patent protection, unlike copyright protection, expressly covers
  processes.  Thus the Patent Act provides:
 <blockquote>
  Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine,
  manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful
  improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the
  conditions and requirements of this title.<a name="F104"><a href="#FN104"><sup><fontsize=-2>104</font></sup></a></a>
 </blockquote>

 <p> On the other hand, the Supreme Court has read several exceptions into
  this list of patentable subject matters.  The matters that cannot be
  patented include ``ideas'' and ``phenomena of nature''.  And in
  <em>Gottschalk</em> v. <em>Benson</em><a name="F105"><a href="#FN105"><sup><fontsize=-2>105</font></sup></a></a> the Court held that an algorithm for use in a
  computer program could not be patented, perhaps because an algorithm
  is an idea or a natural law, like magnetism,<a name="F106"><a href="#FN106"><sup><fontsize=-2>106</font></sup></a></a> but more
  probably because an algorithm, although a process, is a mental
  process---one that one can, at least in theory and perhaps very
  slowly, run in one's head.<a name="F107"><a href="#FN107"><sup><fontsize=-2>107</font></sup></a></a>

  On the other hand, in <em>Diamond</em> v.
  <em>Diehr</em><a name="F108"><a href="#FN108"><sup><fontsize=-2>108</font></sup></a></a> the Court held that a
  patent was not invalid just because it claimed a mathematical formula
  and called for the use of a computer as part of an invention that
  otherwise fell within the scope of patentable subject
  matter.<a name="F109"><a href="#FN109"><sup><fontsize=-2>109</font></sup></a></a>  And the Federal Circuit of late has
  taken to acting as if it had overruled
  <em>Benson</em>.<a name="F110"><a href="#FN110"><sup><fontsize=-2>110</font></sup></a></a>

 <p> One question that we took up in the course is whether the patent that
  was issued on the RSA public-key encryption algorithm is
  valid.<a name="F111"><a href="#FN111"><sup><fontsize=-2>111</font></sup></a></a>
  A more interesting question though is whether one can get both a
  patent on a computer program claimed as a process and a copyright on
  the same program claimed as a text.

 <p>

 <h2><a name="s5">5 The ITAR and I</a></h2>

 <p> A major concern of mine, that kept intruding into the course, even
  when perhaps it was inappropriate, is the problem that the ITAR
  causes me.

 <p> Since it expressly forbids the disclosure of cryptographic software,
  including algorithms, to foreign persons within the United States or
  abroad and defines cryptographic software as including software
  with the capability of maintaining secrecy or confidentiality, unless
  one first obtains a license---a so-called Commodity Jurisdiction
  Determination---from the Department of State, I have been unable to
  publish my course materials and make them available on my world wide
  web server, because they include the text of my little encryption
  program and of Paul Leyland's similar program in two lines of C and
  of the RSA source code and of the reverse-engineered RC2 and RC4
  programs, and information about where one can get the Pretty Good
  Privacy encryption program---a practicable public key encryption
  program.

 <p> Not being able to supply the world with the text of the Pretty Good
  Privacy Program, because it has the capability when run of protecting
  one's privacy, raises a particularly tricky legal issue, since I am
  convinced that any lawyer who uses e-mail or the world wide web to
  communicate with his clients has the ethical---and perhaps in some
  cases the legal---duty to make it possible for them to effectively
  encrypt their communications.

 <p> How can one have a duty to use the process of encryption---to use
  cryptographic software---when communicating with one's clients and at
  the same time have a duty not to disclose the text of that software to
  one's clients?

 <p> I think that that is more than just a potential exam question.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN1"></a><a href="#F1">1</a></b>  This may not
 be a good example, for any course that must deal with both the
 <em>Sick Chicken</em> Case (A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United
 States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935) (<em>holding</em> that the ``Live Poultry

 amounted to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power by
 Congress)) and the <em>Causby</em> Case (United States v. Causby, 328
 U.S. 256 (1946)) (<em>holding</em> that it was a taking of property for
 which compensation was required under the Fifth Amendment when the
 government flew its bombers so low over the Causby's dwelling and
 chicken farm that as many as six to ten of their chickens died in one
 day of fright)) should probably be placed in the category of courses
 that are about many different things.  It seems that ``the Chicken''
 is just a placeholder for all the innumerable legal problems that may
 arise involving chickens.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN2"></a><a href="#F2">2</a></b>  <em>Nota bene</em> that this is
 <em>not</em> a sexist usage; I am the instructor and I am masculine.

<p> One of the most useful lessons to be learned from studying computers
 is the necessity of precision, for computers always do what you tell
 them to do (or, if your instructions are ambiguous, crash), even if
 what you said is not what you meant.  In my experience, the skills of
 a legal draftsman and those of a computer programmer are identical;
 studying one leads to mastery of the other.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN3"></a><a href="#F3">3</a></b>  Sentient beings,
 intentional beings, human beings, or whatever.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN4"></a><a href="#F4">4</a></b>  The words ``computer'' and ``computing''
 have an unfortunate connotation when applied to machines, since
 computation is an act that can be performed only by intelligences,
 and---for all practical purposes in so far as we know---only by human
 intelligences.  In fact a ``computer'' was originally, as the Second
 Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary puts it: ``One who computes;
 a calculator, reckoner; spec. a person employed to make calculations
 in an observatory, in surveying, etc.''.  (I happen to know this from
 personal experience, not from just reading the dictionary, since the
 teacher under whom I studied plain geometry in high school spent his
 summers working as a computer for an oil company, and I myself, one
 summer when I was working as a gravity observer on an oil exploration
 crew up in the North West Territories, was drafted into spending a
 few evenings working as the computer's assistant.)  It is rather as
 if we were to call a typewriter simply a ``writer'' and then assume
 that it---rather than a human author---actually does the writing.

<p> To make matters worse, the type of machine that we call a
 ``computer'' is used for much more than merely computing, it is also
 used for word processing and data processing and language
 translation and any other process that involves the manipulation of
 symbols---or, rather, of signs.  

<p> The French, I think, made a better choice when they elected to call
 computers <em>ordinateurs</em>.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN5"></a><a href="#F5">5</a></b>  And as my computer writes this I realize that I should
 change the course name to ``Computing and the Law'', a change that I
 hope can be implemented before it is offered again next Fall.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN6"></a><a href="#F6">6</a></b>  Though it hardly helps that at the level of ultimate
 reality there is no difference between the dancer and the dance, or,
 rather, that there is no dancer and no dance, but only the dancing
 itself, just as it is.

<p> Or at least that is what the Buddha---so I have heard---teaches.

<p> In the course in Computers and the Law I am not trying to proclaim
 the <em>Buddha Dharma</em>, but rather only to teach the plain old
 everyday sort of law---<em>i.e.</em>, <em>dharma</em>---that is the usual
 subject of law courses in law schools in the United States. (I am not
 even trying to teach about computers except to the extent that that
 is necesary to understand the legal problems that arise from the
 computing process; I am neither a computer scientist nor a Buddhist
 priest).
 
 I do not believe that in the United States the solution, or even the
 posing, of legal problems should---or constitutionally can---turn on
 the teachings about the nature of reality that are proclaimed by any
 particular religion.  

<p> And that is perhaps the greatest difficulty with teaching about
 computers and the law.  How can one distinguish between the dancer
 and the dance, or the words and the song, without sinking into the
 slough of religion and metaphysics?

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN7"></a><a href="#F7">7</a></b>  It
 should be noted, however, that the Office of Defense Trade Controls
 in the United States Department of State confused---or tried to
 confuse---computers with their functioning when it adopted that
 portion of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations that treats
 software---which it insists is ``functionality''---as something like
 a computer that can actually be exported. <em>See</em> <em>infra</em>
 Section <a href="#s5">5</a>.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN8"></a><a href="#F8">8</a></b>  The
 first definition of ``software'' given by the OED 2d is: ``The
 programs and procedures required to enable a computer to perform a
 specific task, as opposed to the physical components of the system''.
 
 This sounds harmless enough, but the OED also quotes the following
 example of the term's use, a passage that suggests, correctly, that
 its use is often infelicitous: ``<b>1965</b> Hollingdale & Tootill
 <em>Electronic Computers</em> 192 The cost of developing and making the
 computer itself (the hardware) is matched by the cost of making
 programming schemes for it (often, regrettably, termed software).''

<p> The term ``software'' is misleading to the extent that it suggests
 that software is---computer programs are---the same sort of ``ware''
 as the hardware, <em>i.e.</em>, the computer, upon which it runs.  To
 dispel this confusion it is perhaps enough to note that the term
 ``wetware'' is often used by cognitive scientists to refer to the
 (usually human) brain: it is unlikely that anyone could actually
 believe that computers and brains and computer programs are all the
 same sort of ``thing'', although many a cognitive scientist at least
 tries to believe that the wetware, the brain, is just a sort of
 complicated computer on which the programs that we call the mind are
 running.

<p> But this distinction between hardware and software just involves the
 distinction between physical objects, on the one hand, and processes,
 on the other.  If you want to give a cognitive scientist a hard time,
 just ask him where the programs of the brain are stored when they are
 not running---and then ask him what the programs are stored
 <em>as</em>.

<p> That is a good question: What are our thoughts stored as when we are
 not thinking them?  As a text?

<p> The OED 2d defines ``ware'' as: ``A collective term for: Articles of
 merchandise or manufacture; the things which a merchant, tradesman,
 or pedlar, has to sell; goods, commodities. '' And in this context
 the distinction, or lack thereof, between hardware and software takes
 on considerable legal significance: are computer programs goods that

<blockquote>
 As used in this Act ---
<blockquote>
 (3) the term ``good'' means any article, natural or manmade substance,

<p> (4) the term ``technology'' means the information and know-how (whether

<p> ``Technology'' is also defined in Part 772 of the Export
 Administration Regulations (``EAR'') as `` Specific information
 necessary for the `development', `production', or `use' of a
 product.''

<p> EAR Part 772 also defines ``software'' as ``A collection of one or
 more `programs' or `microprograms' fixed in any tangible medium of
 expression''.  Part 722 also defines ``Program'' as ``A sequence of
 instructions to carry out a process in, or convertible into, a form
 executable by an electronic computer'' and ``microprogam'' as ``A
 sequence of elementary instructions, maintained in a special storage,
 the execution of which is initiated by the introduction of its
 reference instruction into an instruction register''.

<p> The requirement in the EAR's definition that a ``program'' must be
 ``fixed in any tangible medium of expression'' is identical with the

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN33"></a><a href="#F33">33</a></b>  Thus the ITAR defines ``export'' as:

    Export means:
   (1) Sending or taking a defense article out of the United States in any
manner, except by mere travel outside of the United States by a person whose
personal knowledge includes technical data; or

<p>   (2) Transferring registration, control or ownership to a foreign person of

<p>   . . . .
</blockquote>
 22 CFR &#167; 120.17.

<p> ``Technical data'' is defined in the ITAR as:
<blockquote>
   Technical data means, for purposes of this subchapter:

<p>   (1) Information, other than software as defined in &#167; 120.10(d),
   which is required for the design development, production,
   manufacture, assembly, operation, repair, testing, maintenance or

 22 CFR &#167; 120.10.

<p> You may have noticed that despite the reference in &#167; 120.10(1) to &#167;
 120.10(d), there is no &#167; 120.10(d).  The government's lawyers argue,
 however, that this is a typographical error and that the reference is
 actually supposed to be to &#167; 120.10(4), so that &#167; 120(1) expressly
 excludes from the definition of technical data the software that is
 expressly included in that definition by &#167; 120(4).  (For the
 definition of software that is contained in &#167; 121.8f, see

 National Security Agency, who worked at the Office of Defense Trade
 Contros and whose job it was to answer questions about the
 application of the ITAR to cryptography, her only answer was:
 ``That's your government at work.''

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN45"></a><a href="#F45">45</a></b>  And consequently this
 discussion.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN46"></a><a href="#F46">46</a></b>  The term ``user'',
 often spelled ``luser'' and pronounced ``loser'', is rather a term of
 contempt when used by someone who actually knows something about
 computers.

<p> There is some merit to this position, even if it is rather unkind.
 For the user is often a loser when he struggles to make his computer
 do something that it is supposed to do, and ends up buying an
 expensive ``upgrade'' that does not work either.

<p> One question that comes up in a course in computers and the law that
 perhaps does not directly involve the distinction between text and
 process is, why there is so little litigation about defective
 software, when most computer programs---especially those sold as
 commodities---really don't work very well.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN47"></a><a href="#F47">47</a></b>  It would be most
 helpful, but I fear quite unprecedented, if computer centers at
 colleges and universities---instead of offering the latest network
 hardware and a few courses in the trivia of word processing or how to
 cruise the internet---would actually make available to students and
 faculty the sort introduction to computers and computing that I got
 as a practicing lawyer in the mid-sixties when some of us---who felt
 that we ought to know something about those new gadgets that so many
 of our clients were installing---snuck into the IBM Executive
 Computer Concepts Course.

<p> That course was for comptrollers and financial vice-presidents of
 large corporations who were thinking about acquiring their company's
 first real computer.  Besides the never stated goal of selling some
 computers, the major effort of the course was directed toward giving
 us---all those high-powered corporate types and one rather junior
 lawyer---enough of an understanding of how computers work to keep us
 from being hornswaggled by the programmers and engineers who would
 actually run our new machines.  It was, I think, the roughtest course
 I ever took, even if everyone was guaranteed to graduate in the top
 ten percent of the class.  It was also one of the most effective.

<p> We were first introduced to a simulated model of a 1950's
 computer---back in the days before any programming language had been
 invented---and a card punching machine.  (Do you remember those old
 ``Don't Bend Fold or Mutilate'' punched cards?)  Our first assignment
 was to punch a pack of cards containing the instructions---written in
 so-called ``machine language'' as a binary number, that is, as a
 string of one's and zero's---that would cause the computer to
 calculate the then present value of the thirty-eight dollars that
 were paid for Manhattan back in the seventeenth century.  The
 calculation seemed to work all right when the interest rate was set
 at two or three percent---although, since the answer was printed out
 as a rather large binary number, none of us really could be sure.
 But when we tried to get the computer to calculate the present value
 with an interest rate of six percent, the answer we got was just
 plain wrong.  At six percent the number we were calculating grew too
 large to be held in the computer's accumulator, so the computer just
 threw away the high digits.

<p> At that point the financial types looked rather uncomfortable and I
 had visions of all sorts of interesting law suits dancing in my
 head.  And all of us knew then far more about the things that
 computers do than do most of the users of today.

<p> And the next day they invented assembly language.

<p> Now that, I think, is the sort of course that every college student
 should be required---or at least have the opportunity---to take.  I
 fear, however, that such a course will never be offered by academic
 computer centers.  I mean, if they offered such a course, they might
 not be able to hornswaggle us so easily.

 number is 00001010; the algorithm in <em>Benson</em> specified a series
 of steps by which a computer when given the first pattern as input
 would produce the second pattern as output.

<p> It is worth looking again at the pattern 00010000.  If we interpret
 it as a binary coded decimal number then its value is, as I just
 said, ten, but if we interpret it as a binary coded number then its
 value is sixteen.  The computer may rearrange the patterns, but it is
 we who interpret them.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN57"></a><a href="#F57">57</a></b>  And those instructions also take the form

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN58"></a><a href="#F58">58</a></b>  I might also add in my defense that the

 ten digits 0 through 9; hexidecimal numbers, on the other hand,
 include the sixteen digits, 0 through 9 and then A through F.
 Thus fifteen is written as ``15'' in decimal notation and as ``F''
 in hexidecimal notation, while sixteen is written as ``16'' and
 ``10'' respectively.  Hexidecimal numbers are used by computer
 programmers in preference to decimal numbers because the hexidecimal
 numbers from zero to fifteen can be represented exactly by four
 binary digits.  There thus is no need to have a program, like the one
 in <em>Benson</em>, to convert a hexidecimal coded representation of a
 number into a binary coded representation.

<p> The Jargon File is a dictionary of computer jargon that was
 originally maintained at MIT.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN72"></a><a href="#F72">72</a></b>  The second footnote defines
 ``program'' as that term is likely to be viewed as a philosopher.

<p> The use of TWI.COM program described <em>supra</em> in Section
 <a href="#s2.2.2">2.2.2</a> is, I suppose, an example of experimental epistemology.
 In this article I have, however, tried to avoid the use of
 philosophical terminology.  You may have noticed, for example, that I
 have not once, until now, referred to the distinction between a sign
 and a signifier or used the word ``semiotic''.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN73"></a><a href="#F73">73</a></b>  The reason that most software that is sold
 as a commodity works so badly is that it typically is not sold with
 humanly readable source code, and the support personnel at the
 vendor's hot-line typically do not have access to the source
 either---and probably could not understand it even if it were
 available.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN74"></a><a href="#F74">74</a></b>  <em>See</em> <em>supra</em>
 Note <a href="#FN46">46</a>.

<p> I do not want to be a loser, under the malicious control---at least
 it usually feels like its malicious---of some software publisher or
 system administrator.  That is one of the reason why on my computers
 I run an operating system called Linux, which comes with all its
 source code, and application programs like the GNU EMACS editor and
 the LaTeX typesetting program that also come with source code.
 (The other reasons are that these programs are free, are more
 powerful, and are much better supported than are their commercial
 counterparts.)

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN75"></a><a href="#F75">75</a></b>  <em>See</em> <em>supra</em>
 Note <a href="#FN2">2</a>.

<p> The only difference is that in practice, programmers have to be much
 more precise than legal draftsmen.  Common sense, and sometimes a
 judge, may prevent a poorly drafted contract---or governmental
 regulation like the ITAR---from causing havoc.  But computers do not
 have common sense and notoriously do what one tells them to do, not
 what one intends them to do.

<p> There are many computer programs that check other computer programs
 for ambiguities, bad syntax, and inconsistencies.  It would be a
 worthwhile project to see if these programs could be modified to
 critique drafts of legal instruments.

 believe that the First Amendment only protects political speech.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN77"></a><a href="#F77">77</a></b>  Before Computers.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN78"></a><a href="#F78">78</a></b>  An early IBM computer was affectionately known by the
 acronym CADET, which stood for ``Can't Add, Doesn't Even Try''.  The
 CADET computer could not perform any arithmetical calculations, it
 just looked the answers up in a table that was stored on its drum,
 which was an early storage device shaped like a drum rather than a
 disk.

<blockquote>
 [t]he name of a programming language designed by Dennis Ritchie
 during the early 1970s and immediately used to reimplement Unix; so
 called because many features derived from an earlier compiler named
 `B' in commemoration of <em>its</em> parent, BCPL. . . .

<p> C is often described, with a mixture of fondness and disdain varying
 according to the speaker, as ``a language that combines all the

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN86"></a><a href="#F86">86</a></b>  Though it may be difficult for
 technophobes---a class that I fear includes many lawyers and most law
 teachers---to comprehend, computer programmers are human beings too.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN87"></a><a href="#F87">87</a></b>  Quite often programs that are written in C
 code are not actually intended to be actually compiled and run on a
 computer; they are just written as a convenient way to present
 algorithms and to transmit information to other programmers.  As I
 understand it, this was actually the case with respect to the
 cryptographic source code of the programs at issue in <em>Karn</em> and
 <em>Bernstein</em>.  And sometimes programs are written in C not to be
 compiled and run, but to demonstrate the author's skill at using that
 language.  My course materials include a one-time pad encryption
 program in two lines of C written by Paul C. Leyland of Oxford
 University Computing Services that falls in this category; its art
 lies in its brevity, but it is not what I would call user
 friendly. (But then, exactly the same can be said of my little
 one-time pad program.)

<p> Most large programs have many authors, each of whom must be able to
 read the code written by the others, and those who have the
 responsibility for debuging and updating the programs normally do so
 by reading and patching the source code and then recompiling it.
 Many programs written in C are distributed only in source code form
 and have to be adapted to the needs of particular machines and then
 compiled into machine code before they will actually run.  <em>See</em>
 <em>supra</em> text accompanying Notes <a href="#FN71">71</a>-<a href="#FN74">74</a>.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN89"></a><a href="#F89">89</a></b>  At
 this point you should give thanks that I am not indulging in any
 philosophical speculations. <em>See</em> <em>supra</em> Note <a href="#FN72">72</a>.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN90"></a><a href="#F90">90</a></b>  714 F.2d 1240, 1249 (3d Cir. 1983),
 <em>cert. dismissed</em>, 464 U.S. 1033 (1984).

 see <em>infra</em> Section <a href="#s3">3</a>.

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN92"></a><a href="#F92">92</a></b>  A company named RCA Data Seccurity, which holds patents
 that supposedly cover several encryption algorithms, also published
 two encryption programs---RC2 and RC4---that were supposedly trade
 secrets.  Yet someone, no one knows quite who, was able to decompile
 the machine code for RC4 and reverse engineer the program and produce
 an implementation of that program in C, which was then posted
 anonymously to an e-mail list on the Internet.  And a year later
 someone did the same wtih RC2.  There was a lot of fussing and
 gnashing of teeth, but neither of these incidents produced any
 litigation.

<p> (I cannot, of course, tell you how to get those ``reverse
 engineered'' programs because of the requirements of the ITAR, even
 though the programs are publically available on the internet.)

<hr><p><b><a name ="FN93"></a><a href="#F93">93</a></b>  <em>See</em> <em>supra</em> Note <a href="#FN74">74</a>.

<p> The definition of source code would, of course, have to include not
 only code written in C, but also code written in interpreted
 languages like Perl that are run directly on the computer without
 being first converted into a separate program in object
 code.

<p> The only selfish reason that I have to object to the exclusion of
 machine code from the protection of the First Amendment, since I
 could distribute my programs---and the other programs that I want to
 make available, like the Pretty Good Privacy encryption program---in
 the form of source code, is that few of my students, or other
 prospective readers, will have the necessary assemblers, compilers,
 and interpreters to convert the source code into functional object
 code.  The slaves of the machine---and of Microsoft or Apple---seldom
 can afford those fundamental tools.

<p> And I suppose that I could be forbidden to distribute the hard copy
 version of my little cryptographic program in the form of hexidecimal
 machine code that can be loaded into the computer using DEBUG.

<h1>                TITLE 22.  FOREIGN RELATIONS AND INTERCOURSE   </h1>
<h2>                      CHAPTER 39.  ARMS EXPORT CONTROL   </h2>
<h3>                            MILITARY EXPORT CONTROLS</h3>

<h4>                             22 USCS &#167; 2778 (1994)</h4>

<P> &#167; 2778.  Control of arms exports and imports

<P>
    (a) Presidential control of exports and imports of defense
articles and services, guidance of policy, etc.; designation of United
States Munitions List; issuance of export licenses; condition for
export; negotiations information.

<P>
   (1) In furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign
policy of the United States, the President is authorized to control
the import and the export of defense articles and defense services and
to provide foreign policy guidance to persons of the United States
involved in the export and import of such articles and services. The
President is authorized to designate those items which shall be
considered as defense articles and defense services for the purposes
of this section and to promulgate regulations for the import and
export of such articles and services. The items so designated shall
constitute the United States Munitions List.

<P>
   (2) Decisions on issuing export licenses under this section shall
be made in coordination with the Director of the United States Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, taking into account the Director's
assessment as to whether the export of an article would contribute to
an arms race, aid in the development of weapons of mass destruction,
support international terrorism, increase the possibility of outbreak
or escalation of conflict, or prejudice the development of bilateral
or multilateral arms control or nonproliferation agreements or other
arrangements. The Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
is authorized, whenever the Director determines that the issuance of
an export license under this section would be detrimental to the
national security of the United States, to recommend to the President
that such export license be disapproved.

<P>
   (3) In exercising the authorities conferred by this section, the
President may require that any defense article or defense service be
sold under this Act as a condition of its eligibility for export, and
may require that persons engaged in the negotiation for the export of
defense articles and services keep the President fully and currently
informed of the progress and future prospects of such negotiations.

<P>
   (b) Registration and licensing requirements for manufacturers,
exporters, or importers of designated defense articles and defense
services; exceptions.

<P>
   (1) (A) As prescribed in regulations issued under this section,
every person (other than an officer or employee of the United States
Government acting in an official capacity) who engages in the business
of manufacturing, exporting, or importing any defense articles or
defense services designated by the President
under subsection (a)(1) shall register with the United States
Government agency charged with the administration of this section, and
shall pay a registration fee which shall be prescribed by such
regulations. Such regulations shall prohibit the return to the United
States for sale in the United States (other than for the Armed Forces
of the United States and its allies or for any State or local law
enforcement agency) of any military firearms or ammunition of United
States manufacture furnished to foreign governments by the United
States under this Act or any other foreign assistance or sales program
of the United States, whether or not enhanced in value or improved in
condition in a foreign country. This prohibition shall not extend to
similar firearms that have been so substantially transformed as to
become, in effect, articles of foreign manufacture.

<P>
   (B) The prohibition under such regulations required by the second
sentence of subparagraph (A) shall not extend to any military firearms
(or ammunition, components, parts, accessories, and attachments for
such firearms) of United States manufacture furnished to any foreign
government by the United States under this Act or any other foreign
assistance or sales program of the United States if--

<P>
   (i) such firearms are among those firearms that the Secretary of
the Treasury is, or was at any time, required to authorize the
importation of by reason of the provisions of section 925(e) of title
18, United States Code (including the requirement for the listing of
such firearms as curios or relics under section 921(a)(13) of that
title); and

<P>
   (ii) such foreign government certifies to the United States
Government that such firearms are owned by such foreign government.

<P>
   [(C)] (B) A copy of each registration made under this paragraph
shall be transmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury for review
regarding law enforcement concerns. The Secretary shall report to the
President regarding such concerns as necessary.

<P>
   (2) Except as otherwise specifically provided in regulations issued
under subsection (a)(1), no defense articles or defense services
designated by the President under subsection (a)(1) may be exported or
imported without a license for such export or import, issued in
accordance with this Act and regulations issued under this Act, except
that no license shall be required for exports or imports made by or
for an agency of the United States Government (A) for official use by
a department or agency of the United States Government, or (B) for
carrying out any foreign assistance or sales program authorized by law
and subject to the control of the President by other means.

<P>
   (3) (A) For each of the fiscal years 1988 and 1989, $ 250,000 of
registration fees collected pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be
credited to a Department of State account, to be available without
fiscal year limitation.  Fees credited to that account shall be
available only for the payment of expenses incurred for--

<P>
   (i) contract personnel to assist in the evaluation of munitions
control license applications, reduce processing time for license
applications, and improve monitoring of compliance with the terms of
licenses; and

<P>
   (ii) the automation of munitions control functions and the
processing of munitions control license applications, including the
development, procurement, and utilization of computer equipment and
related software.

<P>
   (B) The authority of this paragraph may be exercised only to such
extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation
Acts.

<P>
   (c) Criminal violations; punishment.  Any person who willfully
violates any provision of this section or section 39 [22 USCS &#167;
2779], or any rule or regulation issued under either section, or who
willfully, in a registration or license application or required
report, makes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, shall upon conviction be
fined for each violation not more than $ 1,000,000 or imprisoned not
more than ten years, or both.

<P>
   (d) [Repealed]

<P>
   (e) Enforcement powers of President.  In carrying out functions
under this section with respect to the export of defense articles and
defense services, the President is authorized to exercise the same
powers concerning violations and enforcement which are conferred upon
departments, agencies and officials by subsections (c), (d), (e), and
(g) of section 11 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 [50 USCS
Appx &#167; 2410(c), (d), (e) and (g)], and by subsections (a) and (c)
of section 12 of such Act [50 USCS Appx &#167; 2411(a) and (c)],
subject to the same terms and conditions as are applicable to such
powers under such Act.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed
as authorizing the withholding of information from the Congress.
Notwithstanding section 11(c) of the Export Administration Act of 1979
[50 USCS Appx &#167; 2410(c)], the civil penalty for each violation
involving controls imposed on the export of defense articles and
defense services under this section may not exceed $ 500,000.

<P>
   (f) Periodic review of items on the munitions list.  The President
shall periodically review the items on the United States Munitions
List to determine what items, if any, no longer warrant export
controls under this section. The results of such reviews shall be
reported to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and to the
Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Banking, Housing,
and Urban Affairs of the Senate. Such a report shall be submitted at
least 30 days before any item is removed from the Munitions List and
shall describe the nature of any controls to be imposed on that item
under the Export Administration Act of 1979.

<P>
   (g) Identification of persons convicted or subject to indictment
for violations of certain provisions.

<P>
   (1) The President shall develop appropriate mechanisms to identify,
in connection with the export licensing process under this section--

<P>
   (A) persons who are the subject of an indictment for, or have been
convicted of, a violation under--

<P>
   (i) this section,

<P>
   (ii) section 11 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C.
App.  2410),

<P>
   (iii) section 793, 794, or 798 of title 18, United States Code
(relating to espionage involving defense or classified information),

<P>
   (iv) section 16 of the Trading with the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App.
16),

<P>
   (v) section 206 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
(relating to foreign assets controls; 50 U.S.C. App. 1705),

<P>
   (vi) section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C.
78dd-1) or section 104 of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (15 U.S.C.
78dd-2),

<P>
   (vii) chapter 105 of title 18, United States Code [18 USCS
&#167;&#167; 2151 et seq.]  (relating to sabotage),

<P>
   (viii) section 4(b) of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (relating
to communication of classified information; 50 U.S.C. 783(b)),

<P>
   (ix) section 57, 92, 101, 104, 222, 224, 225, or 226 of the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2077, 2122, 2131, 2134, 2272, 2274,
2275, and 2276),

<P>
   (x) section 601 of the National Security Act of 1947 (relating to
intelligence identities protection; 50 U.S.C. 421), or

<P>
   (xi) section 603(b) or (c) of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act
of 1986 (22 U.S.C. 5113 (b) and (c));

<P>
   (B) persons who are the subject of an indictment or have been
convicted under section 371 of title 18, United States Code, for
conspiracy to violate any of the statutes cited in subparagraph (A);
and

<P>
   (C) persons who are ineligible--

<P>
   (i) to contract with,

<P>
   (ii) to receive a license or other form of authorization to export
from, or

<P>
   (iii) to receive a license or other form of authorization to import
defense articles or defense services from, any agency of the United
States Government.

<P>
   (2) The President shall require that each applicant for a license
to export an item on the United States Munitions List identify in the
application all consignees and freight forwarders involved in the
proposed export.

<P>
   (3) If the President determines--

<P>
   (A) that an applicant for a license to export under this section is
the subject of an indictment for a violation of any of the statutes
cited in paragraph (1),

<P>
   (B) that there is reasonable cause to believe that an applicant for
a license to export under this section has violated any of the
statutes cited in paragraph (1), or

<P>
   (C) that an applicant for a license to export under this section is
ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other form of
authorization to import defense articles or defense services from, any
agency of the United States Government,

<P>
   the President may disapprove the application. The President shall
consider requests by the Secretary of the Treasury to disapprove any
export license application based on these criteria.

<P>
   (4) A license to export an item on the United States Munitions List
may not be issued to a person--

<P>
   (A) if that person, or any party to the export, has been convicted
of violating a statute cited in paragraph (1), or

<P>
   (B) if that person, or any party to the export, is at the time of
the license review ineligible to receive export licenses (or other
forms of authorization to export) from any agency of the United States
Government,

<P>
   except as may be determined on a case-by-case basis by the
President, after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury,
after a thorough review of the circumstances surrounding the
conviction or ineligibility to export and a finding by the President
that appropriate steps have been taken to mitigate any law enforcement
concerns.

<P>
   (5) A license to export an item on the United States Munitions List
may not be issued to a foreign person (other than a foreign
government).

<P>
   (6) The President may require a license (or other form of
authorization) before any item on the United States Munitions List is
sold or otherwise transferred to the control or possession of a
foreign person or a person acting on behalf of a foreign person.

<P>
   (7) The President shall, in coordination with law enforcement and
national security agencies, develop standards for identifying
high-risk exports for regular end-use verification. These standards
shall be published in the Federal Register and the initial standards
shall be published not later than October 1, 1988.

<P>
   (8) Upon request of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of
Defense and the Secretary of the Treasury shall detail to the office
primarily responsible for export licensing functions under this
section, on a nonreimbursable basis, personnel with appropriate
expertise to assist in the initial screening of applications for
export licenses under this section in order to determine the need for
further review of those applications for foreign policy, national
security, and law enforcement concerns.

<P>

          Amendments to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations
                                    Part II
                                  58 FR 39280
DATE: Thursday, July 22, 1993

ACTION: Final rule. 

SUMMARY: This rule amends the regulations implementing section 38 of
the Arms Export Control Act, which governs the import and export of
defense articles and services. The rule clarifies existing regulations
and reduces the regulatory burden on exporters of defense articles and
services.  Although this is a final rule public comment is welcome and
will be taken into account to the extent possible.

EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective July 22, 1993.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Information regarding this notice may
be obtained from James Andrew Lewis, U.S. Department of State, Bureau
of Politico- Military Affairs (202-647-4231), Mal Zerden or Allan
Suchinsky, U.S. Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls
(703-875-6644).
   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The regulations implementing section 38
of the Arms Export Control Act were last revised substantially in
November 1984. A proposed rule was published on May 7, 1992 (57 FR
19666), for public comment.  This Final Rule clarifies and simplifies
the current regulations. Certain sections are consolidated while
others are revised in the interests of clarity and consistency. To the
extent possible, related sections are cross-referenced.  In amending
the regulations, public comments and suggestions from industry and
other U.S. agencies have been considered and in many cases
incorporated into the regulations.
   The most significant changes are an increase in the validity period
of a license from three to four years and a revision of the policy
used by the Department for designating defense articles that takes
into account civil application and functional equivalence. Several new
exemptions from licensing requirements are also established. These
exemptions will cover exports under approved manufacturing or
technical assistance agreements; spare parts valued at $ 500 or less;
intra-company transfers of components being sent abroad for assembly;
temporary imports for repair and servicing; and items which were
previously licensed for temporary export to trade shows.
   Other changes include a clarification of the commodity jurisdiction
process, which establishes a review period and specifies the appeal
process. The definition of public domain is expanded and clarified. An
exception allows for the re-export of certain U.S.-origin components
to the Governments of NATO countries, and the Governments of Japan and
Australia without prior U.S.  approval for components which are not
significant military equipment or controlled for purposes of the
Missile Technology Control Regime and do not require Congressional
notification.
  Specific Changes
   The Office of Munitions Control was renamed the Office of Defense
Trade Controls on January 8, 1990. All references to the Office of
Munitions Control are now referred to as the Office of Defense Trade
Controls. For clarification, all references to the Assistant Secretary
for Politico-Military Affairs are replaced by Assistant Secretary of
State for Politico-Military Affairs. Due to a change in office
designation, all references to the Under Secretary of State for
Security Assistance, Science and Technology are replaced by Under
Secretary of State for International Security Affairs.

consolidation and addition of sections in the regulations. Sections in
which there are substantive changes are noted below. These section
designations refer to the new section numbers.

burden on exporters in that respect. The relevant information
collection is to be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget
under control no. 1405-0013.

Comp. p. 79; 22 U.S.C. 2658.
  &#167; 120.1 -- General authorities and eligibility.
   (a) Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778)
authorizes the President to control the export and import of defense
articles and defense services. The statutory authority of the
President to promulgate regulations with respect to exports of defense
articles and defense services was delegated to the Secretary of State
by Executive Order 11958, as amended (42 FR 4311).  This subchapter
implements that authority. By virtue of delegations of authority by
the Secretary of State, these regulations are primarily administered
by the Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of
Politico-Military Affairs, Department of State.
   (b) Authorized Officials. All authorities conferred upon the
Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls by this subchapter
may be exercised at any time by the Under Secretary of State for
International Security Affairs, the Assistant Secretary of State for
Politico-Military Affairs, or the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
for Politico-Military Affairs responsible for supervising the Office
of Defense Trade Controls unless the Legal Adviser or the Assistant
Legal Adviser for Politico-Military Affairs of the Department of State
determines that any specific exercise of this authority under this
subsection may be inappropriate.
   (c) Eligibility. Only U.S. persons (as defined in &#167; 120.15)
and foreign governmental entities in the United States may be granted
licenses or other approvals (other than retransfer approvals sought
pursuant to this subchapter).  Foreign persons (as defined in &#167;
120.16) other than governments are not eligible. U.S. persons who have
been convicted of violating the criminal statutes enumerated in &#167;
120.27, who have been debarred pursuant to part 127 or 128 of this
subchapter, who are the subject of an indictment involving the
criminal statutes enumerated in &#167; 120.27, who are ineligible to
contract with, or to receive a license or other form of authorization
to import defense articles or defense services from any agency of the
U.S. Government, who are ineligible to receive export licenses (or
other forms of authorization to export) from any agency of the
U.S. Government, who are subject to Department of State
Suspension/Revocation under &#167; 126.7 (a)(1)-(a)(7) of this
subchapter, or who are ineligible under &#167; 127.6(c) of this
subchapter are generally ineligible.  Applications for licenses or
other approvals will be considered only if the applicant has
registered with the Office of Defense Trade Controls pursuant to part
122 of this subchapter. All applications and requests for approval
must be signed by a U.S. person who has been empowered by the
registrant to sign such documents.
   (d) The exemptions provided in this subchapter do not apply to
transactions in which the exporter or any party to the export (as
defined in &#167; 126.7(e) of this subchapter) is generally ineligible
as set forth above in paragraph (c) of this section, unless an
exception has been granted pursuant to &#167; 126.7(c) of this
subchapter.
  &#167; 120.2 -- Designation of defense articles and defense
services.
   The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778(a) and 2794(7))
provides that the President shall designate the articles and services
deemed to be defense articles and defense services for purposes of
this subchapter. The items so designated constitute the United States
Munitions List and are specified in part 121 of this subchapter. Such
designations are made by the Department of State with the concurrence
of the Department of Defense. For a determination on whether a
particular item is included on the U.S. Munitions List see &#167;
120.4(a).
  &#167; 120.3 -- Policy on designating and determining defense
articles and services.
   An article or service may be designated or determined in the future
to be a defense article (see &#167; 120.6) or defense service (see
&#167; 120.9) if it:
   (a) Is specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted, or
modified for a military application, and
   (i) Does not have predominant civil applications, and
   (ii) Does not have performance equivalent (defined by form, fit and
function) to those of an article or service used for civil
applications; or a military application, and has significant military
or intelligence applicability such that control under this subchapter
is necessary.
   The intended use of the article or service after its export (i.e.,
for a military or civilian purpose) is not relevant in determining
whether the article or service is subject to the controls of this
subchapter. Any item covered by the U.S. Munitions List must [*39284]
be within the categories of the U.S.  Munitions List. The scope of the
U.S. Munitions List shall be changed only by amendments made pursuant
to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C.  2778).
  &#167; 120.4 -- Commodity jurisdiction.
   (a) The commodity jurisdiction procedure is used with the
U.S. Government if doubt exists as to whether an article or service is
covered by the U.S.  Munitions List. It may also be used for
consideration of a redesignation of an article or service currently
covered by the U.S. Munitions List. The Department must submit a
report to Congress at least 30 days before any item is removed from
the U.S. Munitions List. Upon written request, the Office of Defense
Trade Controls shall provide a determination of whether a particular
article or service is covered by the U.S. Munitions List. The
determination, consistent with &#167;&#167; 120.2, 120.3, and 120.4,
entails consultation among the Departments of State, Defense, Commerce
and other U.S. Government agencies and industry in appropriate cases.
   (b) Registration with the Office of Defense Trade Controls as
defined in part 122 of this subchapter is not required prior to
submission of a commodity jurisdiction request. If it is determined
that the commodity is a defense article or service covered by the
U.S. Munitions List, registration is required for exporters,
manufacturers, and furnishers of defense articles and defense services
(see part 122 of this subchapter).

U.S.C. 2752, 2778); E.O. 11958, 42 FR 4311, 1977 Comp. p. 79; 22
U.S.C. 2658.
  &#167; 122.1 -- Registration requirements.
   (a) Any person who engages in the United States in the business of
either manufacturing or exporting defense articles or furnishing
defense services is required to register with the Office of Defense
Trade Controls. Manufacturers who do not engage in exporting must
nevertheless register.
   (b) Exemptions. Registration is not required for:
   (1) Officers and employees of the United States Government acting
in an official capacity.
   (2) Persons whose pertinent business activity is confined to the
production of unclassified technical data only.
   (3) Persons all of whose manufacturing and export activities are
licensed under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
   (4) Persons who engage only in the fabrication of articles for
experimental or scientific purpose, including research and
development.
   (c) Purpose. Registration is primarily a means to provide the
U.S. Government with necessary information on who is involved in
certain manufacturing and exporting activities. Registration does not
confer any export rights or privileges. It is generally a precondition
to the issuance of any license or other approval under this
subchapter.
  &#167; 122.2 -- Submission of registration statement.
   (a) General. The Department of State Form DSP-9 (Registration
Statement) and the transmittal letter required by paragraph (b) of
this section must be submitted by an intended registrant with a
payment by check or money order payable to the Department of State of
one of the fees prescribed in &#167; 122.3(a) of this subchapter. The
Registration Statement and transmittal letter must be signed by a
senior officer who has been empowered by the intended registrant to
sign such documents. The intended registrant shall also submit
documentation that demonstrates that it is incorporated or otherwise
authorized to do business in the United States. The Office of Defense
Trade Controls will return to the sender any Registration Statement
that is incomplete, or that is not accompanied by the required letter
or payment of the proper registration fee.
   (b) Transmittal letter. A letter of transmittal, signed by an
authorized senior officer of the intended registrant, shall accompany
each Registration Statement.
   (1) The letter shall state whether the intended registrant, chief
executive officer, president, vice-presidents, other senior officers
or officials (e.g.  comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) or any
member of the board of directors:
   (i) Has ever been indicted for or convicted of violating any of the
U.S.  criminal statutes enumerated in &#167; 120.27 of this
subchapter; or
   (ii) Is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or
other approval to import defense articles or defense services from, or
to receive an export license or other approval from, any agency of the
U.S. Government.
   (2) The letter shall also declare whether the intended registrant
is owned or controlled by foreign persons (as defined in &#167; 120.16
of this subchapter). If the intended registrant is owned or controlled
by foreign persons, the letter shall also state whether the intended
registrant is incorporated or otherwise authorized to engage in
business in the United States.
   (c) Definition. For purposes of this section, ownership means that
more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting securities of the firm
are owned by one or more foreign persons. Control means that one or
more foreign persons have the authority or ability to establish or
direct the general policies or day-to-day operations of the
firm. Control is presumed to exist where foreign persons own 25
percent or more of the outstanding voting securities if no
U.S. persons control an equal or larger percentage. The standards for
control specified in 22 CFR 60.2(c) also provide guidance in
determining whether control in fact exists.
  &#167; 122.3 -- Registration fees.
   (a) A person who is required to register may do so for a period up
to 5 years upon submission of a completed form DSP-9, transmittal
letter, and payment of a fee as follows:
  1 year -- $ 250
  2 years -- 500
  3 years -- 700
  4 years -- 850
  5 years -- 1,000
   (b) Lapse in registration. A registrant who fails to renew a
registration and, after an intervening period, seeks to register again
must pay registration fees for any part of such intervening period
during which the registrant engaged in the business of manufacturing
or exporting defense articles or defense services.
   (c) Refund of fee. Fees paid in advance for future years of a
multiple year registration will be refunded upon request if the
registrant ceases to engage in the manufacture or export of defense
articles and defense services. A request for a refund must be
submitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls prior to the
beginning of any year for which a refund is claimed.
  &#167; 122.4 -- Notification of changes in information furnished by
registrants.
   (a) A registrant must, within five days of the event, notify the
Office of Defense Trade Controls by registered mail if:
   (1) Any of the persons referred to in &#167; 122.2(b) are indicted
for or convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes
enumerated in &#167; 120.27 of this subchapter, or become ineligible
to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to export
or temporarily import defense articles or defense services from any
agency of the U.S. government; or
   (2) There is a material change in the information contained in the
[*39299] Registration Statement, including a change in the senior
officers; the establishment, acquisition or divestment of a subsidiary
or foreign affiliate; a merger; a change of location; or the dealing
in an additional category of defense articles or defense services.
   (b) A registrant must notify the Office of Defense Trade Controls
by registered mail at least 60 days in advance of any intended sale or
transfer to a foreign person of ownership or control of the registrant
or any entity thereof. Such notice does not relieve the registrant
from obtaining the approval required under this subchapter for the
export of defense articles or defense services to a foreign person,
including the approval required prior to disclosing technical
data. Such notice provides the Office of Defense Trade Controls with
the information necessary to determine whether the authority of
section 38(g)(6) of the Arms Export Control Act regarding licenses or
other approvals for certain sales or transfers of articles or data
should be invoked (see &#167;&#167; 120.10 and 126.1(e) of this
subchapter).
   (c) The new entity formed when a registrant merges with another
company or acquires, or is acquired by, another company or a
subsidiary or division of another company shall advise the Office of
Defense Trade Controls of the following:
   (1) The new firm name and all previous firm names being disclosed;
   (2) The registration number that will survive and those that are to
be discontinued (if any);
   (3) The license numbers of all approvals on which unshipped
balances will be shipped under the surviving registration number,
since any license not the subject of notification will be considered
invalid; and
   (4) Amendments to agreements approved by the Office of Defense
Trade Controls to change the name of a party to those agreements. The
registrant must, within 60 days of this notification, provide to the
Office of Defense Trade Controls a signed copy of an amendment to each
agreement signed by the new U.S. entity, the former U.S. licensor and
the foreign licensee. Any agreements not so amended will be considered
invalid.
   (d) Prior approval by the Office of Defense Trade Controls is
required for any amendment making a substantive change.
  &#167; 122.5 -- Maintenance of records by registrants.
   (a) A person who is required to register must maintain records
concerning the manufacture, acquisition and disposition of defense
articles; the provision of defense services; and information on
political contributions, fees, or commissions furnished or obtained,
as required by part 130 of this subchapter.  All such records must be
maintained for a period of five years from the expiration of the
license or other approval. The Director, Office of Defense Trade
Controls, may prescribe a longer or shorter period in individual
cases.
   (b) Records maintained under this section shall be available at all
times for inspection and copying by the Director, Office of Defense
Trade Controls or a person designated by the Director (the Director of
the Diplomatic Security Service or a person designated by the Director
of the Diplomatic Security Service or another designee), or the
Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service or a person designated by the
Commissioner.

U.S.C. 2658.
  &#167; 123.1 -- Requirement for export or temporary import licenses.
   (a) Any person who intends to export or to import temporarily a
defense article must obtain the approval of the Office of Defense
Trade Controls prior to the export or temporary import, unless the
export or temporary import qualifies for an exemption under the
provisions of this subchapter. Applications for export or temporary
import must be made as follows:
   (1) Applications for licenses for permanent export must be made on
Form DSP-5 (unclassified);
   (2) Applications for licenses for temporary export must be made on
Form DSP- 73 (unclassified);
   (3) Applications for licenses for temporary import must be made on
Form DSP- 61 (unclassified); and
   (4) Applications for the export or temporary import of classified
defense articles or classified technical data must be made on Form
DSP-85.
   (b) Applications for Department of State export licenses must be
confined to proposed exports of defense articles including technical
data.
   (c) As a condition to the issuance of a license or other approval,
the Office of Defense Trade Controls may require all pertinent
documentary information regarding the proposed transaction and proper
completion of the application form as follows:
   (1) Form DSP-5, DSP-61, DSP-73, and DSP-85 applications must have
an entry in each block where space is provided for an entry. All
requested information must be provided.
   (2) Attachments and supporting technical data or brochures should
be submitted in seven collated copies. Two copies of any freight
forwarder lists must be submitted. If the request is limited to
renewal of a previous license or for the export of spare parts, only
two sets of any attachment (including freight forwarder lists) and one
copy of the previous license should be submitted.
   (3) A certification letter signed by an empowered official must
accompany all application submissions (see &#167; 126.13 of this
subchapter).
   (4) An application for a license under this part for the permanent
export of defense articles sold commercially must be accompanied by a
copy of a purchase order, letter of intent or other appropriate
documentation. In cases involving the U.S. Foreign Military Sales
program, three copies of the relevant Department of Defense Form
[*39300] 1513 are required, unless the procedures of &#167; 126.4(c)
or &#167; 126.6 of this subchapter are followed.
   (5) Form DSP-83, duly executed, must accompany all license
applications for the permanent export of significant military
equipment, including classified hardware or classified technical data
(see &#167;&#167; 123.10 and 125.3 of this subchapter).
   (6) A statement concerning the payment of political contributions,
fees and commissions must accompany a permanent export application if
the export involves defense articles or defense services valued in an
amount of $ 500,000 or more and is being sold commercially to or for
the use of the armed forces of a foreign country or international
organization (see part 130 of this subchapter).
   (d) Provisions for furnishing the type of defense services
described in &#167; 120.9(a) of this subchapter are contained in part
124 of this subchapter.  Provisions for the export or temporary import
of technical data and classified defense articles are contained in
part 125 of this subchapter.
   (e) A request for a license for the export of unclassified
technical data (DSP-5) related to a classified defense article should
specify any classified technical data or material that subsequently
will be required for export in the event of a sale.
  &#167; 123.2 -- Import jurisdiction.
   The Department of State regulates the temporary import of defense
articles.  Permanent imports of defense articles into the United
States are regulated by the Department of the Treasury (see 27 CFR
parts 47, 178 and 179).
  &#167; 123.3 -- Temporary import licenses.
   (a) A license (DSP-61) issued by the Office of Defense Trade
Controls is required for the temporary import and subsequent export of
unclassified defense articles, unless exempted from this requirement
pursuant to &#167; 123.4. This requirement applies to:
   (1) Temporary imports of unclassified defense articles that are to
be returned directly to the country from which they were shipped to
the United States;
   (2) Temporary imports of unclassified defense articles in transit
to a third country;
   (b) A bond may be required as appropriate (see part 125 of this
subchapter for license requirements for technical data and classified
defense articles.)
  &#167; 123.4 -- Temporary import license exemptions.
   (a) District Directors of Customs shall permit the temporary import
(and subsequent export) without a license, for a period of up to 4
years, of unclassified U.S.-origin defense articles (including any
article manufactured abroad pursuant to U.S. Government approval) if
the article temporarily imported:
   (1) Is serviced (e.g., inspection, testing, calibration or repair,
including overhaul, reconditioning and one-to-one replacement of any
defective articles, parts or components, but excluding any
modification, enhancement, upgrade or other form of alteration or
improvement that changes the basic performance of the article), and is
subsequently returned to the country from which it was
imported. Shipment may be made by the U.S. importer or a foreign
government representative of the country from which the goods were
imported; or
   (2) Is to be enhanced, upgraded or incorporated into another
article which has already been authorized by the Office of Defense
Trade Controls for permanent export; or
   (3) Is imported for the purpose of exhibition, demonstration or
marketing in the United States and is subsequently returned to the
country from which it was imported; or
   (4) Has been rejected for permanent import by the Department of the
Treasury and is being returned to the country from which it was
shipped; or
   (5) Is approved for such import under the U.S. Foreign Military
Sales (FMS) program pursuant to an executed U.S. Department of Defense
Letter of Offer and Acceptance (DD Form 1513).
   Note: These Exceptions do not apply to shipments that transit the
U.S. to or from Canada (see &#167; 123.19 and &#167; 126.5 of this
subchapter for exceptions).
   (b) District Directors of Customs shall permit the temporary import
(but not the subsequent export) without a license of unclassified
defense articles that are to be incorporated into another article, or
modified, enhanced, upgraded, altered, improved or serviced in any
other manner that changes the basic performance or productivity of the
article prior to being returned to the country from which they were
shipped or prior to being shipped to a third country. A DSP-5 is
required for the reexport of such unclassified defense articles after
incorporation into another article, modification, enhancement,
upgrading, alteration or improvement.
   (c) Requirements. To use an exemption under &#167; 123.4 (a) or
(b), the following criteria must be met:
   (1) The importer must meet the eligibility requirements set forth
in &#167; 120.1(b) of this subchapter;
   (2) At the time of export, the ultimate consignee named on the
Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) must be the same as the foreign
consignee or end-user of record named at the time of import; and
   (3) As stated in &#167; 126.1 of this subchapter, the temporary
import must not be from or on behalf of a proscribed country listed in
that section unless an exception has been granted in accordance with
&#167; 126.3 of this subchapter.
   (d) Procedures. To the satisfaction of the District Director of
Customs, the importer and exporter must comply with the following
procedures:
   (1) At the time of temporary import-
   (i) File and annotate the applicable U.S. Customs document (e.g.,
Form CF 3461, 7512, 7501, 7523 or 3311) to read: "This shipment is
being imported in accordance with and under the authority of 22 CFR
123.4(a) (identify subsection)," and
   (ii) Include, on the invoice or other appropriate documentation, a
complete list and description of the defense article(s) being
imported, including quantity and U.S. dollar value; and
   (2) At the time of export, file with the District Director of
Customs at the port of exit a Shipper's Export Declaration (Department
of Commerce Form 7525-V) and include on the SED or as an attachment
the following information:
   (i) the U.S. Customs entry document number or a copy of the
U.S. Customs documentation under which the article was imported;
   (ii) the following statement: "22 CFR (identify section) and 22 CFR
120.1(b) applicable."
  &#167; 123.5 -- Temporary export licenses.
   (a) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may issue a license for
the temporary export of unclassified defense articles (DSP-73). Such
licenses are valid only if (1) the article will be exported for a
period of less than 4 years and will be returned to the United States
and (2) transfer of title will not occur during the period of
temporary export. Accordingly, articles exported pursuant to a
temporary export license may not be sold or otherwise permanently
transferred to a foreign person while they are overseas under a
temporary export license. A renewal of the license or other written
approval must be obtained from the Office of Defense Trade Controls if
the article is to remain outside the United States beyond the period
for which the license is valid.
   (b) Requirements. Defense articles authorized for temporary export
under this section may be shipped only from [*39301] a port in the
United States where a District Director of Customs is available, or
from a U.S. Post Office (see 39 CFR part 20), as appropriate. The
license for temporary export must be presented to the District
Director of Customs who, upon verification, will endorse the exit
column on the reverse side of the license. In some instances of the
temporary export of technical data (e.g postal shipments),
self-endorsement will be necessary (see &#167; 123.22(d)). The
endorsed license for temporary export is to be retained by the
licensee. In the case of a military aircraft or vessel exported under
its own power, the endorsed license must be carried on board such
vessel or aircraft as evidence that it has been duly authorized by the
Department of State to leave the United States temporarily.
   (c) Upon the return to the United States of defense articles
covered by a license for temporary export, the license will be
endorsed in the entry column by the District Director of Customs. This
procedure shall be followed for all exits and entries made during the
period for which the license is valid. The licensee must send the
license to the Office of Defense Trade Controls immediately upon
expiration or after the final return of the defense articles approved
for export, whichever occurs first.
  &#167; 123.6 -- Foreign trade zones and U.S. Customs bonded
warehouses.
   Foreign trade zones and U.S. Customs bonded warehouses are
considered integral parts of the United States for the purpose of this
subchapter. An export license is therefore not required for shipment
between the United States and a foreign trade zone or a Customs bonded
warehouse. In the case of classified defense articles, the provisions
of the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual will apply. An
export license is required for all shipments of articles on the
U.S. Munitions List from foreign trade zones and U.S. Customs bonded
warehouses to foreign countries, regardless of how the articles
reached the zone or warehouse.
  &#167; 123.7 -- Exports to warehouses or distribution points outside
the United States.
   Unless the exemption under &#167; 123.16(b)(1) is used, a license
is required to export defense articles to a warehouse or distribution
point outside the United States for subsequent resale and will
normally be granted only if an agreement has been approved pursuant to
&#167; 124.14 of this subchapter.
  &#167; 123.8 -- Special controls on vessels, aircraft and satellites
covered by the U.S. Munitions List.
   (a) Transferring registration or control to a foreign person of any
aircraft, vessel, or satellite on the U.S. Munitions List is an export
for purposes of this subchapter and requires a license or written
approval from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. This requirement
applies whether the aircraft, vessel, or satellite is physically
located in the United States or abroad.
   (b) The registration in a foreign country of any aircraft, vessel
or satellite covered by the U.S. Munitions List which is not
registered in the United States but which is located in the United
States constitutes an export. A license or written approval from the
Office of Defense Trade Controls is therefore required. Such
transactions may also require the prior approval of the Maritime
Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration or other agencies
of the U.S. Government.
  &#167; 123.9 -- Country of ultimate destination and approval of
reexports or retransfers.
   (a) The country designated as the country of ultimate destination
on an application for an export license, or on a Shipper's Export
Declaration where an exemption is claimed under this subchapter, must
be the country of ultimate end- use. The written approval of the
Office of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained before reselling,
transferring, transshipping, or disposing of a defense article to any
end user, end use or destination other than as stated on the export
license, or on the Shipper's Export Declaration in cases where an
exemption is claimed under this subchapter. Exporters must ascertain
the specific end-user and end-use prior to submitting an application
to the Office of Defense Trade Controls or claiming an exemption under
this subchapter.
   (b) The exporter shall incorporate the following statement as an
integral part of the bill of lading, and the invoice whenever defense
articles on the U.S. Munitions List are to be exported:
   These commodities are authorized by the U.S. Government for export
only to [country of ultimate destination] for use by [end-user]. They
may not be transferred, transshipped on a non-continuous voyage, or
otherwise be disposed of in any other country, either in their
original form or after being incorporated into other end-items,
without the prior written approval of the U.S. Department of State."
   (c) A U.S. person or a foreign person requesting approval for the
reexport or retransfer, or change in end-use, of a defense article
shall submit a written request which shall be subject to all the
documentation required for a permanent export license (see &#167;
123.1) and shall contain the following:
   (1) The license number under which the defense article was
previously authorized for export from the United States;
   (2) A precise description, quantity and value of the defense
article;
   (3) A description of the new end-use; and
   (4) Identification of the new end-user.
   (d) The written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls
must be obtained before reselling, transferring, transshipping on a
non-continuous voyage, or disposing of a defense article in any
country other than the country of ultimate destination, or anyone
other than the authorized end-user, as stated on the Shipper's Export
Declaration in cases where an exemption is claimed under this
subchapter.
   (e) Reexports or retransfers of U.S.-origin components incorporated
into a foreign defense article to a government of a NATO country, or
the governments of Australia or Japan, are authorized without the
prior written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls,
provided:
   (1) The U.S.-origin components were previously authorized for
export from the United States, either by a license or an exemption;
   (2) The U.S.-origin components are not significant military
equipment, the items are not major defense equipment sold under a
contract in the amount of $ 14,000,000 ($ 14 million) or more; the
articles are not defense articles or defense services sold under a
contract in the amount of $ 50,000,000 ($ 50 million) or more; and are
not identified in part 121 of this subchapter as Missile Technology
Control Regime (MTCR) items; and
   (3) The person reexporting the defense article must provide written
notification to the Office of Defense Trade Controls of the retransfer
not later than 30 days following the reexport. The notification must
state the articles being reexported and the recipient government.
   (4) In certain cases, the Director, Office of Defense Trade
Controls, may place retransfer restrictions on a license prohibiting
use of this exemption.
  &#167; 123.10 -- Non-transfer and use assurances.
   (a) A nontransfer and use certificate (Form DSP-83) is required for
the export of significant military equipment and classified articles
including classified technical data. A license will [*39302] not be
issued until a completed Form DSP-83 has been received by the Office
of Defense Trade Controls.  This form is to be executed by the foreign
consignee, foreign end-user, and the applicant. The certificate
stipulates that, except as specifically authorized by prior written
approval of the Department of State, the foreign consignee and foreign
end-user will not reexport, resell or otherwise dispose of the
significant military equipment enumerated in the application outside
the country named as the location of the foreign end-use or to any
other person.
   (b) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may also require a DSP-83
for the export of any other defense articles or defense services.
   (c) When a DSP-83 is required for an export of any defense article
or defense service to a non-governmental foreign end-user, the Office
of Defense Trade Controls may require as a condition of issuing the
license that the appropriate authority of the government of the
country of ultimate destination also execute the certificate.
  &#167; 123.11 -- Movements of vessels and aircraft covered by the
U.S. Munitions List outside the United States.
   (a) A license issued by the Office of Defense Trade Controls is
required whenever a privately-owned aircraft or vessel on the
U.S. Munitions List makes a voyage outside the United States.
   (b) Exemption. An export license is not required when a vessel or
aircraft referred to in paragraph (a) of this section departs from the
United States and does not enter the territorial waters or airspace of
a foreign country if no defense articles are carried as cargo. Such a
vessel or aircraft may not enter the territorial waters or airspace of
a foreign country before returning to the United States, or carry as
cargo any defense article, without a temporary export license (Form
DSP-73) from the Department of State. (See &#167; 123.5.)
  &#167; 123.12 -- Shipments between U.S. possessions.
   An export license is not required for the shipment of defense
articles between the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
and U.S.  possessions. A license is required, however, for the export
of defense articles from these areas to foreign countries.
  &#167; 123.13 -- Domestic aircraft shipments via a foreign country.
   A license is not required for the shipment by air of a defense
article from one location in the United States to another location in
the United States via a foreign country. The pilot of the aircraft
must, however, file a written statement with the District Director of
Customs at the port of exit in the United States. The original
statement must be filed at the time of exit with the District Director
of Customs. A duplicate must be filed at the port of reentry with the
District Director of Customs, who will duly endorse it and transmit it
to the District Director of Customs at the port of exit. The statement
will be as follows:
  Domestic Shipment Via a Foreign Country of Articles on the
U.S. Munitions List
   Under penalty according to Federal law, the undersigned certifies
and warrants that all the information in this document is true and
correct, and that the equipment listed below is being shipped from
(U.S. port of exit) via (foreign country) to (U.S. port of entry),
which is the final destination in the United States.
  Description of Equipment __________ Quantity: __________ Equipment:
__________ Value: __________ Signed:
   Endorsement: Customs Inspector. __________ Port of Exit __________
Date: __________ Signed:
   Endorsement: Customs Inspector. __________ Port of Entry:
__________ Date:
  &#167; 123.14 -- Import certificate/delivery verification procedure.
   (a) The Import Certificate/Delivery Verification Procedure is
designed to assure that a commodity imported into the territory of
those countries participating in IC/DV procedures will not be
diverted, transshipped, or reexported to another destination except in
accordance with export control regulations of the importing country.
   (b) Exports. The Office of Defense Trade Controls may require the
IC/DV procedure on proposed exports of defense articles to
non-government entities in those countries participating in IC/DV
procedures. In such cases, U.S. exporters must submit both an export
license application (the completed Form DSP-5) and the original Import
Certificate, which must be provided and authenticated by the
government of the importing country. This document verifies that the
foreign importer complied with the import regulations of the
government of the importing country and that the importer declared the
intention not to divert, transship or reexport the material described
therein without the prior approval of that government. After delivery
of the commodities to the foreign consignee, the Department of State
may also require U.S. exporters to furnish Delivery Verification
documentation from the government of the importing country. This
documentation verifies that the delivery was in accordance with the
terms of the approved export license. Both the Import Certificate and
the Delivery Verification must be furnished to the U.S. exporter by
the foreign importer.
   (c) Triangular transactions. When a transaction involves three or
more countries that have adopted the IC/DV procedure, the governments
of these countries may stamp a triangular symbol on the Import
Certificate. This symbol is usually placed on the Import Certificate
when the applicant for the Import Certificate (the importer) states
either (1) that there is uncertainty whether the items covered by the
Import Certificate will be imported into the country issuing the
Import Certificate; (2) that he or she knows that the items will not
be imported into the country issuing the Import Certificate; or (3)
that, if the items are to be imported into the country issuing the
Import Certificate, they will subsequently be reexported to another
destination. All parties, including the ultimate consignee in the
country of ultimate destination, must be shown on the completed Import
Certificate.
  &#167; 123.15 -- Congressional notification for licenses.
   All exports of major defense equipment, as defined in &#167; 120.8
of this subchapter, sold under a contract in the amount of $
14,000,000 or more, or exports of defense articles and defense
services sold under a contract in the amount of $ 50,000,000 or more,
may take place only after the Office of Defense Trade Controls
notifies the exporter through issuance of a license or other approval
that 30 calendar days have elapsed since receipt by the Congress of
the certification required by 22 U.S.C. 2776(c)(1) and that Congress
has not enacted a joint resolution prohibiting the export. Persons who
intend to export defense articles and defense services pursuant to any
exemption in this subchapter (e.g., &#167; 126.5 of this subchapter)
under the circumstances described in the first sentence of this
subsection must notify the Office of Defense Trade Controls by letter
of the intended export and, prior to transmittal to Congress, provide
a signed contract and a DSP-83 signed by the applicant, the foreign
consignee and end-user.
  &#167; 123.16 -- Exemptions of general applicability.
   (a) The following exemptions apply to exports of unclassified
defense articles for which no approval is needed from the Office of
Defense Trade Controls.  [*39303] These exemptions do not apply to:
Proscribed destinations under &#167; 126.1 of this subchapter; exports
for which Congressional notification is required; MTCR articles; and
may not be used by persons who are generally ineligible as described
in &#167; 120.1(c) of this subchapter. All shipments of defense
articles, including those to and from Canada, require a Shippers
Export Declaration (SED). If the defense article is exempt from
licensing, the SED must cite the exemption. Refer to &#167; 123.22(c)
for Shipper's Export Declaration requirements.
   (b) The following exports are exempt from the licensing
requirements of this subchapter.
   (1) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a
license of defense articles being exported in furtherance of an
approved manufacturing license agreement, technical assistance
agreement or distribution agreement provided that:
   (i) The defense articles to be exported support the activity and
must be identified by item, quantity and value in the agreement; and
   (ii) Any provisos or limitations placed on the authorized agreement
are adhered to; and
   (iii) The exporter certifies on the Shipper's Export Declaration
that the export is exempt from the licensing requirements of this
subchapter. This is done by writing, "22 CFR 123.16(b)(1) and AG
[identify agreement number] applicable and
   (iv) The total value of all shipments does not exceed the value
authorized in the agreement.
   (v) In the case of distribution agreements, export must be made
directly to the approved foreign distributor.
   (2) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export of
components or spare parts (for exemptions for firearms and ammunition
see &#167; 123.17) without a license when the total value does not
exceed $ 500 in a single transaction and:
   (i) The components or spare parts are being exported to support a
defense article previously authorized for export; and
   (ii) The spare parts or components are not going to a distributor,
but to a previously approved end-user of the defense articles; and
   (iii) The spare parts or components are not to be used to enhance
the capability of the defense article;
   (iv) exporters shall not split orders so as not to exceed the
dollar value of this exemption;
   (v) the exporter may not make more than 24 shipments per calender
year to the previously authorized end user;

   (3) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a
license, of packing cases specially designed to carry defense
articles.
   (4) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a
license, of unclassified models or mock-ups of defense articles,

licensing requirements of &#167; 125.4(b) of this subchapter and do
not contain components covered by the U.S. Munitions List (see &#167;
120.6(b) of this subchapter). Some models or mockups built to scale or
constructed of original materials can reveal technical
data. U.S. persons who avail themselves of this exemption must provide
a written certification to the District Director of Customs that these
conditions are met. This exemption does not imply that the Office of
Defense Trade Controls will approve the export of any defense articles
for which models or mocks-ups have been exported pursuant to this
exemption.
   (5) District Directors of Customs shall permit the temporary export
without a license of unclassified defense articles to any public
exhibition, trade show, air show or related event if that article has
previously been licensed for a public exhibition, trade show, air show
or related event and the license is still valid. U.S. persons who
avail themselves of this exemption must provide a written
certification to the District Director of Customs that these
conditions are met.

owned or controlled by the U.S.  person (see &#167; 122.2(c) of this
subchapter) if the component, part, tool or test equipment is to be
used for manufacture, assembly, testing, production, or modification
provided:
   (i) The U.S. person is registered with the Office of Defense Trade
Controls and complies with all requirements set forth in part 122 of
this subchapter;
   (ii) No defense article exported under this exemption may be sold
or transferred without the appropriate license or other approval from
the Office of Defense Trade Controls.

not applicable to a crew-member of a vessel or aircraft unless the
crew-member declares the firearms to a Customs officer upon each
departure from the United States, and declares that it is his or her
intention to return the article(s) on each return to the United
States. It is also not applicable to the personnel referred to in
&#167; 123.18.
   (d) District Directors of Customs shall permit a foreign person to
export without a license such firearms in Category I(a) of &#167;
121.1 of this subchapter and ammunition therefor as the foreign person

ownership. The foregoing exemption is also not applicable to the
personnel referred to in &#167; 123.18.
  &#167; 123.18 -- Firearms for personal use of members of the
U.S. Armed Forces and civilian employees of the U.S. Government.
   The following exemptions apply to members of the U.S. Armed Forces
and civilian employees of the U.S. Government who are U.S. persons
(both referred assigned abroad for extended duty. These exemptions do
not apply to dependents.
   (a) Firearms. District Directors of Customs shall permit
nonautomatic firearms in Category I(a) of &#167; 121.1 of this
subchapter and parts therefor to be exported, except by mail, from the
United States without a license if:
   (1) They are consigned to servicemen's clubs abroad for uniformed
members of the U.S. Armed Forces; or,
   (2) In the case of a uniformed member of the U.S. Armed Forces or a
civilian employee of the Department of Defense, they are for personal
use and not for resale or other transfer of ownership, and if the
firearms are accompanied by a written authorization from the
commanding officer concerned; or
   (3) In the case of other U.S. Government employees, they are for
personal use and not for resale or other transfer of ownership, and
the Chief of the U.S.  Diplomatic Mission or his designee in the
country of destination has approved in writing to Department of State
the import of the specific types and quantities of firearms into that
country. The exporter shall provide a copy of this written statement
to the District Director of Customs.
   (b) Ammunition. District Directors of Customs shall permit not more
than 1,000 cartridges (or rounds) of ammunition for the firearms
referred to in paragraph (a) of this section to be exported (but not

  &#167; 123.19 -- Canadian and Mexican border shipments.
   A shipment originating in Canada or Mexico which incidentally
transits the United States en route to a delivery point in the same
country that originated the shipment is exempt from the requirement
for an in transit license.
  &#167; 123.20 -- Nuclear materials.
   (a) The provisions of this subchapter do not apply to equipment in
Category VI(e) and Category XVI of &#167; 121.1 of this subchapter to
the extent such equipment is under the export control of the
Department of Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Act of 1978.
   (b) A license for the export of any machinery, device, component,
equipment, or technical data relating to equipment referred to in
Category VI(e) will not be granted unless the proposed export comes
within the scope of an existing Agreement for Cooperation for Mutual
Defense Purposes concluded pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954,
as amended, with the government of the country to which the article is
to be exported. Licenses may be granted in the absence of such an
agreement only (1) if the proposed export involves an article which is
identical to that in use in an unclassified civilian nuclear power
plant, (2) if the proposed export has no relationship to naval nuclear
propulsion, and (3) if it is not for use in a naval propulsion plant.
  &#167; 123.21 -- Duration, renewal and disposition of licenses.
   (a) A license is valid for four years. The license expires when the
total value or quantity authorized has been shipped or when the date
of expiration has been reached, whichever occurs first. Defense
articles to be shipped thereafter require a new application and
license. The new application should refer to the expired license. It
should not include references to any defense articles other than those
of the unshipped balance of the expired license.
   (b) Unused, expired, expended, suspended, or revoked licenses must
be returned immediately to the Department of State.
  &#167; 123.22 -- Filing of export licenses and Shipper's Export
Declarations with District Directors of Customs.
   (a) The exporter must deposit the license with the District
Director of Customs at the port of exit before shipment, unless
paragraph (d) of this section or &#167; 125.9 applies (for exports by
mail, see &#167; 123.24). Licenses for temporary export or temporary
import are to be retained by the exporter and presented to the
District Director of Customs at the time of import or export for
endorsement. If necessary, the export may be made through a port other
than the one designated on the license if the exporter complies with
the procedures established by the U.S. Customs Service. Every license
will be returned to the Office of Defense Trade Controls by the
District Director of Customs when the total value or quantity
authorized has been shipped or when the date of expiration is reached,
whichever occurs first.
   (b) Before shipping any defense article, the exporter must also
file a Shipper's Export Declaration with the District Director of
Customs at the port of exit (unless otherwise exempt from filing a
Shipper's Export Declaration).  The District Director of Customs at
the port of exit must authenticate the Shipper's Export Declaration,
and endorse the license to show the shipments actually made. The
District Director of Customs will return a copy of each authenticated
Shipper's Export Declaration to the Office of Defense Trade Controls.
   (c) Except for the export of unclassified technical data, an
exporter must file a Shipper's Export Declaration with District
Directors of Customs or Postmasters in those cases in which no export
license is required because of an exemption under this subchapter. The
exporter must certify that the export is exempt from the licensing
requirements of this subchapter by writing 22 CFR (identify section)
and 22 CFR 120.1(b) applicable on the Shipper's Export Declaration,
and by identifying the section under which an exemption is claimed.  A
copy of each such declaration must be mailed immediately by the
exporter to the Office of Defense Trade Controls.
   (d) A Shipper's Export Declaration is not required for exports of
unclassified technical data. Exporters shall notify the Office of
Defense Trade Controls of the initial export of the data by either
returning the license after self endorsement or by sending a letter to
the Office of Defense Trade Controls.  The letter shall provide the
method, date, license number and airway bill number (if applicable) of
the shipment. The letter must be signed by an empowered official of
the company and provided to the Office of Defense Trade Controls
within thirty days of the initial export. Additionally, similar
notification must be provided to the Office of Defense Trade Controls
for any subsequent exports.
   (e) If a license for the export of unclassified defense articles,
including technical data, is used but not endorsed by U.S. Customs or
a Postmaster for whatever reason (e.g., electronic transmission,
unavailability of Customs [*39305] officer or Postmaster, etc.), the
person exporting the article must self-endorse the license, showing
when and how the export took place. Every license shall also be
returned by the exporter to the Office of Defense Trade Controls when
the total value or quantity authorized has been shipped or when the
date of expiration is reached, whichever occurs first.
  &#167; 123.23 -- Monetary value of shipments.
   District Directors of Customs shall permit the shipment of defense
articles identified on any license when the total value of the export
does not exceed the aggregate monetary value (not quantity) stated on
the license by more than ten percent, provided that the additional
monetary value does not make the total value of the license or other
approval for the export of any major defense equipment sold under a
contract reach $ 14,000,000 or more, and provided that the additional
monetary value does not make defense articles or defense services sold
under a contract reach the amount of $ 50,000,000 or more.
  &#167; 123.24 -- Shipments by mail.
   A Shipper's Export Declaration must be authenticated before an
article is actually sent abroad by mail (see &#167; 123.22(d)). The
postmaster or exporter will endorse each license to show the shipments
made. Every license must be returned by the exporter to the Office of
Defense Trade Controls upon completion of the mailings.
  &#167; 123.25 -- Amendments to licenses.
   (a) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may approve an amendment
to a license for permanent export, temporary export and temporary
import of unclassified defense articles. A suggested format is
available from the Office of Defense Trade Controls.
   (b) The following types of amendments to a license that will be
considered: Addition of U.S. freight forwarder or U.S. consignor;
change due to an obvious typographical error; change in source of
commodity; and change of foreign intermediate consignee if that party
is only transporting the equipment and will not process (e.g.,
integrate, modify) the equipment. For changes in U.S. dollar value see
&#167; 123.23.
   (c) The following types of amendments to a license will not be
approved: Additional quantity, changes in commodity, country of
ultimate destination, end- use or end-user, foreign consignee and/or
extension of duration. The foreign intermediate consignee may only be
amended if that party is acting as freight forwarder and the export
does not involve technical data. A new license is required for these
changes. Any new license submission must reflect only the unshipped
balance of quantity and dollar value.
  &#167; 123.26 -- Recordkeeping requirement for exemptions.
   When an exemption is claimed for the export of unclassified
technical data, the exporter must maintain a record of each such
export. The business record should include the following information:
A description of the unclassified technical data, the name of the
recipient end-user, the date and time of the export, and the method of
transmission.

Comp. p. 79; 22 U.S.C. 2658.
  &#167; 124.1 -- Manufacturing license agreements and technical
assistance agreements.
   (a) The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be
obtained before the defense services described in &#167; 120.9(a) of
this subchapter may be furnished. In order to obtain such approval,
the U.S. person must submit a proposed agreement to the Office of
Defense Trade Controls. Such agreements are generally characterized as
either Manufacturing license agreements, technical assistance
agreements, distribution agreements or off-shore procurement
agreements, and may not enter into force without the prior written
approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Once approved, the
defense services described in the agreements may generally be provided
without further licensing in accordance with &#167;&#167; 124.3 and
125.4(b)(2) of this subchapter. The requirements of this section apply
whether or not technical data is to be disclosed or used in the
performance of the defense services described in &#167; 120.9(a) of
this subchapter (e.g., all the information relied upon by the
U.S. person in performing the defense service is in the public domain
or is otherwise exempt from the licensing requirements of this
subchapter pursuant to &#167; 125.4 of this subchapter). This
requirement also applies to the training of any foreign military
forces, regular and irregular, in the use of defense articles.
Technical assistance agreements must be submitted in such cases. In
exceptional cases, The Office of Defense Trade Controls, upon written
request, will consider approving the provision of defense services
described in &#167; 120.9(a) of this subchapter by granting a license
under part 125 of this subchapter. Also, see &#167; 126.8 of this
subchapter for the requirements for prior approval of proposals
relating to significant military equipment.
   (b) Classified Articles. Copies of approved agreements involving
the release of classified defense articles will be forwarded by the
Office of Defense Trade Controls to the Defense Investigative Service
of the Department of Defense.
   (c) Amendments. Changes to the scope of approved agreements,
including modifications, upgrades, or extensions must be submitted for
approval. The amendments may not enter into force until approved by
the Office of Defense Trade Controls.
   (d) Minor Amendments. Amendments which only alter delivery or
performance schedules, or other minor administrative amendments which
do not affect in any manner the duration of the agreement or the
clauses or information which must be included in such agreements
because of the requirements of this part, do not have to be submitted
for approval. One copy of all such minor amendments must be submitted
to the Office of Defense Trade Controls within thirty days after they
are concluded.
  &#167; 124.2 -- Exemptions for training and military service.
   (a) Technical assistance agreements are not required for the
provision of [*39306] training in the basic operation and maintenance
of defense articles lawfully exported or authorized for export to the
same recipient. This does not include training in intermediate and
depot level maintenance.
   (b) Services performed as a member of the regular military forces
of a foreign nation by U.S. persons who have been drafted into such
forces are not deemed to be defense services for purposes of &#167;
120.9 of this subchapter.
  &#167; 124.3 -- Exports of technical data in furtherance of an
agreement.
   (a) Unclassified technical data. District Directors of Customs or
postal authorities shall permit the export without a license of
unclassified technical data if the export is in furtherance of a
manufacturing license or technical assistance agreement which has been
approved in writing by the Office of Defense Trade Controls and the
technical data being exported does not exceed the scope or limitations
of the relevant agreement. The U.S. party to the agreement must
certify on the Shippers Export Declaration that the export does not
exceed the scope of the agreement and any limitations imposed pursuant
to this part. The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls
must be obtained for the export of any unclassified technical data
which may exceed the terms of the agreement.
   (b) Classified technical data. The export of classified information
in furtherance of an approved manufacturing license or technical
assistance agreement which provides for the transmittal of classified
information does not require further approval from the Office of
Defense Trade Controls when:
   (1) The United States party certifies to the Department of Defense
transmittal authority that the classified information does not exceed
the technical or product limitations in the agreement; and
   (2) The U.S. party complies with the requirements of the Department
of Defense Industrial Security Manual concerning the transmission of
classified information and any other requirements of cognizant
U.S. departments or agencies.
  &#167; 124.4 -- Deposit of signed agreements with the Office of
Defense Trade Controls.
   The United States party to a manufacturing license or a technical
assistance agreement must file one copy of the concluded agreement
with the Office of Defense Trade Controls not later than 30 days after
it enters into force.
  &#167; 124.5 -- Proposed agreements that are not concluded.
   The United States party to any proposed manufacturing license
agreement or technical assistance agreement must inform the Office of
Defense Trade Controls if a decision is made not to conclude the
agreement. The information must be provided within 60 days of the date
of the decision. These requirements apply only if the approval of the
Office of Defense Trade Controls was obtained for the agreement to be
concluded (with or without any provisos).
  &#167; 124.6 -- Termination of manufacturing license agreements and
technical assistance agreements.
   The U. S. party to a manufacturing license or a technical
assistance agreement must inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls
in writing of the impending termination of the agreement not less than
30 days prior to the expiration date of such agreement.
  &#167; 124.7 -- Information required in all manufacturing license
agreements and technical assistance agreements.
   The following information must be included in all proposed
manufacturing license agreements and technical assistance
agreements. The information should be provided in terms which are as
precise as possible. If the applicant believes that a clause or that
required information is not relevant or necessary, the applicant may
request the omission of the clause or information. The transmittal
letter accompanying the agreement must state the reasons for any
proposed variation in the clauses or required information.
   (1) The agreement must describe the defense article to be
manufactured and all defense articles to be exported, including any
test and support equipment or advanced materials. They should be
described by military nomenclature, contract number, National Stock
Number, nameplate data, or other specific information.  Supporting
technical data or brochures should be submitted in seven copies. Only
defense articles listed in the agreement will be eligible for export
under the exemption in &#167; 123.16(b)(1) of this subchapter.
   (2) The agreement must specifically describe the assistance and
technical data, including the design and manufacturing know-how
involved, to be furnished and any manufacturing rights to be granted;
   (3) The agreement must specify its duration; and
   (4) The agreement must specifically identify the countries or areas
in which manufacturing, production, processing, sale or other form of
transfer is to be licensed.
  &#167; 124.8 -- Clauses required both in manufacturing license
agreements and technical assistance agreements.
   The following statements must be included both in manufacturing
license agreements and in technical assistance agreements:
   (1) "This agreement shall not enter into force, and shall not be
amended or extended, without the prior written approval of the
Department of State of the U.S. Government."
   (2) "This agreement is subject to all United States laws and
regulations relating to exports and to all administrative acts of the
U.S. Government pursuant to such laws and regulations."
   (3) "The parties to this agreement agree that the obligations
contained in this agreement shall not affect the performance of any
obligations created by prior contracts or subcontracts which the
parties may have individually or collectively with the
U.S. Government."
   (4) "No liability will be incurred by or attributed to the
U.S. Government in connection with any possible infringement of
privately owned patent or proprietary rights, either domestic or
foreign, by reason of the U.S.  Government's approval of this
agreement."
   (5) "The technical data or defense service exported from the United
States in furtherance of this agreement and any defense article which
may be produced or manufactured from such technical data or defense
service may not be transferred to a person in a third country or to a
national of a third country except as specifically authorized in this
agreement unless the prior written approval of the Department of State
has been obtained."
   (6) "All provisions in this agreement which refer to the United
States Government and the Department of State will remain binding on
the parties after the termination of the agreement."
  &#167; 124.9 -- Additional clauses required only in manufacturing
license agreements.
   (a) Clauses for all manufacturing license agreements. The following
clauses must be included only in manufacturing license agreements:
   (1) "No export, sale, transfer, or other disposition of the
licensed article is authorized to any country outside the territory
wherein manufacture or sale is herein licensed without the prior
written approval of the U.S. Government unless otherwise exempted by
the U.S. Government. Sales or other [*39307] transfers of the licensed
article shall be limited to governments of countries wherein
manufacture or sale is hereby licensed and to private entities seeking
to procure the licensed article pursuant to a contract with any such
government unless the prior written approval of the U.S. Government is
obtained."
   (2) "It is agreed that sales by licensee or its sub-licensees under
contracts made through the U.S. Government will not include either
charges for patent rights in which the U.S. Government holds a
royalty-free license, or charges for data which the U.S. Government
has a right to use and disclose to others, which are in the public
domain, or which the U.S. Government has acquired or is entitled to
acquire without restrictions upon their use and disclosure to others."
   (3) "If the U.S. Government is obligated or becomes obligated to
pay to the licensor royalties, fees, or other charges for the use of
technical data or patents which are involved in the manufacture, use,
or sale of any licensed article, any royalties, fees or other charges
in connection with purchases of such licensed article from licensee or
its sub-licensees with funds derived through the U.S. Government may
not exceed the total amount the U.S. Government would have been
obligated to pay the licensor directly."
   (4) "If the U.S. Government has made financial or other
contributions to the design and development of any licensed article,
any charges for technical assistance or know-how relating to the item
in connection with purchases of such articles from licensee or
sub-licensees with funds derived through the U.S.  Government must be
proportionately reduced to reflect the U.S. Government contributions,
and subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this
section, no other royalties, or fees or other charges may be assessed
against U.S. Government funded purchases of such articles. However,
charges may be made for reasonable reproduction, handling, mailing, or
similar administrative costs incident to the furnishing of such data."
   (5) "The parties to this agreement agree that an annual report of
sales or other transfers pursuant to this agreement of the licensed
articles, by quantity, type, U.S. dollar value, and purchaser or
recipient, shall be provided by (applicant or licensee) to the
Department of State." This clause must specify which party is
obligated to provide the annual report. Such reports may be submitted
either directly by the licensee or indirectly through the licensor,
and may cover calendar or fiscal years. Reports shall be deemed
proprietary information by the Department of State and will not be
disclosed to unauthorized persons. See &#167; 126.10(b) of this
subchapter.
   (6) (Licensee) agrees to incorporate the following statement as an
integral provision of a contract, invoice or other appropriate
document whenever the licensed articles are sold or otherwise
transferred:
   These commodities are authorized for export by the U.S. Government
only to (country of ultimate destination or approved sales
territory). They may not be resold, diverted, transferred,
transshipped, or otherwise be disposed of in any other country, either
in their original form or after being incorporated through an
intermediate process into other end-items, without the prior written
approval of the U.S. Department of State.
   (b) Special clause for agreements relating to significant military
equipment.  With respect to an agreement for the production of
significant military equipment, the following additional provisions
must be included in the agreement:
   (1) "A completed nontransfer and use certificate (DSP-83) must be
executed by the foreign end-user and submitted to the Department of
State of the United States before any transfer may take place."
   (2) "The prior written approval of the U.S. Government must be
obtained before entering into a commitment for the transfer of the
licensed article by sale or otherwise to any person or government
outside of the approved sales territory."
  &#167; 124.10 -- Nontransfer and use assurances.
   A nontransfer and use certificate (Form DSP-83) (see &#167; 123.10
of this subchapter) signed by the applicant and the foreign party to a
manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement is
required as a condition to the approval of any such agreement which
relates to significant military equipment, classified articles or
classified technical data. The Office of Defense Trade Controls may in
some cases require that this certificate or a comparable undertaking
be provided before approving an agreement that does not relate to
significant military equipment. The Office of Defense Trade Controls
may also require as a condition of approval that an appropriate
authority of the foreign party's government also execute the
certificate or provide undertakings comparable to those contained in
the Form DSP-83 (e.g., in a diplomatic note).  Agreements involving
classified articles or classified technical data should be accompanied
by a nontransfer and use certificate signed by an authorized
representative of the foreign government concerned unless the Office
of Defense Trade Controls has granted an exception to this
requirement.
  &#167; 124.11 -- Certification to Congress for agreements.
   Regardless of dollar value, a Technical Assistance Agreement or a
Manufacturing License Agreement for or in a country not a member of
NATO that involves the manufacture abroad of any item of significant
military equipment (as defined in &#167; 120.7 of this subchapter)
shall be certified to Congress by the Department as required by 22
U.S.C. 2776(d). Additionally, any technical assistance agreement or
manufacturing license agreement providing for the export of major
defense equipment, as defined in &#167; 120.8, sold under a contract
in the amount of $ 14 million or more, or of defense articles or
defense services sold under a contract in the amount of $ 50 million
or more, shall be certified to Congress by the Department as required
by 22 U.S.C. 2776(c)(1). The Office of Defense Trade Controls will not
approve agreements requiring Congressional notification until 30
calendar days have elapsed since receipt by the Congress of the
required certification without the Congress having enacted a joint
resolution prohibiting the agreement.
  &#167; 124.12 -- Required information in letters of transmittal.
   (a) An application for the approval of a manufacturing license or
technical assistance agreement with a foreign person must be
accompanied by an explanatory letter. The original letter and seven

offices that have responsibility for the facilities of the
U.S. parties to the agreement shall be identified. The facility
security clearance codes of the U.S. parties shall also be provided.
   (b) The following statements must be made in the letter of
transmittal:
   (1) "If the agreement is approved by the Department of State, such
approval will not be construed by (the applicant) as passing on the
legality of the agreement from the standpoint of antitrust laws or
other applicable statutes, nor will (the applicant) construe the
Department's approval as constituting either approval or disapproval
of any of the business terms or conditions between the parties to the
agreement."
   (2) "The (applicant) will not permit the proposed agreement to
enter into force until it has been approved by the Department of
State."
   (3) "The (applicant) will furnish the Department of State with one
copy of the signed agreement (or amendment) within 30 days from the
date that the agreement is concluded and will inform the Department of
its termination not less than 30 days prior to expiration and provide
information on the continuation of any foreign rights or the flow of
technical data to the foreign party. If a decision is made not to
conclude the proposed agreement, the applicant will so inform the
Department within 60 days."
   (4) "If this agreement grants any rights to sub-license, it will be
amended to require that all sub-licensing arrangements incorporate all
the provisions of the basic agreement that refer to the
U.S. Government and the Department of State (i.e., 22 CFR 124.9 and
124.10)."
  &#167; 124.13 -- Procurement by United States persons in foreign
countries (offshore procurement).
   Notwithstanding the other provisions in part 124 of this
subchapter, the Office of Defense Trade Controls may authorize by
means of a license (DSP-5) the export of unclassified technical data
to foreign persons for offshore procurement of defense articles,
provided that:
   (a) The contract or purchase order for offshore procurement limits
delivery of the defense articles to be produced only to the person in
the United States or to an agency of the U.S. Government; and
   (b) The technical data of U.S.-origin to be used in the foreign
manufacture of defense articles does not exceed that required for bid
purposes on a build- to-print basis (build-to-print means producing an
end-item (i.e., system, subsystem or component) from technical
drawings and specifications (which contain no process or know-how
information) without the need for additional technical
assistance). Release of supporting documentation (e.g., acceptance
criteria, object code software for numerically controlled machines) is
permissible. Build-to-print does not include the release of any
information which discloses design methodology, engineering analysis,
detailed process information or manufacturing know-how); and
   (c) The contract or purchase order between the person in the United
States and the foreign person:
   (1) Limits the use of the technical data to the manufacture of the
defense articles required by the contract or purchase order only; and
   (2) Prohibits the disclosure of the data to any other person except
subcontractors within the same country; and
   (3) Prohibits the acquisition of any rights in the data by any
foreign person; and
   (4) Provides that any subcontracts between foreign persons in the
approved country for manufacture of equipment for delivery pursuant to
the contract or purchase order contain all the limitations of this
paragraph (c); and
   (5) Requires the foreign person, including subcontractors, to
destroy or return to the person in the United States all of the
technical data exported pursuant to the contract or purchase order
upon fulfillment of their terms; and
   (6) Requires delivery of the defense articles manufactured abroad
only to the person in the United States or to an agency of the
U.S. Government; and
   (d) The person in the United States provides the Office of Defense
Trade Controls with a copy of each contract, purchase order or
subcontract for offshore procurement at the time it is accepted. Each
such contract, purchase order or subcontract must clearly identify the
article to be produced and must identify the license number or
exemption under which the technical data was exported; and
   (e) Licenses issued pursuant to this section must be renewed upon
their expiration if offshore procurement is to extend beyond the
period of validity of the license. If the technical data involved in
an offshore procurement arrangement is otherwise exempt from the
licensing requirements pursuant to &#167; 126.4 or &#167; 126.5 of
this subchapter, the DSP-5 referred to in the first sentence of this
section is not required. However, the exporter must comply with the
other requirements of this section. The exemptions under &#167; 125.4
of this subchapter may not be used to establish offshore procurement
arrangements.
  &#167; 124.14 -- Exports to warehouses or distribution points
outside the United States.
   (a) Agreements (e.g., contracts) between U.S. persons and foreign
persons for the warehousing and distribution of defense articles must
be approved by the Office of Defense Trade Controls before they enter
into force. Such agreements will be limited to unclassified defense
articles and must contain conditions for special distribution, end-use
and reporting. Licenses for exports pursuant to such agreements must
be obtained prior to exports of the defense articles unless an
exemption under &#167; 123.16(b)(1) of this subchapter is applicable.
   (b) Required Information. Proposed warehousing and distribution
agreements (and amendments thereto) shall be submitted to the Office
of Defense Trade Controls for approval. The following information must
be included in all such agreements:
   (1) A description of the defense articles involved including test
and support equipment covered by the U.S. Munitions List. This shall
include when applicable the military nomenclature, the Federal stock
number, nameplate data, and any control numbers under which the
defense articles were developed or procured by the
U.S. Government. Only those defense articles specifically listed in
the agreement will be eligible for export under the exemption in
&#167; 123.16(b)(1) of this subchapter.  [*39309]
   (2) A detailed statement of the terms and conditions under which
the defense articles will be exported and distributed;
   (3) The duration of the proposed agreement;
   (4) Specific identification of the country or countries that
comprise the distribution territory. Distribution must be specifically
limited to the governments of such countries or to private entities
seeking to procure defense articles pursuant to a contract with a
government within the distribution territory or to other eligible
entities as specified by the Office of Defense Trade
Controls. Consequently, any deviation from this condition must be
fully explained and justified. A nontransfer and use certificate
(DSP-83) will be required to the same extent required in licensing
agreements under &#167; 124.9(b).
   (c) Required statements. The following statements must be included
in all warehousing and distribution agreements:
   (1) "This agreement shall not enter into force, and may not be
amended or extended, without the prior written approval of the
Department of State of U.S.  Government."
   (2) "This agreement is subject to all United States laws and
regulations related to exports and to all administrative acts of the
United States Government pursuant to such laws and regulations.
   (3) "The parties to this agreement agree that the obligations
contained in this agreement shall not affect the performance of any
obligations created by prior contracts or subcontracts which the
parties may have individually or collectively with the
U.S. Government."
   (4) "No liability will be incurred by or attributed to the
U.S. Government in connection with any possible infringement of
privately owned patent or proprietary rights, either domestic or
foreign by reason of the U.S.  Government's approval of this
agreement."
   (5) "No export, sale, transfer, or other disposition of the defense
articles covered by this agreement is authorized to any country
outside the distribution territory without the prior written approval
of the Office of Defense Trade Controls of the U.S. Department of
State."
   (6) "The parties to this agreement agree that an annual report of
sales or other transfers pursuant to this agreement of the licensed
articles, by quantity, type, U.S. dollar value, and purchaser or
recipient shall be provided by (applicant or licensee) to the
Department of State." This clause must specify which party is
obligated to provide the annual report. Such reports may be submitted
either directly by the licensee or indirectly through the licensor,
and may cover calendar or fiscal years. Reports shall be deemed
proprietary information by the Department of State and will not be
disclosed to unauthorized persons. (See &#167; 126.10(b) of this
subchapter.)
   (7) (Licensee) agrees to incorporate the following statement as an
integral provision of a contract, invoice or other appropriate
document whenever the articles covered by this agreement are sold or
otherwise transferred:
   These commodities are authorized for export by the U.S. Government
only to (country of ultimate destination or approved sales
territory). They may not be resold, diverted, transferred,
transshipped, or otherwise be disposed of in any other country, either
in their original form or after being incorporated through an
intermediate process into other end-items, without the prior written
approval of the U.S. Department of State.
   (8) "All provisions in this agreement which refer to the United
States Government and the Department of State will remain binding on
the parties after the termination of the agreement."
   (9) Additional clause. Unless the articles covered by the agreement
are in fact intended to be distributed to private persons or entities
(e.g., sporting firearms for commercial resale, cryptographic devices
and software for financial and business applications), the following
clause must be included in all warehousing and distribution
agreements: "Sales or other transfers of the licensed article shall be
limited to governments of the countries in the distribution territory
and to private entities seeking to procure the licensed article
pursuant to a contract with a government within the distribution
territory, unless the prior written approval of the U.S. Department of
State is obtained."
   (d) Special clauses for agreements relating to significant military
equipment. With respect to agreements for the warehousing and
distribution of significant military equipment, the following
additional provisions must be included in the agreement:
   (1) A completed nontransfer and use certificate (DSP-83) must be
executed by the foreign end-user and submitted to the U.S. Department
of State before any transfer may take place.
   (2) The prior written approval of the U.S. Department of State must
be obtained before entering into a commitment for the transfer of the
licensed article by sale or otherwise to any person or government
outside the approved distribution territory.
   (e) Transmittal Letters. Requests for approval of warehousing and
distribution agreements with foreign persons must be made by

   (1) "If the agreement is approved by the Department of State, such
approval will not be construed by (applicant) as passing on the
legality of the agreement from the standpoint of antitrust laws or
other applicable statutes, nor will (the applicant) construe the
Department's approval as constituting either approval or disapproval
of any of the business terms or conditions between the parties to the
agreement."
   (2) "The (applicant) will not permit the proposed agreement to
enter into force until it has been approved by the Department of
State."
   (3) "(Applicant) will furnish the Department of State with one copy
of the signed agreement (or amendment thereto) within 30 days from the
date that the agreement is concluded, and will inform the Department
of its termination not less than 30 days prior to expiration. If a

U.S.C. 2658.
  &#167; 125.1 -- Exports subject to this part.
   (a) The controls of this part apply to the export of technical data
and the export of classified defense articles. Information which is in
the public domain (see &#167; 120.11 of this subchapter and &#167;
125.4(b)(13)) is not subject to the controls of this subchapter.
   (b) A license for the export of technical data and the exemptions
in &#167; 125.4 may not be used for foreign production purposes or for
technical assistance unless the approval of the Office of Defense
Trade Controls has been obtained.  Such approval is generally provided
only pursuant to the procedures specified in part 124 of this
subchapter.
   (c) Technical data authorized for export may not be reexported,
transferred or diverted from the country of ultimate end-use or from
the authorized foreign end-user (as designated in the license or
approval for export) or disclosed to a national of another country
without the prior written approval of the Office of Defense Trade
Controls.
   (d) The controls of this part apply to the exports referred to in
paragraph (a) of this section regardless of whether the person who
intends to export the technical data produces or manufactures defense
articles if the technical data is determined by the Office of Defense
Trade Controls to be subject to the controls of this subchapter.
   (e) The provisions of this subchapter do not apply to technical
data related to articles in Category VI(e) and Category XVI. The
export of such data is controlled by the Department of Energy and the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of
1954, as amended, and the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Act of 1978.
  &#167; 125.2 -- Exports of unclassified technical data.
   (a) A license (DSP-5) is required for the export of unclassified
technical data unless the export is exempt from the licensing
requirements of this subchapter. In the case of a plant visit, details
of the proposed discussions must be transmitted to the Office of
Defense Trade Controls for an appraisal of the technical data. Seven
copies of the technical data or the details of the discussion must be
provided.
   (b) Patents. A license issued by the Office of Defense Trade
Controls is required for the export of technical data whenever the
data exceeds that which is used to support a domestic filing of a
patent application or to support a foreign filing of a patent
application whenever no domestic application has been filed. Requests
for the filing of patent applications in a foreign country, and
requests for the filing of amendments, modifications or supplements to
such patents, should follow the regulations of the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office in accordance with 37 CFR part 5. The export of
technical data to support the filing and processing of patent
applications in foreign countries is subject to regulations issued by
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office pursuant to 35 U.S.C.  184.
   (c) Disclosures. Unless otherwise expressly exempted in this
subchapter, a license is required for the oral, visual or documentary
disclosure of technical data by U.S. persons to foreign persons. A
license is required regardless of the manner in which the technical
data is transmitted (e.g., in person, by telephone, correspondence,
electronic means, etc.). A license is required for such disclosures by
U.S. persons in connection with visits to foreign diplomatic missions
and consular offices.
  &#167; 125.3 -- Exports of classified technical data and classified

application must contain full details of the proposed transaction. It
should also list the facility security clearance code of all
U.S. parties on the license and include the Defense Investigative
Service cognizant security office of the party responsible for
packaging the commodity for shipment. A nontransfer and use
certificate (Form DSP-83) executed by the applicant, foreign
consignee, end-user and an authorized representative of the foreign
government involved will be required.
   (b) Classified technical data which is approved by the Office of
Defense Trade Controls either for export or reexport after a temporary
import will be transferred or disclosed only in accordance with the
requirements in the Department of Defense Industrial Security
Manual. Any other requirements imposed by cognizant U.S. departments
and agencies must also be satisfied.
   (c) The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be
obtained for the export of technical data by a U.S. person to a

an invention secrecy order are to be addressed to the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (see 37 CFR 5.11).
  &#167; 125.4 -- Exemptions of general applicability.
   (a) The following exemptions apply to exports of unclassified
technical data for which approval is not needed from the Office of
Defense Trade Controls.  These exemptions, except for paragraph
(b)(13) of this section, do not apply to exports to proscribed
destinations under &#167; 126.1 of this subchapter or for persons
considered generally ineligible under &#167; 120.1(c) of this
subchapter. The exemptions are also not applicable for purposes of
establishing offshore procurement arrangements. If &#167; 126.8 of
this subchapter requirements are applicable, they must be met before
an exemption under this section may be used.  Transmission of
classified information must comply with the requirements of the
Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual and the exporter must
certify to the transmittal authority that the technical data does not
exceed the technical limitation of the authorized export.
   (b) The following exports are exempt from the licensing
requirements of this subchapter.
   (1) Technical data, including classified information, to be
disclosed pursuant to an official written request or directive from
the U.S. Department of Defense;
   (2) Technical data, including classified information, in
furtherance of a manufacturing license or technical assistance
agreement approved by the Department of State under part 124 of
[*39311] this subchapter and which meet the requirements of &#167;
124.3 of this subchapter;
   (3) Technical data, including classified information, in
furtherance of a contract between the exporter and an agency of the
U.S. Government, if the contract provides for the export of the data
and such data does not disclose the details of design, development,
production, or manufacture of any defense article;
   (4) Copies of technical data, including classified information,
previously authorized for export to the same recipient. Revised copies
of such technical data are also exempt if they pertain to the
identical defense article, and if the revisions are solely editorial
and do not add to the content of technology previously exported or
authorized for export to the same recipient;
   (5) Technical data, including classified information, in the form
of basic operations, maintenance, and training information relating to
a defense article lawfully exported or authorized for export to the
same recipient. Intermediate or depot-level repair and maintenance
information may be exported only under a license or agreement approved
specifically for that purpose;
   (6) Technical data, including classified information, related to
firearms not in excess of caliber .50 and ammunition for such weapons,
except detailed design, development, production or manufacturing
information;
   (7) Technical data, including classified information, being
returned to the original source of import;
   (8) Technical data directly related to classified information which
has been previously exported or authorized for export in accordance
with this part to the same recipient, and which does not disclose the
details of the design, development, production, or manufacture of any
defense article;
   (9) Technical data, including classified information, sent by a
U.S.  corporation to a U.S. person employed by that corporation
overseas or to a U.S.  Government agency. This exemption is subject to
the limitations of &#167; 125.1(b) and may be used only if:
   (i) The technical data is to be used overseas solely by
U.S. persons;
   (ii) If the U.S. person overseas is an employee of the
U.S. Government or is directly employed by the U.S. corporation and
not by a foreign subsidiary; and
   (iii) The classified information is sent overseas in accordance
with the requirements of the Department of Defense Industrial Security
Manual.
   (10) Disclosures of unclassified technical data in the U.S. by U.S.
institutions of higher learning to foreign persons who are their bona
fide and full time regular employees. This exemption is available only
if:
   (i) The employee's permanent abode throughout the period of
employment is in the United States;
   (ii) The employee is not a national of a country to which exports
are prohibited pursuant to &#167; 126.1 of this subchapter; and
   (iii) The institution informs the individual in writing that the
technical data may not be transferred to other foreign persons without
the prior written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls;
   (11) Technical data, including classified information, for which
the exporter, pursuant to an arrangement with the Department of
Defense, Department of Energy or NASA which requires such exports, has
been granted an exemption in writing from the licensing provisions of
this part by the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Such an exemption
will normally be granted only if the arrangement directly implements
an international agreement to which the United States is a party and
if multiple exports are contemplated. The Office of Defense Trade
Controls, in consultation with the relevant U.S. Government agencies,
will determine whether the interests of the United States Government
are best served by expediting exports under an arrangement through an
exemption (see also paragraph (b)(3) of this section for a related
exemption);
   (12) Technical data which is specifically exempt under part 126 of
this subchapter; or
   (13) Technical data approved for public release (i.e., unlimited
distribution) by the cognizant U.S. Government department or agency or
Directorate for Freedom of Information and Security Review. This
exemption is applicable to information approved by the cognizant
U.S. Government department or agency for public release in any
form. It does not require that the information be published in order
to qualify for the exemption.
  &#167; 125.5 -- Exemptions for plant visits.
   (a) A license is not required for the oral and visual disclosure of
unclassified technical data during the course of a classified plant
visit by a foreign person, provided (1) the classified visit has
itself been authorized pursuant to a license issued by the Office of
Defense Trade Controls; or (2) the classified visit was approved in
connection with an actual or potential government-to-government
program or project by a U.S. Government agency having classification
jurisdiction over the classified defense article or classified
technical data involved under Executive Order 12356 or other
applicable Executive Order; and (3) the unclassified information to be
released is directly related to the classified defense article or
technical data for which approval was obtained and does not disclose
the details of the design, development, production or manufacture of
any other defense articles. In the case of visits involving classified
information, the requirements of the Defense Industrial Security
Manual (Department of Defense Manual 5220.22M) must be met.
   (b) The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls is not
required for the disclosure of oral and visual classified information
to a foreign person during the course of a plant visit approved by the
appropriate U.S. Government agency if (1) the requirements of the
Defense Industrial Security Manual have been met, (2) the classified
information is directly related to that which was approved by the
U.S. Government agency, (3) it does not exceed that for which approval
was obtained, and (4) it does not disclose the details of the design,
development, production or manufacture of any defense articles.
   (c) A license is not required for the disclosure to a foreign
person of unclassified technical data during the course of a plant
visit (either classified or unclassified) approved by the Office of
Defense Trade Controls or a cognizant U.S. Government agency provided
the technical data does not contain information in excess of that
approved for disclosure. This exemption does not apply to technical
data which could be used for design, development, production or
manufacture of a defense article.
  &#167; 125.6 -- Certification requirements for exemptions.
   (a) To claim an exemption for the export of technical data under
the provisions of &#167;&#167; 125.4 and 125.5, an exporter must
certify that the proposed export is covered by a relevant paragraph of
that section. For &#167; 125.4, certification consists of marking the
package or letter containing the technical data: "22 CFR 125.4
(identify subsection) applicable." This certification must be made in
written form and retained in the exporter's files for a period of five
years. A Shippers Export Declaration is not required for [*39312]
exports of unclassified technical data (see &#167; 123.22 (d) of this
subchapter.
   (b) If a District Director of Customs or Postmaster is unavailable
at the time of export, or if the export is via oral, visual, or
electronic means, the exporter must also complete a written
certification as indicated in paragraph (a) of this section.
  &#167; 125.7 -- Procedures for the export of classified technical
data and other classified defense articles.
   (a) All applications for the export or temporary import of

   (b) If a license for the export of unclassified technical data is
used but not endorsed by U.S. Customs or a Postmaster for whatever
reason (e.g., electronic transmission, unavailability of Customs
officer or Postmaster, etc.), the person exporting the data must
self-endorse the license, showing when and how the export took
place. Every license must be returned to the Office of Defense Trade
Controls when the total value authorized has been shipped or when the

Pub. L. 90- 629, 90 Stat. 744 (22 U.S.C. 2752, 2778, 2780, and 2791,
and 2797); E.O. 11958, 42 FR 4311, E.O. 11322, 32 FR 119; 22
U.S.C. 2658.
  &#167; 126.1 -- Prohibited exports and sales to certain countries.
   (a) It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses, other
approvals, exports and imports of defense articles and defense
services, destined for or originating in certain countries. This
policy applies to: Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Byelarus,
Cambodia, Cuba, Estonia, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Mongolia, North Korea,
Romania, Russia, South Africa, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,
Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. This policy also applies to countries
with respect to which the United States maintains an arms embargo
(e.g., Burma, China, Liberia, Somalia, the Sudan, the former
Yugoslavia, and Zaire) or for whenever an export would not otherwise
be in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy
of the United States. Comprehensive arms embargoes are normally the
subject of a State Department notice published in the Federal
Register. The exemptions provided in the regulations in this
subchapter, except &#167;&#167; 123.17 and 125.4(b)(13) of this
subchapter, do not apply with respect to articles originating in or
for export to any proscribed countries or areas.
   (b) Shipments. A defense article licensed for export under this
subchapter may not be shipped on a vessel, aircraft or other means of
conveyance which is owned or operated by, or leased to or from, any of
the proscribed countries or areas.
   (c) South Africa. South Africa is subject to an arms embargo and
thus to the policy specified in paragraph (a) of this
section. Exceptions may be made to this policy only if the Assistant
Secretary for Politico-Military Affairs determines that:
   (1) The item is not covered by United Nations Security Council
Resolution 418 of November 4, 1977; and
   (2) The item is to be exported solely for commercial purposes and
not for use by the armed forces, police, or other security forces of
South Africa or for any other similar purpose.
   (d) Terrorism. Exports to countries which the Secretary of State
has determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of
international terrorism are contrary to the foreign policy of the
United States and are thus subject to the policy specified in
paragraph (a) of this section and the requirements of section 40 of
the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2780) and the Omnibus
Diplomatic Security and Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986 (22 U.S.C. 4801,
note). The countries in this category are: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya,
North Korea and Syria. The same countries are identified pursuant to
section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act, as amended (50
U.S.C. App. 2405(j)).
   (e) Proposed sales. No sale or transfer and no proposal to sell or
transfer any defense articles, defense services or technical data
subject to this subchapter may be made to any country referred to in
this section (including the embassies or consulates of such a
country), or to any person acting on its behalf, whether in the United
States or abroad, without first obtaining a license or written
approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls. However, in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, it is the policy of the
Department of State to deny licenses and approvals in such cases. Any
person who knows or has reason to know of such a proposed or actual
sale, or transfer, of such articles, services or data must immediately
[*39313] inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls.
  &#167; 126.2 -- Temporary suspension or modification of this
subchapter.
   The Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, may order the
temporary suspension or modification of any or all of the regulations
of this subchapter in the interest of the security and foreign policy
of the United States.
  &#167; 126.3 -- Exceptions.
   In a case of exceptional or undue hardship, or when it is otherwise
in the interest of the United States Government, the Director, Office
of Defense Trade Controls may make an exception to the provisions of
this subchapter.
  &#167; 126.4 -- Shipments by or for United States Government
agencies.
   (a) A license is not required for the temporary import, or
temporary export, of any defense article, including technical data or
the performance of a defense service, by or for any agency of the
U.S. Government (1) for official use by such an agency, or (2) for
carrying out any foreign assistance, cooperative project or sales
program authorized by law and subject to control by the President by
other means. This exemption applies only when all aspects of a
transaction (export, carriage, and delivery abroad) are effected by a
United States Government agency or when the export is covered by a
United States Government Bill of Lading. This exemption, however, does
not apply when a U.S.  Government agency acts as a transmittal agent
on behalf of a private individual or firm, either as a convenience or
in satisfaction of security requirements.  The approval of the Office
of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained before defense articles
previously exported pursuant to this exemption are permanently
transferred (e.g., property disposal of surplus defense articles
overseas) unless (i) the transfer is pursuant to a grant, sale, lease,
loan or cooperative project under the Arms Export Control Act or a
sale, lease or loan under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as
amended, or (ii) the defense articles have been rendered useless for
military purposes beyond the possibility of restoration.
   Note: Special definition. For purposes of this section, defense
articles exported abroad for incorporation into a foreign launch
vehicle or for use on a foreign launch vehicle or satellite that is to
be launched from a foreign country shall be considered a permanent
export.
   (b) This section does not authorize any department or agency of the
U.S.  Government to make any export which is otherwise prohibited by
virtue of other administrative provisions or by any statute.
   (c) A license is not required for the temporary import, or
temporary or permanent export, of any classified or unclassified
defense articles, including technical data or the performance of a
defense service, for end-use by a U.S.  Government Agency in a foreign
country under the following circumstances:
   (1) The export or temporary import is pursuant to a contract with,
or written direction by, an agency of the U.S. Government; and
   (2) The end-user in the foreign country is a U.S. Government agency
or facility, and the defense articles or technical data will not be
transferred to any foreign person; and
   (3) The urgency of the U.S. Government requirement is such that the
appropriate export license or U.S. Government Bill of Lading could not
have been obtained in a timely manner.
   (d) A Shipper's Export Declaration (SED), required under &#167;
123.22(c) of this subchapter, and a written statement by the exporter
certifying that these requirements have been met must be presented at
the time of export to the appropriate District Director of Customs or
Department of Defense transmittal authority. A copy of the SED and the
written certification statement shall be provided to the Office of
Defense Trade Controls immediately following the export.
  &#167; 126.5 -- Canadian exemptions.
   (a) District Directors of Customs and postmasters shall permit the
export or temporary import without a license of any unclassified
defense article or any unclassified technical data to Canada for
end-use in Canada by Canadian citizens or return to the United States,
or from Canada for end-use in the United States or return to a
Canadian citizen in Canada, with the exception of the articles or
related technical data listed in paragraph (b) of this section.
   (b) Exceptions. The exemptions of this section do not apply to the
following articles and related technical data:
   (1) Fully automatic firearms in Category I(a) which are not for
end-use by the Federal Government, or a Provincial or Municipal
Government of Canada;
   (2) Nuclear weapons strategic delivery systems and all components,
parts, accessories, attachments specifically designed for such systems
and associated equipment;
   (3) Nuclear weapon design and test equipment listed in Category
XVI;
   (4) Naval nuclear propulsion equipment listed in Category VI(e);
   (5) Aircraft listed in Category VIII(a);
   (6) Submersible and oceanographic vessels and related articles
listed in Category XX (a) through (d).
   (7) Technical data for use by a foreign national other than a
Canadian.
   (8) Unclassified technical data directly related to a classified
defense article.
   (c) Related requirements. The foregoing exemption from obtaining an
export license does not exempt an exporter from complying with the
requirements set forth in &#167; 123.15 of this subchapter or from
filing the Shipper's Export Declaration required by &#167; 123.22 of
this subchapter.
   (d) Part 124 agreements. The requirements of part 124 of this
subchapter must be complied with in the situations contemplated in
that part. For example, the except pursuant to an approved
manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement.
  &#167; 126.6 -- Foreign-owned military aircraft and naval vessels,
and the Foreign Military Sales program.
   (a) A license from the Office of Defense Trade Controls is not
required if:
   (1)(i) The article or technical data to be exported was sold,
leased, or loaned by the Department of Defense to a foreign country or
international organization pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act or
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and
   (ii) The article or technical data was delivered to representatives

   (b) Foreign military aircraft and naval vessels. A license is not
required for the entry into the United States of military aircraft or
naval vessels of any foreign state if no overhaul, repair, or
modification of the aircraft or naval vessel is to be
performed. However, Department of State approval for overflight
(pursuant to the 49 U.S.C. 1508) and naval visits must be obtained
from the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, Office of International
Security Operations.
   (c) Procedures for the Foreign Military Sales Program. (1) District
Directors of Customs are authorized to permit the [*39314] export and
temporary import of classified and unclassified defense articles,
defense services and technical data without a license if the articles
or technical data were sold, leased or loaned by the U.S. Department
of Defense to foreign governments or international organizations under
the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program of the Arms Export Control
Act. This procedure may be used only if a proposed export is:
   (i) Pursuant to an executed U.S. Department of Defense Letter of
Offer and Acceptance (DD Form 1513); and
   (ii) Accompanied by a properly executed DSP-94, or in the case of a
classified shipment, an approved Letter of Offer and Acceptance; and
   (iii) Made by the relevant foreign diplomatic mission of the
purchasing country or its authorized freight forwarder, provided that

defense articles or technical data are involved, has the requisite
U.S. Government security clearance and a transportation plan has been
approved as in &#167; 126.6(a)(1), above and the defense articles or
technical data are shipped in compliance with the Department of
Defense Industrial Security Manual.
   (2) Filing and documents. corresponding authenticated DD Form 1513
and a Shipper's Export Declaration, must be filed with the District
Director of Customs at the port of exit prior to actual shipment. An
executed DD Form 1513 is one which has been signed by:
   (A) an authorized Department of Defense representative and

   (ii) SED or Outbound Manifest. The Shipper's Export Declaration or,
if authorized, the outbound manifest, must be annotated as follows:

of State Form DSP-94. It covers FMS Case (case identification),
expiration date __________. 22 CFR 126.6 applicable. The
U.S. Government point of contact is __________, telephone number
__________.
  &#167; 126.7 -- Denial, revocation, suspension, or amendment of
licenses and other approvals.
   (a) Policy. Licenses or approvals shall be denied or revoked
whenever required by any statute of the United States (see
&#167;&#167; 127.6 and 127.10 of this subchapter). Any application for
an export license or other approval under this subchapter may be
disapproved, and any license or other approval or exemption granted
under this subchapter may be revoked, suspended, or amended without

United States, or is otherwise advisable; or
   (2) The Department of State believes that 22 U.S.C. 2778, any
regulation contained in this subchapter, or the terms of any

authorization granted pursuant to the Export Administration Act, as
amended) has been violated by any party to the export or other person
having significant interest in the transaction; or
   (3) An applicant is the subject of an indictment for a violation of
any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in &#167; 120.27 of this
subchapter; or
   (4) An applicant or any party to the export or the agreement has
been convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes
enumerated in &#167; 120.27 of this subchapter; or
   (5) An applicant is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a

or manufacturer of the defense article or defense service or any
person who has a significant interest in the transaction has been
debarred, suspended, or otherwise is ineligible to receive an export

documentation expressly required to support a license application or
other request for approval under this subchapter or as required in the
instructions in the applicable Department of State form; or

actions taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. The reasons
for the action will be stated as specifically as security and foreign
policy considerations permit.
   (c) Reconsideration. If a written request for reconsideration of an
adverse decision is made within 30 days after a person has been
informed of the decision, the U.S. person will be accorded an
opportunity to present additional information. The case will then be
reviewed by the Office of Defense Trade Controls.
   (d) Reconsideration of certain applications. Applications for
licenses or other requests for approval denied for repeated failure to
provide information or documentation expressly required will normally
not be reconsidered during the thirty day period following
denial. They will be reconsidered after this period only after a final
decision is made on whether the applicant will be subject to an
administrative penalty imposed pursuant to this subchapter. Any
request for reconsideration shall be accompanied by a letter
explaining the steps that have been taken to correct the failure and
to ensure compliance with the requirements of this subchapter.
   (e) Special definition. For purposes of this section, the term
party to the export means:

   (2) The freight forwarders or designated exporting agent of the
applicant; and
   (3) Any consignee or end-user of any item to be exported.
  &#167; 126.8 -- Proposals to foreign persons relating to significant
military equipment.
   (a) Certain proposals to foreign persons for the sale or
manufacture abroad of significant military equipment require either
the prior approval of, or prior notification to, the Office of Defense
Trade Controls.
   (1) Sale of significant military equipment: Prior approval
requirement. The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls is
required before a U.S.  person may make a proposal or presentation
designed to constitute a basis for a decision on the part of any
foreign person to purchase significant [*39315] military equipment on
the U.S. Munitions List whenever all the following conditions are met:
   (i) The value of the significant military equipment to be sold is $
14,000,000 or more; and
   (ii) The equipment is intended for use by the armed forces of any
foreign country other than a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, Australia, New Zealand, or Japan; and
   (iii) The sale would involve the export from the United States of
any defense article or the furnishing abroad of any defense service
including technical data; and
   (iv) The identical significant military equipment has not been
previously licensed for permanent export or approved for sale under
the Foreign Military Sales Program of the Department of Defense, to
any foreign country.
   (2) Sale of significant military equipment: Prior notification
requirement.  The Office Defense Trade Controls must be notified in
writing at least thirty days in advance of any proposal or
presentation concerning the sale of significant military equipment
whenever the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through
(iii) of this section are met and the identical equipment has been
previously licensed for permanent export or approved for sale under
the FMS Program to any foreign country.
   (3) Manufacture abroad of significant military equipment: Prior
approval requirement. The approval of the Office of Defense Trade
Controls is required before a U.S. person may make a proposal or
presentation designed to constitute a basis for a decision on the part
of any foreign person to enter into any manufacturing license
agreement or technical assistance agreement for the production or
assembly of significant military equipment, regardless of dollar
value, in any foreign country, whenever:
   (i) The equipment is intended for use by the armed forces of any
foreign country; and
   (ii) The agreement would involve the export from the United States
of any defense article or the furnishing abroad of any defense service
including technical data.
   (b) Definition of proposal or presentation. The terms proposal or
presentation (designed to constitute a basis for a decision to
purchase and to enter into any agreement) mean the communication of
information in sufficient detail that the person communicating that
information knows or should know that it would permit an intended
purchaser to decide either to acquire the particular equipment in
question or to enter into the manufacturing license agreement or
technical assistance agreement. For example, a presentation which
describes the equipment's performance characteristics, price, and
probable availability for delivery would require prior notification or
approval, as appropriate, where the conditions specified in paragraph
(a) of this section are met. By contrast, the following would not
require prior notification or approval: Advertising or other reporting
in a publication of general circulation; preliminary discussions to
ascertain market potential; or merely calling attention to the fact
that a company manufactures a particular item of significant military
equipment.
   (c) Satisfaction of requirements. (1) The requirement of this
section for prior approval is met by any of the following:
   (i) A written statement from the Office of Defense Trade Controls
approving the proposed sale or agreement or approving the making of a
proposal or presentation.
   (ii) A license issued under &#167; 125.2 or &#167; 125.3 of this
subchapter for the export of technical data relating to the proposed
sale or agreement to the country concerned.
   (iii) A temporary export license issued under &#167; 123.5 of this
subchapter relating to the proposed sale or agreement for a
demonstration to the armed forces of the country of export.
   (iv) With respect to manufacturing license agreements or technical
assistance agreements, the application for export licenses pursuant to
the two preceding subparagraphs must state that they are related to
possible agreements of this kind.
   (2) The requirement of this section for prior notification is met
by informing the Office of Defense Trade Controls by letter at least
30 days before making the proposal or presentation. The letter must
comply with the procedures set forth in paragraph (d) of this section
and must identify the relevant license, approval, or FMS case by which
the identical equipment had previously been authorized for permanent
export or sale. The Office of Defense Trade Controls will provide
written acknowledgement of such prior notification to confirm
compliance with this requirement and the commencement of the 30-day
notification period.
   (d) Procedures. Unless a license has been obtained pursuant to
&#167; 126.8(c)(1) (ii) or (iii), a request for prior approval to make
a proposal or presentation with respect to significant military
equipment, or a 30-day prior notification regarding the sale of such
equipment, must be made by letter to the Office of Defense Trade
Controls. The letter must outline in detail the intended transaction,
including usage of the equipment involved and the country (or
countries) involved. Seven copies of the letter should be provided as
well as seven copies of suitable descriptive information concerning
the equipment.
   (e) Statement to accompany licensing requests. (1) Every
application for an export license or other approval to implement a
sale or agreement which meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a)
of this section must be accompanied by a statement from the applicant
which either:
   (i) Refers to a specific notification made or approval previously
granted with respect to the transaction; or
   (ii) Certifies that no proposal or presentation requiring prior
notification or approval has been made.
   (2) The Department of State may require a similar statement from
the Foreign Military Sales contractor concerned in any case where the
United States Government receives a request for a letter of offer for
a sale which meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this
section.
   (f) Penalties. In addition to other remedies and penalties
prescribed by law or this subchapter, a failure to satisfy the prior
approval or prior notification requirements of this section may be
considered to be a reason for disapproval of a license, agreement or
sale under the FMS program.
   (g) License for technical data. Nothing in this section constitutes
or is to be construed as an exemption from the licensing requirement
for the export of technical data that is embodied in any proposal or
presentation made to any foreign persons.
  &#167; 126.9 -- Advisory opinions.
   Any person desiring information as to whether the Office of Defense
Trade Controls would be likely to grant a license or other approval
for the export of a particular defense article or defense service to a
particular country may request an advisory opinion from the Office of
Defense Trade Controls. These opinions are not binding on the
Department of State and are revocable. A request for an advisory
opinion must be made in writing and must outline in detail the
equipment, its usage, the security classification (if any) of the
articles or related technical data, and the country or countries
involved. An original and seven copies of the letter must be provided
along with seven copies of suitable descriptive information concerning
the defense article or defense service.  [*39316]
  &#167; 126.10 -- Disclosure of information.
   (a) Freedom of Information. Subchapter R of this title contains
regulations on the availability to the public of information and
records of the Department of State. The provisions of subchapter R
apply to such disclosures by the Office of Defense Trade Controls.
   (b) Determinations required by law. Section 38 of the Arms Export
Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) provides that certain information
required by the Department of State in connection with the licensing
process may generally not be disclosed to the public unless certain
determinations relating to the national interest are made in
accordance with the procedures specified by that provision.
Determinations required by section 38(e) shall be made by the
Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs.
   (c) Information required under part 130. Part 130 of this
subchapter contains specific provisions on the disclosure of
information described in that part.
   (d) National Interest Determinations. In accordance with section
38(e) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778(e)), the
Secretary of State has determined that the following disclosures are
in the national interest of the United States:
   (1) Furnishing information to foreign governments for law
enforcement or regulatory purposes; and
   (2) Furnishing information to foreign governments and other
agencies of the U.S. Government in the context of multilateral or
bilateral export regimes (e.g., the Missile Technology Control Regime,
the Australia Group, and CoCoM).
  &#167; 126.11 -- Relations to other provisions of law.
   The provisions in this subchapter are in addition to, and are not
in lieu of, any other provisions of law or regulations. The sale of
firearms in the United States, for example, remains subject to the
provisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968 and regulations administered
by the Department of the Treasury. The performance of defense services
on behalf of foreign governments by retired military personnel
continues to require consent pursuant to Part 3a of this
title. Persons who intend to export defense articles or furnish
defense services should consequently not assume that satisfying the
requirements of this subchapter relieves one of other requirements of
law.
  &#167; 126.12 -- Continuation in force.
   All determinations, authorizations, licenses, approvals of
contracts and agreements and other action issued, authorized,
undertaken, or entered into by the Department of State pursuant to
section 414 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, or under
the previous provisions of this subchapter, continue in full force and
effect until or unless modified, revoked or superseded by the
Department of State.
  &#167; 126.13 -- Required information.
   (a) All applications for licenses (DSP-5, DSP-61, DSP-73, and
DSP-85), all requests for approval of agreements and amendments
thereto under part 124 of this subchapter, all requests for other
written authorizations, and all 30-day prior notifications of sales of
significant military equipment under &#167; 126.8(c) must include a
letter signed by a responsible official empowered by the applicant and
addressed to the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, stating
whether:
   (1) The applicant or the chief executive officer, president,
vice-presidents, other senior officers or officials (e.g.,
comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) or any member of the board of
directors is the subject of an indictment for or has been convicted of
violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in &#167;
120.27 of this subchapter since the effective date of the Arms Export
Control Act, Public Law 94-329, 90 Stat. 729 (June 30, 1976);
   (2) The applicant or the chief executive officer, president,
vice-presidents, other senior officers or officials (e.g.,
comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) or any member of the board of
directors is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or
other approval to import defense articles or defense services from, or
to receive an export license or other approval from, any agency of the
U.S. Government;
   (3) To the best of the applicant's knowledge, any party to the
export as defined in &#167; 126.7(e) has been convicted of violating
any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in &#167; 120.27 of this
subchapter since the effective date of the Arms Export Control Act,
Public Law 94-329, 90 Stat. 729 (June 30, 1976), or is ineligible to
contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to import
defense articles or defense services from, or to receive an export
license or other approval from any agency of the U.S. government; and
   (4) The natural person signing the application, notification or
other request for approval (including the statement required by this
subsection) is a citizen or national of the United States, has been
lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence (and
maintains such a residence) under the Immigration and Nationality Act,
as amended (8 U.S.C. 1101(a), section 101(a)20, 60 Stat. 163), or is
an official of a foreign government entity in the United States.
   (b) In addition, all applications for licenses must include, on the
application or an addendum sheet, the complete names and addresses of
all U.S.  consignors and freight forwarders, and all foreign
consignees and foreign intermediate consignees involved in the
transaction. If there are multiple consignors, consignees or freight
forwarders, and all the required information cannot be included on the
application form, an addendum sheet and seven copies containing this
information must be provided. The addendum sheet must be marked at the
top as follows: "Attachment to Department of State License From
(insert DSP-5, 61, 73, or 85, as appropriate) for Export of (insert
commodity) valued at (insert U.S. dollar amount) to (insert country of
ultimate destination)." The Office of Defense Trade Controls will
impress one copy of the addendum sheet with the Department of State
seal and return it to the applicant with each license. The sealed
addendum sheet must remain attached to the license as an integral part
thereof. District Directors of Customs and Department of Defense
transmittal authorities will permit only those U.S. consignors or
freight forwarders listed on the license or sealed addendum sheet to
make shipments under the license, and only to those foreign consignees
named on the documents.  Applicants should list all freight forwarders
who may be involved with shipments under the license to ensure that
the list is complete and to avoid the need for amendments to the list
after the license has been approved. If there are unusual or
extraordinary circumstances that preclude the specific identification
of all the U.S. consignors and freight forwarders and all foreign
consignees, the applicant must provide a letter of explanation with
each application.
   (c) In cases when foreign nationals are employed at or assigned to
security- cleared facilities, provision by the applicant of a
Technology Control Plan (available from the Defense Investigative
Service) will facilitate processing.

  &#167; 127.1 -- Violations.
   (a) It is unlawful:
   (1) To export or attempt to export from the United States any
defense article or technical data or to furnish any defense service
for which a license or written approval is required by this subchapter
without first obtaining the required license or written approval from
the Office of Defense Trade Controls;
   (2) To import or attempt to import any defense article whenever a
license is required by this subchapter without first obtaining the
required license or written approval from the Office of Defense Trade

this subchapter is responsible for the acts of employees, agents, and
all authorized persons to whom possession of the licensed defense
article or technical data has been entrusted regarding the operation,
use, possession, transportation, and handling of such defense article
or technical data abroad. All persons abroad subject to
U.S. jurisdiction who obtain temporary custody of a defense article
exported from the United States or produced under an agreement
described in part 124 of this subchapter, and irrespective of the
number of intermediate transfers, are bound by the regulations of this
subchapter in the same manner and to the same extent as the original
owner or transferer.
   (c) A person with knowledge that another person is then ineligible
pursuant to &#167;&#167; 120.1(c) of this subchapter or 126.7 of this
chapter, is then subject to an order of debarment, or interim
suspension, may not, directly or indirectly, in any manner or
capacity, without prior disclosure of the facts to, and written
authorization from, the Office of Defense Trade Controls:
   (1) Apply for, obtain, or use any export control document as
defined in &#167; 127.2(b) for such debarred, suspended, or ineligible
person; or
   (2) Order, buy, receive, use, sell, deliver, store, dispose of,
forward, transport, finance, or otherwise service or participate in
any transaction which may involve any defense article or the
furnishing of any defense service for which a license or approval is

suspended, or ineligible person may obtain any benefit therefrom or
have any direct or indirect interest therein.
   (d) No person may willfully cause, or aid, abet, counsel, demand,
induce, procure or permit the commission of any act prohibited by, or
the omission of any act required by 22 U.S.C. 2778, 22 U.S.C. 2779, or
any regulation, license, approval, or order issued thereunder.
  &#167; 127.2 -- Misrepresentation and omission of facts.
   (a) It is unlawful to use any export or temporary import control
document containing a false statement or misrepresenting or omitting a
material fact for the purpose of exporting any defense article or
technical data or the furnishing of any defense service for which a
license or approval is required by this subchapter. Any false
statement, misrepresentation, or omission of material fact in an
export or temporary import control document will be considered as made
in a matter within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the
United States for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. 1001, 22 U.S.C. 2778 and
22 U.S.C. 2779.
   (b) For the purpose of this section, export or temporary import

license and supporting documents.
   (2) Shipper's Export Declaration.
   (3) Invoice.
   (4) Declaration of destination.
   (5) Delivery verification.

   (9) Foreign import certificate.
   (10) Bill-of-lading.
   (11) Airway bill.
   (12) Nontransfer and use certificate.
   (13) Any other document used in the regulation or control of a
defense article, defense service or technical data for which a license
or approval is required by this subchapter.
  &#167; 127.3 -- Penalties for violations.
   Any person who willfully:
   (a) Violates any provision of section 38 or section 39 of the Arms
Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778 and 2779), or any undertaking
specifically required by part 124 of this subchapter; or
   (b) In a registration, license application or report required by
section 38 or section 39 of the Arms Export Control Act (22
U.S.C. 2278 and 2779) or by any rule or regulation issued under either
section, makes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, shall, upon conviction, be subject
to a fine or imprisonment, or both, as prescribed by 22 U.S.C.
2778(c).
  &#167; 127.4 -- Authority of U.S. Customs Service officers.
   (a) U.S. Customs Service officers may take appropriate action to
ensure observance of this subchapter as to the export or the attempted
export of any defense article or technical data, including the
inspection of loading or unloading of any vessel, vehicle, or
aircraft. This applies whether the export is authorized by license or
by written approval issued under this subchapter.
   (b) U.S. Customs Service officers have the authority to
investigate, detain or seize any export or attempted export of defense
articles or technical data contrary to this subchapter.
   (c) Upon the presentation to a Customs Officer of a license or
written approval authorizing the export of any defense article, the
customs officer may require the production of other relevant documents
and information relating to the proposed export. This includes an
invoice, order, packing list, shipping document, correspondence,
instructions, and the documents otherwise required by the U.S. Customs
Service.
  &#167; 127.5 -- Authority of the Defense Investigative Service.
   In the case of exports involving classified technical data or
defense articles, the Defense Investigative Service may take
appropriate action to ensure compliance with the Department of Defense
Industrial Security Manual.  Upon a request to the Defense
Investigative Service regarding the export of any classified defense
article or technical data, the Defense [*39318] Investigative Service
official or a designated government transmittal authority may require
the production of other relevant documents and information relating to
the proposed export.
  &#167; 127.6 Seizure and forfeiture in attempts at illegal exports.
   (a) An attempt to export from the United States any defense
articles in violation of the provisions of this subchapter constitutes
an offense punishable under section 401 of title 22 of the United
States Code. Whenever it is known or there is probable cause to
believe that any defense article is intended to be or is being or has
been exported or removed from the United States in violation of law,
such article and any vessel, vehicle or aircraft involved in such
attempt is subject to seizure, forfeiture and disposition as provided
in section 401 of title 22 of the United States Code.
   (b) Similarly, an attempt to violate any of the conditions under
which a temporary export or temporary import license was issued
pursuant to this subchapter or to violate the requirements of &#167;
123.2 of this subchapter also constitutes an offense punishable under
section 401 of Title 22 of the United States Code, and such article,
together with any vessel, vehicle or aircraft involved in any such
attempt is subject to seizure, forfeiture, and disposition as provided
in section 401 of title 22 of the United States Code.
  &#167; 127.7 -- Debarment.
   (a) In implementing section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, the
Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs may
prohibit any person from participating directly or indirectly in the
export of defense articles, including technical data or in the
furnishing of defense services for which a license or approval is
required by this subchapter for any of the reasons listed below. Any
such prohibition is referred to as a debarment for purposes of this
subchapter. The Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military
Affairs shall determine the appropriate period of time for debarment,
which shall generally be for a period of three years.
   (b) Grounds. (1) The basis for a statutory debarment, as described
in paragraph (c) of this section, is any conviction for violating the
Arms Export Control Act (see &#167; 127.3 of this subchapter) or any
conspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act.
   (2) The basis for administrative debarment, described in part 128
of this subchapter, is any violation of 22 U.S.C. 2778 or any rule or
regulation issued thereunder when such a violation is of such a
character as to provide a reasonable basis for the Office of Defense
Trade Controls to believe that the violator cannot be relied upon to
comply with the statute or these rules or regulations in the future,
and when such violation is established in accordance with part 128 of
this subchapter.
   (c) Statutory Debarment. Section 38(g)(4) of the Arms Export
Control Act prohibits the issuance of licenses to persons who have
been convicted of violating the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in
&#167; 120.27 of this subchapter.  Discretionary authority to issue
licenses is provided, but only if certain statutory requirements are
met. It is the policy of the Department of State not to consider
applications for licenses or requests for approvals involving any
person who has been convicted of violating the Arms Export Control Act
or convicted of conspiracy to violate that Act for a three year period
following pursuant to this policy. A list of persons who have been
convicted of such offenses and debarred for this reason shall be
published periodically in the Federal Register. Debarment in such
cases is based solely upon the outcome of a criminal proceeding,
conducted by a court of the United States, that established guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt in accordance with due process. The
procedures of part 128 of this subchapter are not applicable in such
cases.
   (d) Appeals. Any person who is ineligible pursuant to paragraph (c)
of this section may appeal to the Under Secretary of State for
International Security Affairs for reconsideration of the
ineligibility determination. The procedures specified in &#167; 128.13
of this subchapter are applicable in such appeals.
  &#167; 127.8 -- Interim suspension.
   (a) The Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls is
authorized to order the interim suspension of any person when the
Director believes that grounds for debarment (as defined in &#167;
127.6 of this part) exist and where and to the extent the Director
finds that interim suspension is reasonably necessary to protect world
peace or the security or foreign policy of the United States.  The
interim suspension orders prohibit that person from participating
directly or indirectly in the export of any defense article or defense
service for which a license or approval is required by this
subchapter. The suspended person shall be notified in writing as
provided in &#167; 127.6(c) of this part (statutory debarment) or
&#167; 128.3 of this subchapter (administrative debarment), whichever
is appropriate. In both cases, a copy of the interim suspension order
will be served upon that person in the same manner as provided in
&#167; 128.3 of this subchapter. The interim suspension order may be
made immediately effective, without prior notice. The order will state
the relevant facts, the grounds for issuance of the order, and
describe the nature and duration of the interim suspension. No person
may be suspended for a period exceeding 60 days unless proceedings
under &#167; 127.6(c) of this part or under part 128 of this
subchapter, or criminal proceedings, are initiated before the
expiration of that period.
   (b) A motion or petition to vacate or modify an interim suspension
order may be filed at any time with the Under Secretary of State for
International Security Affairs. After a final decision is reached, the
Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls will issue an
appropriate order disposing of the motion or petition and will
promptly inform the respondent accordingly.
  &#167; 127.9 -- Applicability of orders.
   For the purpose of preventing evasion, orders of the Assistant
Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs, debarring a person
under &#167; 127.6 and orders of the Director, Office of Defense Trade
Controls, suspending a person under &#167; 127.7 may be made
applicable to any other person who may then or thereafter (during the
term of the order) be related to the debarred person by affiliation,
ownership, control, position of responsibility, or other commercial
connection.  Appropriate notice and opportunity to respond to charges
will be given.
  &#167; 127.10 -- Civil penalty.
   (a) The Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs,
Department of State, is authorized to impose a civil penalty in an
amount not to exceed that authorized by 50 U.S.C. App. 2410(c) for
each violation of 22 U.S.C.  2778, or any regulation, order, license
or approval issued thereunder. This civil penalty may be either in
addition to, or in lieu of, any other liability or penalty which may
be imposed.
   (b) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may make:
   (1) The payment of a civil penalty under this section or
   (2) The completion of any administrative action pursuant to this
part 127 or 128 of this subchapter a prior condition for the issuance,
restoration, or continuing validity of any export license or other
approval.  [*39319]
  &#167; 127.11 -- Past violations.
   (a) Pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, licenses
or other approvals may not be granted to persons who have been
convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in
&#167; 120.27 of this subchapter or who are ineligible to receive any
export licenses from any agency of the U.S.  government, subject to a
narrowly defined statutory exception. This provision establishes a
presumption of denial for licenses or other approvals involving such
persons. This presumption is applied by the Office of Defense Trade
Controls to all persons convicted or deemed ineligible in this manner
since the effective date of the Arms Export Control Act
(Pub. L. 94-329; 90 Stat. 729) (June 30, 1976).
   (b) Policy. An exception to the policy of the Department of State
to deny applications for licenses or other approvals that involve
persons described in paragraph (a) of this section shall not be
considered unless there are extraordinary circumstances surrounding
the conviction or ineligibility to export, and only if the applicant
demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Bureau of Politico-Military
Affairs, that the applicant has taken appropriate steps to mitigate
any law enforcement and other legitimate concerns, and to deal with
the causes that resulted in the conviction, ineligibility, or
debarment.  Any person described in paragraph (a) of this section who
wishes to request consideration of any application must explain, in a
letter to the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, the reasons
why the application should be considered. If the Bureau of
Politico-Military Affairs concludes that the application and written
explanation have sufficient merit, it shall consult with the Office of
the Legal Adviser and the Department of the Treasury regarding law
enforcement concerns, and may also request the views of other
departments, including the Department of Justice. If the Office of
Defense Trade Controls does grant the license or other approval,
subsequent applications from the same person need not repeat the
information previously provided but should instead refer to the
favorable decision.
   (c) Debarred persons. Persons debarred pursuant to &#167; 127.6(c)
(statutory debarment) may not utilize the procedures provided by this
section while the debarment is in force. Such persons may utilize only
the procedures provided by &#167; 127.7(d) of this part.
  &#167; 127.12 -- Voluntary Disclosures.
   (a) General policy. The Department strongly encourages the
disclosure of information to the Office of Defense Trade Controls by
persons, firms or any organization that believe they may have violated
any export control provision of the Arms Export Control Act, or any
regulations, order, license, or other authorization issued under the
Arms Export Control Act. Voluntary self- disclosure may be considered
a mitigating factor in determining the administrative penalties, if
any, that should be imposed by the Department.  Failure to report such
violation(s) may result in circumstances detrimental to U.S. national
security and foreign policy interests.
   (b) Limitations. (1) The provisions of this section apply only when
information is provided to the Office of Defense Trade Controls for
its review in determining whether to take administrative action under
part 128 of this subchapter concerning violation(s) of the export
control provisions of the Arms Export Control Act and these
regulations.
   (2) The provisions of this section apply only when information is
received by the Office of Defense Trade Controls for review prior to
such time that either the Department of State or any other agency,
bureau or department of the United States Government obtains knowledge
of either the same or substantially similar information from another
source and commenced an investigation or inquiry that involves that
information, and that is intended to determine whether the Arms Export
Control Act or these regulations, or any other license, order or other
authorization issued under the Arms Export Control Act has been
violated.
   (3) It is possible that the activity in question-despite voluntary
disclosure-might merit penalties, administrative actions, sanctions,
or referrals to the Department of Justice for consideration as to
whether criminal prosecution is warranted. In the latter case, the
Office of Defense Trade Controls will notify the Department of Justice
of the voluntary nature of the disclosure although the Department of
Justice is not required to give that fact any weight. The Office of
Defense Trade Controls has the sole discretion to consider whether
"voluntary disclosure," in context with other relevant information in
a particular case, should be a mitigating factor in determining what,
if any, administrative action will be imposed. Some of the mitigating
factors the Office of Defense Trade Controls may consider are:
   (i) Whether the transaction would have been authorized had proper
application been made;
   (ii) Why the violation(s) occurred;
   (iii) The degree of cooperation with the ensuing investigation;
   (iv) Whether the person or firm has instituted or improved an
internal compliance program to reduce the likelihood of future
violation(s);
   (v) Whether the person making the disclosure did so with the full
knowledge and authorization of the firm's senior management. (If not,
then a firm will not be deemed to have made a disclosure as covered in
this section.)
   (4) The provisions of this section do not, nor should they be
relied on, to create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits,
privileges, or protection enforceable at law or in equity by any
person, business, or entity in any civil, criminal, administrative, or
other matter.
   (c) Notification. (1) Any person or firm wanting to disclose
information that constitutes a voluntary self-disclosure should, in
the manner outlined below, initially notify the Office of Defense
Trade Controls as soon as possible after violation(s) are discovered
and then conduct a thorough review of all export- related transactions
where violation(s) are suspected.
   (2) Notification of violation(s) must be in writing and should
include the following information:
   (i) A precise description of the nature and extent of the
violation(s) (e.g., an unauthorized shipment, doing business with a
party denied U.S. export privileges, etc.);
   (ii) The exact circumstances surrounding the violation(s) (a
thorough explanation of why, when, where, and how the violation(s)
occurred);
   (iii) The complete identities and addresses of all individuals and
organizations, whether foreign or domestic, involved in the activities
giving rise to the violation(s);
   (iv) Export license numbers, if applicable;
   (v) U.S. Munitions List category and subcategory, product
descriptions, quantities, and characteristics of the commodities or
technical data involved;
   (vi) A description of any corrective actions already undertaken;
   (vii) The name and address of the person(s) making the disclosure
and a point of contact, if different, should further information be
needed.
   (3) Factors to be considered include, for example, whether the
violation(s) were intentional or inadvertent; the degree to which the
person or firm responsible for the violation(s) making the disclosure
was familiar with the [*39320] laws and regulations; and whether the
violator was the subject of prior administrative or criminal action
under the AECA. In addition to immediately providing written
notification, persons, firms, companies and organizations are strongly
urged to conduct a thorough review of all export- related transactions
where possible violation(s) are suspected.
   (d) Documentation. (1) The written disclosure should be accompanied
by copies of those documents that substantiate it. Where appropriate,
the documentation should include, but is not limited to:
   (i) Licensing documents (e.g., license applications, export
licenses and end- user statements);
   (ii) Shipping documents (e.g., shipper's export declarations,
airway bills and bills of lading);
   (iii) Any other relevant documents must be retained by the person
making the disclosure until the Office of Defense Trade Controls
requests them or until a final decision on the disclosed information
has been made.
   (e) Certification. A certification must be submitted stating that
all of the representations made in connection with the voluntary
self-disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person's
knowledge and belief. Certifications made by a firm, corporation or
any other organization should be executed by someone with the
authority to do so.
   (f) Oral presentations. It is generally not necessary to augment
the written presentation with an oral presentation. However, if the
person making the disclosure believes a meeting is desirable, a
request for one should be included with the written presentation.
   (g) Voluntary disclosures should be sent to:
   Compliance Analysis Division, PM/DTC, SA-6, room 200, Office of
Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs,
U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC 20522-0602.

  &#167; 128.1 -- Exclusion of functions from the Administrative
Procedure Act.
   The Arms Export Control Act authorizes the President to control the
import and export of defense articles and services in furtherance of
world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United
States. It authorizes the Secretary of State to make decisions on
whether licenses shall be granted, as well as to revoke, suspend or
amend licenses whenever the Secretary deems such action to be
advisable. The administration of the Arms Export Control Act is a
foreign affairs function and is thus encompassed within the meaning of
the military and foreign affairs exclusion of the Administrative
Procedure Act and is thereby expressly exempt from various provisions
of that Act. Because the exercising of the foreign affairs function,
including the decisions required to implement the Arms Export Control
Act, is highly discretionary, it is excluded from review under the
Administrative Procedure Act.
  &#167; 128.2 -- Presiding Official.
   The Presiding Official referred to in this part is the Presiding
Official of the International Trade Administration of the Department
of Commerce, as provided in 15 CFR 388.2. The Presiding Official is
authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties provided for
in &#167;&#167; 127.6, 127.7 of this subchapter and &#167;&#167; 128.3
through 128.16.
  &#167; 128.3 -- Institution of administrative proceedings.
   (a) Charging letters. The Director, Office of Munitions Control,
with the concurrence of the Office of the Legal Adviser, Department of
State, may initiate debarment proceedings in accordance with &#167;
127.6 of this subchapter or civil penalties in accordance with &#167;
127.9 of this subchapter. Administrative proceedings shall be
initiated by means of a charging letter. The charging letter will
state the essential facts constituting the alleged violation and refer
to the regulatory or other provisions involved. It will give notice
that if the respondent to answer the charges with 30 days, as provided
in &#167; 128.5(a), and indicate that a failure to answer will be
taken as an admission of the truth of the charges. It will inform the
respondent that he or she is entitled to an oral hearing if a written
demand for one is filed with the answer or within 7 days after service
of the answer. The respondent will also be informed that he or she
may, if so desired, be represented by counsel of his or her choosing.
Charging letters may be amended from time to time, upon reasonable
notice.
   (b) Service. A charging letter is served upon a respondent:
   (1) If the respondent is a resident of the United States, when it
is mailed postage prepaid in a wrapper addressed to the respondent at
his or her last known address; or when left with the respondent or the
agent or employee of the respondent; or when left at the respondent's
dwelling with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing
herein; or
   (2) If the respondent is a non-resident of the United States, when
served upon the respondent by any of the foregoing means. If such
methods of service are not practicable or appropriate, the charging
letter may be tendered for service on the respondent to an official of
the government of the country wherein the respondent resides, provided
that there is an agreement or understanding between the United States
Government and the government of the country wherein the respondent
resident permitting this action.
  &#167; 128.4 -- Default.
   (a) Failure to answer. If the respondent fails to answer the
charging letter, the respondent may be held in default. The case shall
then be referred to the Presiding Official for consideration in a
manner as the Presiding Official may consider appropriate. Any order
issued shall have the same effect as an order issued following the
disposition of contested charges.
   (b) Petition to set aside defaults. Upon showing good cause, any
respondent against whom a default order has been issued may apply to
set aside the default and vacate the order entered thereon. The
petition shall be submitted in duplicate to the Assistant Secretary
for Politico-Military Affairs, U.S.  Department of State, 2201 C
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20520. The Director will refer the
petition to the Presiding Official for consideration and a
recommendation. The Presiding Official will consider the application
and may order a hearing and require the respondent to submit further
evidence [*39321] in support of his or her petition. The filing of a
petition to set aside a default does not in any manner affect an order

   (a) When to answer. The respondent is required to answer the
charging letter within 30 days after service.
   (b) Contents of answer. An answer must be responsive to the
charging letter.  It must fully set forth the nature of the
respondent's defense or defenses. In the answer, the respondent must
admit or deny specifically each separate allegation of the charging
letter, unless the respondent is without knowledge, in which case the
respondent's answer shall so state and the statement shall operate as
a denial. Failure to deny or controvert any particular allegation will
be deemed an admission thereof. The answer may set forth such
additional or new matter as the respondent believes supports a defense
or claim of mitigation.  Any defense or partial defense not
specifically set forth in an answer shall be deemed waived. Evidence
offered thereon by the respondent at a hearing may be refused except
upon good cause being shown. If the respondent does not demand an oral
hearing, he or she shall transmit, within 7 days after the service of
his or her answer, original or photocopies of all correspondence,

20230. A copy shall be simultaneously mailed or delivered to the
Director, Office of Munitions Control, Department of State,
Washington, DC 20520.
  &#167; 128.6 -- Discovery.
   (a) Discovery by the respondent. The respondent, through the
Presiding Official, may request from the Office of Munitions Control
any relevant information, not privileged, that may be necessary or
helpful in preparing a defense. The Office of Munitions Control any
relevant information, not privileged, that may be necessary or helpful
in preparing a defense. The Office of Munitions Control may supply
summaries in place of original documents and may withhold information
from discovery if necessary to comply with any statute, executive
order or regulation requiring that the information not be disclosed.
The respondent may request the Presiding Officer to request any
relevant information, books, records, or other evidence, from any
other person or government agency so long as the request is reasonable
in scope and not unduly burdensome.
   (b) Discovery by the Office of Munitions Control. The Office of
Munitions Control or the Presiding Official may request from the
respondent admissions of facts, answers to interrogatories, the
production of books, records, or other relevant evidence, so long as
the request is relevant and material, reasonable in scope, and not
unduly burdensome.
   (c) Subpoenas. At the request of any party, the Presiding Official
may issue subpoenas, returnable before him, requiring the attendance
of witnesses and the production of books, records, and other
documentary or physical evidence determined by the Presiding Official
to be relevant and material to the proceedings, reasonable in scope,
and not unduly burdensome.
   (d) Enforcement of discovery rights. If the Office of Munitions
Control fails to provide the respondent with information in its
possession which is nototherwi
 available and which is necessary to the respondent's defense, the
Presiding Official may dismiss the charges on her or his own motion or

reasonable diligence to the requests for discovery by the Office of
Munitions Control or the Presiding Official, on her or his own motion
or motion of the Office of Munitions Control, and upon such notice to
the respondent as the Presiding Official may direct, may strike
respondent's answer and declare the respondent in default, or make any
other ruling which the Presiding Official deems necessary and just
under the circumstances. If a third party fails to respond to the
request for information, the Presiding Official shall consider whether
the evidence sought is necessary to a fair hearing, and if it is so
necessary that a fair hearing may not be held without it, the
Presiding Official shall dismiss the charges.
  &#167; 128.7 -- Prehearing conference.
   (a) The Presiding Official may, upon his own motion or upon motion
of any party, request the parties or their counsel to a prehearing
conference to consider (1) simplification of issues; (2) the necessity
or desirability of amendments to pleadings; (3) obtaining stipulations
of fact and of documents to avoid unnecessary proof; or (4) such other
matter as may expedite the disposition of the proceeding. The
Presiding Official will prepare a summary of the action agreed upon or
taken at the conference, and will incorporate therein any written
stipulations or agreements made by the parties. The conference
proceedings may be recorded magnetically or taken by a reporter and
transcribed, and filed with the Presiding Official.
   (b) If a conference is impracticable, the Presiding Official may
request the parties to correspond with him or her to achieve the
purposes of a conference.  The Presiding Official shall prepare a
summary of action taken as in the case of a conference.
  &#167; 128.8 -- Hearings.
   (a) A respondent who had not filed a timely written answer is not
entitled to a hearing, and the case may be considered by the Presiding
Official as provided in &#167; 128.4(a). If any answer is filed, but
no oral hearing demanded, the Presiding Official may proceed to
consider the case upon the written pleadings and evidence
available. The Presiding Official may provide for the making of the
record in such manner as the Presiding Official deems appropriate. If
respondent answers and demands an oral hearing, the Presiding
Official, upon due notice, shall set the case for hearing, unless a
respondent has raised in his answer no issues of material fact to be
determined. If respondent fails to appear at a scheduled hearing, the
hearing nevertheless may proceed in respondent's absence.  The
respondent's failure to appear will not affect the validity of the
hearing or any proceedings or action thereafter.
   (b) The Presiding Official may administer oaths and
affirmations. Respondent may be represented by counsel. Unless
otherwise agreed by the parties and the Presiding Official, the
proceeding will be taken by a reporter or by magnetic recording,
transcribed, and filed with the Presiding Official. Respondent may

prepare a written report. The report will include findings of fact,
findings of law, a finding whether a law or regulation has been
violated, and the Presiding Official's recommendations. It shall be
transmitted to the Assistant Secretary for Politico-Military Affairs,
Department of State.
  &#167; 128.10 -- Disposition of proceedings.
   Where the evidence is not sufficient to support the charges, the
Director, Office of Munitions Control or the Presiding Official will
dismiss the charges.  Where the Presiding Official finds that a
violation has been committed, the Presiding Official's recommendation
shall be advisory only. The Assistant Secretary for Politico-Military
Affairs will review the record, consider the report of the Presiding
Official, and make an appropriate disposition of the case. The
Director may issue an order debarring the respondent from
participating in the export of defense articles or technical data or
the furnishing of defense services as provided in &#167; 127.6 of this
subchapter, impose a civil penalty as provided in &#167; 127.9 of this
subchapter or take such other action as the presiding Official deems
appropriate. Any debarment order will be effective for the period of
time specified therein and may contain such additional terms and
conditions as are deemed appropriate. A copy of the order together
with a copy of the Presiding Official's report will be served upon the
respondent.
  &#167; 128.11 -- Consent agreements.
   (a) The Office of Munitions Control and the respondent may, by
agreement, submit to the Presiding Official a proposal for the
issuance of a consent order.  The Presiding Official will review the
facts of the case and the proposal and may conduct conferences with
the parties and may require the presentation of evidence in the
case. If the Presiding Official does not approve the proposal, the
Presiding Official will notify the parties and the case will proceed
as though no consent proposal had been made. If the proposal is
approved, the Presiding Official will report the facts of the case
along with recommendations to the Assistant Secretary for
Politico-Military Affairs. If the Director does not approve the
proposal, the case will proceed as though no consent proposal has been
made. If the Director approves the proposal, an appropriate order may
be issued.
   (b) Cases may also be settled prior to service of a charging
letter. In such an event, a proposed charging letter shall be
prepared, and a consent agreement and order shall be submitted for the
approval and signature of the Assistant Secretary for
Politico-Military Affairs, and no action by the Presiding Official
shall be required. Cases which are settled may not be reopened or
appealed.
  &#167; 128.12 -- Rehearings.
   The Presiding Official may grant a rehearing or reopen a proceeding
at any time for the purpose of hearing any relevant and material
evidence which was not known or obtainable at the time of the original
hearing. A report for rehearing or reopening must contain a summary of
such evidence, and must explain the reasons why it could not have been
presented at the original hearing. The Presiding Official will inform
the parties of any further hearing, and will conduct such hearing and
submit a report and recommendations in the same manner as provided for
the original proceeding (described in &#167; 128.10).
  &#167; 128.13 -- Appeals.
   (a) Filing of appeals. An appeal must be in writing, and be
addressed to and filed with the Under Secretary of State for Security
Assistance, Science and Technology, Department of State, Washington,
DC 20520. An appeal from a final order denying export privileges or
imposing civil penalties must be filed within 30 days after receipt of
a copy of the order. If the Under Secretary cannot for any reason act
on the appeal, he or she may designate another Department of State
official to receive and act on the appeal.
   (b) Grounds and conditions for appeal. The respondent may appeal
from the debarment or from the imposition of a civil penalty (except
the imposition of civil penalties pursuant to a consent order pursuant
to &#167; 128.11) upon the ground: (1) That the findings of a
violation are not supported by any substantial evidence; (2) that a
prejudicial error of law was committed: or (3) that the provisions of
the order are arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. The
appeal must specify upon which of these grounds the appeal is based
and must indicate from which provisions of the order the appeal is
taken.  An appeal from an order issued upon default will not be
entertained if the respondent has failed to seek relief as provided in
&#167; 128.4(b).
   (c) Matters considered on appeal. An appeal will be considered upon
the basis of the assembled record. This record consists of (but is not
limited to) the charging letter, the respondent's answer, the
transcript or magnetic recording of the hearing before the Presiding
Official, the report of the Presiding Official, the order of the
Assistant Secretary for Politico-Military Affairs, and any other
relevant documents involved in the proceedings before the Presiding
Official. The Under Secretary for Security Assistance, Science and
Technology may direct a rehearing and reopening before the Presiding
Official if he or she finds that the record is insufficient or that
new evidence is relevant and material to the issues and was not known
and was not available to the respondent at the time of the original
hearings.
   (d) Effect of appeals. The taking of an appeal will not stay the
operation of any order.
   (e) Preparation of appeals.-(1) General requirements. An appeal
shall be in letter form. The appeal and accompanying material should
be filed in duplicate, unless otherwise indicated, and a copy
simultaneously mailed or delivered to the Director, Office of
Munitions Control, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520.
   (2) Oral presentation. The Under Secretary for Security Assistance,
Science and Technology may grant the appellant an opportunity for oral
argument and will set the time and place for oral argument and will
notify the parties, ordinarily at least 10 days before the date set.
   (f) Decisions. All appeals will be considered and decided within a
reasonable time after they are filed. An appeal may be granted or
denied in whole or in part, or dismissed at the request of the
appellant. The decision of the Under Secretary for Security
Assistance, Science and Technology will be final.
  &#167; 128.14 -- Confidentiality of proceedings.
   Proceedings under this part are confidential. The documents
referred to in &#167; 128.17 are not, however, deemed to be
confidential Reports of the Presiding Official and copies of
transcripts or recordings of hearings will be available to parties
and, to the extent of their own testimony, to witnesses. All records
are available to any U.S. Government agency showing a proper interest
therein.  [*39323]
  &#167; 128.15 -- Orders containing probationary periods.
   (a) Revocation of probationary periods. A debarment or interim
suspension order may set a probationary period during which the order
may be held in abeyance for all or part of the debarment or suspension
period, subject to the conditions stated therein. The Director, Office
of Munitions Control, may apply, without notice to any person to be
affected thereby, to the Presiding Official for an order revoking
probation when it appears that the conditions of the probation have
been breached. The facts in support of the application will be
presented to the Presiding Official, who will report thereon and make
a recommendation to the Assistant Secretary for Politico-Military
Affairs. The latter will make a determination whether to revoke
probation and will issue an appropriate order.
   (b) Hearing-(1) Objections upon notice. Any person affected by an
application upon notice to revoke probation, within the time specified
in the notice, may file objections with the Presiding Official.
   (2) Objections to order without notice. Any person adversely
affected by an order revoking probation, without notice may request
that the order be set aside by filing his objections thereto with the
Presiding Official. The request will not stay the effective date of
the order or revocation.
   (3) Requirements for filing objections. Objections filed with the
Presiding Official must be submitted in writing and in duplicate. A
copy must be simultaneously submitted to the Office of Munitions
Control. Denials and admissions, as well as any mitigating
circumstances, which the person affected intends to present must be
set forth in or accompany the letter of objection and must be
supported by evidence. A request for an oral hearing may be made at
the time of filing objections.
   (4) Determination. The application and objections thereto will be
referred to the Presiding Official. An oral hearing, if requested,
will be conducted at an early convenient date, unless the objections
filed raise no issues of material fact to be determined. The Presiding
Official will report the facts and make a recommendation to the
Assistant Secretary for Politico-Military Affairs, who will determine
whether the application should be granted or denied and will issue an
appropriate order. A copy of the order and of the Presiding Official's
report will be furnished to any person affected thereby.
   (c) Effect of revocation on other actions. The revocation of a
probationary period will not preclude any other action concerning a
further violation, even where revocation is based on the further
violation.
  &#167; 128.16 -- Extension of time.
   The Presiding Official, for good cause shown, may extend the time
within which to prepare and submit an answer to a charging letter or
to perform any other act required by this part 128.
  &#167; 128.17 -- Availability of orders.
   All charging letters, debarment orders, orders imposing civil
penalties, probationary periods, and interim suspension orders are

to furnish the information specified in &#167; 130.10 with respect to
a sale, every applicant or supplier must obtain from each vendor, from
or through whom the applicant acquired defense articles or defense
services forming the whole or a part of the sale, a full disclosure by
the vendor of all political contributions or fees or commission paid,
by vendor with respect to such sale. Such disclosure must include
responses to all the information pertaining to vendor required to
enable applicant or supplier, as the case may be, to comply fully with
&#167;&#167; 130.9 and 130.10. If so required, they must include the
information furnished by each vendor in providing the information
specified.
   (b) Any vendor which has been requested by an applicant or supplier
to furnish an initial statement under paragraph (a) of this section
must, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, furnish
such statement in a timely manner and not later than 20 days after
receipt of such request.
   (c) If the vendor believes that furnishing information to an
applicant or supplier in a requested statement would unreasonably risk
injury to the vendor's commercial interests, the vendor may furnish in
lieu of the statement an abbreviated statement disclosing only the
aggregate amount of all political contributions and the aggregate
amount of all fees or commissions which have been paid, or offered or
agreed to be paid, or offered or agreed to be paid, by the vendor with
respect to the sale. Any abbreviated statement furnished to an
applicant or supplier under this paragraph must be accompanied by a
certification that the requested information has been reported by the
vendor directly to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. The vendor
must simultaneously report fully to the Office of Defense Trade
Controls all information which the vendor would otherwise have been
required to report to the applicant or supplier under this
section. Each such report must clearly identify the sale with respect
to which the reported information pertains.
   (d)(1) If upon the 25th day after the date of its request to
vendor, an applicant or supplier has not received from the vendor the
initial statement required by paragraph (a) of this section, the
applicant or supplier must submit to the Office of Defense Trade
Controls a signed statement attesting to:
   (i) The manner and extent of applicant's or supplier's attempt to
obtain from the vendor the initial statement required under paragraph
(a) of this section;
   (ii) Vendor's failure to comply with this section; and
   (iii) The amount of time which has elapsed between the date of
applicant's or supplier's request and the date of the signed
statement;
   (2) The failure of a vendor to comply with this section does not
relieve any applicant or supplier otherwise required by &#167; 130.9
to submit a report to the Office of Defense Trade Controls from
submitting such a report.
  &#167; 130.13 -- Information to be furnished to applicant, supplier
or vendor by a recipient of a fee or commission.
   (a) Every applicant or supplier, and each vendor thereof;
   (1) In order to determine whether it is obliged under &#167; 130.9
or &#167; 130.12 to furnish information specified in &#167; 130.10
with respect to a sale; and
   (2) Prior to furnishing such information, must obtain from each
person, if any, to whom it has paid, or offered or agreed to pay, a
fee or commission in respect of such sale, a timely statement
containing a full disclosure by such a person of all political
contributions paid, or offered or agreed to be paid, by it or on its
behalf, or at its direction, in respect of such sale. Such disclosure
must include responses to all the information required to enable the
applicant, supplier or vendor, as the case may be, to comply fully
with &#167;&#167; 130.9, 130.10, and 130.12.
   (b) In obtaining information under paragraph (a) of this section,
the applicant, supplier or vendor, as the case may be, must also
require each person to whom a fee or commission is paid, or offered or
agreed to be paid, to furnish from time to time such reports of its
political contributions as may be necessary to enable the applicant,
supplier or vendor, as the case may be, [*39326] to comply fully with
&#167;&#167; 130.9, 130.10, 130.11, and 130.12.
   (c) The applicant supplier or vendor, as the case may be, must
include any political contributions paid, or offered or agreed to be
paid, by or on behalf of, or at the direction of, any person to whom
it has paid, or offered or agreed to pay a fee or commission in
determining whether applicant, supplier or vendor is required by
&#167;&#167; 130.9, 130.11, and 130.12 to furnish information
specified in &#167; 130.10.
  &#167; 130.14 -- Recordkeeping.
   Each applicant, supplier and vendor must maintain a record of any
information it was required to furnish or obtain under this part and
all records upon which its reports are based for a period of not less
than five years following the date of the report to which they
pertain.
  &#167; 130.15 -- Confidential business information.
   (a) Any person who is required to furnish information under this
part may identify any information furnished hereunder which the person
considers to be confidential business information. No person,
including any applicant or supplier, shall publish, divulge, disclose,
or make known in any manner, any information so identified by a vendor
or other person unless authorized by law or regulation.
   (b) For purposes of this section, confidential business information
means commercial or financial information which by law is entitled to
protection from disclosure. (See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (3) and (4);
18 U.S.C. 1905; 22 U.S.C.  2778(e); Rule 26(c)(7), Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure.)
  &#167; 130.16 -- Other reporting requirements.
   The submission of reports under this part does not relieve any
person of any requirements to furnish information to any federal,
state, or municipal agency, department or other instrumentality as
required by law, regulation or contract.
  &#167; 130.17 -- Utilization of and access to reports and records.
   (a) All information reported and records maintained under this part
will be made available, upon request for utilization by standing
committees of the Congress and subcommittees thereof, and by United
States Government agencies, in accordance with section 39(d) of the
Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C.  2779(d)), and reports based upon
such information will be submitted to Congress in accordance with
sections 36(a)(8) and 36(b)(1) of that Act (22 U.S.C. 2776 (a)(8) and
(b)(1)).
   (b) All confidential business information provided pursuant to this
part shall be protected against disclosure to the extent provided by
law.
   (c) Nothing in this section shall preclude the furnishing of
information to foreign governments for law enforcement or regulatory
purposes under international arrangements between the United States
and any foreign government.
   Dated: July 12, 1993.
  Lynn E. Davis,
  Under Secretary for International Security Affairs.

<hr>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Administration has released, and is seeking informal
comments on, a draft of the new Commerce Department regulations on
encryption exports. </p>

<p>The new regulations create a new category of controls --
&quot;EI&quot; (which stands for &quot;encryption items&quot;). The regulations
divide these encryption items into 5 categories and create
different licensing schemes for each. </p>

<p>Certain mass-market encryption software may be released, after
a one-time review, from normal EI controls and made eligible for
mass market treatment (which includes eligibility for all the
provisions of the Export Administration Regulations applicable to
other software).</p>

<p>&quot;Recovery&quot; encryption software and equipment will be
eligible for a license to export and reexport in unlimited
quantities to all non-embargoed destinations. Applications for
key recovery and key escrow products must identify a satisfactory
key recovery agent with established security policies adequate to safeguard
keys or other escrowed material.</p>

<p>56-bit DES or equivalent non-recovery encryption items will be
eligible for 6-month export and reexport licenses after an initial
review of the item and the submission of a satisfactory key
recovery plan demonstrating a commitment to develop key recovery
products and services. Licenses can be renewed for additional six
month periods depending upon the applicant's adherence to
benchmarks set out in the original plan. All licenses issued
under this category will expire after December 31, 1998.</p>

<p>All other encryption items may be eligible for
&quot;encryption licensing arrangements.&quot; These arrangements are
like the distribution arrangements currently available for
encryption items at the State Department. Such arrangements may
allow exports and reexports of encryption software and equipment
in unlimited quantities to all non-embargoed destinations, but
applications must specify the sales territory and classes of
end-uers. Such arrangements may also impose certain reporting
requirements. Encryption items not approved for an encryption
licensing arrangement may still be granted individual licenses on
a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Encryption &quot;technology&quot; (e.g. technical data) may be
licensed for export and reexport on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>As expected, the usual Commerce Department rules on foreign
availability and de minimis content will not apply to encryption items.
Similarly, controlled software will not be eligible for
&quot;publicly available&quot; treatment, even if the source code
or object code is published in a book or other media.</p>

<p>Other notable provisions of the new regulations include a
&quot;grandfather&quot; provision for existing State Department
licenses and arrangements; detailed rules concerning Internet
distribution of encryption software; and a broad definition of
&quot;recoverable&quot; encryption which includes items that
allow access to unencrypted data without necessarily requiring
access to the keys. </p>

<p><b>ACTION: </b>Interim rule. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><b>SUMMARY:</b> This interim rule amends the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR) by exercising jurisdiction over,
and imposing new combined national security and foreign policy
controls on certain encryption items that were on the United States
Munitions List, consistent with Executive Order 13026 and a
Presidential Memorandum, both issued by President Clinton on
November 15, 1996. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>On October 1, 1996, the Administration announced a plan to
make it easier for Americans to use stronger encryption products
to protect their privacy, intellectual property and other
valuable information. The plan envisions a worldwide key management
infrastructure with the use of key recovery and key escrow
encryption items to promote electronic commerce and secure communications
while protecting national security and public safety. To provide
for a transition period for the development of this key
management infrastructure, this rule permits the export and
reexport of 56-bit key length DES or equivalent encryption items
upon issuance by BXA of an initial license valid for six months,
if an exporter makes satisfactory commitments to build and market
recoverable encryption items and to help build the supporting
international infrastructure. This policy will apply to hardware
and software. <br wp="br1">

<p><font size="4">Background </font><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>On November 15, 1996, the President issued a Memorandum
directing that all encryption items controlled on the U.S. Munitions
List, except those specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted,
or modified for military applications, be transferred to the
Commerce Control List. The Memorandum and Executive Order 13026
(15 November 1996, 61 FR 58767) also set forth certain additional
provisions with respect to controls on such encryption items to
be imposed by the Department of Commerce. The Executive Order
also provides for appropriate controls on the export and foreign dissemination
of encryption items controlled on the U.S. Munitions List that
are placed on the Commerce Control List. In issuing the
Memorandum the President stated: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>Encryption products, when used outside the United States, can
jeopardize our foreign policy and national security interests. Moreover,
such products, when used by international criminal organizations, can
threaten the safety of U.S. citizens here and abroad, as well as
the safety of the citizens of other countries. The exportation of
encryption products must be controlled to further U.S. foreign
policy objectives, and promote our national security, including
the protection of the safety of U.S. citizens abroad. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This initiative will make it easier for Americans to use
stronger encryption items to protect their privacy, intellectual
property and other valuable information. It will support the
growth of electronic commerce, increase the security of the
global information infrastructure, and sustain the economic competitiveness
of U.S. encryption product manufacturers during the transition to
a key management infrastructure. Under this initiative,
non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent
strength will be permitted for export and reexport after a
one-time review of the item and if the exporter makes satisfactory
commitments to build and market recoverable encryption items and
to support an international key management infrastructure. This
policy will apply to hardware and software. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The relaxation of export and reexport controls on
non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent
strength will last until January 1, 1999. The temporary
relaxation of controls is one part of a broader encryption policy
initiative designed to promote electronic information security and public
safety. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The initiative carries out important foreign policy and
national security concerns identified by the President. Export
controls on cryptographic items are essential to controlling the
spread aborad of powerful encryption products which could be
harmful to critical U.S. national security, foreign policy and law
enforcement interests. This initiative will preserve such
controls and foster the development of a key management
infrastructure necessary to protect important national security,
foreign policy and law enforcement concerns. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This interim rule implements the Administration's policy on
encryption exports. This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations
(EAR) by imposing national security and foreign policy controls (&quot;EI&quot; for
Encryption Items) on certain information security systems and
equipment, cryptographic devices, software and components
specifically designed or modified therefor, including recoverable encryption software,
and related technology (&quot;encryption items&quot;).
&quot;Encryption items&quot; do not include encryption items specifically
designed, developed, configured, adapted or modified for military applications
(including command, control and intelligence applications). Such
items remain on the U.S. Munitions List, and continue to be
controlled by the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls.
EI controls apply to encryption software, including recoverable
encryption &quot;software&quot; transferred from the U.S. Munitions
List to the Commerce Control List pursuant to E.O. 13026 of November
15, 1996 (61 FR 58767). </p>

<p>This interim rule also amends the Export Administration
Regulations to require a license for exports and reexports to all destinations,
except Canada, of certain encryption items controlled for EI
reasons. The licensing policy is as follows: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<dl>
    <dd>(1) <u>Certain mass-market encryption software</u>.
        Certain encryption software that was transferred from the
        U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List pursuant
        to E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996 (61 FR 58767) may be released
        from &quot;EI&quot; controls and thereby made eligible
        for mass market treatment after a one-time BXA review. To determine
        eligibility for mass market treatment, exporters must
        submit a classification request to BXA. 40-bit mass market encryption
        software may be eligible for a 7-day review process, and
        company proprietary software may be eligible for 15-day
        processing. See new Supplement No. 6 to part 742 of the EAR
        and 748.3(b)(3) of the EAR for additional information.
        Note that the one-time review is for a determination to
        release encryption software in object code only.
        Exporters requesting release of the source code should
        refer to paragraph (b)(3)(v)(E) of Supplement No. 6 to
        part 742. If, after a one-time review, BXA determines
        that the software is released from EI controls, such software
        is eligible for all provisions of the EAR applicable to
        other software, such as License Exception TSU for mass-market
        software. If BXA determines that the software is not
        released from EI controls, a license is required for export
        and reexport to all destinations, except Canada, and
        license applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis. <br
        wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        <p>(2) <u>Recovery encryption software and commodities</u>.
        Recovery encryption software and equipment controlled for
        EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 or under ECCN 5A002,
        including encryption equipment designed or modified to
        use recoverable encryption software, may be released from
        &quot;EI&quot; controls and thereby made eligible for
        license exception RSE after a one-time BXA review.
        License exception RSE is valid for all destinations
        except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria and
        Sudan. To determine eligibility, exporters must submit a classification request
        to BXA. Requests for key escrow and key recovery
        encryption items will receive favorable consideration
        provided that, prior to the export or reexport, a key
        recovery agent satisfactory to BXA has been identified
        (refer to new Supplement No. 4 to part 742) and security policies
        for safeguarding the key(s) or other escrowed
        material/information as described in new Supplement No. 5
        to part 742 are established to the satisfaction of BXA
        and are maintained after export or reexport as required
        by the EAR and any license conditions. If the exporter or reexporter
        intends to be the key recovery agent, then the exporter
        or reexporter must meet all of the requirements of a key
        recovery agent identified in Supplement 5 to part 742. In
        addition, the key recovery or key escrow system must meet
        the criteria identified in Supplement No. 4 to part 742.
        Note that eligibility is dependent on continued
        fulfilment of the requirements of a key recovery agent
        identified in Supplement 5. <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>(3) <u>Non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key
        length DES or equivalent strength supported by a
        satisfactory business and marketing plan for exporting
        recoverable items and services</u>. License applications
        from manufacturers of non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit
        key length DES or equivalent strength will be approved
        for export and reexport by the Department of Commerce
        upon the issuance of an export license valid for six
        months after an initial BXA review of the item and the
        submission of a satisfactory business and marketing plan that
        explains in detail the steps the applicant will take
        during the two-year transition period beginning January
        1, 1997 to develop, produce, or market encryption items
        and services with recoverable features. Any subsequent
        renewal is not automatic, and will depend on the applicant's
        adherence to explicit benchmarks and milestones as set
        forth in the plan submitted for the initial license
        application. This relaxation of controls will last until
        January 1, 1999. The plan that is submitted with applications for
        the export of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit
        key length DES or equivalent strength must include the
        elements in new Supplement No. 7 to part 742. Note that
        BXA will accept requests for export and reexport of
        non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length
        DES or equivalent strength under this paragraph from distributors,
        re-sellers, and other entities that are not manufacturers
        of the encryption items. BXA will authorize exports and reexports
        of such items only in instances where a license has been
        granted to the manufacturer of the encryption items. The
        authority to so export or reexport will be for a time
        period ending on the same day the producer's authority to
        export or reexport ends. <br wp="br1">

<p>Note that all &quot;EI&quot; encryption items are not subject
to any mandatory decontrol or licensing requirements based on
foreign availability provisions of the EAA or the EAR In section
1(a) of Executive Order 13026, the President states: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I have determined that the export of encryption products
    described in this section may harm national security and
    foreign policy interests even where comparable products are or
    appear to be available from sources outside the United
    states, and that facts and questions concerning the foreign
    availability of such encryption products cannot be subject to
    public disclosure or judicial review without revealing or
    implicating classified information that could harm United
    States national security and foreign policy interests. Accordingly,
    section 4(c) and 6(h)(2) - (4) of the Export Administration
    Act of 1979 (&quot;the EAA&quot;) ..., all other analogous
    provisions the EAA relating to foreign availability, and the
    regulations in the EAR relating to such EAA provisions, shall not
    be applicable with respect to export controls on such
    encryption products. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This interim rule amends part 768 of the EAR, Foreign
Availability, to make clear that the provisions of that part do
not apply to encryption items transferred to the Commerce Control
List. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This interim rule also amends part 734 of the EAR to exclude
encryption items transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce
Control List pursuant to E.O. 13026 (61 FR 58767, November 15, 1996)
from the <u>de minimis</u> provisions for items exported from
abroad. This rule also amends part 734 of the EAR to reflect that
certain encryption software controlled for EI reasons under ECCN
5D002 that has been transferred to the Department of Commerce
from the Department of State by E.O. 13026 will be subject to the
EAR even when publicly available. Such encryption software in
both source code and object code remains subject to the EAR and
is not eligible for publicly available treatment even if published
in a book or any other writing or media. This rule also amends
part 740 and Supplement No. 2 to part 774 of the EAR to reflect
that encryption software will not be eligible for &quot;mass
market&quot; treatment under the General Software Note or for
export as beta-test software under License Exception BETA unless
released from EI controls through a one-time BXA review (refer to new
Supplement No. 6 to part 742). Note that License Exception TMP is
available for temporary exports and reexports of encryption items
except under the provisions for beta-test software. Software and
technology that was controlled by the Department of Commerce prior
to [INSERT EFFECTIVE DATE] are not affected by this rule and will
continue to be eligible for the publicly available treatment.
Software controlled by the Department of Commerce prior to [INSERT EFFECTIVE
DATE] will continue to be eligible for mass market treatment
under the General Software Note, and License Exception TSU for
mass-market software. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>For purposes of this rule, &quot;recovery encryption
products&quot; refer to encryption products (including software)
which allow law enforcement officials to obtain under proper
legal authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the
user, the plaintext of encrypted data and communications. Such recoverable
products fulfill the objectives of the Administration's encryption
policy. Other approaches to access and recovery may be defined in
the future. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This interim rule also amends part 742 of the EAR to reflect
the new combined national security and foreign policy controls imposed
by this rule, and adds a new Supplement No. 4 to part 742 titled
&quot;Key Recovery or Key Escrow Products Criteria&quot; that
includes product criteria, a new Supplement No. 5 to part 742
titled &quot;Key Recovery or Key Escrow Agent Criteria&quot; that includes
interim requirements for key recovery agents, a new Supplement
No. 6 to part 742 titled &quot;Guidelines for Submitting a Classification Request
for a Mass Market Software Product that contains Encryption&quot;
that includes the criteria for the one-time review of
classification requests for release of certain encryption
software from EI controls, and a new Supplement No. 7 to part 742
titled &quot;Review Criteria for Exporter Key Recovery or Key Escrow
Development Plans.&quot; <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This interim rule makes conforming changes in part 748 of the
EAR for classification requests, amends part 750 of the EAR to
reflect the Department of Justice role in the review of
encryption license applications, amends the record keeping provisions
of part 762 of the EAR, adds new definitions to part 772 of the
EAR, and amends the Commerce Control List (Supplement No. 1 to
part 774) by adding new EI controls under ECCNs 5A002, 5D002, and
5E002 for commodities, software and technology that are placed
under Commerce Department jurisdiction by E.O. 13026. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>In certain cases, semiannual reporting requirements on
quantities shipped and country of destination will be imposed on exporters,
in order to allow the United States to fulfill the reporting
requirements of the Wassenaar Arrangement. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The scope of controls on the release to foreign nationals of
technology and software subject to the EAR may be amended in a separate
Federal Register Notice. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This rule involves no new curtailment of exports, because the
transfer or removal of items from the United States Munitions List
to the CCL maintains a continuity of controls. Therefore, the
provisions regarding the impact of new controls do not apply, and
contract sanctity also does not apply to this imposition of
controls. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>U.S. persons holding valid USML licenses and other approvals
issued by the Department of State prior to (INSERT DATE OF
PUBLICATION) may ship remaining balances authorized by such licenses
or approvals under the authority of the EAR by filing Shippers
Export Declarations (SEDs) with District Directors of Customs,
citing this Federal Register Notice and the State Department license
number. Such shipments shall be in accordance with the terms and
conditions, including the expiration date, existing at the time
of issuance of the State license. Any reports required for distribution
and other types of agreements previously authorized by the
Department of State, valid at the time of this publication, should
be henceforth submitted to the Department of Commerce. Export violations,
including the terms and conditions of export, shall hereafter constitute
a violation of the EAR. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>Consistent with the provisions of section 6 of the Export
Administration Act, a foreign policy report was submitted to Congress
on (<u>DATE OF REPORT</u>), notifying the Congress of the
Department's intention to impose controls on certain information
security systems and equipment, cryptographic devices, software
and components specifically designed or modified therefor, and
related technology that will be controlled on the CCL and that
will be subject to new control procedures. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>Although the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired on August
20, 1994, the President invoked the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act and continued in effect, to the extent
permitted by law, the provisions of the EAA and the EAR in
Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, notice of August 15,
1995 (60 FR 42767), and notice of August 14, 1996 </p>

<br wp="br2">
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1. This interim rule has been determined to be significant
    for purposes of E. O. 12866. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person
    is required to respond to, nor shall any person be subject to
    a penalty for failure to comply with a collection of information,
    subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act,
    unless that collection of information displays a currently
    valid OMB Control Number. This rule involves collections of
    information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.
    3501 <u>et seq.</u>). These collections have been approved by
    the Office of Management and Budget under control number
    0694-0088. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism
    implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
    assessment under Executive Order 12612. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>4. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5
    U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the
    opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date,
    are inapplicable because this regulation involves a military
    and foreign affairs function of the United States (Sec. 5
    U.S.C. 553(a)(1)). Further, no other law requires that a
    notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public
    comment be given for this interim final rule. Because a
    notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment
    are not required to be given for this rule under 5 U.S.C. or
    by any other law, the requirements of the Regulatory
    Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <u>et seq.</u> ) are not
    applicable. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, because of the importance of the issues raised by
these regulations, this rule is issued in interim form and
comments will be considered in the development of final
regulations. Accordingly, the Department encourages interested
persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possible
time to permit the fullest consideration of their views. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The period for submission of comments will close (<u>INSERT
DATE 45 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION</u>). The Department will
consider all comments received before the close of the comment
period in developing final regulations. Comments received after
the end of the comment period will be considered if possible, but
their consideration cannot be assured. The Department will not
accept public comments accompanied by a request that a part or
all of the material be treated confidentially because of its
business proprietary nature or for any other reason. The
Department will return such comments and materials to the person
submitting the comments and will not consider them in the development
of final regulations. All public comments on these regulations
will be a matter of public record and will be available for
public inspection and copying. In the interest of accuracy and completeness,
the Department requires comments in written form. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which
will also be a matter of public record and will be available for public
review and copying. Communications from agencies of the United States Government
or foreign governments will not be made available for public
inspection. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The public record concerning these regulations will be
maintained in the Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information
Records Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of Commerce,
14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20230. Records in this facility, including written public

                controls and thereby made eligible for mass
                market treatment after a one-time review. To
                determine eligibility for mass market treatment,
                exporters must submit a classification request to BXA.
                40-bit mass market encryption software may be
                eligible for a 7-day review process, and company proprietary software
                may be eligible for 15-day processing. Refer to
                new Supplement No. 6 to part 742 of the EAR and
                748.3(b)(2) of the EAR for additional information.
                Note that the one-time review is for a determination
                to release encryption software in object code
                only unless otherwise specifically requested. Exporters
                requesting release of the source code should
                refer to paragraph (b)(3)(v)(E) of Supplement No.
                6 to part 742. If, after a one-time review, BXA determines
                that the software is released from EI controls,
                such software is eligible for all provisions of
                the EAR applicable to other software, such as
                License Exception TSU for mass-market software.
                If BXA determines that the software is not
                released from EI controls, a license is required
                for export and reexport to all destinations,

                or reexport as required by the EAR and any license

                be the key recovery agent, then the exporter or
                reexporter must meet all of the requirements of a
                key recovery agent identified in Supplement 5 to

                escrow system must meet the criteria identified
                in Supplement No. 4 to part 742. Note that

<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>KEY RECOVERY AGENT REQUIREMENTS; SECURITY POLICIES; KEY
RECOVERY OR KEY ESCROW PROCEDURES <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This Supplement sets forth criteria that the Department of
Commerce will use to approve key recovery agents to support approval
of the export or reexport of key recovery encryption items
controlled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002 and 5D002. Any
arrangements between the exporter or reexporter and the key
recovery agent must reflect the provisions contained in this
Supplement in a manner satisfactory to BXA and other agencies.
This Supplement outlines the criteria for employing key recovery
agent personnel for key recovery procedures. An applicant for a
license to export or reexport key recovery items shall provide,
or cause the proposed key recovery agent to provide, to BXA
sufficient information concerning any proposed key recovery agent
arrangements to permit BXA's evaluation, in conjunction with
other agencies, of the key recovery agent's security policies,
key recovery procedures, and suitability and trustworthiness to
maintain the confidentiality of the key(s) or other escrowed material/information.
The key recovery agent, who must be approved by BXA, may be the applicant
for the export or reexport license or another party legally
obligated to the applicant to provide escrow services. BXA
retains the right, in addition to any other remedies, to revoke
export or reexport licenses if BXA, in conjunction with other
agencies, determines that a key recovery agent no longer meets
these criteria. The requirements related to the suitability and
trustworthiness, security policies, and key recovery procedures
of the key recovery agent shall be made terms and conditions of
the export or reexport license for key recovery items. BXA shall
require the key recovery agent to provide a representation that
it will comply with such terms and conditions. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><u>Key Recovery Agent Requirements</u> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>(1) A key recovery agent must identify by name, date and place
of birth, and social security number, individual(s) who: <br

identify to BXA by name, date and place of birth, and social security
number any new individual(s) who will assume the responsibilities
set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this Supplement. Before that
individual(s) assumes such responsibilities, the key recovery
agent must certify to BXA that the individual(s) meets the
criteria set forth in subparagraphs (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this
Supplement. BXA, in conjunction with other agencies, reserves the
right to determine at any time the suitability and
trustworthiness of such personnel. <br wp="br1">

<p>(5) Use of key recovery agents located outside the U.S. is
permitted if acceptable to BXA, in consultation with the host government,
as appropriate. </p>

<p>(6) Key recovery agents shall submit suitable evidence of the
key recovery agent's corporate viability and financial responsibility
(e.g., a certificate of good standing from the state of
incorporation, credit reports, and errors/omissions insurance). <br

foregoing occurring during the life of the license. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>(8) Key recovery agent(s) shall designate an individual(s) to
be the security and operations officer(s). <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>(9) A key recovery agent may be internal to a user's
organization and may consist of one or more individuals. BXA may approve
such key recovery agents if sufficient information is provided to demonstrate
that appropriate safeguards will be employed in handling key
recovery requests from government entities. These safeguards
should ensure: i) the key recovery agent's structural independence from
the rest of the organization; (ii) security; and (iii)
confidentiality. <br wp="br1">

<p>SUPPLEMENT NO. 7 TO PART 742 - REVIEW CRITERIA FOR EXPORTER
KEY RECOVERY OR KEY ESCROW DEVELOPMENT PLANS <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>1. In exchange for specific commitments from exporters to help
build and support a global key management infrastructure (through
development, production and marketing of recovery products and services),
we will permit these companies to export non-recoverable
encryption items with 56-bit key length DES, or equivalent,
encryption items as we now permit the export of certain mass
market encryption software (i.e. rapid review, flexible
licensing) for a maximum of two years. Companies' commitments
should be in the form of a letter from senior corporate
management (i.e. an officer of the company) confirming the
corporate commitment and providing (in the letter or in
attachments) the information specified below. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>2. Issuance of an initial export license valid for six months
will be based on an initial BXA review in conjunction with other government
agencies, and the submission to and approval by BXA (after appropriate
interagency review) of a plan that explains in detail the steps
the applicant will take to develop, produce or market recoverable
encryption products or services. Proposed recovery products and
services will be evaluated against technical criteria which are
found in Supplement No. 4 to this part. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>3. Any subsequent six-month renewal is not automatic, and is
subject to adherence to explicit benchmarks and milestones as set
forth in the plan submitted for the initial license. Review will
entail assessment by appropriate government agencies, at intervals
not to exceed six months, to determine if the licensee is showing
acceptable progress in meeting the milestones set forth in the
exporter's plan. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>4. For the initial license, the applicant must commit to
implementing a key escrow, key recovery or recoverable products
and services development plan based on the following elements: <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>Criteria for Exporters <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>5. In its initial application, the applicant must describe its
business and marketing plan for developing key recovery, recoverable
or key escrow products and services during the two year
transition period. The plan must describe specific actions
(including, to the extent applicable, research and development, testing,
production, distribution and marketing achievements and goals)
and the kinds and magnitude of resources expected to be committed
under the plan. In addition, the plan must describe how the applicant
will make the transition within two years from the export of
56-bit non-key recovery or non-key escrow products and services
to the export of key recovery, recoverable or key escrow products
and services. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>6. By January 1, 1998, or within six months from receiving the
initial approval for export (whichever is later), the applicant
will indicate the arrangements for export purposes made for key
recovery or key escrow (which may be internal to the company) acceptable
to BXA. Criteria for key recovery or key escrow agents are in
Supplement No. 5 to part 742. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>7. The initial plan submitted by the exporter will provide the
basis for the review and approval of the initial license and any subsequent
renewals during the two year transition period. Exporters may
amend the plan as needed during the course of this period,
subject to review. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><b>Criteria for Non-Manufacturing Exporters </b><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>8. An initial license will be granted for export of non
recovery products and services only if the manufacturer of those products
has submitted, and had approved according to the criteria above,
a plan to develop key recovery, recoverable or key escrow
products or services. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><b>Additional Factors </b><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>9. An applicant may, at its discretion, provide other
information to indicate commitment to the development of a key management
infrastructure, such as: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<dl>
    <dd>a. Participation in U.S. Government pilot programs; <br

        c. Role in the Commerce Department's Technical Advisory
        Committee on a Key Management Infrastructure; <br
        wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        d. Participation in other encryption policy committees or
        groups; or <p>e. Public support for a key management
        infrastructure. <br wp="br1">

<p>PART 744 - [AMENDED] <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>25. Part 744 is amended by adding a new 744.9 to read as
follows: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>744.9 Restrictions on activities of U.S. persons with respect
to certain encryption items. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>(a) <u>General prohibition</u>. No U.S. person (as defined in
paragraph (c) of this section) may, without a license from BXA, knowingly
provide assistance to foreign persons, including providing
training, to manufacture or to export encryption items transferred
from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List

Export Administration Regulation; Simplification of Export
Administration Regulations

AGENCY: Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce.

ACTION: Interim rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This interim rule restructures and reorganizes the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR), the regulatory regime through which
the Bureau of Export Administration imposes export and reexport
controls on those items and activities within its jurisdiction. This
interim rule clarifies the language of the EAR, simplifies their
application, and generally makes the export control regulatory regime
more user-friendly.

DATES: Effective Dates: This interim rule is effective April 24, 1996,
except part 752, which shall be effective March 25, 1996. Removal of
newly designated Sec. 771A.25(d) shall be effective March 25, 1996.
Removal of newly designated parts 768A through 779A, 785A through 791A,
and 799A will be effective November 1, 1996.

COMMENTS: Comments on this rule must be received on or before May 24,
1996.

USE OF FORMS: On June 15, 1996 BXA will begin requiring applicants to
submit certain new forms to implement this interim rule. The new Form
BXA-748P, Multipurpose Application will be effective June 15, 1996.
Before June 15, 1996 BXA will not accept Form BXA-748P. After June 15,
1996 BXA will not accept existing Forms BXA-622P or BXA-699P. See
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION for guidance on which forms to use before
June 15, 1996, and which forms to use after that date.

ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to Cecil Hunt, Deputy Chief
Counsel for Export Administration, United States Department of
Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration, Fourteenth Street and
Constitution Avenue, N.W., Room 3839, Washington, D.C. 20230.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Larry E. Christensen, Director,
Regulatory Policy Division, Bureau of Export Administration, (202) 482-
2440.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    On September 30, 1993, the Secretary of Commerce submitted to the
Congress a report of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC),
entitled Toward a National Export Strategy. The report included the
following among its goals:

    Undertake a comprehensive review of the Export Administration
Regulations to simplify, clarify, and make the regulations more
user-friendly.

    In November 1993, BXA organized a Task Group, drawn from several of
its offices, to carry out the TPCC recommendation. The Task Group
launched its review project by publishing an advance notice of proposed
rulemaking (ANPRM) in the Federal Register on February 10, 1994 (59 FR
6528). This notice was designed to solicit comments from industry and
the interested public. The ANPRM asked for suggestions concerning
improvements BXA could make to the EAR and described several specific
issues on which BXA was particularly interested in receiving public
input.
    Over seven months during the development of a proposed rule with
request for comments that was published in the Federal Register on May
11, 1995, titled ``Export Administration Regulations; Simplification of
Export Administration Regulations'' (60 FR 25268) (hereafter referred
to as proposed rule), BXA shared four discussion packages with and
sought comments from the Regulations & Procedures Technical Advisory
Committee (RPTAC), an advisory committee consisting of industry
representatives intimately familiar with the private sector's role in
using the EAR. The packages were also made available to other
interested members of the public, with the last two being made
available electronically on FedWorld. The four discussion packages were
dated August 2, 1994, September 29, 1994, January 12, 1995, and
February 28, 1995.
    The May 11 proposed rule reflected several new features based upon
the comments received from the public pursuant to the ANPRM, and the
RPTAC, and BXA's own assessment of how the EAR could be improved. Such
features include:
    <bullet> No license or other authorization would be required for
any transaction under BXA jurisdiction unless the regulations
affirmatively state the requirement. (Existing regulations state that
all exports are prohibited unless an applicable general license has
been established or a validated license or other authorization has been
granted by BXA.)
    <bullet> The terms ``general'' license and ``validated'' license
would be dropped. The term ``license'' would be used to refer only to
authorization issued by BXA upon application. The proposed regulations
would convert the many existing general licenses into a smaller number
of ``exceptions'' to require the obligation to seek a license when the
Commerce Control list indicates that the particular item going to the
stated country generally requires a license.
    <bullet> The parts of the EAR would be arranged to give the reader
a logical path to follow.
    <bullet> The affirmative statements of the need to obtain a
license, scattered throughout various parts of the existing EAR, would
be consolidated into ten general prohibitions and described in a
separate part. One part would contain the license review policy for all
list-based license requirements; another part would provide for the
requirements and review policies of licenses based on the end-use or
end-user involved in a proposed export or reexport; and the list-based
license requirements would be contained in the Commerce Control List
(CCL) indicating the reason for control and the Country Chart
indicating the country scope of each reason for control.
    <bullet> The Country Groups used in the existing regulations would
be revised in favor of Groups which better reflect post-Cold War
circumstances.
    <bullet> The CCL would be redesigned to state the reasons for
control more specifically within each Export Control Classification
Number (ECCN).
    <bullet> The redesigned CCL would be used in tandem with a new
Country Chart that would indicate whether a license is required for any
ECCN to any country in the world and the reason or reasons for control.
    Over 80 commenters responded to the proposed rule. Many commenters
recommended that BXA take sufficient time to draft an interim rule to
ensure ample opportunity to review and discuss with industry their
comments on the May 11 proposed rule, and incorporate them into an
interim rule. BXA has taken the time necessary to thoroughly review,
analyze, and discuss industry comments on the proposed rule. In
addition, BXA conducted 18 town-hall style fora (hereafter referred to
as town-hall fora) that reached over 1,000 industry representatives,
and met with the RPTAC and other interested

[[Page 12715]]
public to discuss their comments and concerns in more detail.
    Following is a detailed part-by-part description of this interim
rule, and a review of comments received pursuant to the May 11 proposed
rule:

Implementation

    This interim rule will become effective April 24, 1996; however,
final compliance with this interim rule is not compelled until November
1, 1996. During the period between the effective date and the final
compliance date of this interim rule, you must comply with the
provisions of either the existing Export Administration Regulations
(EAR) (redesignated 15 CFR 768A through 799A by this interim rule)
including any amendments thereto that are published in the Federal
Register or the provisions of this interim rule including any
amendments thereto that are published in the Federal Register.
    Notwithstanding the general effective date of this interim rule,
the repeal of the importer statement requirement for General License
GCT is effective immediately, and the Special Comprehensive License
provisions in part 752 are effective immediately. For up to March 25,
1997, holders of issued and outstanding special licenses may continue
to use those special licenses according to their terms and conditions
and according to the special license provisions of the existing EAR.
    The majority of the commenters requested a 90 day delayed effective
date plus an additional six to twelve months during which one must
comply with either the existing Export Administration Regulations or
this interim rule. The cost of changes to internal information systems
and the time to train personnel on the new system were the main reasons
cited for requesting a delayed effective date and a transition period.
Several large companies said that their computer systems will require
substantial reprogramming for the new License Exception group symbols,
the new Destination Control Statement (DCS), and the renumbering of
entries on the Commerce Control List in part 774 to conform to the
European Union numbering system.
    Some firms indicated that implementation costs would be reduced if
they were allowed a span of time in which to implement the changes made
by this interim rule. Costs would be higher if a single implementation
date were required because their information systems departments would
not have flexibility regarding scheduling and might be required to hire
additional temporary employees or pay overtime. Many large firms cannot
implement the computer changes on one given day. After receiving the
above comments in writing and during the town-hall fora, BXA made
additional contacts with several firms. All acknowledge that they can
efficiently implement the changes required by this interim rule within
six months. Since those discussions, BXA has determined to modify the
Destination Control Statement (DCS) as noted below to closely following
the existing DCS widely used by many firms. BXA is hopeful that this
decision will further reduce the costs of implementation of this
interim rule.
    BXA is sensitive to the costs of implementation, and that is the
reason this interim rule provides for a rather long implementation
period. Through this mechanism, BXA hopes to reduce the marginal costs
of implementation by reducing necessary overtime, contracting, and
training beyond that regularly scheduled. BXA will also assist the
business community in training for this interim rule. BXA has already
announced a substantial program to conduct training sessions around the
United States to make it convenient for firms to train their personnel.
    The new Multipurpose Application Form, BXA-748P, will replace the
Application for Export License (BXA-622P) and the Request for Reexport
Authorization (BXA-699P). It will also serve as an application for the
Special Comprehensive License. Additionally, the BXA-748P will
accommodate Commerce Classification Requests, thus allowing item
classifications to be handled electronically.
    BXA will not accept the new forms listed in this paragraph for
applications and requests received before June 15. BXA will not accept
existing forms listed in this paragraph for applications and requests
received on or after June 15. The existing Form BXA-622P Application
for Export License, existing Form BXA-685P, Request for Amendment
Action, and existing Form BXA-699P, Request for Reexport Authorization
will all be replaced by new Form BXA 748P, Multipurpose Application.
The existing Form BXA-622P-A, Commodity Description Supplement will be
replaced by new Form BXA-748P-A, Item Appendix. Existing Form 622P-B,
End-user Supplement will be replaced by new Form 748P-B, End-user
Appendix. Form BXA-6052P, Statement by Foreign Consignee in Support of
Special License Application will be replaced by Form BXA-752P,
Statement by Consignee in Support of Special Comprehensive License.
    Existing Form BXA-629P, Statement by Ultimate Consignee and
Purchaser will be replaced by new Form BXA-711, Statement by Ultimate
Consignee and Purchaser. However, Form BXA-629P may be used until
November 1, 1996.
    Use of Existing Form BXA 686-P, Statement by Foreign Importer of
Aircraft or Vessel Repair Parts and Form BXA 6026-P, Service Supply
(SL) Statement by U.S. Exporter will be discontinued on March 25, 1996,
because the Aircraft and Vessel Repair Station Procedure at Sec. 773A.8
and the Service Supply (SL) Procedure at Sec. 773A.7 of the existing
EAR will be replaced by the Special Comprehensive License in part 752
of this interim rule.
    BXA will stop issuing BXA Form-648P, Notification of Delivery
Verification Requirement on June 15, 1996. For licenses issued on or
after that date, the delivery verification requirement will be printed
on the license itself.

The Knowledge Standard

    One step is being taken in this interim rule that changes language
in many parts of the EAR, but without changing the intended meaning.
Several commenters noted that the proposed rule continued use in the
EAR of differing expressions as to knowledge, such as ``know'' or
``know or have reason to know''. Three commenters called for the
removal of the term ``reason to know'' and one commenter requested a
uniform adoption of ``know or have reason to know''. BXA has decided to
adopt the term ``knowledge'' (together with variants, such as ``know''
or ``knowing'') as the standard usage and defines this term in the EAR.
This definition is added to part 772--Definitions. Variants, such as
``reason to believe'' are being retained in the EAR where they are used
to follow statutory wording. This definition confirms the intention of
BXA that ``know'' and terms such as ``know or have reason to know'' be
given the same meaning and that this meaning include more than positive
knowledge. This definition is not being applied to part 760--
Restrictive Practices and Boycotts, leaving the interpretation of such
terms in this distinct part of the EAR to be independent of export
control usage.

Part-by-Part Analysis

Part 730--General Information

    Part 730 provides a general introduction to the EAR. It is intended
for the first-time reader and is not regulatory.
    Seven of the public comments referred to part 730. There was broad

[[Page 12716]]
support for the listing of other control agencies, together with
telephone and fax numbers for obtaining information. Four commenters
noted that similar information was provided in a supplement to the
scope part of the proposed rule, with duplication and some
inconsistency. BXA has eliminated that supplement and includes the
agency information in this part 730. Three commenters requested that
the listing be broadened, and noted the absence of reference to certain
controls of other agencies listed in the existing EAR. This listing has
been updated and extended. BXA is not, however, acting on requests to
add more detailed information on controls administered by other
agencies, nor on areas of possible overlap, as this would unduly
complicate this brief introduction to the EAR.
    Three commenters called for combining part 730 with the Steps part
in some way. BXA concluded that a merger of the two parts is not
advisable, as the amount of detail needed in steps would obscure the
more general introductory information offered in part 730. Many
comments on the two parts called for flow charts and wiring diagrams.
BXA has recently received authorization from the Office of the Federal
Register to include such additional aids, and BXA will develop those
materials for inclusion in the EAR at a later date.
    Two commenters questioned the basic, non-regulatory, approach taken
in part 730, citing such elements as the Sec. 730.6 reference to the
benefits from multilateral controls and the Sec. 730.8 explanation of
why the EAR are lengthy and detailed. BXA continues to believe that
this kind of introduction to the EAR will be helpful to persons new to
the field.

Part 732--Steps

    By cross-references to the relevant provisions, part 732 describes
the suggested steps for you to determine applicability of (1) the scope
of the EAR described in part 734, (2) each of the general prohibitions
in part 736, (3) the License Exceptions in part 740, and (4) other
requirements such as clearing the U.S. Customs Service, keeping
records, and completing license applications. This part 732 describes
the organization of the EAR, informs you of the relationship among the
parts and provisions, and describes the appropriate order in which to
consider the various provisions of the EAR by cross-referencing those
provisions. Supplement No. 1 to this part 732, contains the ``Know Your
Customer'' Guidance, which has been moved from part 744--Control
Policy--End-user and End-use Based Control. In this interim rule, BXA
has also added examples of Red Flags referred to in the ``Know Your
Customer'' Guidance.
    Over thirty commenters referred to the part on steps in the
proposed rule, and all but one supported the inclusion of steps to
guide the reader. Of these commenters, more than half stated that the
steps part should be relocated so that it could serve as a type of
road-map in the use of the entire EAR. The proposed rule provided for
steps at part 736 after the parts on scope and general prohibitions.
BXA agrees that the steps part is more useful if relocated closer to
the beginning of the EAR. Therefore, in this interim rule, the steps
part is renumbered as part 732; and it precedes the part on scope that
is renumbered as part 734 and the part on prohibitions that is
renumbered as part 736.
    About one quarter of the commenters on this part urged some type of
restructuring or reordering of the steps within the part; however, the
comments were varied. Based upon these written comments and a
substantial number of oral comments made during the town-hall fora, BXA
believes that it is useful to organize the steps in categories
regarding the scope of the EAR, the ten general prohibitions, the
License Exceptions, and additional requirements such as keeping
records, documentation for clearing the U.S. Customs Service, and
completing license applications. In addition, one commenter urged that
the steps regarding prohibitions at part 736 make clear the distinction
between the first three prohibitions that are shaped by product
parameters on the Commerce Control List versus the last seven
prohibitions that address certain types of activities without regard to
the product parameters on the Commerce Control List. Another common
suggestion was to give greater prominence and clarity to the
determination of the proper ECCN for items, a process referred to as
classification. This interim rule adopts those recommendations.
    One commenter suggested that the steps part in the proposed rule
included too many cross-references to the other parts and required the
reader to flip too many pages. Several other commenters recommended
additional cross-references in the EAR. BXA believes that the part on
steps should continue to contain cross-references for fundamental
reasons. The part on steps is not a substitute for the language of
other parts of the EAR and the part on steps would be much too long if
it contained a complete explanation or repetition of every other
provision of the EAR. Rather, it is a type of road-map, guide, or
written decision tree that helps the reader understand the order in
which to read the various provisions and to determine which provisions
are relevant to a given transaction or activity. By this means, the
part on steps serves the purpose of describing the relationship among
the provisions of the EAR, something that was not done in the EAR
before the proposed rule. When these steps are followed in the proper
order, the reader will consider those provisions of the EAR necessary
to determine his or her rights and duties.
    It would be impossible to develop a useful series of steps without
use of cross-references to the various provisions of the EAR; however,
BXA is sensitive to a reader's understandable desire for steps that may
be read with an easy flow and with no more cross-referencing than
necessary to specify the language that creates regulatory rights and
obligations. To this end, where possible, we have inserted brief
explanatory references that give the reader an indication of the
substance of the referenced provision. One comment made often by the
public is that the steps part must contain guidance and not create
additional regulatory duties. BXA agrees that part 732 is not
controlling for purposes of describing the requirements of the EAR; the
parts of the EAR referenced in the steps are controlling. For this
reason, part 732 must reference the regulatory provisions in the other
parts of the EAR.
    An organization of trade associations, supported by several other
commenters, suggested several additional drafting changes to improve
the part on steps. Nearly all of those recommendations are included in
this interim rule.

Part 734--Scope

    This part establishes the rules for determining whether
commodities, software, technology, software and activities of U.S. and
foreign persons are subject to the EAR. ``Subject to the EAR'' is a
term used to identify the items and activities that BXA regulates under
the EAR. Those items and activities not so identified are not regulated
under the EAR.
    The term ``subject to the EAR'' does not imply that a license is
required for any particular item or activity. Licensing requirements
are spelled out in other parts of the EAR. The term does define the
bounds of the authority that BXA has exercised under the EAR. The term
is particularly useful to define the limits of the recordkeeping
requirements, certain denial orders, and the end use and end user
obligations related to proliferation controls.

[[Page 12717]]

    This part also provides certain key terms and principles used
throughout this interim rule. These include definitions for the terms
``export'' and ``reexport.'' A comprehensive listing of definitions is
included in part 772.
    In addition to a change in designation from part 732 in the
proposed rule to part 734 in this interim rule, this interim rule makes
substantial changes in part 734 as a result of comments received on the
proposed rule. BXA received 31 comments on this part. BXA has adopted
many of the recommendations contained in the public comments and they
are reflected in the interim rule.
    Section 734.1 has been substantially revised. The proposed rule
included a list of all the contents to part 734 with specificity. One
commenter urged that this listing amounted to a table of contents and
recommended deletion. This interim rule follows this recommendation
and, and includes an introduction that explains the contents of this
part and how it fits into the overall structure of the EAR.
    Certain commenters recommended that definitions be included in part
772, Definitions, rather than in this part. This interim rule removes
the definitions for the terms ``item'' and ``you'', and moves them to
part 772. Because the terms ``export'' and ``reexport'' are so key to
the EAR, these terms have been retained in this section, with certain
modifications. Section 732.2(d) of the proposed rule defined exports
and reexports of technology and software, but did not include a
definition of exports and reexports of commodities. This interim rule
amends the definition of ``export'' and ``reexport'' to apply to
commodities, technology, and software.
    A number of commenters also noted that, as written in the proposed
rule, the reexport in a foreign country of technology by release by one
foreign national to another foreign national could be read to include
release of foreign-origin technology, with no United States nexus. This
interim rule limits this provision to ``items subject to the EAR'' and
thereby limits the provision to U.S.-origin technology.
    This interim rule adds three additional provisions to part 734.
Section 734.2(d)(5) reflects the principle that exports that will
transit a country on their way to a third country or are intended to be
reexported to a third country are deemed under the EAR to be exports to
the third country. This principle was not included in the proposed
rule, except as it relates to Canada (Sec. 732.12 of the proposed
rule). Section 734.2(d)(6) reflects the principle that appeared in
Sec. 732.15 of the proposed rule that an export to a territory,
possession, or department of a country is deemed under the EAR to be an
export to that country. Finally Sec. 734.2(d)(7) clarifies that
shipments among the states of the United States and its territories,
dependencies, and possessions do not constitute exports or reexports.
    A significant number of commenters indicated that the provision
regarding Canada in Sec. 732.15 of the proposed rule was misleading and
tended to confuse the distinction between the scope of the EAR and
licensing requirements with respect to Canada. BXA agrees, and this
interim rule omits this provision. The minimal number of instances
where licenses are required for Canada is reflected on the CCL and does
not need to be recited in this part. As noted above, the in-transit and
intended reexport principles contained in the Canada provision are
retained in this interim rule and are made applicable to all
destinations. Finally, any License Exceptions that apply to Canada are
reflected in part 740, License Exceptions.
    In the proposed rule, BXA invited comments on the implementation of
a de minimis rule for software and technology. In particular, BXA said
that we were considering a requirement for a one-time report on
calculations under the de minimis rule. Throughout the comment period,
BXA made clear at the town-hall fora that there are three criteria of
concern in carrying out the proposal without a reporting requirement.
First, for transfers between related parties, the export price of the
software or technology exported from the United States must reflect an
arms-length price or fair market value. Second, estimates of future
sales of foreign-made software must be reasonable. Third, selection of
the scope of foreign technology for measuring U.S.-content must be
reasonable.
    BXA sought comments and suggestions on a one-time report. This was
to determine how to avoid the potential misuse of the above criteria
without requiring a one-time report. BXA also sought comments on
whether the calculations should be made only under United States-based
generally accepted accounting principles. From the outset, BXA
concluded that strict accounting standards would be useful to prevent
misuse of the rule through unreasonably low transfer prices for U.S.
software or technology transferred to related parties. BXA also
believed there is no need to create a new U.S. accounting standard for
implementation of this rule.
    No commenter offered a solution to avoid misuses in the choice
amortization assumptions for software and the selection of an
appropriate universe to measure U.S.-content in foreign commingled
technology. All comments on the report opposed its requirement.
Commenters supported the rule with the hope that the de minimis
exclusion might be granted by BXA without requiring a report. However,
many of these same firms acknowledge that they and foreign parents,
subsidiaries and customers will invariably make de minimis calculations
on valuation assumptions most likely to result in a finding that U.S.
content is below the relevant de minimis level. The tenor of the
comments also suggests that most commenters did not fully appreciate
that the de minimis relief could not likely be granted without either a
one-time report or some other means to avoid the potential misuses of
the criteria.
    Some commenters called the report a burden almost as heavy as the
license requirement. Some of those commenters stated expresses a belief
that the existing rule is simply not enforced and likely is not
enforceable. They also concluded that compliance with the existing
commingled rule is weak. However, some commenters acknowledged that
without a report requirement in this interim rule, they would
nonetheless submit advisory requests before relying on the de minimis
exclusions. Such advisory requests would require the same information
as the report required by this interim rule. Therefore for such
companies, the report requirement of this interim rule does not add
costs for use of the relief granted by this interim rule.
    Almost all foreign commenters on the de minimis rule opposed a
requirement for U.S. accounting standards. They argued that they should
be permitted to use their home-country accounting standards and that
use of U.S. accounting standards would be too costly.
    BXA has determined to require a one-time report and to permit
various accounting standards so long as the export price is not
depreciated or otherwise reduced by accounting conventions. With the
requirement of a one-time report, there is far less need for a single,
strict accounting standard.
    The report will require a description of the nature and export
price of the item exported from the United States, the estimate of
future software sales in units and value along with the basis for those
estimates within the relevant market category, and a description of the
technology and its value for

[[Page 12718]]
purposes of determining the U.S.-content of technology. The report will
not require information regarding destinations and end-users for
reexport.
    BXA has concluded after interagency consultations and review of all
the comments that the so-called amortization problem exists for
software and does not exist for commodities. Several commenters have
asked why.
    Unlike parts incorporated into end products, the cost of U.S.
software code will be attributed or allocated to the future sales of
foreign-made software incorporating the U.S. code. In making this
calculation for foreign software, you must make an estimate of future
software sales of that software if it is commingled with or
incorporated with the U.S. code. Unless there is a one-time report
revealing the assumptions of such calculations, foreign firms may
misuse the de minimis rule and make unrealistic assumptions of large
future sales. Such a misuse can result in U.S.-content that is unfairly
estimated to be below the de minimis level.
    BXA has concluded after interagency consultations and review of all
the comments that the so-call universe problem exists for technology
and not for commodities. Several commenters have asked why.
    There is the risk that foreign firms will select excessively large
categories of foreign technology for division into the U.S.-origin
technology content. There is no regulatory criteria or standard that is
sufficient to describe the scope of foreign technology that must be
divided into the U.S. technology to determine the percentage of U.S.-
content. The possible choices of a universe by the reexporter are many
and varied.
    Some commenters wanted BXA to select one U.S. transfer pricing
standard such as the standard of the Internal Revenue Service found in
section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code. One software producer
indicated that it will have very difficult decisions to make in the
calculation of U.S.-content for purposes of foreign-made software and
asked BXA how it would be done. In this interim rule, we indicate that
accepted accounting standards such as section 482, its implementing
rules, and related ruling provide one option the exporter or reexport
may follow. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) is considering uniform transfer pricing rules, and such
international standards would present an attractive option in the
future. However, it will likely be at least a year before they put such
OECD standards in place. Other commenters said that their firms do not
maintain adequate records to perform calculations of U.S.-content. Of
course, for such firms, any value-based de minimis rule will not
relieve existing burdens regardless of the report requirement.
    For decades, all reexport controls under the EAR extended to
foreign software and technology incorporating any level of U.S.-
content. BXA refers to this as the commingled rule. In 1988, BXA
proposed giving some relief from the commingled rule with a type of
shifting of presumptions regarding country of origin after a period of
time. With one exception, commenters opposed that proposed rule and
urged a value-based de minimis exclusion. BXA addressed the issue in
its February 1994 proposed renewal of the Export Administration Act.
That proposal would have compelled a de minimis exclusion from the
commingled rule and reserved the authority of the Executive Branch to
require a one-time report.
    BXA believes that it is appropriate to put reasonable limits on the
reach of U.S. reexport controls for foreign-made software and
technology. This is to recognize the sensitivities of other nations and
to put some outer limits on the obligations of foreign firms doing
business with U.S. firms. However, it is not the purpose of this
exercise to eliminate reexport controls on software and technology.
Reexport controls remain tools of the EAR to prevent diversion contrary
to vital national security, nonproliferation, and foreign policy
interests of the United States.
    BXA understands that some foreign firms will benefit from the
relief offered in this interim rule and will use this relief by filing
the necessary report. For such firms, the de minimis rule and related
report is not a new licensing requirement. Rather, it is a means for
BXA to assure that the above described three criteria are not misused
in a given set of calculations and assumptions. The report is required
under a ``report and wait'' procedure. If the reporting firm does not
hear from BXA within thirty days, then the reporting firm may
thereafter rely upon its reported calculations, and its foreign
technology or software described in the filed report is not subject to
the EAR.
    For those reexporters without the desire or ability to take
advantage of the de minimis rule, their position under the EAR remains
unchanged in any respect by this interim rule. The commingled rule
continues to apply as it has for decades. One commenter said that the
report requirement would make enforcement easier for BXA than under the
existing rule. BXA does not believe that to be true. The existing rule
is clear.
    Reexporters should also be mindful that many authorities for
permissive reexports remain available to overcome reexport
prohibitions. The de minimis exclusion from the commingle rule
determines whether foreign technology or software is subject to the
EAR. If certain commingled foreign technology or software is subject to
the EAR, then the general prohibitions and License Exceptions define
the obligations of the holder of that technology and software.
    This interim rule also makes several changes to Sec. 734.3, Items
Subject to the EAR. In the proposed rule, foreign made products subject
to the EAR were separately in Sec. 732.4. These provisions dealing with
foreign made products are now included in Sec. 734.3, together with
other items subject to the EAR. This interim rule consolidates all
related principles in one section.
    A number of commenters questioned whether BXA intended to limit the
coverage of items subject to the EAR only to ``U.S.-origin'' items as
reflected in Sec. 732.2(a) of the proposed rule. This interim rule
clarifies the intent of the proposed rule and the BXA practice related
to this issue. Specifically, this interim rule has asserted
jurisdiction over all items subject to the EAR exported from the United
States, whether of U.S. or foreign origin, but in practice has limited
other controls, such as reexport controls, over EAR-controlled items to
those of U.S. origin. Section 734.3(a) of this interim rule reflects
these provisions. Section 734.3 also applies to all covered items in
the United States, and to all such items that are of U.S.-origin,
wherever located.
    This interim rule also specifically states that foreign origin
items in-transit through the United States and in U.S. foreign trade
zones are subject to the EAR. For any special licensing treatment that
may be accorded such shipments on their export from the United States,
exporters should look at the License Exceptions in part 740.
    This interim rule makes five changes to the proposed rule that are
reflected in the provisions of Sec. 734.3(b), which lists the
exclusions from items subject to the EAR.
    1. In proposed Sec. 732.3(a)(1), BXA excluded items exclusively
controlled for export or reexport by other agencies which maintain
controls for national security or foreign policy purposes. The agencies
were identified in Supplement No. 2 to proposed part 732. To reduce
cross-referencing, the agencies are now listed in part 734, and the
Supplement has been removed.
    2. This interim rule also adds a new provision that excludes from
the definition of ``items subject to the EAR''

[[Page 12719]]
items included in ECCN 0A98 in the existing EAR, such as films,
records, books, and periodicals. This provision was not included in the
proposed rule. Under the existing EAR, items included in that ECCN do
not require authorization to any destination. This interim rule has the
same result.
    3. Section 732.2(a)(3) of the proposed rule excluded security-
classified technology and software from the coverage of items ``subject
to the EAR.'' This provision was based on the theory that classified
items are controlled by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the
Department of State's Office of Defense Trade Controls. One commenter
observed that because these agencies control the export of classified
items as part of their ``exclusive'' jurisdiction, no specific
provision needs to appear for classified items. To avoid confusion,
this interim rule omits the reference to classified items. The
provision is already implicitly included in part 734 because items
controlled exclusively for export by another agency are not subject to
the EAR (Sec. 734.3(b)(1)).
    4. This interim rule also adopts the term ``publicly available
information'' to refer to all information included in General License
GTDA of the existing EAR. Such information is listed in
Sec. 734.3(b)(3). In the proposed rule, the term ``publicly available''
applied solely to information that was ``generally accessible to the
interested public in any form''. This interim rule adopts the term
``published information'' to represent such generally accessible
information.
    5. A number of commenters objected to the use of the term ``Not on
List'' or ``NOL'' to designate and clear for export those items which
are subject to the EAR but which do not appear on the CCL. This interim
rule drops this term, which will be discussed in greater detail under
part 758, General Export Clearance Requirements. However, in response
to written comments and audience comments at the town-hall fora, BXA
will designate such items under ``EAR99.'' This designation, discussed
in Sec. 734.3(c) of this interim rule, will be used for classification
and reference purposes only, and will not be required for clearing
exports.
    One commenter recommended that items subject to the EAR be
specifically limited to exports and reexports because BXA's statutory
authority relates to controlling exports and reexports. This interim
rule does not adopt this recommendation because the term ``subject to
the EAR'' defines the scope of EAR jurisdiction. The prohibition on
exports and reexports of such items based on BXA's statutory authority
is reflected in part 736, Prohibitions.
    Finally, this interim rule expands Supplement No. 2 to include a
requirement for the submission of a report to be submitted to BXA if an
exporter uses the de minimis for technology or software.

Part 736--General Prohibitions

    Part 736 includes ten general prohibitions. These are the
prohibitions that may apply to items subject to the scope of the EAR as
described in part 734, Scope. General Prohibitions One, Two, and Three
are product controls. The Commerce Control List in Supplement No. 1 to
part 774 and the Country Chart in Supplement No. 1 to part 738 are used
together to define the product scope and destinations for the license
requirements of General Prohibitions One, Two, and Three. General
Prohibitions Four through Ten describe certain activities that are not
permitted without authorization from BXA.
    Several commenters recommended liberalization of the existing
reexport controls. For example, one commenter suggested a license free
zone for all members of the former Coordinating Committee on Export
Controls (COCOM), the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the
Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), and the Australia Group (AG). BXA notes
that a provision in the Export Administration Act of 1979 compels
individual validated licenses for items controlled cooperatively by
members of the MTCR. BXA is aware of the interest of the exporting
community in the further expansion of license free zones. However, this
interim rule is not intended to address such fundamental policy
decisions and is not an appropriate vehicle to make such changes.
    Some commenters urged BXA to create a separate part for reexport
controls or a separate guideline for reexports. Others supported this
view and indicated that it was convenient for them to photocopy newly
designated part 774A and send this to firms abroad. BXA believes that
part 774A of the EAR does not describe all the duties of reexporters;
and reliance upon a reading of only that portion of the regulations
could well lead to violations of other portions of the EAR. In response
to these comments, BXA has taken care in this interim rule to indicate
which requirements of the EAR apply to reexporters and which
requirements do not. Part 732, Steps contains explicit indications of
applicability of various provisions to reexporters. As suggested by
several commenters, part 732, Steps has been substantially expanded to
present a road map for the use of these provisions by reexporters.
    The foreign-produced direct product control described in General
Prohibition Three reflects a policy prompted by the Cold War. The
Regulations and Procedures Technical Advisory Committee (RPTAC)
recommended that BXA not revise this policy during the drafting period
that led to the proposed rule. After publication of this interim rule,
BXA will initiate a policy review of the foreign-produced direct
product rule.
    All ten general prohibitions in this part 736 apply to firms abroad
under some circumstances. Part 734, Scope defines the scope of the
regulations for foreign as well as domestic firms. The key factors that
make all ten general prohibitions applicable to foreign firms are the
scope of the parts and components rule, the foreign-produced direct
product rule, and the general prohibition regarding reexports of U.S.-
origin items. These are described in detail in part 732, Steps; part
734, Scope; and part 736, General Prohibitions with specific references
to reexporters.
    One commenter asked if we would add a provision regarding the
applicability of License Exceptions to General Prohibition Eight
concerning the unlading of goods in certain countries. The structure of
this prohibition is that it applies only to exports and reexports that
require a license. By definition, if you properly use a License
Exception authorized by the EAR, General Prohibition Eight does not
apply. Rather, it is a prohibition against unlading items that are
shipped under a license. Exporters and carriers should note that BXA
plans to conduct a policy review of the country scope of General
Prohibition Eight following the publication of this interim rule.
    Several commenters stated that the proposed rule continued to
present a complex set of requirements, and many commenters suggested
fundamental decontrols and elimination of longstanding regulatory
requirements. Such recommendations would necessary entail changes to
the general prohibitions. However, the Regulation Reform exercise was
not intended to address such fundamental policy decisions, and this
interim rule is not an appropriate vehicle to make such changes.
    Supplement No. 1 to part 736 on General Prohibitions provides for
certain General Orders. At this time, Supplement No. 1 is reserved.
Supplement No. 2 to part 736 provides

[[Page 12720]]
for three Administrative Orders. These Administrative Orders continue
polices of the existing regulations regarding the technical advisory
committees, business conduct before BXA, and certain confidentiality
provisions.

Part 738--Commerce Control List Overview and Country Chart

    Part 738 provides an overview of the Commerce Control List (CCL)
and the Country Chart. The complete CCL is contained in Supplement No.
1 to part 774, while the Country Chart is contained in this part.
    A significant change to the proposed rule as it relates to the CCL
is the modification of the numbering system used to identify Export
Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) to conform with the European
Union (EU) numbering system as described in the supplementary
information regarding the CCL. This part provides an overview of the
new CCL structure and ECCN numbering system along with a thorough
discussion of the components that make up an ECCN.
    This interim rule eliminates the use of the term ``License
Alternative'' and the ``Special Comprehensive License'' reference as
described in the proposed rule. In addition, this interim rule adopts
the revised reasons for control as identified in the proposed rule
(i.e., use of the broad term ``FP'' has been discontinued). New
``Related Definition'' and ``Related Controls'' sections contained in
the proposed rule have also been adopted in this interim rule.
    Several commenters described use of the Country Chart column
identifier in the ``License Requirement'' section of each ECCN as a
rational model and fundamental to simplifying the task of determining
licensing requirements. This interim rule retains this very valuable
tool with few modifications.
    The Country Chart, as described in the proposed rule, has been
modified to incorporate columns for destinations eligible for General
License GCT and GNSG under the existing EAR. General License GCT
eligibility is now determined by NS Column 2, while NP Column 1 now
reflects General License GNSG eligibility. NP Column 2 is retained in
its original format as reflected in the proposed rule. Accordingly,
references to License Exceptions CSR and NSG in the ``License
Exceptions'' section within each entry on the Commerce Control List do
not appear in this interim rule.
    A few commenters noted that the proposed title to part 738,
Commerce Control List and Country Chart implies that the entire CCL is
contained in part 738. The title to this part has been modified to
state this part contains an overview of the CCL structure and its
relationship to the Country Chart, rather than the actual CCL.
    Two commenters noted that the cross-reference to part 742, Control
Policy--CCL Based Controls should be clarified. This interim rule
contains a more descriptive cross-reference to part 742 and is placed
in a more appropriate location.
    A few commenters expressed confusion over the use of UN Column 1.
This interim rule removes UN Column 1, because of its limited scope of
control and for added clarity. In addition, this interim rule revises
the two instances in which the Country Chart is not consulted to
determine license requirements. This interim rule expands the proposed
list of ECCNs in which the Country Chart cannot be used from 5A80D
(5A980) to include 1A988, 2A994, 2D994, 2E994, 2B985, 0A983, 0A986, and
0A988.
    This interim rule does not adopt the request made by a few
commenters that the Country Chart be expanded to incorporate the
Country Group identification as described in part 740, License
Exceptions. These two lists were developed for separate purposes and
allow for systematic licensing determinations (e.g., Country Groups are
not reviewed unless a license is required by the Country Chart). In
addition, incorporation increases the possibility that readers will
make incorrect license determinations.
    This interim rule expands the example for using the CCL and Country
Chart to illustrate more complex fact patterns, as requested by a
commenter.

Part 740--License Exceptions

    Part 740 provides for exceptions from license requirements similar
to the General Licenses contained in the existing regulations. In
addition to License Exceptions for commodities, this part contains
License Exceptions for software and technology and permissive
reexports. Previously, both technical data and reexports had separate
parts. License Exceptions for short supply commodities appear in part
754.
    Eligibility for License Exceptions may be based on the item to be
exported or reexported, the country of ultimate destination, the end-
use of the item, or the end-user. If a License Exception is available
for a particular transaction, the exporter or reexporter may proceed
with the export or reexport without a license. However, the exporter or
reexporter is required to meet all the terms of the License Exception;
in using a License Exception, the exporter or reexporter will be
certifying that all terms, conditions, and provisions for the use of
that License Exception have been met.
    The most significant departure in this interim rule from the
proposed rule is the changed relationship between the determination of
the applicability of a License Exception to a particular transaction
and the documenting of that transaction for export clearance purposes.
Previously, each License Exception bore a three-character symbol that
transferred directly to shipping documents to certify that the
transaction did not require a license and that it met the terms and
condition of the stated License Exception. In this interim rule, each
three-character symbol that will be used on shipping documents
represents a group of License Exceptions rather than a single License
Exception. This change means that a few symbols will cover a large
percentage of shipments from the United States. Each symbol bears an
intuitive relationship to its group of License Exceptions; for example,
those based on the Commerce Control List bear the symbol ``LST.'' Some
commenters wished to retain the old General License symbols, but a
preponderance of exporters preferred intuitive symbols and expressed
that preference at the numerous town-hall fora held around the country.
    Many commenters on the proposed rule protested that certain
existing General Licenses--specifically GLR and GTDU--had been
needlessly fragmented. In this interim rule, these License Exceptions
have been consolidated into Servicing and Replacement (RPL) and
Technology and Software--Unrestricted (TSU), respectively. General
Licenses GCT and GNSG in the existing EAR, which appeared as License
Exceptions CSR and NSG in the proposed rule, have in this interim rule
been incorporated into the Country Chart in part 738.
    Changes made in General Licenses in the intervening period between
publication of the proposed rule and this interim rule, including G-
BETA for beta test software, G-CTP for computers, and a modification of
GCG (shipments to cooperating governments), are reflected in part 740.
The former Humanitarian License Procedure, which was included in the
Embargo part of the proposed rule, has become a License Exception for
humanitarian donations.

Part 742--Control Policy--CCL-Based Controls

    If you have determined that a license application must be filed
after reviewing the Country Chart in part 738 and the Commerce Control
List (CCL) in part 774, this part 742 provides the licensing

[[Page 12721]]
policy that BXA will apply in reviewing your application. This part
contains licensing review policies for all items listed on the CCL
except items controlled for ``short supply'' reasons or to implement
``U.N. Sanctions.'' It consolidates most of newly designated part 785A,
Special Country Policies, portions of newly designated part 776A,
Special Commodity Policies and all the CCL-based controls described in
newly designated part 778A, Proliferation Controls. It also includes
control policies for items included on the CCL but not reflected in the
Country Chart. Specifically, these items are high performance
computers, implements of torture, and communications intercepting
devices.
    Part 742 does not include controls and licensing polices that apply
to exports and reexports to embargoed destinations (currently, Cuba,
Libya, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, and the Bosnian-Serb controlled areas
of Bosnia-Herzegovina), except a description of anti-terrorism controls
applicable to Iran (Sec. 742.8) and other terrorist-designated
countries (Supplement No. 2 to part 742). Part 746, Embargoes and Other
Special Controls, covers the licensing policies for embargoed
destinations.
    This part is structured to assist exporters to easily retrieve
licensing information related to the reason for control for each item
listed on the CCL. Each ``Reason for Control'' column on the Country
Chart in part 738 has a counterpart section in part 742. The sections
in this part appear consecutively in the same order as the columns on
the chart, reading from left to right. In addition, each section is
similarly structured:

--Paragraph (a) lists the licensing requirements as stated on the CCL;
--Paragraph (b) provides the licensing policy for specific controls on
the CCL;
--Paragraph (c) describes any contract sanctity dates that apply to
particular controls; and
--paragraph (d) provides information concerning any multilateral
cooperation that may apply to a particular control.

    BXA believes that the structure and organization of this part is a
significant improvement over the existing EAR. It enables an exporter
to retrieve specific licensing information relevant to each ECCN on the
CCL without having to review extraneous material.
    Changes were made in Sec. 742.1, Introduction, to accurately
describe the structure of this interim rule. Paragraph (c) was added to
make clear that controls on embargoed destinations, other than anti-
terrorism controls, are covered in part 746, Embargoes and Other
Special Controls and do not appear in this part 742. Paragraph (d)
generally describes anti-terrorism controls maintained by BXA.
Paragraph (e) reminds the reader that items not listed on the CCL are
nonetheless subject to the end-use and end-user provisions described in
part 744, Control Policy--End-user/End-use Based.
    In addition, this interim rule contains changes that implement
regulations which were issued by BXA but were not reflected in the
proposed rule. The interim rule also reflects changes made in response
to public comments on the proposed rule.
    On May 6, 1995, the President issued Executive Order 12959,
imposing a virtual embargo on exports of any goods, technology or
devices to Iran and on certain reexports of U.S.-origin goods or
technology. (The Treasury Department, Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC), has principal responsibility for implementing E.O. 12959.)
Because of the virtual embargo on exports to Iran, provisions dealing
with Iran, except anti-terrorism controls, have been shifted to part
746, Embargoes and Other Special Controls. In this interim rule,
Sec. 742.8 describes anti-terrorism controls on exports and reexports
to Iran that BXA continues to maintain while the comprehensive embargo
administered by OFAC is in effect.
    This interim rule also includes new anti-terrorism controls on
Sudan, described in Sec. 742.10 and in Supplement No. 2 to part 742.
The Department will also publish these controls in the format of newly
designated part 785A and related parts. The items controlled for anti-
terrorism reasons to Sudan include explosive device detectors, which
have been moved into a new ECCN. The anti-terrorism control on
explosive device detectors also applies to Syria and Iran.
    Since the publication of the proposed rule, the Department has
issued a new regulation on exports of specially designed implements of
torture (60 FR 58512). This regulation moved specially designed
implements of torture from Export Commerce Control Number (ECCN) 0A82C
to a new ECCN, 0A83D, and required a license to all destinations,
including Canada. The changes made by that regulation are reflected in
the interim rule. Proposed Sec. 742.7 (Crime Control) is revised to
eliminate references to implements of torture, and a new Sec. 742.11
(Specially Designed Implements of Torture) is added to this interim
rule.
    The President announced a revision of U.S. export controls on
computers on October 6, 1995 that affects the supercomputer controls
contained in part 742 (Sec. 742.12) of the proposed rule. The
Department published the revised regulations on January 25, 1996 (61 FR
2099). Section 742.12 has been retitled ``High performance computers''
in this interim rule and describes the license requirements and
licensing policies applicable to four ``tiers'' of countries.
Supplement No. 3 to part 742 describes licensing safeguard conditions
that may be imposed on exports of high performance computers to certain
destinations.
    Twelve commenters included comments on part 742 in their
submissions. A number of commenters pointed out technical mistakes and
omissions in part 742. These are corrected in this interim rule.
Following is a discussion of other comments submitted.
    Two commenters questioned the appropriateness of continuing
controls on exports to members of a given multilateral control regime
of items controlled by that regime. No License Exceptions are available
for items controlled for missile technology reasons because a provision
in the Export Administration Act requires individual validated licenses
to all destinations. Section 742.2(a)(2) of this interim rule states
that licenses are not required for exports of the listed chemicals to
Australia Group member countries. This interim rule revises
Sec. 742.3(a)(1) to inform the exporter that no license is required for
exports of certain nuclear proliferation controlled items to Nuclear
Suppliers Group (NSG) member countries. Finally, this interim rule
describes, in Sec. 742.4(a), a new national security control level,
denoted by ``NS Column 2'' in the Country Chart, which indicates that
no license is required for exports to Country Group A:1 and cooperating
countries.
    One commenter noted that proposed Supplement No. 2, listing
countries that are party to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of
Nuclear Weapons and to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons in Latin America, required updating. Because the list of
countries party to these treaties is constantly changing, BXA decided
to remove this Supplement rather than risk publishing an inaccurate or
outdated list. BXA will maintain and make available to interested
persons a current list of the countries party to these treaties.
    One commenter suggested that part 738, Commerce Control List
Overview; part 742, Control Policy--CCL Based

[[Page 12722]]
Controls; and part 774, The Commerce Control List be combined, since
they all concern the Commerce Control List. BXA did not adopt this
recommendation. Each of the three parts provides a view of controls
from a different vantage point: Part 738 by country; part 742 by type
of control; and part 774 by type of item. BXA believes that
consolidating the three parts into one would make the interim rule more
unwieldy and difficult to use.
    Two commenters recommended that contract sanctity provisions be
established for nuclear nonproliferation, national security, regional
stability, crime control or computer controls. BXA did not establish
contract sanctity in this interim rule. Decisions on contract sanctity
dates are made when new controls are imposed. This interim rule does
not impose any new controls. Accordingly, no changes have been made in
contract sanctity provisions.
    Two commenters stated that Sec. 742.2(d) (chemical and biological
weapons), Sec. 742.4(d) (national security) and Sec. 742.5(d) (missile
technology) incorrectly state that U.S. controls are consistent with
multilateral agreements. BXA does not agree with this comment. The only
change that BXA is making in this interim rule is to reserve
Sec. 742.4(d). On December 19, 1995, the United States and twenty-seven
other countries, including its NATO allies and Russia, agreed to
establish a new multilateral export control arrangement. The Wassenaar
Arrangement for Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-use
Goods and Technologies (``Wassenaar Arrangement'') is expected to be
operational later in 1996. Any EAR changes that may be needed to carry
out the Wassenaar Arrangement will be made at the appropriate time.
    A commenter suggested that License Exception NSG be extended to
South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico. License Exception NSG has been removed
in this interim rule. Instead, items on the CCL with ``NP Column 1'' in
the Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section of an
ECCN do not require a license to NSG member countries. The commenter's
suggestion has not been adopted by BXA for Taiwan and Mexico because
the regulations simplification initiative was not intended to make
substantive changes in license requirements. However, recent regulatory
changes have extended such treatment to South Korea, and that change is
incorporated into this interim rule.
    One commenter questioned why ECCN 5A80 (communications intercepting
devices) of the proposed rule is not included in Sec. 742.7 (Crime
Control). These items are regulated under separate statutory authority
and licensing criteria. Items controlled under Sec. 742.7 are those
agreed to pursuant to section 6(n) of the Export Administration Act.
Controls on communications intercepting devices are maintained in
accordance with the Omnibus Crime Controls and Safe Streets Act of
1968, and are therefore separately controlled under Sec. 742.13.

Part 744--Control Policy--End-User/End-Use Based

    This part contains prohibitions against exports, reexports, and
activities related to certain end-uses and end-users. Specifically,
Sec. 744.2 prohibits exports and reexports of items subject to the EAR,
without a license, if at the time of the export or reexport you know
that the item will be used in nuclear explosive, or other safeguarded
or unsafeguarded nuclear activities. Section 744.3 prohibits the export
or reexport, without a license, of certain items to be used for missile
end-uses. Similarly, Sec. 744.4 prohibits the export or reexport of
items with certain chemical and biological weapon end-uses. Next,
Sec. 744.5 prohibits the export or reexport of items to be used for
specified nuclear maritime end-uses.
    Section 744.6 places restrictions on certain proliferation-related
activities of U.S. persons. For purposes of this prohibition the term
``U.S. person'' means citizens, permanent resident aliens, or protected
individuals as defined in the immigration laws; any juridical person
organized under the laws of the United States or any U.S. jurisdiction;
and any person physically in the United States. This part also contains
prohibitions against exports, reexports, and certain transfers to
specified end-users. Section 744.7 imposes restrictions on certain
exports to and for the use of certain foreign vessels or aircraft, and
Sec. 744.8 places restrictions on certain exports to all countries for
Libyan aircraft.
    Commenters urged BXA to publish a positive list of items and limit
the applicability of the nonproliferation related end-use restrictions
to items on such a positive list. In addition, commenters asked BXA to
publish certain names of end-users as to which individual exporters
have been ``informed'' that a license is required by reason of
Sec. 744.2(b), Sec. 744.3(b), Sec. 744.4(b), and Sec. 744.6(b). BXA is
working within the Administration toward these objectives; however,
these are major policy initiatives, they are not part of this interim
rule, and they are not necessary to achieve the goals of the
Regulations Reform exercise.
    Commenters suggested that under Sec. 744.2(b) the discretion of BXA
to inform an exporter of the trustworthiness of certain end users
should be a duty of BXA rather than an option of BXA. The U.S.
Government will retain this discretion because of the overriding
interests in protecting sources and methods of intelligence gathering
and the interests in law enforcement objectives that on occasion
require flexibility on the part of the government.
    One commenter urged BXA to make clearer the treatment of technology
that historically was authorized for export under General License GTDA.
In the proposed rule, BXA excluded such information from the scope of
the EAR. That approach is retained in this interim rule and clarified
in the steps that have been added to part 732, Steps to suggest methods
for using part 734, Scope of the EAR. Items not subject to the scope of
the EAR are not subject to any prohibition of the EAR.
    Section 744.2(b) contains provisions designed to standardize the
procedure for informing exporters that a particular party may present
an unacceptable risk of diversion contrary to nuclear policies. Some
commenters applauded this addition, and one opposed it. BXA will
maintain this provision because the procedural discipline it provides
should prove useful for both BXA and exporters. This provision does not
change BXA's substantive authorities under the EAR.
    One commenter suggested additional cross-references to the license
review policies for items subject to, for example, missile technology
controls identified on the CCL based upon product parameters rather
than a prohibited end-use. In the proposed rule and in this interim
rule, the license review standard for applications required by reason
of the product parameters designated on the CCL are listed in part 742,
Control Policy--CCL Based Controls. The license review standards for
license requirements defined by end-uses described in part 744 are
contained in part 744. Because of the criticism of some commenters that
the proposed rule contained too many cross-references, BXA has
concluded in this instance that additional cross-references are not
advisable.
    This interim rule continues existing policy regarding the country
scope of the nuclear end-use prohibition. A new Supplement No. 3 is
added to the part and referenced at Sec. 744.2(a) to exempt designated
countries from this prohibition, and those are the same countries that
are exempt under the

[[Page 12723]]
existing EAR. This is a change from the proposed rule.
    One commenter suggested that BXA remove from Sec. 744.6 words that
indicate defined activities are prohibited in the United States. This
interim rule accepts this recommendation. One commenter complained that
Sec. 744.6 applies to less than all countries in Country Group D:1. The
exclusion of Romania and China is consistent with current policy, and
is maintained in this interim rule. BXA recognizes that such policy
decisions make the use of the Country Groups and the EAR itself more
complex. BXA hopes reviewing of provisions of the EAR in the order
recommended by the steps in part 732 will minimize this problem. BXA
intends to further address such issues in the future. However, policy
making in export controls will always present trade offs for exporters
when petitioning the government for fairness and precision of export
control policy on the one hand versus simplicity and ease of
administration for the public on the other.
    The proposed Sec. 744.6(a)(2) prohibited certain U.S. person
activities related to nuclear explosives devices. It was removed from
this interim rule because such activity is prohibited under the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR 120-130), which
regulate defense services for all destinations.

Part 746--Embargoes and Other Special Controls

    Part 746 of the proposed rule contained controls for Cuba, Libya,
Iraq, North Korea, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro), indicating where jurisdiction was divided between BXA and
the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. It
also contained controls implementing U.N. sanctions resulting in
additional EAR controls on Rwanda.
    Controls on Iran, embargoed because of Executive Order 12959 of May
6, 1995, have been added to part 746 in this interim rule. With the
suspension of the embargo on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia
and Montenegro), controls on that country, as well as on certain areas
of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzgovina, have been shifted to a Supplement to
part 746. Commenters pointed out that ECCN 0A95, which released food
and medical supplies to Libya from reexport control, was unaccounted
for in the proposed rule; that oversight has been corrected. The former
Humanitarian License Procedure, which was included in the Embargo part
of the proposed rule, has become a License Exception for humanitarian
donations and is in part 740 of this interim rule.
    Finally, this part includes Supplements containing general
information on embargoes and sanctions administered by other federal
agencies.

Part 748--Applications (Classification, Advisory, and License) and
Documentation

    Part 748 describes the procedures for submitting license
applications, classification requests and advisory opinions. This
interim rule places information from throughout the existing EAR into
one part. It is intended to provide the reader with all information
necessary to submit an application to BXA.
    This interim rule adopts use of the new Form BXA-748P for the
submission of license applications and classification requests, but not
advisory opinions. Most commenters favored the use of one form for both
exports and reexports. This interim rule clarifies the definition of
advisory opinions and states they must be submitted in writing via
letter. Commenters were evenly split regarding the proposal to require
use of Form BXA-748P for advisory opinions. One commenter proposed
adopting the form for use when submitting end-user requests. This
suggestion along with one recommending the elimination of unit and
total price boxes are not adopted in this interim rule. A number of
commenters also queried whether BXA intends to republish the Forms
Supplement contained in the existing loose leaf EAR subscription. BXA
will republish the Forms Supplement in the subscription to the EAR
offered by the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). The Forms
Supplement is not published in the Code of Federal Regulations.
    Sections in part 748 have been redesignated to better describe each
section's contents. The addresses in Sec. 748.2 and Sec. 748.14 have
been placed in one section. Procedures for submitting applications
electronically have been placed in a separate section for easier
access. For continuity, the unique license requirements for specific
items or transactions have been placed in a separate Supplement No. 2
to this part. This change will allow readers to determine quickly
whether the unique requirements apply to their transaction, and if not,
to continue quickly with sections relating to support documents.
Instructions for completing Form BXA-748P contained in Supplement No. 1
to part 748 have been clarified in response to comments posed by both
the public and BXA employees.
    On the suggestion of one commenter, a reminder that information
submitted under the Export Administration Act will be treated in
accordance with provisions stated in section 12(c) of the act has been
added in this interim rule in Sec. 748.1(c).
    The section on license application support documents has been
revised to eliminate one step in the decision tree. The questions
contained in Sec. 748.10(a)(3) in the proposed rule have been combined
into one question in this interim rule. Some commenters noted that
exceptions for obtaining support documents have decreased in certain
circumstances. The changes announced in the proposed rule were due
largely to the changing export control environment and proliferation
credentials of various countries. Accordingly, this interim rule adopts
the requirements contained in the proposed rule with a few
modifications. This interim rule also adopts the two year validity
period for the Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser.
    A few commenters noted that though the development of decision
trees will assist in determining support document requirements, BXA
should consider the development of a matrix or chart similar to that
contained in part 775 of the existing rule. Though a chart has not been
included in this interim rule, BXA will explore development of a new
matrix/chart based on the support document decision tress in this part.
This interim rule also eliminates the last letter in the Export Control
Classification Number contained in the existing rule. This letter had
been used previously to designate support document requirements, but is
no longer necessary.
    A few commenters requested additional guidance on what constitutes
an emergency and clarification of validity periods as they relate to
licenses approved under emergency processing. This interim rule
clarifies the validity period by cross-referencing the appropriate
section in part 750, but does not provide additional language to be
used by applicants when submitting emergency requests. In order to
retain the emergency nature of these requests, this interim rule does
not adopt the suggestion by one commenter to increase the validity
period from 30 to 60 days for applications involving reexports.
    Commenters were evenly split regarding the elimination of Form BXA-
685P for amendments with a few stating the elimination of this form is
long overdue. This interim rule adopts the intent to eliminate Form
BXA-685P along with Form BXA-648. Changes not

[[Page 12724]]
listed in Sec. 750.7(c) will require the submission of a Replacement
application. One commenter stated the time period for the return of
Delivery Verifications to BXA was reduced with elimination of Form BXA-
648. The existing rule states the time frame as ``a reasonable time
after the last shipment'' while the instructions contained in the
existing Form BXA-648 stated the time frame as ``90 days after the last
shipment''. This interim rule eliminates this inconsistency by
establishing a 90 day time frame.
    Form BXA-711 along with its written counterpart is adopted in this
interim rule. Commenters stated the ability to use a form or letter was
a good idea.

Part 750--Application Processing, Issuance and Denial

    Part 750 describes the processing procedures and time frames for
classification requests, advisory opinion requests and license
applications. Once an applicant has prepared documents in accordance
with part 748, this part describes how the application will be handled
by BXA. The time frames detailed in this interim rule are drawn from
Executive Order No. 12981 of December 6, 1995 and the draft 1994 Export
Administration Act bill written by the Clinton Administration.
    This interim rule provides a detailed description of the
relationship between all agencies and departments involved in the
license review process as well as a description of the interagency
dispute resolution process. This part also addresses actual issuance,
validity periods, denial, revocations, suspensions, transfers,
duplicates, and shipping tolerances.
    This interim rule also eliminates the proposed exceptions to the
license processing time frames and limits all license applications to a
90 day processing time frame. A number of commenters made
recommendations for revising the time frames for the processing of
license applications as well as the types of applications subject to
Congressional notification. This interim rule incorporates the
processing time frames provided in Executive Order No. 12981.
Accordingly, recommendations to establish different time frames have
not been adopted. In addition, congressional notification requirements
for crude oil and refined petroleum products have not been adopted
since they no longer apply to the types of licenses reviewed by the
Department.
    Most commenters supported the clarification of the license
processing system and time frames. These commenters agreed that BXA has
met the goal of making the process more transparent for the exporter.
    A number of commenters requested that applicants be given the
opportunity to express their views during the license escalation
process. These commenters also requested clarification of the term
``registration'' to include language that would require prompt action
by BXA upon receipt of a license application. Both of these
recommendations have been adopted in this interim rule.
    One commenter suggested that part 756, Appeals, be combined with
this part 750 since most appeals involve license applications. This
recommendation was not adopted because the appeals process is open to
all administrative actions, not only those relating to license
applications.
    One commenter recommended simplification in the provisions for
shipping tolerances. While this recommendation has merit and may be
considered at a later date, it was not adopted in this interim rule.

Part 752--Special Comprehensive License

    Part 752 describes the provisions of the Special Comprehensive
License (SCL). The SCL consolidates the activities authorized under the
Project, Distribution, Service Supply, Service Facilities, Aircraft and
Vessel Repair Station Procedure, and Special Chemical Licenses, and
provides for additional flexibility to BXA in shaping appropriate SCLs
and internal control programs (ICPs). For example, the Project License
and Service Supply Procedure authorize exports and reexports to
countries of the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the People's
Republic of China, but the Distribution License, which includes an
extensive mandatory ICP that is not required for the Project License or
the Service Supply Procedure, does not allow exports and reexports for
distribution in these countries. This interim rule conforms item and
country eligibility under the SCL. All items subject to the EAR are
also eligible for export and reexport under the SCL, except a few
specified items. Form BXA-686P, Statement by Foreign Importer of
Aircraft or Vessel Repair Parts, which was used for certain exports
under the Aircraft and Vessel Repair Station Procedure, and Form BXA-
6026P, Service Supply License Statement by U.S. Exporter, are not used
under the SCL.
    BXA received fourteen comments on part 752. Overall, several
commenters stated that the SCL is a significant improvement over the
existing special license eligibility because it provides broader
authority to allow exports of items such as software and technology.
    Five commenters suggested that existing special license holders
retain the right to use existing special licenses until they expire,
but apply for amendments to take advantage of the increased item and
country scope of the SCL.
    This interim rule makes the SCL effective March 25, 1996. All
existing special licenses will expire on March 25, 1997, unless the
special license expires before that time by its own terms. BXA will not
grant extensions to existing special licenses. Existing special license
holders who want to take advantage of the SCL benefits, must apply for
an SCL according to part 752. BXA will not accept amendments to
outstanding special licenses.
    Eight commenters provided comments on item scope for the SCL. Most
commenters stated that the proposed rule would not authorize exports
under the SCL of items eligible for a License Exception. The proposed
rule allowed exports under the SCL of all items subject to the EAR,
including items eligible for a License Exception. However, to prevent
confusion, the interim rule specifically states in Sec. 752.1 that you
may apply for an SCL, when appropriate, in lieu of a license described
in part 748 or a License Exception described in part 740.
    Two commenters stated that the SCL should not exclude any items
because it defeats the purpose of the SCL, which is designed to allow
greater flexibility in return for increased monitoring of each shipment
by the SCL holder and consignees. One commenter added that other
agencies have the right to review the applications for an SCL, and
restrictions may be placed on a license on a case-by-case basis.
However, two commenters stated that there should be no ad-hoc
restrictions, adding that the only item restrictions should be those
published in the Federal Register, which would be applicable to all
companies.
    This interim rule retains the list of items not eligible for the
SCL in Sec. 752.3 to ensure that potential applicants are aware of the
few item restrictions before they consider applying for an SCL. If BXA
determines that an item must be added to the list to protect national
security, nonproliferation, or foreign policy interests, or determines
that an item need no longer be prohibited under the SCL, BXA will
publish a change in the Federal Register, at which time the change will
become effective and apply to all SCL and potential SCL holders.
    Another commenter was concerned about the general policy of denial
for

[[Page 12725]]
exports to destinations in Country Group D:2 of items controlled for
nuclear nonproliferation reasons, and suggested that the SCL
specifically state that items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation
reasons be authorized on a case-by-case basis provided that the
exporter has appropriate controls in place to screen for proscribed
end-uses or end-users. The Internal Control Procedures (ICPs) required
for most activities authorized under the SCL include screening elements
for proliferation end-uses. This interim rule revises the policy of
denial language found in Sec. 752.3(b) of the proposed rule to a policy
of case-by-case review. In addition, this rule retains the discretion
to deny or limit the export or reexport of all items, including those
controlled for nonproliferation reasons.
    Most commenters applauded the expansion of country scope to include
the newly independent states and Russia. However, several commenters
requested clarification that the SCL is eligible for countries such as
Slovenia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Croatia, which are eligible under
existing special licenses . One commenter stated that when BXA declares
a country ineligible to receive items under the SCL, BXA should
simultaneously list the country in the EAR, and remove it from all
SCLs.
    It is not BXA's intent to roll-back special license country
eligibility. This interim rule therefore clarifies that all countries
are eligible to receive items under the SCL except Cuba, Iran, Iraq,
Libya, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan. If BXA determines that additional
countries should become ineligible to receive items under the SCL, it
will publish the change in the Federal Register, and notify all SCL
holders.
    Four commenters suggested consolidating Sec. 752.2 into one generic
paragraph that describes the representative activities. Another
commenter stated that the SCL should not prohibit the export of service
parts or upgrades as long as it does not exceed the limits of the SCL
parameters. Section 752.2 is intended to provide illustrative examples
of the types of activities that may be approved under the SCL. It is
not intended to be an inclusive list, and other activities may be
approved on a case-by-case basis. This interim rule revises Sec. 752.2
to provide a general description of the types of activities that BXA
may approve the under the SCL. These activities fall under the general
categories of ``service'', ``end-user'', ``distribution'', and
``other'' activities.
    Four commenters provided comments on the requirement for a letter
of assurance for exports under the SCL of certain technology. One
commenter stated that the SCL expands the scope of the existing letter
of assurance required for exports under General License GTDR because it
would require the letter of assurance from each new recipient overseas.
One commenter specifically requested that the letter of assurance be
required from only one party overseas. The proposed rule did not expand
current policy. Under the existing EAR, any transfers of technical data
covered by a letter of assurance would require such assurances from any
new recipient of the technology. Two commenters indicated that
assurances are not required for exports of technology under a validated
license. But, if an assurance must be required, the assurance should be
included in the SCL certifications.
    This interim rule removes the letter of assurance requirement from
Sec. 752.5. BXA intends to review requests to export controlled
software and technology under the SCL on a case-by-case basis, and
impose conditions or restrictions as appropriate. Depending upon the
level of software or technology requested for export under the SCL,
this may include restrictions on reexport of software or technology, or
exports of direct products of the technology.
    Comments on Sec. 752.5, steps you must follow to apply for an SCL,
focused on the comprehensive narrative statement. Many commenters
stated that much of the information required in the comprehensive
narrative statement is already required on Form BXA-748P, Multipurpose
Application, or Form BXA-752, Statement by Consignee in Support of
Special Comprehensive License. Five commenters specifically requested
that the requirement to state the ratio and dollar volumes of
controlled items to those not subject to the EAR be removed, because it
is impractical to calculate and fundamentally unreliable. BXA agrees
that SCL applicants should not be required to repeat information in a
comprehensive narrative statement that is also required on Form BXA-
748P or Form BXA-752. Therefore, this interim rule includes major
revisions to the comprehensive narrative statement requirements,
limiting that statement to the information that is not required
elsewhere. This interim rule also removes the requirement to list the
items eligible for a License Exception that will be exported under the
SCL because the ICP requirements assure that appropriate controls are
in place to prevent diversion.
    One commenter stated that the application stage was too early to
provide BXA a copy of the proposed ICP, and to do so conflicts with the
certification requirements that an ICP must be in place upon approval
of the SCL. This interim rule retains, under Sec. 752.5(c)(3), the
requirement that applicants and consignees submit ICPs at the time of
application. This information is necessary for BXA to determine whether
to approve the items, activities, or countries requested on the SCL
application, or to modify your proposed ICP depending upon the nature
of the request.
    One commenter stated that BXA should not require an SCL holder to
inform all consignees of license conditions. Certain conditions may
only have relevance to one or two consignees. BXA agrees, and has
clarified in Sec. 752.9(a)(4) to state that the SCL holder must inform
all relevant consignees of all license conditions prior to making any
shipments under the SCL. Four commenters objected to the language that
refers to prior reporting of exports of certain items, which is was
included in Sec. 752.9(a)(4). This interim rule retains this language.
Exporters should note that the list of the special conditions that may
be placed on your SCL included in this section only provides examples,
and such conditions may not be included on your SCL.
    Section 752.11 describes the elements of the Internal Control
Programs (ICPs) that the SCL holder and consignee must implement upon
approval of the SCL to assure that exports and reexports are not made
contrary to the EAR. Two commenters stated that the ICP requirements
included in the proposed rule should be clear and defined, not
generalized. Three commenters suggested that EPCI screening be limited
to certain countries. Two commenters requested that BXA clarify when
the parties to the application must submit the ICP to BXA. One
commenter also requested that upon publication of the SCL, BXA publish
guidelines that further define ICP requirements.
    This interim rule also restructures Sec. 752.11 to consolidate the
elements of all three ICPs into one list, and to remove the different
levels of ICPs. This simplifies the text, and makes it more user-
friendly. This interim rule does not place country limits on screens
against customers who are known to have, or suspected of having,
unauthorized dealings with specially designated regions and countries
for which nonproliferation controls apply. Any such limits must be
approved by BXA, and are dependent upon the specific nature of your SCL
request. This interim rule also includes information in
Sec. 752.11(a)(2) on where you may obtain

[[Page 12726]]
guidelines to assist you in developing an adequate ICP.
    This interim rule also makes several other editorial changes to
part 752 to consolidate provisions and simplify the text. Section
752.10, Changes to the SCL, has been revised to clearly define the
requirements for changing an SCL. Detailed instructions on how to
complete Forms BXA-748P, Multipurpose Application, and Form BXA-752,
Statement by Consignee in Support of Special Comprehensive License, and
other forms related to applying for an SCL are included in supplements
to part 752. The servicing provision in Sec. 752.4(b) has been revised
to conform with the standard used throughout the EAR. This provision
prohibits you from servicing, under the SCL, any item when you know
that the item is owned or controlled by, or under the lease or charter
of, entities in countries not eligible for the SCL, or any nationals of
such countries. Finally, the recordkeeping provisions of Sec. 752.12
have been clarified by providing the appropriate cross-references to
part 762, which applies to all transactions subject to the EAR.

Part 754--Short Supply

    This part implements section 7 of the EAA and similar provisions in
other laws that authorize or require restrictions on exports for
reasons dealing with adequacy of supply of commodities in the United
States, as opposed to reasons based on foreign policy, national
security, or nonproliferation considerations. Specifically, this part
implements controls on exports of crude oil restricted under the EAA
and a number of other laws; on exports of petroleum products produced
or derived from the Naval Petroleum Reserves; on exports of western red
cedar as required by provisions in the EAA; and on exports of horses by
sea for the purpose of slaughter. It also provides information relating
to two provisions contained in EAA section 7: The registration of
agricultural commodities for exemption from short supply controls, and
the filing of petitions for the imposition of controls on recyclable
metallic materials.
    Consistent with the revised structure of the proposed and interim
rules, this part contains all of the requirements that apply uniquely
to commodities controlled for short supply reasons. It sets forth all
of the licensing requirements, licensing policy, License Exceptions,
and other unique requirements that apply to commodities controlled for
short supply reasons on the CCL. Short supply controlled commodities
are identified with ``SS'' under ``Reason for Control'' in each
relevant ECCN on the CCL. Other requirements of the EAR that are not
unique to short supply controls, such as recordkeeping in part 762,
also apply to items covered by this part.
    Six commenters provided comments on this part. A number of
revisions have been made to implement the recommendations contained in
the comments. Additional revisions were made to incorporate the heavy
California crude oil rule published in the Federal Register but not
included in the proposed rule.
    Commenters recommended that the definition of ``crude oil'' in
Sec. 754.2 be moved to the front of this section from paragraph (g).
The definition of ``crude oil'' is now included in paragraph (a).
    Section 754.2(b) deals with licensing policy for crude oil. It has
been revised significantly to distinguish BXA's licensing policy for
shipments of crude oil which have already been found to be in the
national interest, by Presidential decision or otherwise, e.g., crude
oil from Cook Inlet or California heavy crude, and those which will be
approved if BXA makes the necessary findings on a case-by-case review
of applications. In the proposed rule all crude oil applications would
be reviewed by BXA and approved if the crude oil was not subject to
certain statutory restrictions and BXA made a finding that the export
was in the national interest and consistent with the purposes of the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act. In this interim rule, paragraph
(b)(1) of Sec. 754.2 lists the exports that have already been found to
be in the national interest and paragraph (b)(2) lists the exports for
which BXA must make the necessary findings.
    Section 754.2(b)(2) also reflects a revision relating to the kinds
of transactions that BXA will find to be in the national interest. The
proposed rule had cited examples of crude-for-crude and crude-for-
product exchanges that would be found to be in the national interest.
The language of the proposed rule, however, could have been interpreted
as limiting the national interest to these examples. The interim rule
makes clear that the cited exchanges are only examples.
    This interim rule also adds a new paragraph (g) to Sec. 754.2,
reflecting regulations that were published in the Federal Register (60
FR 15669, March 27, 1995).
    Finally, this interim rule creates two new License Exceptions which
apply to the exports of crude oil. Section 754.2(h) implements a new
License Exception SS-SPR, intended to permit the export of foreign
origin oil stored for emergency use by a foreign government in the
Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR). License Exception SS-SPR permits
the export even if the foreign origin oil is commingled with other SPR
oil, provided that the Department of Energy certifies that the crude
oil being exported is of the same quantity and of comparable quality as
the foreign origin oil imported by the foreign government for storage
in the SPR.
    Section 754.2(i) of this interim rule creates a new License
Exception, SS-SAMPLE, to permit limited quantities of crude oil for
analytical or testing purposes. This revision implements
recommendations included in the public comments. Under this License
Exception you may ship up to ten barrels of crude oil to any one end-
user annually, up to a cumulative limit of 100 barrels per exporter
annually. This License Exception codifies a BXA licensing policy for
sample shipments that has been in effect for several years. This
licensing policy has been included in BXA's annual report to the
Congress, but has not been reflected in the EAR. Such de minimis sample
shipments have no measurable effect on U.S. oil supplies.
    Section 754.3 of this interim rule reflects a significant change in
the way that the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act (NPRPA)
restriction on non-crude oil products are implemented. The NPRPA
prohibits the export of petroleum origination or derived from the Naval
Petroleum Reserve (NPR), unless the President approves the export.
Under existing EAR, licenses are required for all petroleum products,
and General License G-NNR authorizes shipments of all such product of
non-NPR origin or derivation. The proposed rule continued this approach
and provided License Exception SS-NPR.
    Commenters noted that if all NPR crude oil produced in fiscal year
1994 were refined, it would amount to less than one percent of all the
crude oil refined in the United States. The commenters recommended that
the existing approach be changed to require a license only for
petroleum products which were NPR produced or derived. BXA adopted this
recommendation and this provision reflects the change.
    The relevant ECCNs on the CCL have been revised to apply only to
petroleum products that were produced or derived from the NPR or became
available for export as a result of an exchange of any NPR produced or
derived commodities. With this change, General License SS-NNR is no
longer necessary and is removed.

[[Page 12727]]

    Section 754.4, unprocessed western red cedar, has been reorganized
consistent with a recommendation included in the comments. In the
proposed rule, Sec. 754.4(a)(2) contained instructions for filing a
license application, and preceded provisions on license policy and
exceptions. A commenter noted that an exporter will first look for
licensing policy and license exceptions before looking for information
on how to fill out a license application. The commenter observed that
there is no point in instructing the exporter how to complete a license
application if subsequent text informs the exporter either that a
license will not be approved or is not necessary. This interim rule
adopts this comment and has restructured Sec. 754.4 accordingly.

Part 756--Appeals

    This part describes the procedures applicable to appeals from
administrative actions taken by BXA. An administrative action is any
action (not including an administrative enforcement proceeding) taken
under the EAA or EAR with respect to a particular person, including
denial of a license application, return of a license application for
other than procedural deficiencies or additional information, or
classification of an appellant's item. Essentially, any person directly
and adversely affected by an administrative action would be allowed to
appeal to the Under Secretary for Export Administration for
reconsideration of that administrative action.
    No substantial comments were received on this part 756. One
commenter suggested the possibility of combining this part with part
748, Applications. This interim rule does not adopt the suggestion.
    With the exception of minor editorial revisions and clarifications,
the provisions of part 756 remain unchanged from the proposed rule.

Part 758--General Export Clearance Requirements

    This part deals with requirements imposed on exporters and others
regarding the movement of items subject of the Export Administration
Regulations (EAR) out of the United States. The purpose of this part is
to assure that the movement of items subject to these EAR conforms to
the requirements of the export license or other authorization for their
export.
    This part imposes specific responsibilities on the different
persons involved in export transactions to ensure compliance with other
provisions of the EAR and of the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations
(FTSR) (15 CFR Part 30), including exporters, freight forwarders,
exporters' agents, carriers and all other persons. It prohibits any
person from engaging in certain proscribed conduct. This part governs
some of the same conduct that is governed by the FTSR.
    This part imposes specific responsibilities for assuring that
Shipper's Export Declarations (SEDs), bills of lading and air waybills
are accurately filled out and are consistent with the export license or
other authorization for the export to which they correspond. It
restricts the conduct of exporters, forwarders, carriers and others to
assure that the delivery abroad of items subject to the EAR is in
accordance with the terms of the export license, exception to the
licensing requirement or other authorization. In some cases, it imposes
duties on parties to the transaction to return the items to the United
States or take steps to prevent them from entering the commerce of a
foreign country.
    The proposed rule made several changes to this part. Approximately
25 commenters made comments on the proposed part 758.
    A majority of those who commented on part 758 recommended that we
eliminate the requirement to place the symbol ``NOL'' on Shippers
Export Declarations (SEDs) for transactions involving items not on the
CCL. Most of those commenters suggested that we adopt a single symbol
``NLR'' for all transactions where the export does not require a
license either because it is on the CCL but does not require a license
to the destination in question or because it is not on the CCL. Several
commenters went further and recommended that we authorize the use of
the symbol ``NLR'' for transactions that are authorized by a License
Exception instead of requiring that the License Exception symbol be
listed on the SED. We adopted the suggestion to eliminate the symbol
``NOL''. However, this interim rule includes a designator (EAR99) for
items that in the proposed rule were subject to the EAR but not on the
CCL, that will be used by BXA in responding to classification requests
and by exporters for their management systems. The designator will not
be used on SEDs. We have also reduced the number of License Exception
symbols from which parties filling out SEDs must choose. As noted above
in the discussion of License Exceptions, we have created a small number
of symbols for various groups of License Exceptions, and it is these
symbols for groups of License Exceptions that must appear on the SED.
    Several commenters suggested that the choice of Destination Control
Statements (DCSs) in the proposed rule was unduly complex. In addition,
some commenters suggested that the proposed rule on DCSs did not make
it clear that the most restrictive DCS could be used for any
transaction. This interim rule adopts a single simplified DCS.
    A number of commenters raised the issue of what information should
be shown on SEDs for items which in the proposed rule were not subject
to the EAR, but which in the existing EAR are eligible for general
license GTDA. In response to these comments this interim rule creates
an optional designator TSPA which exporters may use on SEDs for
software or technology that the proposed rule and this interim rule
define as outside the scope of the EAR.
    The proposed rule eliminated some information about authority and
status of forwarding agents and procedures for correcting SEDs on the
grounds that those points are covered in the FTSR (15 CFR part 30) and
including them in the EAR was redundant of the FTSR. Some trade
associations recommended that we retain these procedures. We did not
adopt this suggestion because the FTSR applies to all exports from the
United States including those subject to the EAR and those that are
not. These procedures need to be in the FTSR because exporters who have
no transactions subject to the EAR must follow them. Retaining
duplicate language in a regulation that applies to only a portion of
the exports from the United States would be redundant and creates the
burden of keeping two different sets of regulations identical whenever
amendments are adopted.
    Two commenters suggested that proposed Sec. 758.1 was too long and
portions were redundant. They suggested breaking it up into several
sections. We did not adopt this suggestion in this interim rule. The
section has been shortened because of the elimination of the NOL
provisions.
    Several commenters suggested that the use of the word ``you'' in
the proposed rule under Sec. 758.1(a)(1) shifted responsibility from
exporters to forwarders. This interim rule does not change that
language. The proposed rule, by its terms makes those who obtain
licenses from BXA or rely on License Exceptions in their export
transactions responsible for the proper use of that license or License
Exception. This is a reasonable policy and is retained in this interim
rule.
    Two commenters proposed that forwarding agents not be required to
keep a record of the delegation of authority to them unless the

[[Page 12728]]
responsibility to do so was delegated by the exporter. This interim
rule does not adopt this suggestion. The proposed rule and this interim
rule conform with the existing EAR and with the FTSR on this issue.
    Two commenters stated that the use of the phrase ``exporter and the
person submitting the document'' in the proposed Secs. 758.3(e) and
758.3(l)(1) expands the scope of the persons making representations to
the U.S. Government to include forwarders in instances where the
existing EAR does not impose responsibility on forwarders. We accepted
this recommendation. This interim rule adopts language from the
existing EAR. However, other sections of this interim rule, like the
existing EAR, impose liability on forwarders who make
misrepresentations to the government.
    Two commenters recommended that the HTSUS numbers be permitted on
SEDs in lieu of Schedule B numbers. We did not adopt this
recommendation in this interim rule. The FTSR (15 CFR part 30) which
govern all exports from the United States require Schedule B numbers.
To the extent that there are differences between the HTSUS and the
Schedule B numbers, errors in compiling foreign trade statistics would
occur if either classification numbering system were permitted for
exports subject to the EAR.
    One commenter recommended that this rule eliminate the
responsibility of exporters and forwarders who file summary monthly
reports in lieu of SEDs to ensure that carriers place the destination
control statement on bills of lading and air waybills. We did not adopt
this suggestion. The proposed rule and this interim rule follow the
existing EAR which was designed to assure that exports made under the
privileged monthly procedure were totally in compliance with the EAR.
    Two commenters recommended that the regulations impose a limit on
the time that the Government may hold up export shipments for
inspection. We did not adopt that suggestion because it was beyond the
scope of the regulations reform exercise. Input from a number of other
government agencies would be necessary to develop a rational time
limit.
    One commenter recommended that when the government orders a carrier
to return or unload a shipment that the government be required to
notify the exporter. We did not adopt this suggestion. In some cases
the exporter may be the target of an investigation and a notification
requirement could jeopardize legitimate law enforcement activities.
More than one agency has authority to order return or unloading and
developing a rule would require the coordinated input of several
agencies. That coordination would be beyond the scope of the
regulations reform exercise.
    One commenter recommended that we require that exporters show the
Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) on the SED for all exports.
We did not adopt this suggestion. Although exporters need to determine
the proper ECCN in order to determine whether they need an export
license, requiring them to show that number on SED's for all exports
would unduly increase the paperwork burden.
    To assist in defining parties to an export transaction, one
association recommended we adopt as a guide a Power of Attorney
utilized by Customs. We did not adopt this recommendation. The EAR
defines parties to a transaction in an adequate manner. Parties to
transactions additionally are free to adopt any Power of Attorney
arrangement that addresses pertinent roles and is not inconsistent with
the EAR or other applicable regulations.
    One commenter questioned the proposed requirement to place the
various EAR authorizations for each item being exported under its
corresponding line item description. This commenter pointed out that
the FTSR requires that same information to be placed in blocks 21 and
22 on the SED form or continuation sheet. This interim rule adopts the
FTSR procedure and eliminates the requirement to repeat the
authorization under the line item description.
    This same commenter also recommended that the ``Conformity''
provisions in Sec. 758.4(c)(2)(iii) be changed to allow a name of a
party other that the licensee/shipper on the SED to be shown on the
bill of lading as shipper. We did not adopt this recommendation. These
provisions are designed to assure that new parties are not introduced
in transactions contrary to the EAR and that exports are completed in
an orderly and legal manner. Additionally, the situation described may
be appropriately addressed in the application for license process, by
showing the foreign subsidiary as exporter/licensee and the United
States affiliated/related company as agent for the exporter.
    Two commenters recommended eliminating the proposed rule
requirements concerning commodity descriptions on the SED
(Sec. 758.3(g)(2)(ii)) and the requirement that a copy of the
commercial invoice with a DCS be sent to the ultimate consignee
(Sec. 758.6(c)(4)). They claimed that these were new requirements. We
did not adopt the recommendations in this interim rule because the
proposed rule merely retained the requirements of the existing EAR.

Part 760--Restrictive Trade Practices or Boycotts

    This part revises the existing part 769. The recordkeeping
requirement found in Sec. 760.5(b)(8) of this interim rule requires the
recipient of records relating to a reportable boycott request to keep
those records for five years after receipt of the request. The existing
EAR Sec. 769.6(b)(8) requires the recipient of records relating to a
reportable boycott request to keep those records for three years after
receipt of the request.
    Two sections that were reserved in the existing EAR (769.5 and
769.7) have been removed. As a result of this change, Sec. 769.6 in the
existing EAR has been renumbered as Sec. 760.5 in this interim rule. In
addition two grace period provisions in the existing EAR have been
removed. They are; Sec. 760.2(f)(11) (along with its accompanying
example xi) in which certain actions to implement letters of credit
prior to the expirations of grace periods and Sec. 769.8 which
established a grace period for agreements entered into on or before May
16, 1977 could be complied with. The last such grace period expired on
December 31, 1978. Supplement No. 14 which relates to U.S. sanctions
against South Africa that have been repealed has also been removed and
subsequent supplements renumbered.
    A new Supplement No. 16 interpreting antiboycott policy in light of
recent developments in Jordan has been added by this interim rule.
    None of the changes made to this part by this interim rule were
published in the proposed rule.

Part 762--Recordkeeping

    In this interim rule, this part has been reorganized and revised to
eliminate the requirement that regulated persons obtain BXA approval
prior to destroying original documents and replacing them with
electronic, magnetic, photographic or other images. This interim rule
also makes it clear that persons required to keep records may always
keep the records in the form in which that person receives or creates
it. It extends the recordkeeping period to five years to coincide with
the applicable statute of limitations and sets standards of legibility
and retrievability for reproductions that are kept in lieu of
originals.
    Several commenters objected to the extension of the recordkeeping
requirement to five years in the

[[Page 12729]]
proposed rule. This interim rule adopts the five year record retention
period. A record retention period that coincides with the applicable
statute of limitations is needed to promote effective enforcement. In
addition, such a retention period benefits firms that comply with the
regulations because the EAR require that those who export under a
License Exception justify the use of that exception. Such persons will
need the records of the transaction to do so.
    Three commenters suggested that recordkeeping requirements be
eliminated for certain categories of exports that do not require a
license from BXA. We did not adopt this suggestion. Many transactions
that are subject to the EAR do not require a license from BXA.
Comprehensive records are necessary for effective enforcement and
administration of the EAA and EAR.
    One commenter objected to a requirement in the proposed rule that
records which are the subject of a request for production of records by
the government may not be destroyed even if the record retention period
has otherwise expired. This provision is a requirement under the
existing EAR and is retained in this interim rule. Enforcement and
compliance efforts would be undermined if parties were allowed to
destroy records after they have been notified that those records are
wanted in connection with an audit or investigation.
    Several commenters recommended that we eliminate the specific
requirements for legibility and retrievability of reproduced records
that are kept in lieu of originals that appeared in the proposed rule.
We did not adopt this suggestion. This interim rule does not impose any
requirements of legibility on original records. However, standards of
legibility and retrievability are necessary when the originals are
destroyed and copies are retained in lieu thereof. BXA will continue to
review this issue to ascertain if the standards might be simplified
without compromising record integrity.
    Two commenters recommended that the EAR specifically state that
records of certain activities of U.S. persons in connection with the
proliferation controls described in Secs. 734.2(b)(7) and 744.6 are
subject to the recordkeeping requirement. Although the proposed rule
stated that all transactions that are subject to the EAR are subject to
these recordkeeping requirements, we adopted this suggestion to make
more explicit the fact that activities subject to the proliferation
controls are covered.

Part 764--Enforcement

    Eleven of the commenters dealt with part 764. This interim rule
makes numerous changes to the proposed rule based upon these comments.
    This interim rule accepts the suggestion of one commenter and
revises Sec. 764.2(e) expressly to limit the offense of acting with
knowledge of a violation to actions that are connected with an item
that is the object of the violation of the EAA or EAR.
    Section 764.2(j) is revised to remove from the list of violations a
number of actions characterized as ``trafficking and advertising export
control documents''. BXA accepted the suggestion that some of the
restrictions on the creation of an interest in a licensed transaction
are inconsistent with normal trade practice in financing and insuring
exports. BXA is eliminating other parts of this section as unnecessary
because limitations on license transfer and use are effectively covered
by other EAR provisions, such as Sec. 750.10, and concerns regarding
disclosure of a person's relationship to a transaction are covered by
provisions such as Sec. 764.2(g). This interim rule limits
Sec. 764.2(j) to the offense of license, other export control documents
or other alteration.
    Some commenters called for distinguishing between ``substantive''
and ``minor'' violations. BXA did not adopt this suggestion. BXA
concludes that such distinctions are not feasible or appropriate with
respect to the type of activity covered by the EAR.
    Some commenters urged BXA to list factors that would mitigate
sanctions for violations. BXA did not adopt this suggestion. BXA notes
that its practice shows that it is open to the consideration of a wide
range of mitigating factors, and it does not believe that a listing of
such factors is needed to enhance compliance or to ensure that
sanctions will be appropriate.
    Some commenters called for BXA to include in the EAR a
comprehensive denial list that would include the names not only of
persons denied export privileges by BXA, but of persons covered by
denial orders or designations by other agencies. This interim rule does
not contain such a list. BXA cannot make its regulations an official
repository of legal action by other agencies. BXA will work with other
agencies to try to improve coordination of and access to the lists.
    This interim rule describes certain measures such as license
suspensions and temporary denial orders and places them in a new
Sec. 764.6, entitled ``protective administrative measures''. These
measures are not punitive, but are intended to protect against activity
contrary to the purposes of the EAR. Although these measures were
included in the existing EAR and in the proposed rule, they were not
all in a single section. Placing these measures in a single section
distinguishes them from the sanctions which are covered elsewhere in
part 764.

Part 766--Administration Enforcement Proceedings

    Five commenters specifically addressed part 766. Three of these
commenters addressed substantially the same points.
    Three commenters called for changes to protect the interests of
persons BXA seeks to add to a denial order on the basis of relationship
to the respondent. This interim rule makes three such changes. It
revises Sec. 766.23 to clarify that prevention of evasion is the basis
for making an order applicable to a related person, to provide more
specifically and uniformly for notice to persons that BXA seeks to have
named as related, and provides that such persons may oppose or appeal
not only the issue of relationship, but also whether the order is
justified to prevent evasion. These commenters suggested, further, that
related persons be allowed to challenge the order on the merits, that
is, as to whether or not there has been a violation or a temporary
denial order is necessary in the public interest in order to prevent an
imminent violation. BXA did not adopt this suggestion. BXA believes
that it is proper to limit contests on the merits to respondents, as it
is the alleged conduct of respondents that is the basis for the order.
    One commenter expressed concern that having the Under Secretary
decide appeals from Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) decisions in
enforcement proceedings raises doubts about impartiality, due process
and fairness. This commenter called for direct appeal from the ALJ to
the U.S. Court of Appeals. No such change has been made, as it would be
contrary to specific EAA provisions and to general administrative law
practice that makes final agency action subject to judicial review. An
ALJ decision cannot be final agency action under 50 U.S.C. app. 2412(c)
or (d). Moreover, BXA believes that its conduct of administrative
proceedings has been marked by fairness and the careful observance of
due process.
    Three commenters called for stating that ``clear and convincing
evidence'' is required to sustain an administrative enforcement case.
BXA did not adopt this suggestion. The EAA (50 U.S.C.

[[Page 12730]]
app. 2412(c)) makes the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 556)
evidence standard (``reliable, probative, and substantial'')
applicable. BXA does not believe that any different EAR standard is
needed.
    Three commenters called for detailed provisions on how much
evidence is needed to support a summary decision under Sec. 766.8.
    BXA did not adopt this suggestion. BXA concludes that the use of
the standard ``there is no genuine issue as to any material fact'' is
proper and sufficient.
    Another commenter stated that Sec. 766.24(b) should be revised to
define the ``imminent violation'' criterion for issuance of a temporary
denial order as requiring a showing of imminence both in nearness of
time and in likelihood of occurrence. BXA did not adopt this
suggestion. BXA retains its longstanding definition from the existing
EAR, consistent with the legislative history of the 1985 amendments to
the EAA, that either time or probability imminence will support the
issuance or renewal of a temporary denial order.
    This interim rule adopts many improvements in drafting clarity and
precision that were suggested in the comments, along with numerous
others that BXA developed. This interim rule revises Sec. 766.7 to make
default procedures available in antiboycott proceedings. There were no
public comments suggesting this change, but it makes the procedures for
imposing administrative sanctions and other measures in antiboycott
cases more consistent with other proceedings under the EAR. Finally,
BXA decided to remove from this interim rule one provision that
appeared in the proposed rule even though no comments on it were
received. This interim rule eliminates a provision from Sec. 766.18 of
the proposed rule that would have barred reference in a settlement
order to a finding of a violation, as the content of such an order is
consensual. This deletion makes this interim rule consistent with the
existing EAR.

Part 768--Foreign Availability

    Part 768 reflects the provisions described in part 791A of the
existing EAR. It implements section 5(h) of the Export Administration
Act (EAA) and contains procedures and criteria relating to
determinations of foreign availability for national security controlled
items. It is substantively unchanged from the existing part 791A. This
revised version contains several technical changes, such as use of the
term ``claimant'' instead of ``applicant,'' intended to make part 768
easier to read and understand.
    Only three commenters mentioned this part in their submissions,
possibly because the Federal Register notice soliciting comments had
stated that BXA did not intend to make any significant changes in this
part.
    One commenter questioned why Cuba is included in the definition of
``controlled countries'' for foreign availability purposes under
Sec. 768.1(d) and not for general purposes by inclusion in Country
Group D:1, as described in Supplement No. 1 to part 740. Cuba is a
``controlled country'' pursuant to determination made by BXA under
section 5(b) of the EAA. (See Export Administration Annual Report 1994,
at II-8.) Country Group D:1 does not include countries subject to broad
based embargoes, such as Cuba and North Korea, even though they are
controlled countries. This interim rule adds a clarifying notation
stating that since virtually all exports to Cuba and North Korea
currently are subject to an embargo, the foreign availability
procedures do not apply to these two controlled countries. A similar
notation is included in Supplement No. 1 to part 740.
    Another commenter suggested that Sec. 768.7(d) be revised to
clearly reflect the provision of section 5(f)(3) of the EAA that ``the
Secretary shall accept the representations of applicants * * *
supported by reasonable evidence, unless contradicted by reliable
evidence * * *''. BXA did not make any revisions because Sec. 768.7
paragraphs (c), (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this interim Rule already
implement this provision.
    One comment suggested that the provision in Sec. 768.7(f)((1)(i)(C)
for submitting foreign availability determinations to COCOM or a
successor regime was unnecessary and should be deleted. When COCOM
ceased functioning on March 31, 1994, the United States and other
member countries agreed to maintain the control lists that were in
place at that time until a successor regime was in place. A change has
been made in this interim rule to reflect BXA's intention to conduct
any necessary consultations with former member countries.
    Another commenter questioned why foreign availability procedures do
not apply to foreign policy controlled items. Foreign availability is
always taken into account whenever foreign policy controls are imposed,
expanded, or extended. Because the purposes of foreign policy controls
vary, strict procedures for conducting assessments have not been deemed
to be warranted. Finally, one commenter suggested that part 768 be
revised to reflect the expanded role of the Strategic Industries and
Economic Security Office's Economic Analysis Division in considering
unfair impact, effectiveness of controls, and foreign availability, and
to discuss how exporters may contribute to this work and analysis. BXA
will consider such an addition to the EAR in future revisions.

Part 770--Interpretations

    Part 770 contains certain interpretations concerning commodities,
software, technology, and de minimis exceptions for chemical mixtures.
These are designed to clarify the scope of the controls. BXA intends to
add interpretations to this part over time to aid you in interpreting
the EAR. Since the publication of the proposed rule, BXA has issued
certain interpretations on the application of the de minimis exclusion
for certain mixtures of chemicals. Those interpretations are added to
part 770 in this interim rule.
    Some commenters suggested that the part numbers of this chapter and
others will overlap with the part numbers of different chapters in
earlier versions of the EAR and therefore BXA should use both odd and
even numbers for the parts of this interim rule. BXA does not believe
that using only even numbers for the parts of this interim rule will
cause confusion. BXA further believes that is it useful to retain only
even numbers in this interim rule so as to leave room for future parts
that cannot now be anticipated.
    Certain commenters urged BXA to add interpretations of certain
issues; and BXA will review those recommendations for inclusion in the
future.
    Commenters also asked BXA to include an interpretation of the
phrase ``specially designed.'' BXA is not responding to this
recommendation due to pending criminal enforcement action and for other
reasons.
    This part contains certain interpretations regarding the de minimis
content of certain chemical mixtures. These reflect amendments to the
EAR adopted after the publication of the proposed rule.

Part 772--Definitions

    This part defines terms as used in the EAR.
    In response to comments, this interim rule combines the definitions
part from the proposed rule with the multilaterally-agreed definitions
found on the Commerce Control List that are found in Supplement No. 3
to Sec. 799A.1 of the existing EAR. These definitions may be
distinguished from other definitions by the fact that they appear in
quotation marks.

Part 774--The Commerce Control List

    On May 11, 1995, BXA published an advance notice of public
rulemaking in the Federal Register, (60 FR 25480), soliciting comments
from industry and interested public on whether and how to conform the
numbering system used to identify items controlled by the Export
Administration Regulations, or Export Control Classification Numbers
(ECCNs), with the numbering system used by the European Union (EU) to
identify such items.
    BXA received a total of eighteen responses to the May 11 notice.
Ten commenters responded directly to this notice, while the remaining
commenters included comments on the May 11 notice with their comments
on the proposed rule. Additional verbal comments were also provided at
the town-hall fora conducted throughout the United States by BXA.
    Overall, industry supports harmonizing the U.S. ECCN system with
the EU numbering system. The following is an analysis of the responses
to the five questions posed by BXA in the Federal Register notice,
followed by other general comments.
1. Should the U.S. Harmonize the ECCNs With the EC Numbers and
Encourage Other Countries To Adopt a Uniform Numbering System?
    Most commenters stated that they were very supportive of adopting
the EU numbering system. Four stated that if such a change were to be
made, there should be a grace period during which either the ECCN or EU
number could be used. One of these commenters stated that the grace
period should be six months, and another stated that a minimum of nine
months should be allowed for a smooth transition to the new system. One
company stated that it would be less costly to plan for such a change
now rather than sometime in the ``years ahead''. Another commenter
stated that although the initial computerization of the new numbers
could be costly, they will be able to use the information to process
export declarations electronically, which will make processing the
information much more timely.
    One foreign-based company stated that they do not support
converting the ECCNs to the EU numbering system because the U.S.-based
ECCN automatically shows that the item is U.S.-origin, and that there
are just too many discrepancies between the items controlled by ECCNs
and the corresponding EU numbers. Another commenter who does not
support conversion to the EU numbering system stated that the use of a
common ECCN has little benefit in the export documentation and should
not be considered an advantage to exporters. This commenter further
stated that it was only recently that they incurred costs of
administering the changes BXA made to the ECCNs to implement the
Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Control's (COCOM) ``Core
List'' in 1991 (56 FR 42824, August 29, 1991), and would not want to do
it again. Another commenter stated that the ECCN system is a good
system that works and that they see no advantage of a world-wide system
in this area.
    One commenter, that supported the conversion of ECCNs to the EU
system, stated that BXA should not require conversion to the EU system
until the differences between the existing ECCNs and the numbering
system used by the EU are resolved, and also until the COCOM successor
regime and control lists are finalized and all export destinations
agree to adopt the system. Another commenter echoed this opinion, and
added that the new U.S. ECCNs should only be developed for U.S.-
controlled items now controlled by the EU. One commenter stated that
unless the U.S. and EU numbers are identical, there will still be a
need for exporters to classify U.S. and EU separately.
    BXA agrees that complete harmonization between the new ECCN system
and the EU system is desirable. Without such harmonization, any
resulting list may be confusing for industry and difficult to
implement. For multilaterally controlled items, the new ECCNs described
in this interim rule are renumbered according to the comparable entry
on the EU list. The scope of such controls are generally the same on
both lists, however the style of the text may be different.
    It is important to note that the EU list provides guidance to
member states on the control parameters for items controlled by on the
Industrial List, the International Atomic Energy List, Missile
Technology Control Regime Annex, the Nuclear Supplier's Group, and the
list of items controlled by the Australia Group. Each EU member
publishes its own national list to implement such controls and any
other unilateral controls. Many national lists are therefore different
from the EU list, except for the scope of multilateral controls. The
U.S. also uses discretion in developing its national list, the CCL, for
dual-use items. Certain entries on the CCL have been created for those
items that are not controlled multilaterally on the EU list. Such items
are identified an unilateral controls. In those few instances where the
multilateral entries differ, the U.S. will ask its trading partners to
adopt the CCL.
2. What are the Specific Implications If We Change the ECCNs To Conform
With the EC Numbering System? For Example, if You Currently Have
Computer Programs That Aid in Facilitating Exports and Reexports, What
Will be the Programming Implications for Your Firm if We Make This
Change?
    Most of the commenters stated that the reprogramming of computer
systems would be a significant undertaking to convert to a EU numbering
system. One commenter stated that they estimate it would take
approximately 2 person years of effort and $300,000 to change the data
base and ancillary associated systems worldwide. The time for
performing this effort would be approximately three to four months. Two
commenters stated that consideration would need to be given to the
diversion of human resources from current tasks to the review of entire
product lines against the proposed new classification numbers. This
would involve the review of several thousand product part numbers and
the time required to enter each new EU-based number into the computer
system. Three commenters remarked on the export control personnel
retraining requirements requisite to use of the new numbering system.
Another commenter stated that changes to their current system would be
minimal, but they are now in the process of upgrading relevant programs
and processes, and would like to see a change in numbering system now.
    One commenter stated that they currently give dual classifications
(ECCN and EU number) to items on their product matrices, and that the
matrices are computerized. Changes to the matrices will be required for
the implementation of the EAR simplification project, so it would be
beneficial if the ECCN harmonization could be carried out at the same
time.
    BXA is sympathetic to the time and cost involved in implementing a
new numbering system. However, as many companies have stated, the
benefits of a global numbering system far outweigh the costs of
implementing such a system. The new ECCNs identified in this interim
rule implement the first steps toward a global control list.

[[Page 12732]]

3. What Problems Have You Had in the Past in Tracking Two or More
Numbering Systems for Identical Items Controlled by Two or More
Countries?
    One commenter stated that a uniform numbering system would
eliminate a potential area for misunderstanding or confusion in
references to a specific item while another stated that the current
need to track multiple numbering systems adds cost and unnecessary
complexity to their compliance programs. This latter commenter also
stated that there is added confusion caused by changes on different
dates by different countries to the various lists. Another commenter
stated that the lack of correlation between the various lists has made
it all but impossible to develop a computerized correlation between the
various numbers that may apply to one unique product. This commenter
also stated there is no correlation in the EU numbering system for
ECCNs designated for unilateral controls.
4. What Are the Specific Ways in Which a Uniform Numbering System Would
Help Your Company?
    Five commenters responded to this question. One commenter stated
that it would simplify their product matrices, while another two stated
that it would streamline their training procedures. One of these
commenters also stated that it would also increase their ability to
maintain high levels of export control compliance. Another commenter
agreed that standardization would allow the company to avoid building
and maintaining cross-reference tables as they communicate order
requirements and status on U.S. export orders with importing foreign
entities.
    Another commenter also cited simplification as the major benefit of
a uniform system, and highlighted the specific benefit of consistency
in classification of items. Only one commenter stated that a uniform
numbering system would not benefit their company, but provided no
further explanation as to why it would not be beneficial.
5. Are There Numbering Systems of Other Countries That You Prefer to
the EC System? If So, State Which Ones and Exactly How You Would
Reconcile Any Differences in Scope?
    Two of the ten commenters supported maintaining the current ECCN
system. Of the seven commenters that specifically supported a unified
numbering system, none identified a system other than the EU as
preferable.
    Four commenters provided additional comments other than those
supporting the four specific questions posed in the May 11 Federal
Register notice. One commenter, who did not support a conversion to the
EU numbering system, stated that the fourth and fifth digits of the EU
number do not provide any real benefit or added clarity. This commenter
further stated that the alpha-character used at the end of the current
ECCNs has been useful in internal control procedures. For example, an
``A'' at the end of a ECCN easily indicates a highly sensitive item,
while a ``G'' indicates greater range of exportability.
    Two commenters, who were supportive of the EU numbering system,
also supported the elimination of basket categories. One of these
commenters stated that the continued use of such categories would
conflict with the objective of harmonizing the ECCNs with the EU list.
Another commenter stated that elimination of the ``G'' level basket
categories was not favorable.
    One commenter also stated that there should be no interim or
intermediate changes to the ECCN numbering system, and future changes
to the control list should be effective on the same date in all
countries that are a party to the control regimes using the list. The
EU provides guidance to member states for drafting national control
lists. Each state is responsible for implementing changes to
multilateral control lists based upon agreements reached by the
Wassenaar Arrangement, the Missile Technology Control Regime, the
Nuclear Suppliers Group, and the Australia Group. BXA will continue to
implement agreements reached by each of the regimes through prompt
publication in the Federal Register.
    Another commenter suggested that if the United States were to adopt
the EU numbering system, BXA should clarify whether new control numbers
(not included on the EU control list) represent new controls, and if
so, what items are being suggested for control and the policy basis for
such controls. A comprehensive cross-reference will be included in
Supplement No. 3 to this part. The Supplement will provide cross-
references for both new format to old format and old to new, so that
readers will be able to locate new numbers based on their current
ECCNs. In this manner, readers will be able to determine the origin of
all numbers that do not currently appear on the EU list. Further, the
revised CCL implements recent multilateral agreements that have not yet
been incorporated in the EU list, such as the NSG revisions published
February 1, 1996 (61 FR 3555).
    Under the new numbering system adopted by this interim rule, it
will be easy to identify whether an item is controlled multilaterally
(e.g., for national security, missile technology, nuclear
nonproliferation, or chemical and biological reasons) or unilaterally,
based upon the third digit of the number. ECCNs having a ``9'' as their
third digit (i.e., 5A980, surreptitious listening devices) are controls
unique to the United States, just as other countries may have their own
unique controls. Further, Category 10 has been renumbered, and will
appear as Category 0 in conformance with the EU list. Titles of the
various categories have also been revised in conformance with the EU.
    This interim rule retains one ``basket'' entry (EAR99), referenced
at the end of each category in the Commerce Control List, which
contains all the items that used to be classified under those ECCNs
ending with ``96G'' and were thus eligible for General License G-DEST
to most destinations. Items classified as EAR99 are those items not
specified on the CCL, but still subject to the EAR. Therefore,
exporters first must determine that their items are not, in fact, on
the CCL; only then may they classify their items as EAR99.
    As in the existing EAR, terms enclosed in quotation marks (i.e.,
``aircraft'' or ``production'') are those with multilaterally agreed
definitions that appear throughout the CCL. These definitions, found in
Supplement No. 3 to part 799A of the existing EAR, are in this interim
rule integrated into part 772 (Definitions). By contrast, definitions
or parameters not enclosed in quotation marks and identified by the
Related Definitions header in individual ECCNs are unique to particular
entries, and therefore appear only in those entries.
    Administrative Exception Notes, denoting ``favorable
consideration'' of licenses for certain items to certain destinations
in the existing Supplement No. 1 to part 799A, became meaningless when
COCOM disbanded, and they have been removed from the CCL in this
interim rule.
    With the harmonization of the CCL and the EU list, most items will
need to be reclassified. Exporter and reexporters may submit requests
for reclassification beginning on the effective date of this interim
rule. BXA will publish a list of those ECCNs where reclassification is
not necessary prior to November 1, 1996.

Forms Supplement

    The new Multipurpose Application Form, BXA-748P, will replace the
Application for Export License (BXA-622P) and the Request for Reexport
Authorization (BXA-699P). It will also

[[Page 12733]]
serve as an application for the Special Comprehensive License.
Additionally, the BXA-748P will accommodate Commerce Classification
Requests, thus allowing item classifications to be handled
electronically.
    The BXA-711P replaces BXA-629P, Statement by Ultimate Consignee and
Purchaser. A letter from the ultimate consignee or purchaser may now be
substituted for this form, provided the letter contains the same
information. The BXA-752P will be required as support documentation for
the Special Comprehensive License, replacing the Statement by Foreign
Consignee in Support of Special License Application (BXA-6052P).
    The International Import Certificate (BXA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53),
the Delivery Verification Certificate (BXA-647P), and the Notification
of Delivery Verification Requirement (BXA-648P) remain unchanged.
Applicants will now submit replacement licenses rather than amendment
requests when their situations change; therefore, the Request for
Amendment Action (BXA-685P) will be discontinued.
    Exporters and reexporters may find instructions for completing
forms in part 748, while applicants for the Special Comprehensive
License may find instructions in part 752.
    Applicants must begin using the new forms as of June 15, 1996. Due
to the requirements of electronic submission and processing systems,
there will be no transition period during which either version of each
form may be used. Old forms received after the changeover date will be
returned without action to the applicant. Forms may be obtained from
U.S. Department of Commerce District Offices or from: Exporter
Counselling Division, Bureau of Export Administration, Room 1099, U.S.
Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.,
Washington, DC 20230. Telephone (202) 482-4811.

Rulemaking Requirements

    1. For purposes of Executive Order 12866, this interim rule has
been determined to be significant.
    2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person is
required to respond to nor shall a person be subject to a penalty for
failure to comply with a collection of information subject to the
requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act unless that collection of
information displays a currently valid OMB Control Number. This interim
rule contains five new collections of information subject to the
requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. ch. 35, which
were cleared by the Office of Management and Budget. The new
``Multipurpose Application'' is cleared under OMB Control Number 0694-
0088, the ``Special Comprehensive License'' is cleared under OMB
Control Number 0694-0089, five year record retention is cleared under
OMB Control Number 0694-0096, the one-time report on calculations under
the de minimis rule for software and technology is cleared under OMB
Control Number 0694-0101, requests for appointment of a Technical
Advisory Committee is cleared under OMB Control Number 0694-0100,
miscellaneous activities are cleared under OMB Control Number and 0694-
0102. All other collections of information contained in the rulemaking
have been previously approved by OMB. Supplement No. 2 to part 730 of
the EAR contains a table of the current OMB Control Numbers. The public
reporting burdens for the new collections of information are estimated
to average 45 minutes for the Multipurpose Application, between 20 and
40 hours for the Special Comprehensive License, 10 seconds for
recordkeeping, 25 hours for the one-time report, 5 hours for requests
for appointment of Technical Advisory Committee, and 5 hours for
petitions covered under miscellaneous activities. These estimates
include the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data
sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and
reviewing the collections of information. Send comments regarding these
burden estimates or any other aspect of these collections of
information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Larry E.
Christensen, Director, Regulatory Policy Division, Bureau of Export
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230.
    3. For purposes of Executive Order 12612, this interim rule does
not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant
preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
    4. Pursuant to authority at 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1) and section 13(a) of
the Export Administration Act, 50 U.S.C. 2401-2420 et seq., though
prior notice and an opportunity for public comment are provided, such
procedures are not required for this regulatory action. As such, no
Initial or Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is required under
sections 3 and 4 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603(a) and
604(a), and none has been prepared.
    5. Although the Export Administration Act expired on August 20,
1994, the President invoked his authority under the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act, through Executive Order 12924, August
19, 1994, as extended on August 15, 1995, and determined that, to the
extent permitted by law, the provisions of the Export Administration
Act shall be extended so as to continue in full force and effect and
amend, as necessary, the export control system previously implemented,
as the Export Administration Regulations, pursuant to the Export
Administration Act.
    However, because of the importance of the issues raised by these
regulations, this rule is issued in interim form and comments will be
considered in the development of final regulations. Accordingly, the
Department encourages interested persons who wish to comment to do so
at the earliest possible time to permit the fullest consideration of
their views.
    The period for submission of comments will close May 24, 1996. The
Department will consider all comments received before the close of the
comment period in developing final regulations. Comments received after
the end of the comment period will be considered if possible, but their
consideration cannot be assured. The Department will not accept public
comments accompanied by a request that a part or all of the material be
treated confidentially because of its business proprietary nature or
for any other reason. The Department will return such comments and
materials to the person submitting the comments and will not consider
them in the development of final regulations. All public comments on
these regulations will be a matter of public record and will be
available for public inspection and copying. In the interest of
accuracy and completeness, the Department requires comments in written
form.
    Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which will
also be a matter of public record and will be available for public
review and copying. Communications from agencies of the United States
Government or foreign governments will not be made available for public
inspection.
    The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained
in the Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Records
Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and
Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20230. Records in this
facility, including written public comments and memoranda summarizing
the substance of oral communications, may be inspected and copied in
accordance with regulations published in Part 4 of Title 15 of the Code
of Federal Regulations.

[[Page 12734]]
Information about the inspection and copying of records at the facility
may be obtained from Margaret Cornejo, Bureau of Export Administration
Freedom of Information Officer, at the above address or by calling

Sec. 730.1  What these regulations cover.

    In this part, references to the Export Administration Regulations
(EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The EAR are
issued by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export
Administration (BXA) under laws relating to the control of certain
exports, reexports, and activities. In addition, the EAR implement
antiboycott law provisions requiring regulations to prohibit specified
conduct by United States persons that has the effect of furthering or
supporting boycotts fostered or imposed by a country against a country
friendly to United States. Supplement No. 1 to part 730 lists the
control numbers assigned to information collection requirements under
the EAR by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.

Sec. 730.2  Statutory authority.

    The EAR have been designed primarily to implement the Export
Administration Act of 1979, as amended, 50 U.S.C. app. 2401-2420 (EAA).
There are numerous other legal authorities underlying the EAR. These
are listed in the Federal Register documents promulgating the EAR and
at the beginning of each part of the EAR in the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR). From time to time, the President has exercised
authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act with
respect to the EAR (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706 (IEEPA)). The EAA is not
permanent legislation, and when it has lapsed, Presidential executive
orders under IEEPA have directed and authorized the continuation in
force of the EAR.

Sec. 730.3  Dual use exports.

    The convenient term ``dual use'' is sometimes used to distinguish
the types of items covered by the EAR from those that are covered by
the regulations of certain other U.S. government departments and
agencies with export licensing responsibilities. In general, the term
dual use serves to distinguish EAR-controlled items that can be used
both in military and other strategic uses (e.g., nuclear) and
commercial applications. In general, the term dual use serves to
distinguish EAR-controlled items that can be used both in military and
other strategic uses and in civil applications from those that are
weapons and military related use or design and subject to the controls
of the Department of State or subject to the nuclear related controls
of the Department of Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Note,
however, that although the short-hand term dual use may be employed to
refer to the entire scope of the EAR, the EAR also apply to some items
that have solely civil uses.

Sec. 730.4  Other control agencies and departments.

    In addition to the departments and agencies mentioned in Sec. 730.3
of this part, other departments and agencies have jurisdiction over
certain narrower classes of exports and reexports. These include the
Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which
administers controls against certain countries that are the object of
sanctions affecting not only exports and reexports, but also imports
and financial dealings. For your convenience, Supplement No. 3 to part
730 identifies other departments and agencies with regulatory
jurisdiction over certain types of exports and reexports. This is not a
comprehensive list, and the brief descriptions are only generally
indicative of the types of controls administered and/or enforced by
each agency.

Sec. 730.5  Coverage of more than exports.

    The core of the export control provisions of the EAR concerns
exports from the United States. You will find, however, that some
provisions give broad meaning to the term ``export'', apply to
transactions outside of the United States, or apply to activities other
than exports.
    (a) Reexports. Commodities, software, and technology that have been
exported from the United States are generally subject to the EAR with
respect to reexport. Many such reexports, however, may go to many
destinations without a license or will qualify for an exception from
licensing requirements.
    (b) Foreign products. In some cases, authorization to export
technology from the United States will be subject to assurances that
items produced abroad that are the direct product of that technology
will not be exported to certain destinations without authorization from
BXA.
    (c) Scope of ``exports''. Certain actions that you might not regard
as an ``export'' in other contexts do constitute an export subject to
the EAR. The release of technology to a foreign national in the United
States through such means as demonstration or oral briefing is deemed
an export. Other examples of exports under the EAR include the return
of foreign equipment to its country of origin after repair in the
United States, shipments from a U.S. foreign trade zone, and the
electronic transmission of non-public data that will be received
abroad.
    (d) U.S. person activities. To counter the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction, the EAR restrict the involvement of ``United
States persons'' anywhere in the world in exports of foreign-origin
items, or in providing services or support, that may contribute to such
proliferation.

Sec. 730.6  Control purposes.

    The export control provisions of the EAR are intended to serve the
national security, foreign policy, nonproliferation, and short supply
interests of the United States and, in some cases, to carry out its
international obligations. Some controls are designed to restrict
access to dual use items by countries or persons that might apply such
items to uses inimical to U.S. interests. These include controls
designed to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
controls designed to limit the military and terrorism support
capability of certain countries. The effectiveness of many of the
controls under the EAR is enhanced by their being maintained as part of
multilateral control arrangements. Multilateral export control
cooperation is sought through arrangements such as the Nuclear
Suppliers Group, the Australia Group, and the Missile Technology
Control Regime. The EAR also include some export controls to protect
the United States from the adverse impact of the unrestricted export of
commodities in short supply.

Sec. 730.7  License requirements and exceptions.

    A relatively small percentage of exports and reexports subject to
the EAR require an application to BXA for a license. Many items are not
on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (Supplement No. 1 to Sec. 774.1 of
the EAR), or, if on the CCL, require a license to only a limited number
of countries. Other transactions may be covered by one or more of the
License Exceptions in the EAR. In such cases no application need be
made to BXA.

Sec. 730.8  How to proceed and where to get help.

    (a) How the EAR are organized. The Export Administration
Regulations (EAR) are structured in a logical manner. In dealing with
the EAR you may find it helpful to be aware of the overall organization
of these regulations. In order to determine what the rules are and what
you need to do, review the titles and the introductory sections of the
parts of the EAR.

[[Page 12736]]

    (1) How do you go about determining your obligations under the EAR?
Part 732 of the EAR provides steps you may follow to determine your
obligations under the EAR. You will find guidance to enable you to tell
whether or not your transaction is subject to the EAR and, if it is,
whether it qualifies for a License Exception or must be authorized
through issuance of a license.
    (2) Are your items or activities subject to the EAR at all? Part
734 of the EAR defines the items and activities that are subject to the
EAR. Note that the definition of ``items subject to the EAR'' includes,
but is not limited to, items listed on the Commerce Control List in
part 774 of the EAR.
    (3) If subject to the EAR, what do the EAR require? Part 736 of the
EAR lists all the prohibitions that are contained in the EAR. Note that
certain prohibitions (General Prohibitions One through Three) apply to
items as indicated on the CCL, and others (General Prohibitions Four
through Ten) prohibit certain activities and apply to all items subject
to the EAR unless otherwise indicated.
    (4) Do you need a license for your item or activity? What policies
will BXA apply if you do need to submit license application? The EAR
have four principal ways of describing license requirements:
    (i) The EAR may require a license to a country if your item is
listed on the CCL and the Country Chart in part 738 of the EAR tells
that a license is required to that country. Virtually all Export
Control Classification Numbers (ECCN) on the CCL are covered by the
Country Chart in part 738 of the EAR. That part identifies the limited
number of entries that are not included on the Chart. These ECCNs will
state the specific countries that require a license or refer you to a
self-contained section, i.e., Short Supply in part 754 of the EAR, or
Embargoes in part 746 of the EAR. If a license is required, you should
consult part 740 of the EAR which describes the License Exception that
may be available for items on the CCL. Part 742 of the EAR describes
the licensing policies that BXA will apply in reviewing an application
you file. Note that part 754 of the EAR on short supply controls and
part 746 on embargoes are self-contained parts that include the
available exceptions and licensing policy.
    (ii) A license requirement may be based on the end-use or end-user
in a transaction, primarily for proliferation reasons. Part 744 of the
EAR describes such requirements and relevant licensing policies and
includes both restrictions on items and restrictions on the activities
of U.S. persons.
    (iii) A license is required for virtually all exports to embargoed
destinations, such as Cuba. Part 746 of the EAR describes all the
licensing requirements, license review policies and License Exceptions
that apply to such destinations. If your transaction involves one of
these countries, you should first look at this part. This part also
describes controls that may be maintained under the EAR to implement UN
sanctions.
    (iv) In addition, under Secs. 736.2(b)(9) and (10) of the EAR, you
may not engage in a transaction knowing a violation is about to occur
or violate any orders, terms, and conditions under the EAR. Part 764 of
the EAR describes prohibited transactions with a person denied export
privileges or activity that violates the terms or conditions of a
denial order.
    (5) How do you file a license application and what will happen to
the application once you do file it? What if you need authorization for
multiple transactions? Parts 748 and 750 of the EAR provide information
on license submission and processing. Part 752 of the EAR provides for
a Special Comprehensive License that authorizes multiple transactions.
If your application is denied, part 756 of the EAR provides rules for
filing appeals.
    (6) How do you clear shipments with the U.S. Customs Service? Part
758 of the EAR describes the requirements for clearance of exports.
    (7) Where do you find the rules on restrictive trade practices and
boycotts? Part 760 of the EAR deals with restrictive trade practices
and boycotts.
    (8) Where are the rules on recordkeeping and enforcement? Part 762
of the EAR sets out your recordkeeping requirements, and parts 764 and
766 of the EAR deal with violations and enforcement proceedings.
    (9) What is the effect of foreign availability? Part 768 of the EAR
provides rules for determining foreign availability of items subject to
controls.
    (10) Do the EAR provide definitions and interpretations? Part 770
of the EAR contains interpretations and part 772 of the EAR lists
definitions used.
    (b) Why the EAR are so detailed. Some people will find the great
length of the EAR and their extensive use of technical terms
intimidating. BXA believes, however, that such detail and precision can
and does serve the interests of the public. The detailed listing of
technical parameters in the CCL establishes precise, objective
criteria. This should, in most cases, enable you to ascertain the
appropriate control status. Broader, more subjective criteria would
leave exporters and reexporters more dependent upon interpretations and
rulings by BXA officials. Moreover, much of the detail in the CCL is
derived from multilaterally adopted lists, and the specificity serves
to enhance the uniformity and effectiveness of international control
practices and to promote a ``level playing field''. The detailed
presentation of such elements as licensing and export clearance
procedures enables you to find in one place what you need to know to
comply with pertinent requirements. Of special importance is the
detailed listing of License Exception criteria, as these will enable
you to determine quickly, and with confidence, that you may proceed
with a transaction without delay. Finally, some of the detail results
from the need to draft the EAR with care in order to avoid loop-holes
and to permit effective enforcement.
    (c) Where to get help. Throughout the EAR you will find information
on offices you can contact for various purposes and types of
information. General information including; assistance in understanding
the EAR, information on how to obtain forms, electronic services,
publications, and information on training programs offered by BXA, is
available from the Office of Exporter Services at the following
locations:

Exporter Counselling Division, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and

Sec. 730.9  How the Bureau of Export Administration is organized.

    Functionally, the Bureau of Export Administration is divided into
two branches, Export Administration and Export Enforcement. Also, BXA
manages a number of Technical Advisory Committees consisting of
industry and government representatives which advise and assist BXA and
other agencies with respect to actions designed to implement the EAR.
    (a) Export Administration. Export Administration implements and

[[Page 12737]]
administers the export controls reflected in the EAR. Export
Administration consists of five offices located in Washington D.C. and
two field offices in California under the supervision of the Assistant
Secretary for Export Administration:
    (1) The Office of Nuclear and Missile Technology Controls is
responsible for policy and technical issues and license applications
related to the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Missile Technology
Control Regime. This office has responsibility for items associated
with those regimes, and missile and nuclear related exports and
reexports subject to the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative.
    (2) The Office Chemical/Biological Controls and Treaty Compliance
is responsible for implementing multilateral export controls under the
Australia Group. This office has licensing responsibility for items
associated with the Australia Group and related exports and reexports
subject to the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative.
    (3) The Office of Strategic Trade and Foreign Policy Controls is
responsible for implementing multilateral export controls dealing with
conventional arms and related dual use items. This office is also
responsible for computer export control policies, and implements U.S.
foreign policy controls (e.g., crime control, anti-terrorism, and
regional stability). It also has licensing responsibility for items
controlled for national security and foreign policy reasons.
    (4) The Office of Exporter Services is responsible for the Special
Comprehensive License, processing and routing all license applications,
and preparing responses to requests for advisory opinions and commodity
classifications. This office also provides counselling to exporters and
reexporters, conducts educational seminars for the business community,
maintains the Export Administration Regulations, and coordinates the
operations of two field offices listed in Sec. 730.8(c) of this part.
    (5) The Office of Strategic Industries and Economic Security
implements programs to ensure the continued health of the U.S. defense
industrial base, facilitating diversification of U.S. defense related
industries into civilian markets, and promoting the conversion of
military enterprises. This office is also responsible for analyzing the
economic impact of U.S. export controls on industrial competitiveness.
    (b) Export Enforcement. Export Enforcement implements the
enforcement provisions of the EAR, including part 760 of the EAR
(Restrictive Trade Practices and Boycotts). This office also conducts
outreach programs to assist members of the public in understanding
their obligation under EAR. The Office of Export Enforcement is
organized into three offices under the supervision of the Assistant
Secretary for Export Enforcement.
    (1) The Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) is comprised of an
office in Washington, D.C. and eight field offices. OEE is staffed with
criminal investigators and analysts. This office investigates
allegations of violations and supports administrative and criminal
enforcement proceedings. The addresses and telephone numbers of the
eight field offices are listed in Sec. 764.5(c)(7) of the EAR.
    (2) The Office of Enforcement Support (OES) is located in
Washington, D.C. OES supports BXA's preventive enforcement efforts,
including conducting pre-license checks and post-shipment
verifications. OES also provides administrative and analytical support
for OEE.
    (3) The Office of Antiboycott Compliance administers and enforces
the provisions of part 760 of the EAR (Restrictive Trade Practices and
Boycotts). It investigates and prepares cases on alleged violations of
this part.
    (c) Technical Advisory Committees. The Technical Advisory
Committees (TACs) provide advice and assistance to BXA from U.S.
industry regarding the creation and implementation of export controls.
For further information regarding establishment of TACs and other
information, see Supplement No. 2 to part 730. Existing TACs include
the following:
    (1) The Computer Systems Technical Advisory Committee;
    (2) The Electronics Technical Advisory Committee;
    (3) The Materials Technical Advisory Committee;
    (4) The Materials Processing Equipment Technical Advisory
Committee;
    (5) The Regulations and Procedures Technical Advisory Committee;
    (6) The Sensors Technical Advisory Committee;
    (7) The Telecommunications Equipment Technical Advisory Committee;
and
    (8) The Transportation and Related Equipment Technical Advisory
Committee.

Sec. 730.10  Advisory information.

    The general information in this part is just that--general. To
achieve brevity, so as to give you a quick overview, the information in
this part is selective, incomplete, and not expressed with regulatory
precision. The controlling language is the language of succeeding parts
of the EAR and of any other laws or regulations referred to or
applicable. The content of this part is not to be construed as
modifying or interpreting any other language or as in any way, limiting
the authority of BXA, any of its components or any other government
department or agency. You should not take any action based solely on
what you read in this part.

Supplement No. 1 to Part 730--Information Collection Requirements
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act: OMB Control Numbers

    This Supplement lists the control numbers assigned to the
information collection requirements for the Bureau of Export
Administration by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), pursuant
to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This Supplement complies with
the requirements of section 3506(c)(1)(B)(i) of the Paperwork Reduction
Act requiring agencies to display current control numbers assigned by
the Director of OMB for each agency information collection requirement.

Supplement No. 2 to Part 730--Technical Advisory Committees

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this Supplement is to describe the
procedures and criteria for the establishment and operation of
Technical Advisory Committees.
    (b) Technical advisory committees. Any producer of articles,
materials, or supplies, including technology, software, and other
information, that are subject to export controls, or are being
considered for such controls because of their significance to the
national security of the United States, may request the Secretary of
Commerce to establish a technical advisory committee, under the
provisions of section 5(h) of the Export Administration Act of 1979,
as amended (EAA) to advise and assist the Department of Commerce and
other appropriate U.S. Government agencies or officials with respect
to questions involving technical matters; worldwide availability and
actual utilization of production technology; licensing procedures
that affect the level of export controls applicable to a clearly
defined grouping of articles, materials, or supplies, including
technology, software, or other information; and exports and
reexports subject to all controls that the United States maintains
including proposed revisions of any such controls. If producers of
articles, materials, or supplies, including technology, software,
and other information, that are subject to export controls because
of their significance to the national security of the United States,
wish a trade association or other representative to submit a written
request on their behalf for the appointment to a TAC, such request
shall be submitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this
Supplement.
    (1) Form and substance of requests. Each request for the
appointment of a TAC shall be submitted in writing to: Assistant
Secretary for Export Administration, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC
20044.
    The request shall include:
    (i) A description of the articles, materials, or supplies
including technology and software, in terms of a clear, cohesive
grouping (citing the applicable Export Control Classification
Numbers where practical);
    (ii) A statement of the reasons for requesting the appointment
of a TAC; and
    (iii) Any information in support of any contention that may be
made that the request meets the criteria described in paragraph
(b)(2) of this Supplement.
    (2) Consideration of request for establishment of a TAC. The
Department of Commerce will review all requests for the
establishment of a TAC to determine if the following criteria are
met:
    (i) That a substantial segment of the industry producing the
specified articles, materials, or supplies including technology
desires such a committee; and
    (ii) That the evaluation of such articles, materials, or
supplies including technology and software for export control
purposes is difficult because of questions involving technical
matters, worldwide availability and actual utilization of production
and software technology, or licensing procedures.
    (3) Requests by a substantial segment of an industry. In
determining whether or not a substantial segment of any industry has
requested the appointment of a TAC, the Department of Commerce will
consider:
    (i) The number of persons or firms requesting the establishment
of a TAC for a particular grouping of commodities, software and
technology in relation to the total number of U.S. producers of such
items; and
    (ii) The volume of annual production by such persons or firms of
each item in the grouping in relation to the total U.S. production.
Generally, a substantial segment of an industry (for purposes of
this Supplement) shall consist of:
    (A) Not less than 30 percent of the total number of U.S.
producers of the items concerned; or
    (B) Three or more U.S. producers who produce a combined total of
not less than 30 percent of the total U.S. annual production, by
dollar value of the items concerned; or
    (C) Not less than 20 percent of the total number of U.S.
producers of the items concerned, provided that the total of their
annual production thereof is not less than 20 percent of the total
U.S. annual production, by dollar value.
    (iii) If it is determined that a substantial segment of the
industry concerned has requested the establishment of a TAC
concerning a specific grouping of items that the Department of
Commerce determines difficult to evaluate for export control
purposes, BXA will establish and use the TAC requested.
    (4) Requests from trade associations or other representatives.
Requests from trade associations or other representatives of U.S.
producers for the establishment of a TAC must comply with the
provisions of paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this Supplement. In
addition, in order to assist BXA in determining whether the criteria
described in paragraph (b)(3) of this Supplement have been met, a
trade association or other representative submitting a request for
the establishment of a TAC should include the following information:
    (i) The total number of firms in the particular industry;
    (ii) The total number of firms in the industry that have
authorized the trade association or other representative to act in
their behalf in this matter;
    (iii) The approximate amount of total U.S. annual production by
dollar value of the items concerned produced by those firms that
have authorized the trade association or other representative to act
in their behalf; and
    (iv) A description of the method by which authorization to act
on behalf of these producers was obtained.
    (5) Nominations for membership on TACs. When the Department of
Commerce determines that the establishment of a TAC is warranted, it
will request nominations for membership on the committee among the
producers of the items and from any other sources that may be able
to suggest well-qualified nominees.
    (6) Selection of industry members of committee. Industry members
of a TAC will be selected by the Department of Commerce from a list
of the nominees who have indicated their availability for service on
the committee. To the extent feasible, the Department of Commerce
will select a committee balanced to represent all significant facets
of the industry involved, taking into consideration such factors as
the size of the firms, their geographical distribution, and their
product lines. No industry representative shall serve on a TAC for
more than four consecutive years. The membership of a member who is
absent from four consecutive meetings shall be terminated.
    (7) Government members. Government members of a TAC will be
selected by the Department of Commerce from the agencies having an
interest in the subject matter concerned.
    (8) Invitation to serve on committee. Invitations to serve on a
TAC will be sent by letter to the selected nominees.
    (9) Election of Chair. The Chair of each TAC shall be elected by
a vote of the majority of the members of the committee present and
voting.
    (c) Charter. (1) No TAC established pursuant to this Supplement
shall meet or take any action until an advisory committee charter
has been filed with the Assistant

[[Page 12739]]
Secretary for Export Administration of the Department of Commerce
and with the standing committees of the Senate and of the House of
Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over the Department.
Such charter shall contain the following information:
    (i) The committee's official designation;
    (ii) The committee's objectives and the scope of its activities;
    (iii) The period of time necessary for the committee to carry
out its purposes;
    (iv) The agency or official to whom the committee reports;
    (v) The agency responsible for providing the necessary support
for the committee;
    (vi) A description of the duties for which the committee is
responsible, and, if such duties are not solely advisory, a
specification of the authority for such functions;
    (vii) The estimated annual operating costs in dollars and years
for such committee;
    (viii) The estimated number and frequency of committee meetings;
    (ix) The committee's termination date, if less than two years
from the date of the committee's establishment; and
    (x) The date the charter is filed.
    (d) Meetings. (1) Each TAC established under the provisions of
the EAA and paragraph (b) of this Supplement shall meet at least
once every three months at the call of its Chair unless it is
specifically determined by the Chair, in consultation with other
members of the committee, that a particular meeting is not
necessary.
    (2) No TAC may meet except at the call of its Chair.
    (3) Each meeting of a TAC shall be conducted in accordance with
an agenda approved by a designated Federal government employee.
    (4) No TAC shall conduct a meeting in the absence of a
designated Federal government employee who shall be authorized to
adjourn any advisory committee meeting, whenever the Federal
government employee determines adjournment to be in the public
interest.
    (e) Public notice. Notice to the public of each meeting of a TAC
will be issued at least 20 days in advance and will be published in
the Federal Register. The notice will include the time and place of
the meeting and the agenda.
    (f) Public attendance and participation. (1) Any member of the
public who wishes to do so may file a written statement with any TAC
before or after any meeting of a committee.
    (2) A request for an opportunity to deliver an oral statement
relevant to matters on the agenda of a meeting of a TAC will be
granted to the extent that the time available for the meeting
permits. A committee may establish procedures requiring such persons
to obtain advance approval for such participation.
    (3) Attendance at meetings of TACs will be open to the public
unless it is determined pursuant to section 10(d) of the Federal
Advisory Committee Act to be necessary to close all, or some
portion, of the meeting to the public. A determination that a
meeting or portion thereof be closed to the public may be made if
all or a specific portion of a meeting of a TAC is concerned with
matters described in section 552(b) of Title 5, U.S.C.
    (4) Participation by members of the public in open TAC meetings
or questioning of committee members or other participants shall not
be permitted except in accordance with procedures established by the
committee.
    (5) Every effort will be made to accommodate all members of the
public who wish to attend.
    (g) Minutes. (1) Detailed minutes of each meeting of each TAC
will be kept and will contain a record of the persons present, a
complete and accurate description of the matters discussed and
conclusions reached, and copies of all reports received, issued, or
approved by the TAC.
    (2) The accuracy of all the minutes will be certified to by the
TAC Chair.
    (h) Records. (1) Subject to section 552 of Title 5, U.S.C. and
Department of Commerce Administrative Order 205-12, ``Public
Information,'' and ``Public Information'' regulations issued by the
Department of Commerce that are contained in 15 CFR part 4, Subtitle
A, the records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendices, working
papers, draft, studies, agenda, or other documents that were made
available to or prepared for or by each TAC will be available for
public inspection and copying.
    (2) Each TAC will prepare once each year a report describing its
membership, functions, activities, and such related matters as would
be informative to the public consistent with the policy of section
552(b) of Title 5, U.S.C.
    (3)(i) Requests for records should be addressed to: Bureau of
Export Administration, Freedom of Information, Records Inspection
Facility, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 4513, Washington, DC
20230, Telephone (202) 482-2593.
    (ii) Rules concerning the use of the Records Inspection Facility
are contained in 15 CFR part 4, Subtitle A, or may be obtained from
this facility.
    (i) Compensation. If the Department of Commerce deems it
appropriate, a member of a TAC may be reimbursed for travel,
subsistence, and other necessary expenses incurred in connection
with the member's duties.
    (j) Scope of advisory committee functions. All TACs are limited
to the functions described in their charters.
    (k) Duration of committees. Each TAC will terminate at the end
of two years from the date the committee was established or two
years from the effective date of its most recent extension,
whichever is later. Committees may be continued only for successive
two-year periods by appropriate action taken by the authorized
officer of the Department of Commerce prior to the date on which
such advisory committee would otherwise terminate. TACs may be
extended or terminated only after consultation with the committee.
    (l) Miscellaneous. (1) TACs established in accordance with

Commerce regulations or procedures affecting the establishment or
operation of advisory committees.
    (2) Whenever the Department of Commerce desires the advice or
assistance of a particular segment of an industry with respect to
any export control problem for which the service of a TAC, as
described in paragraph (b) of this Supplement is either unavailable
or impracticable, an advisory committee may be established pursuant
to the provisions of section 9 of the Federal Advisory Committee
Act. Such committees will be subject to the requirements of the
Federal Advisory Committee Act, OMB Circular A-63 (Revision of March
1974), ``Advisory Committee Management,'' Department of Commerce
Administrative Order 205-12, ``Public Information,'' and any other
applicable Department of Commerce regulations or procedures
affecting the establishment or operation of advisory committees.
    (3) Nothing in the provisions of this Supplement shall be
construed to restrict in any manner the right of any person or firm

E.O. 12924, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 917; Notice of August 15, 1995 (60
FR 42767, August 17, 1995).

Sec. 732.1  Steps overview.

    (a)(1) Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR are
references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part is intended
to help you determine your obligations under the EAR by listing logical
steps in Sec. 732.2 through Sec. 732.5 of this part that you can take
in reviewing these regulations. By cross-references to the relevant
provisions of the EAR, this part describes the suggested steps for you
to determine applicability of the following:
    (i) The scope of the EAR (part 734 of the EAR);
    (ii) Each of the general prohibitions (part 736 of the EAR);
    (iii) The License Exceptions (part 740 of the EAR); and
    (iv) Other requirements such as clearing your export with the U.S.
Customs Service, keeping records, and completing and documenting
license applications.
    (2) These steps describe the organization of the EAR, the
relationship among the provisions of the EAR, and the appropriate order
for you to consider the various provisions of the EAR.
    (b) Facts about your transaction. The following five types of facts
determine your obligations under the EAR and will be of help to you in
reviewing these steps:
    (1) What is it? What an item is, for export control purposes,
depends on its classification, which is its place on the Commerce
Control List (see part 774 of the EAR).
    (2) Where is it going? The country of ultimate destination for an
export or reexport also determines licensing requirements (see parts
738 and 774 of the EAR concerning the Country Chart and the Commerce
Control List).
    (3) Who will receive it? The ultimate end-user of your item cannot
be a bad end-user. See General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders) in
Sec. 736.2(b)(4) and parts 744 and 764 of the EAR for a reference to
the list of persons you may not deal with.
    (4) What will they do with it? The ultimate end-use of your item
cannot be a bad end-use. See General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-
User) in Sec. 736.2(b)(5) and part 744 of the EAR for general end-use
and end-user restrictions.
    (5) What else do they do? Conduct such as contracting, financing,
and freight forwarding in support of a proliferation project (as
described in Sec. 744.6 of the EAR) may prevent you from dealing with
someone.
    (c) Are your items and activities subject to the EAR? You should
first determine whether your commodity, software, or technology is
subject to the EAR (see part 734 of the EAR concerning scope), and
Steps 1 through 6 help you do that. For exports from the United States,
only Steps 1 and 2 are relevant. If you already know that your item or
activity is subject to the EAR, you should go on to consider the ten
general prohibitions in part 736 of the EAR. If your item or activity
is not subject to the EAR, you have no obligations under the EAR and
may skip the remaining steps.
    (d) Does your item or activity require a license under one or more
of the ten general prohibitions?
    (1) Brief summary of the ten general prohibitions. The general
prohibitions are found in part 736 of the EAR and referred to in these
steps. They consist, very briefly, of the following:
    (i) General Prohibition One (Exports and Reexports): Export and
reexport of controlled items to listed countries.
    (ii) General Prohibition Two (Parts and Components Reexports):
Reexport and export from abroad of foreign-made items incorporating
more than a de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content.
    (iii) General Prohibition Three (Foreign-produced Direct Product
Reexports): Reexport and export from abroad of the foreign-produced
direct product of U.S. technology and software.
    (iv) General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders): Engaging in actions
prohibited by a denial order.
    (v) General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-User): Export or reexport
to prohibited end-user or end-users.
    (vi) General Prohibition Six (Embargo): Export or reexport to
embargoed destinations.
    (vii) General Prohibition Seven (U.S. Person Proliferation
Activity): Support of proliferation activities.
    (viii) General Prohibition Eight (In-Transit): In-transit shipments
and items to be unladen from vessels and aircraft.
    (ix) General Prohibition Nine (Orders, Terms and Conditions):
Violation of any orders, terms, or conditions.
    (x) General Prohibition Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur):
Proceeding with transactions with knowledge that a violation has
occurred or is about to occur.
    (2) Controls on items on the Commerce Control List (CCL). If your
item or activity is subject to the EAR, you should determine whether
any one

[[Page 12741]]
or more of the ten general prohibitions require a license for your
export, reexport, or activity. Steps 7 through 11 refer to
classification of your item on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (part
774 of the EAR) and how to use the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to
part 738 of the EAR) to determine whether a license is required based
upon the classification of your item. These steps refer to General
Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components
Reexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports) for
all countries except: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea. For
these countries, you may skip Steps 7 through 11 and go directly to
Step 12.
    (3) Controls on activities. Steps 12 through 18 refer to General
Prohibitions Four through Ten. Those general prohibitions apply to all
items subject to the EAR, not merely those items listed on the CCL in
part 774 of the EAR. For example, they refer to the general
prohibitions for persons denied export privileges, prohibited end-uses
and end-users, embargoed countries (e.g., Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and
North Korea), prohibited activities of U.S. persons in support of
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, prohibited unlading of
shipments, compliance with orders, terms and conditions, and activities
when a violation has occurred or is about to occur.
    (4) General prohibitions. If none of the ten general prohibitions
applies, you should skip the steps concerning License Exceptions and
for exports from the United States, review Steps 27 through 29
concerning Shipper's Export Declarations to be filed with the U.S.
Customs Service, Destination Control Statements for export control
documents, and recordkeeping requirements.
    (e) Is a License Exception available to overcome the license
requirement? If you decide by reviewing the CCL in combination with the
Country Chart that a license is required for your destination, you
should determine whether a License Exception will except you from that
requirement. Steps 20 through 24 help you determine whether a License
Exception is available. Note that generally License Exceptions are not
available to overcome General Prohibitions Four through Ten. However,
selected License Exceptions for embargoed destinations are specified in
part 746 of the EAR and License Exceptions for short supply controls
are specified in part 754 of the EAR. If a License Exception is
available and the export is from the United States, you should review
Steps 26 through 28 concerning Shipper's Export Declarations to be
filed with the U.S. Customs Service, Destination Control Statements for
export control documents and recordkeeping requirements. If a License
Exception is not available, go on to Steps 25 through 29.
    (f) How do you apply for a license? If you must file a license
application, you should review the requirements of part 748 of the EAR
as suggested by Step 26. Then you should review Steps 27 through 29
concerning Shipper's Export Declarations to be filed with the U.S.
Customs Service, Destination Control Statements for export control
documents, and recordkeeping requirements.

Sec. 732.2  Steps regarding scope of the EAR.

    Steps 1 through 6 aid you in determining the scope of the EAR.
    (a) Step 1: Items subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another
Federal agency. This step is relevant for both exports and reexports.
Determine whether your item is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
another Federal Agency as provided in Sec. 734.3 of the EAR.
    (1) If your item is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
another Federal agency, comply with the regulations of that agency. You
need not comply with the EAR and may skip the remaining steps.
    (2) If your item is not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
another federal agency, then proceed to Step 2 in paragraph (b) of this
section.
    (b) Step 2: Publicly available technology and software. This step
is relevant for both exports and reexports. Determine if your
technology or software is publicly available as defined and explained
at part 734 of the EAR. Supplement No. 1 to part 734 of the EAR
contains several practical examples describing publicly available
technology and software that is outside the scope of the EAR. The
examples are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (1) If your technology or software is publicly available, and
therefore outside the scope of the EAR, you may proceed with the export
or reexport. You have no obligations under the EAR and need not comply
with the EAR. You may skip the remaining steps.
    (2) If your technology or software is not publicly available and
you are exporting from the United States, skip to Step 7 in
Sec. 732.3(b) of this part concerning the general prohibitions.
    (3) If you are exporting items from a foreign country, you should
then proceed to Step 3 in paragraph (c) of this section and the other
steps concerning the scope of the EAR.
    (c) Step 3: Reexport of U.S.-origin items. This step is appropriate
only for reexporters. For an item in a foreign country, you should
determine whether the item is of U.S. origin. If it is of U.S.-origin,
skip to Step 7 in Sec. 732.3(b) of this part. If it is not of U.S.
origin, then proceed to Step 4 in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Step 4: Foreign-made items incorporating less than the de
minimis level of U.S. parts, components, and materials. This step is
appropriate only for items that are made outside the United States.
    (1) For an item made in a foreign country, you should determine
whether controlled U.S.-origin parts, components, or materials are
incorporated as provided in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR. Also, determine the
value of the U.S.-origin controlled content as provided in Supplement
No. 2 to part 734 of the EAR.
    (2) To determine the value of the U.S.-origin controlled content,
you should classify the U.S.-origin content on the CCL, determine those
items that would require a license from BXA for reexport to the
ultimate destination of the foreign-made product if such parts,
components, or materials were reexported to that destination in the
form received, and divide the total value of the controlled U.S. parts,
components, and materials incorporated into the foreign-made item by
the sale price of the foreign-made item.
    (3) If no U.S. parts, components, or materials are incorporated or
if the incorporated U.S. parts, components, and materials are below the
de minimis level described in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR, then the foreign-
made item is not subject to the EAR by reason of the parts and
components rule, the classification of a foreign-made item is
irrelevant in determining the scope of the EAR, and you should skip
Step 4 and go on to consider Step 5 regarding the foreign-produced
direct product rule.
    (4) If controlled parts, components, or materials are incorporated
and are above the de minimis level, then you should go on to Step 5.
    (e) Step 5: Foreign-made items incorporating more than the de
minimis level of U.S. parts, components, or materials. This step is
appropriate only for foreign-made items incorporating certain U.S.
parts. If the incorporated U.S. parts exceed the relevant de minimis
level, then your export from abroad is subject to the EAR. You then
should skip to Step 7 at Sec. 732.3 of this part and consider the steps
regarding all other general prohibitions, License Exceptions, and other
requirements.

[[Page 12742]]

    (f) Step 6: Foreign-made items produced with certain U.S.
technology for export to specified destinations. This step is
appropriate for foreign-made items in foreign countries.
    (1) If your foreign-produced item is described in an entry on the
CCL and the Country Chart requires a license to your export or reexport
destination for national security reasons, you should determine whether
your item is subject to General Prohibition Three (Foreign-Produced
Direct Product Reexports) (Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR). Your item is
subject to the EAR if it is captured by General Prohibition Three
(Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports), and that prohibition
applies if your transaction meets each of the following conditions:
    (i) Country scope of prohibition. Your export or reexport
destination for the direct product is Cuba, North Korea, Libya, or a
destination in Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of
the EAR) (reexports of foreign-produced direct products exported to
other destinations are not subject to General Prohibition Three);
    (ii) Scope of technology or software used to create direct products
subject to the prohibition. Technology or software that was used to
create the foreign-produced direct product, and such technology or
software that was subject to the EAR and required a written assurance
as a supporting document for a license or as a precondition for the use
of License Exception TSR at Sec. 740.3(d) of the EAR (reexports of
foreign-produced direct products created with other technology and
software are not subject to General Prohibition Three); and
    (iii) Scope of direct products subject to the prohibition. The
foreign-produced direct products are subject to national security
controls as designated on the proper ECCN of the Commerce Control List
in part 774 of the EAR (reexports of foreign-produced direct products
not subject to national security controls are not subject to General
Prohibition Three).
    (2) License Exceptions. Each License Exception described in part
740 of the EAR overcomes this General Prohibition Three if all terms
and conditions of a given License Exception are met by the exporter or
reexporter.
    (3) Subject to the EAR. If your item is captured by the foreign-
produced direct product control at General Prohibition Three, then your
export from abroad is subject to the EAR. You should next consider the
steps regarding all other general prohibitions, License Exceptions, and
other requirements. If your item is not captured by General Prohibition
Three, then your export from abroad is not subject to the EAR. You have
completed the steps necessary to determine whether your transaction is
subject to the EAR, and you may skip the remaining steps. Note that in
summary, items in foreign countries are subject to the EAR when they
are:
    (i) U.S.-origin commodities, software and technology unless
controlled for export exclusively by another Federal agency or unless
publicly available;
    (ii) Foreign-origin commodities, software, and technology that are
within the scope of General Prohibition Two (Parts and Components
Reexports), or General Prohibition Three (Foreign-Produced Direct
Product Reexports). (However, such foreign-made items are also outside
the scope of the EAR if they are controlled for export exclusively by
another Federal agency or unless publicly available.)

Sec. 732.3  Steps regarding the ten general prohibitions.

    (a) Introduction. If your item or activity is subject to the scope
of the EAR, you should then consider each of the ten general
prohibitions listed in part 736 of the EAR. General Prohibitions One
((Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and
Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports) (Sec. 736.2(b) (1),
(2), and (3) of the EAR) are product controls that are shaped and
limited by parameters specified on the CCL and Country Chart. General
Prohibitions Four through Ten are prohibitions on certain activities
that are not allowed without authorization from BXA, and these
prohibitions apply to all items subject to the EAR unless otherwise
specified (Sec. 736.2(b) (4) through (10) of the EAR).
    (b) Step 7: Classification. (1) You should classify your items in
the relevant entry on the CCL, and you may do so on your own without
the assistance of BXA. You are responsible for doing so correctly, and
your failure to correctly classify your items does not relieve you of
the obligation to obtain a license when one is required by the EAR.
    (2) You have a right to request the applicable classification of
your item from BXA, and BXA has a duty to provide that classification
to you. For further information on how to obtain classification
assistance from BXA, see part 748 of the EAR.
    (3) For items subject to the EAR but not listed on the CCL, the
proper classification is EAR99. This number is a ``basket'' for items
not specified under any CCL entry and appears at the end of each
Category on the CCL.
    (c) Step 8: Country of ultimate destination. You should determine
the country of ultimate destination. The country of destination
determines the applicability of several general prohibitions, License
Exceptions, and other requirements. Note that part 754 of the EAR
concerning short supply controls is self-contained and is the only
location in the EAR that contains both the prohibitions and exceptions
applicable to short supply controls.
    (d) Step 9: Reason for control and the Country Chart. (1) Reason
for control and column identifier within the Export Control
Classification Number (ECCN). Once you have determined that your item
is controlled by a specific ECCN, you must use information contained in
the ``License Requirements'' section of that ECCN in combination with
the Country Chart to decide whether a license is required under General
Prohibitions One, Two, or Three to a particular destination. The CCL
and the Country Chart are taken together to define these license
requirements. The applicable ECCN will indicate the reason or reasons
for control for items within that ECCN. For example, ECCN 6A007 is
controlled for national security, missile technology, and anti-
terrorism reasons.
    (2) Reason for control within the Country Chart. With each of the
applicable Country Chart column identifiers noted in the correct ECCN,
turn to the Country Chart. Locate the correct Country Chart column
identifier on the horizontal axis, and determine whether an ``X'' is
marked in the cell next to the destination in question. Consult
Sec. 738.4 of the EAR for comprehensive instructions on using the
Country Chart and a detailed example.
    (i) An ``X'' in the cell or cells for the relevant country and
reason(s) for control column indicates that a license is required for
General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports in the Form Received),
Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced
Direct Product Reexports). (See Sec. 736.2 (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3)
of the EAR).
    (ii) If one or more cells have an ``X'' in the relevant column, a
license is required unless you qualify for a License Exception
described in part 740 of the EAR. If a cell does not contain an ``X''
for your destination in one or more relevant columns, a license is not
required under the CCL and the Country Chart.
    (iii) Additional controls may apply to your export. You must go on
to steps 12 through 18 described in paragraphs (g) to (m) of this
section to determine

[[Page 12743]]
whether additional limits described in General Prohibition Two (Parts
and Components Reexports) and General Prohibition Three (Foreign-
Produced Direct Product Reexports ) apply to your proposed transaction.
If you are exporting an item from the United States, you should skip
Step 10 and Step 11. Proceed directly to Step 12 in paragraph (g) of
this section.
    (3) License requirements not on the Country Chart. There are two
instances where the Country Chart cannot be used to determine if a
license is required. Items controlled for short supply reasons are not
governed by the Country Chart. Part 754 of the EAR contains license
requirements and License Exceptions for items subject to short supply
controls. A limited number of ECCNs contained on the CCL do not
identify a Country Chart column identifier. In these instances, the
ECCN states whether a license is required and for which destinations.
See Sec. 738.3(a) of the EAR for a list of the ECCNs for which you do
not need to consult the Country Chart to determine licensing
requirements.
    (4) Destinations subject to embargo provisions. The Country Chart
does not apply to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea; and for
those countries you should review the embargo provisions at part 746 of
the EAR and may skip this step concerning the Country Chart. For
Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Rwanda, and Serbia and Montenegro
the Country Chart provides for certain license requirements, and part
746 of the EAR provides additional requirements.
    (5) Items subject to the EAR but not on the CCL. Items subject to
the EAR that are not on the CCL are properly classified EAR99. For such
items, you may skip this step and proceed directly with Step 12 in
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (e) Step 10: Foreign-made items incorporating U.S.-origin items and
the de minimis rule. (1) Parts and components rule. The following
considerations are appropriate for items abroad and are the same steps
necessary to determine whether a foreign-made item incorporating U.S.
parts, components, or materials is subject to the EAR. If your foreign-
made item is described in an entry on the CCL and the Country Chart
requires a license to your export or reexport destination, you should
determine whether the controlled U.S.-origin commodities, software, or
technology incorporated into the foreign-made item exceeds the de
minimis level applicable to the ultimate destination of the foreign-
made item, as follows:
    (i) A 10% de minimis level to embargoed and terrorist-supporting
countries; or
    (ii) A 25% de minimis level to all other countries.
    (2) Guidance for calculations. For guidance on how to calculate the
U.S.-controlled content, refer to Supplement No. 2 to part 734 of the
EAR. Note that certain rules issued by the Office of Foreign Assets
Control, certain exports from abroad by U.S.-owned or controlled
entities may be prohibited notwithstanding the de minimis provisions of
the EAR. In addition, the de minimis exclusions from the parts and
components rule do not relieve U.S. persons of the obligation to
refrain from supporting the proliferation of weapons of mass-
destruction and missiles as provided in General Prohibition Seven (U.S.
Person Proliferation Activity) described in Sec. 736.2(b)(7) of the
EAR.
    (f) Step 11: Foreign-produced direct product. The following
considerations are appropriate for items abroad and are the same
considerations necessary to determine whether a foreign-produced direct
product is subject to the EAR under Step 6 in Sec. 732.2(f) of this
part.
    (1) If your foreign-produced item is described in an entry on the
CCL and the Country Chart requires a license to your export or reexport
destination for national security reasons, you must determine whether
your item is subject to General Prohibition Three (Foreign-Produced
Direct Product Reexports) (Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR). Your item is
subject to this general prohibition if your transaction meets each of
the following conditions:
    (i) Country scope of prohibition. Your export or reexport
destination for the direct product is Cuba, Libya, North Korea, or a
destination in Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of
the EAR) (reexports of foreign-produced direct products exported to
other destinations are not subject to General Prohibition Three
described in Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR);
    (ii) Scope of technology or software used to create direct products
subject to the prohibition. Technology or software that was used to
create the foreign-produced direct product, and such technology or
software that was subject to the EAR and required a written assurance
as a supporting document for a license or as a precondition for the use
of License Exception TSR described Sec. 740.19 of the EAR (reexports of
foreign-produced direct products created with other technology and
software are not subject to General Prohibition Three); and
    (iii) Scope of direct products subject to the prohibition. The
foreign-produced direct products are controlled for national security
reasons indicated in an ECCN on the CCL (reexports of foreign-produced
direct products not subject to national security controls are not
subject to General Prohibition Three).
    (2) License Exceptions. Each License Exception described in part
740 of the EAR overcomes General Prohibition Three (Foreign-Produced
Direct Product Reexports) if all terms and conditions of a given
License Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.
    (g) Step 12: Persons denied export privileges. (1) Determine
whether your transferee, ultimate end-user, any intermediate consignee,
or any other party to a transaction is a person denied export
privileges. (See part 764 of the EAR). While it is not a violation of
General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders) (Sec. 736.2(b)(4) of the EAR)
to fail to check the Denied Persons List prior to a transfer, it is
nonetheless a violation of the EAR to engage in any activity that
violates the terms or conditions of a denial order. General Prohibition
Four (Denial Orders) applies to all items subject to the EAR, i.e. both
items on the CCL and within EAR99.
    (2) There are no License Exceptions to General Prohibition Four
(Denial Orders). The prohibition concerning persons denied export
privileges may be overcome only by a specific authorization from BXA,
something that is rarely granted.
    (h) STEP 13: Prohibited end-uses and end-users. (1) Review the end-
uses and end-users prohibited under General Prohibition Five (End-Use
and End-User) (Sec. 736.2(b)(5) of the EAR) described in part 744 of
the EAR. Part 744 of the EAR contains all the end-use and end-user
license requirements, and those are in addition to the license
requirements under General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports),
Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three (Foreign-produced
Direct Product Reexports). Unless otherwise indicated, the license
requirements of General Prohibition Five (End-Use and End-User)
described in part 744 of the EAR apply to all items subject to the EAR,
i.e. both items on the CCL and within EAR99. Moreover, the requirements
of General Prohibition Five (End-Use and End-User) are in addition to
various end-use and end-user limitations placed on certain License
Exceptions.
    (2) There are no License Exceptions to General Prohibition Five
(End-Use and End-User) (Sec. 736.2(b)(5) of the EAR) described in part
740 of the EAR.
    (i) Step 14: Embargoed countries and special destinations. If your
destination for any item is Bosnia-Herzegovina,

[[Page 12744]]
Croatia, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Rwanda, or Serbia and
Montenegro, you must consider the requirements of part 746 of the EAR.
Unless otherwise indicated, General Prohibition Six (Embargo) applies
to all items subject to the EAR, i.e. both items on the CCL and within
EAR99. You may not make an export or reexport contrary to the
provisions of part 746 of the EAR without a license unless:
    (1) You are exporting or reexporting only publicly available
technology or software or other items outside the scope of the EAR, or
    (2) You qualify for a License Exception referenced in part 746 of
the EAR concerning embargoed destinations. You may not use a License
Exception described in part 740 of the EAR to overcome General
Prohibition Six (Embargo) (Sec. 736.2(b)(6) of the EAR) unless it is
specifically authorized in part 746 of the EAR. Note that part 754 of
the EAR concerning short supply controls is self-contained and is the
only location in the EAR for both the prohibitions and exceptions
applicable to short supply controls.
    (j) Step 15: Proliferation activity of U.S. persons unrelated to
exports and reexports. (1) Review the scope of activity prohibited by
General Prohibition Seven (U.S. Person Proliferation Activity)
(Sec. 736.2(b)(7) of the EAR) as that activity is described in
Sec. 744.6 of the EAR. Keep in mind that such activity is not limited
to exports and reexports and is not limited to items subject to General
Prohibition One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components
Reexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports).
Moreover, such activity extends to services and dealing in wholly
foreign-origin items in support of the specified proliferation activity
and is not limited to items listed on the CCL or included in EAR99.
    (2) Review the definition of U.S. Person in part 744 of the EAR.
    (k) Step 16: In-transit. Shippers and operators of vessels or
aircraft should review General Prohibition Eight (In-Transit) to
determine the countries in which you may not unladen or ship certain
items in-transit. General Prohibition Eight applies to all items
subject to the EAR, i.e. both items on the CCL and within EAR99.
    (l) Step 17: Review orders, terms, and conditions. Review the
orders, terms, and conditions applicable to your transaction. General
Prohibition Nine (Orders, Terms, and Conditions) prohibits the
violation of any orders, terms, and conditions imposed under the EAR.
Terms and conditions are frequently contained in licenses. In addition,
the ten general prohibitions (part 736 of the EAR) and the License
Exceptions (part 740 of the EAR) impose terms and conditions or
limitations on your proposed transactions and use of License
Exceptions. A given license or License Exception may not be used unless
each relevant term or condition is met.
    (m) Step 18: Review the ``Know Your Customer'' Guidance and General
Prohibition Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur). License requirements
under the EAR are determined solely by the classification, end-use,
end-user, ultimate destination, and conduct of U.S. persons. Supplement
No. 1 to part 732 of the EAR is intended to provide helpful guidance
regarding the process for the evaluation of information about
customers, end-uses, and end-users. General Prohibition Ten (Knowledge
Violation to Occur) prohibits anyone from proceeding with a transaction
with knowledge that a violation of the EAR has occurred or is about to
occur. It also prohibits related shipping, financing, and other
services. General Prohibition Ten applies to all items subject to the
EAR, i.e. both items on the CCL and within EAR99.
    (n) Step 19: Complete the review of the general prohibitions. After
completion of Steps described in this section and review of all ten
general prohibitions in part 736 of the EAR, including cross-referenced
regulations in the EAR, you will know which, if any, of the ten general
prohibitions of the EAR apply to you and your contemplated transaction
or activity.
    (1) If none of the ten general prohibitions is applicable to your
export from the United States, no license from BXA is required, you do
not need to qualify for a License Exception under part 740 of the EAR.
You should skip the Steps in Sec. 732.4 of this part regarding License
Exceptions and proceed directly to the Steps in Sec. 732.5 of this part
regarding recordkeeping, clearing the U.S. Customs Service with the
appropriate Shipper's Export Declaration, and using the required
Destination Control Statement.
    (2) If none of the ten general prohibitions is applicable to your
reexport or export from abroad, no license is required and you should
skip all remaining Steps.
    (3) If one or more of the ten general prohibitions are applicable,
continue with the remaining steps.

Sec. 732.4  Steps regarding License Exceptions.

    (a) Introduction to Steps for License Exceptions. If your export or
reexport is subject to the EAR and is subject to General Prohibitions
One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), or
Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports), consider the steps
listed in paragraph (b) of this section. If your export or reexport is
subject to General Prohibitions Four (Denial Orders), Seven (U.S.
Person Proliferation Activity), Eight (In-Transit), Nine (Orders,
Terms, and Conditions), or Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur), there
are no License Exceptions available for your export or reexport. If
your export is subject to General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-User),
consult part 744 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to
General Prohibition Six (Embargo), consult part 746 of the EAR for
applicable License Exceptions.
    (b) Steps for License Exceptions. (1) Step 20: Applicability of
General Prohibitions. Determine whether any one or more of the general
prohibitions described in Sec. 736.2(b) of the EAR apply to your export
or reexport. If no general prohibition applies to your export or
reexport, then you may proceed with your export or reexport and need
not review part 740 of the EAR regarding License Exceptions. You are
reminded of your recordkeeping obligations related to the clearance of
the U.S. Customs Service provided in parts 762 and 758 of the EAR.
    (2) Step 21: Applicability of restrictions on all License
Exceptions. Determine whether any one or more of the restrictions in
Sec. 740.2 of the EAR applies to your export or reexport. If any one or
more of these restrictions apply, there are no License Exceptions
available to you, and you must either obtain a license or refrain from
the export or reexport.
    (3) Step 22: Terms and conditions of the License Exceptions. (i) If
none of the restrictions in Sec. 740.2 of the EAR applies, then review
each of the License Exceptions to determine whether any one of them
authorizes your export or reexport. Eligibility for License Exceptions
is based on the item, the country of ultimate destination, the end-use,
and the end-user, along with any special conditions imposed within a
specific License Exception.
    (ii) You may meet the conditions for more than one License
Exception. Moreover, although you may not qualify for some License
Exceptions you may qualify for others. Review the broadest License
Exceptions first, and use any License Exception available to you. You
are not required to use the most restrictive applicable License
Exception. If you fail to qualify for the License Exception that you
first consider, you may consider any other License

[[Page 12745]]
Exception until you have determined that no License Exception is
available.
    (iii) License Exception groupings TMP, RPL, BAG, AVS, GOV, and TSU
authorize exports notwithstanding the provisions of the CCL. License
Exceptions in the list-based grouping (LST) are available only to the
extent specified on the CCL. Part 740 of the EAR provides authorization
for reexports only to the extent each License Exception expressly
authorizes reexports. License Exception APR authorizes reexports only.
    (4) Step 23: Scope of License Exceptions. Some License Exceptions
are limited by country or by type of item.
    (i) Countries are arranged in country groups for ease of reference.
For a listing of country groups, please refer to Supplement No. 1 to
part 740 of the EAR. Unless otherwise indicated in a License Exception,
License Exceptions do not apply to any exports or reexports to
embargoed destinations. If your export or reexport is subject to
General Prohibition Six (Embargo) for embargoed destinations, License
Exceptions are only available to the extent specifically provided in
part 746 of the EAR concerning embargoed destinations.
    (ii) Special commodity controls apply to short supply items. No
License Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR may be used for
items listed on the CCL as controlled for Short Supply reasons. License
Exceptions for short supply items are found in part 754 of the EAR.
    (5) Step 24: Compliance with all terms and conditions. If a License
Exception is available, you may proceed with your export or reexport.
However, you must meet all the terms and conditions required by the
License Exception that you determined authorized your export or
reexport. You must also consult part 758 and 762 of the EAR to
determine your recordkeeping and documentation requirements.
    (6) Step 25: License requirements. If no License Exception is
available, then you must either obtain a license before proceeding with
your export or reexport or you must refrain from the proposed export or
reexport.
    (7) Step 26: License applications. If you are going to file a
license application with BXA, you should first review the requirements
at part 748 of the EAR. Exporters, reexporters, and exporters from
abroad should review the instructions concerning applications and
required support documents prior to submitting an application for a
license.

Sec. 732.5  Steps regarding Shipper's Export Declaration, Destination
Control Statements, record keeping, license applications, and other
requirements.

    (a) Step 27--Shipper's Export Declaration. You should review
Sec. 758.3 of the EAR to determine what notations you must enter on the
Shipper's Export Declaration (SED). These steps should be reviewed by
exporters. Reexporters and firms exporting from abroad may skip Steps
27 through 29 and proceed directly to Sec. 732.6 of this part.
    (1) NLR. The term ``NLR'' represents exports of listed items when
no license is required. Such exports do not require that you qualify
for a License Exception. The symbol ``NLR'' is required on the SED
under two circumstances. First, NLR is the correct symbol when
exporting an item subject to the EAR not listed on the CCL. Such items
are classified EAR99. Secondly, certain items are listed on the CCL but
do not require a license to all destinations under General Prohibitions
One (Exports and Reexports in the Form Received), Two (Parts and
Components Reexports), or Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product
Reexports) (Sec. 736.2 (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of the EAR). Such
items do not have an ``X'' in the appropriate cell on the Country
Chart. If General Prohibitions Four through Ten (Sec. 736.2 (b)(4) of
the EAR) through (b)(10) of the EAR) also do not apply, you must clear
exports of such items by entering the symbol ``NLR'' in the appropriate
place on the SED.
    (2) License Exception group symbol. You must enter on any required
SED the letter code (e.g., LST, TMP) of the group of License Exceptions
under which you are exporting. In the case of License Exceptions
grouped under LST, the ECCN of the item being exported must also be
entered when an SED is required. Please refer to Sec. 758.3 of the EAR
for detailed information on use of SEDs.
    (3) License number. If you are exporting under a license, enter the
license number on the SED as required by Sec. 758.3 of the EAR.
    (b) Step 28: Destination Control Statement. You are required to
enter an appropriate Destination Control Statement (DCS) on commercial
documents in accordance with the DCS requirements of Sec. 758.6 of the
EAR. Exporters should review Sec. 758.6 of the EAR and use the DCS as
required. Reexporters and exporters from abroad should review
Sec. 752.6 for DCS requirements when using a Special Comprehensive
License. Otherwise, DCS requirements do not apply to reexports and
exports from abroad.
    (c) Step 29: Recordkeeping. Records of transactions involving
exports under any license or License Exception must be maintained in
accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of part 762 of the EAR.

Sec. 732.6  Steps for other requirements.

    Sections 732.1 through 732.4 of this part are useful in determining
the license requirements that apply to you. Other portions of the EAR
impose other obligations and requirements. Some of them are:
    (a) Requirements relating to the use of a license in Sec. 758.2 of
the EAR.
    (b) Obligations of carriers, forwarders, exporters and others to
take specific steps and prepare and deliver certain documents to assure
that items subject to the EAR are delivered to the destination to which
they are licensed or authorized by a License Exception or some other
provision of the regulations in Sec. 758.4 through Sec. 758.6 of the
EAR.
    (c) Duty of carriers to return or unload shipments at the direction
of U.S. Government officials (see Sec. 758.8 of the EAR).
    (d) Specific obligations imposed on parties to Special
Comprehensive licenses in part 752 of the EAR.
    (e) Recordkeeping requirements imposed in part 762 of the EAR.
    (f) Requirements of part 764 of the EAR to disclose facts that may
come to your attention after you file a license application or make
other statements to the government concerning a transaction or proposed
transaction that is subject to the EAR.
    (g) Certain obligations imposed by part 760 of the EAR on parties
who receive requests to take actions related to foreign boycotts and
prohibits certain actions relating to those boycotts.

Supplement No. 1--BXA's ``Know Your Customer'' Guidance and Red
Flags

``Know Your Customer'' Guidance

    Various requirements of the EAR are dependent upon a person's
knowledge of the end-use, end-user, ultimate destination, or other
facts relating to a transaction or activity. These provisions
include the nonproliferation-related ``catch-all'' sections and the
prohibition against proceeding with a transaction with knowledge
that a violation of the EAR has occurred or is about to occur.
    (a) BXA provides the following guidance on how individuals and
firms should act under this knowledge standard. This guidance does
not change or interpret the EAR.
    (1) Decide whether there are ``red flags''. Take into account
any abnormal circumstances in a transaction that indicate that the
export may be destined for an inappropriate end-use, end-user, or
destination. Such circumstances are referred to as ``red flags''.
Included among examples

[[Page 12746]]
of red flags are orders for items that are inconsistent with the
needs of the purchaser, a customer declining installation and
testing when included in the sales price or when normally requested,
or requests for equipment configurations that are incompatible with
the stated destination (e.g., 120 volts in a country with 220
volts). Commerce has developed lists of such red flags that are not
all-inclusive but are intended to illustrate the types of
circumstances that should cause reasonable suspicion that a
transaction will violate the EAR.
    (2) If there are ``red flags'', inquire. If there are no ``red
flags'' in the information that comes to your firm, you should be
able to proceed with a transaction in reliance on information you
have received. That is, absent ``red flags'' (or an express
requirement in the EAR), there is no affirmative duty upon exporters
to inquire, verify, or otherwise ``go behind'' the customer's
representations. However, when ``red flags'' are raised in
information that comes to your firm, you have a duty to check out
the suspicious circumstances and inquire about the end-use, end-
user, or ultimate country of destination. The duty to check out
``red flags'' is not confined to the use of License Exceptions
affected by the ``know'' or ``reason to know'' language in the EAR.
Applicants for licenses are required by part 748 of the EAR to
obtain documentary evidence concerning the transaction, and
misrepresentation or concealment of material facts is prohibited,
both in the licensing process and in all export control documents.
You can rely upon representations from your customer and repeat them
in the documents you file unless red flags oblige you to take
verification steps.
    (3) Do not self-blind. Do not cut off the flow of information
that comes to your firm in the normal course of business. For
example, do not instruct the sales force to tell potential customers
to refrain from discussing the actual end-use, end-user, and
ultimate country of destination for the product your firm is seeking
to sell. Do not put on blinders that prevent the learning of
relevant information. An affirmative policy of steps to avoid
``bad'' information would not insulate a company from liability, and
it would usually be considered an aggravating factor in an
enforcement proceeding.
    (4) Employees need to know how to handle ``red flags''.
Knowledge possessed by an employee of a company can be imputed to a
firm so as to make it liable for a violation. This makes it
important for firms to establish clear policies and effective
compliance procedures to ensure that such knowledge about
transactions can be evaluated by responsible senior officials.
Failure to do so could be regarded as a form of self-blinding.
    (5) Reevaluate all the information after the inquiry. The
purpose of this inquiry and reevaluation is to determine whether the
``red flags'' can be explained or justified. If they can, you may
proceed with the transaction. If the ``red flags'' cannot be
explained or justified and you proceed, you run the risk of having
had ``knowledge'' that would make your action a violation of the
EAR.
    (6) Refrain from the transaction or advise BXA and wait. If you
continue to have reasons for concern after your inquiry, then you
should either refrain from the transaction or submit all the
relevant information to BXA in the form of an application for a
validated license or in such other form as BXA may specify.
    (b) Industry has an important role to play in preventing exports
and reexports contrary to the national security and foreign policy
interests of the United States. BXA will continue to work in
partnership with industry to make this front line of defense
effective, while minimizing the regulatory burden on exporters. If
you have any question about whether you have encountered a ``red
flag'', you may contact the Office of Export Enforcement at 1-800-
424-2980 or the Office of Exporter Services at (202) 482-4532.

Red Flags

    Possible indicators that an unlawful diversion might be planned
by your customer include the following:
    1. The customer or purchasing agent is reluctant to offer
information about the end-use of a product.
    2. The product's capabilities do not fit the buyer's line of
business; for example, a small bakery places an order for several
sophisticated lasers.
    3. The product ordered is incompatible with the technical level
of the country to which the product is being shipped. For example,
semiconductor manufacturing equipment would be of little use in a
country without an electronics industry.
    4. The customer has little or no business background.
    5. The customer is willing to pay cash for a very expensive item
when the terms of the sale call for financing.
    6. The customer is unfamiliar with the product's performance
characteristics but still wants the product.
    7. Routine installation, training or maintenance services are
declined by the customer.
    8. Delivery dates are vague, or deliveries are planned for out-
of-the-way destinations.
    9. A freight forwarding firm is listed as the product's final
destination.
    10. The shipping route is abnormal for the product and
destination.
    11. Packaging is inconsistent with the stated method of shipment
or destination.
    12. When questioned, the buyer is evasive or unclear about
whether the purchased product is for domestic use, export or
reexport.

E.O. 12924, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 917; Notice of August 15, 1995 (60
FR 42767, August 17, 1995).

Sec. 734.1  Introduction.

    (a) In this part, references to the Export Administration
Regulations (EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.
This part describes the scope of the Export Administration Regulations
(EAR) and explains certain key terms and principles used in the EAR.
This part provides the rules you need to use to determine whether items
and activities are subject to the EAR. This part is the first step in
determining your obligations under the EAR. If your item or activity is
not subject to the EAR, then you do not have any obligations under the
EAR and you do not need to review other parts of the EAR. If you
already know that your item or activity is subject to the EAR, you do
not need to review this part and you can go on to review other parts of
the EAR to determine your obligations. This part also describes certain
key terms and principles used in the EAR. Specifically, it includes the
following terms: ``subject to the EAR,'' ``items subject to the EAR,''
``export,'' and ``reexport.'' These and other terms are also included
in part 772 of the EAR, Definitions of Terms, and you should consult
part 772 of the EAR for the meaning of terms used in the EAR. Finally,
this part makes clear that compliance with the EAR does not relieve any
obligations imposed under foreign laws.
    (b) This part does not address any of the provisions set forth in
part 760 of the EAR, Restrictive Trade Practices or Boycotts.
    (c) This part does not define the scope of legal authority to
regulate exports, including reexports, or activities found in the
Export Administration Act and other statutes. What this part does do is
set forth the extent to which such legal authority has been exercised
through the EAR.

Sec. 734.2  Important EAR terms and principles.

    (a) Subject to the EAR--Definition. (1) ``Subject to the EAR'' is a
term used in the EAR to describe those items and

[[Page 12747]]
activities over which BXA exercises regulatory jurisdiction under the
EAR. Conversely, items and activities that are not subject to the EAR
are outside the regulatory jurisdiction of the EAR and are not affected
by these regulations. The items and activities subject to the EAR are
described in Sec. 734.2 through Sec. 734.5 of this part. You should
review the Commerce Control List (CCL) and any applicable parts of the
EAR to determine whether an item or activity is subject to the EAR.
However, if you need help in determining whether an item or activity is
subject to the EAR, see Sec. 734.6 of this part. Publicly available
technology and software not subject to the EAR are described in
Sec. 734.7 through Sec. 734.11 and Supplement No. 1 to this part.
    (2) Items and activities subject to the EAR may also be controlled
under export-related programs administered by other agencies. Items and
activities subject to the EAR are not necessarily exempted from the
control programs of other agencies. Although BXA and other agencies
that maintain controls for national security and foreign policy reasons
try to minimize overlapping jurisdiction, you should be aware that in
some instances you may have to comply with more than one regulatory
program.
    (3) The term ``subject to the EAR'' should not be confused with
licensing or other requirements imposed in other parts of the EAR. Just
because an item or activity is subject to the EAR does not mean that a
license or other requirement automatically applies. A license or other
requirement applies only in those cases where other parts of the EAR
impose a licensing or other requirement on such items or activities.
    (b) Export and reexport. (1) Definition of export. ``Export'' means
an actual shipment or transmission of items subject to the EAR out of
the United States; or release of technology or software subject to the
EAR to a foreign national in the United States, as described in
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. See part 772 of the EAR for the
definition that applies to exports of satellites subject to the EAR.
    (2) Export of technology or software. ``Export'' of technology or
software includes:
    (i) Any release of technology or software subject to the EAR in a
foreign country; or
    (ii) Any release of technology or source code subject to the EAR to
a foreign national. Such release is deemed to be an export to the home
country or countries of the foreign national. This deemed export rule
does not apply to persons lawfully admitted for permanent residence in
the United States and does not apply to persons who are protected
individuals under the Immigration and Naturalization Act (8 U.S.C.
1324b(a)(3)). Note that the release of any item to any party with
knowledge a violation is about to occur is prohibited by
Sec. 736.2(b)(10) of the EAR.
    (3) Definition of ``release'' of technology or software. Technology
or software is ``released'' for export through:
    (i) Visual inspection by foreign nationals of U.S.-origin equipment
and facilities;
    (ii) Oral exchanges of information in the United States or abroad;
or
    (iii) The application to situations abroad of personal knowledge or
technical experience acquired in the United States.
    (4) Definition of reexport. ``Reexport'' means an actual shipment
or transmission of items subject to the EAR from one foreign country to
another foreign country; or release of technology or software subject
to the EAR to a foreign national outside the United States, as
described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. See part 772 of the EAR
for the definition that applies to reexports of satellites subject to
the EAR.
    (5) Reexport of technology or software. Any release of technology
or source code subject to the EAR to a foreign national of another
country is a deemed reexport to the home country or countries of the
foreign national. However, this deemed reexport definition does not
apply to persons lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The term
``release'' is defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Note that
the release of any item to any party with knowledge or reason to know a
violation is about to occur is prohibited by Sec. 736.2(b)(10) of the
EAR.
    (6) For purposes of the EAR, the export or reexport of items
subject to the EAR that will transit through a country or countries or
be transshipped in a country or countries to a new country or are
intended for reexport to the new country, are deemed to be exports to
the new country.
    (7) If a territory, possession, or department of a foreign country
is not listed on the Country Chart in Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of
the EAR, the export or reexport of items subject to the EAR to such
destination is deemed under the EAR to be an export to the foreign
country. For example, a shipment to the Cayman Islands, a dependent
territory of the United Kingdom, is deemed to be a shipment to the
United Kingdom.
    (8) Export or reexport of items subject to the EAR does not include
shipments among any of the states of the United States, the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands or any territory, dependency, or possession of the
United States. These destinations are listed in Schedules C & E,
Classification of Country and Territory Designations for U.S. Export
Statistics, issued by the Bureau of the Census.

Sec. 734.3  Items subject to the EAR.

    (a) Except for items excluded in paragraph (b) of this section, the
following items are subject to the EAR:
    (1) All items in the United States, including in a U.S. Foreign
Trade Zone or moving intransit through the United States from one
foreign country to another;
    (2) All U.S. origin items wherever located;
    (3) U.S. origin parts, components, materials or other commodities
incorporated abroad into foreign-made products, U.S. origin software
commingled with foreign software, and U.S. origin technology commingled
with foreign technology, in quantities exceeding de minimis levels as
described in Sec. 734.4 and Supplement No. 2 of this part;
    (4) Certain foreign-made direct products of U.S. origin technology
or software, as described in Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR. The term
``direct product'' means the immediate product (including processes and
services) produced directly by the use of technology or software; and
    (5) Certain commodities produced by any plant or major component of
a plant located outside the United States that is a direct product of
U.S.-origin technology or software, as described in Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of
the EAR.
    (b) The following items are not subject to the EAR:
    (1) Items that are exclusively controlled for export or reexport by
the following departments and agencies of the U.S. Government which
regulate exports or reexports for national security or foreign policy
purposes:
    (i) Department of State. The International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (22 CFR part 121) administered by the Office of Defense
Trade Controls relate to defense articles and defense services on the
U.S. Munitions List. Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22
U.S.C. 2778).
    (ii) Treasury Department, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
Regulations administered by OFAC implement broad controls and embargo
transactions with certain foreign countries. These regulations include
controls on exports and reexports to

[[Page 12748]]
certain countries (31 CFR chapter V). Trading with the Enemy Act (50
U.S.C. app. section 1 et seq.), and International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701, et seq.)
    (iii) U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Regulations
administered by NRC control the export and reexport of commodities
related to nuclear reactor vessels (10 CFR part 110). Atomic Energy Act
of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. part 2011 et seq.).
    (iv) Department of Energy (DOE). Regulations administered by DOE
control the export and reexport of technology related to the production
of special nuclear materials (10 CFR part 810). Atomic Energy Act of
1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. section 2011 et seq.).
    (v) Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). Regulations administered by
PTO provide for the export to a foreign country of unclassified
technology in the form of a patent application or an amendment,
modification, or supplement thereto or division thereof (37 CFR part
5). BXA has delegated authority under the Export Administration Act to
the PTO to approve exports and reexports of such technology which is
subject to the EAR. Exports and reexports of such technology not
approved under PTO regulations must comply with the EAR.
    (2) Prerecorded phonograph records reproducing in whole or in part,
the content of printed books, pamphlets, and miscellaneous
publications, including newspapers and periodicals; printed books,
pamphlets, and miscellaneous publications including bound newspapers
and periodicals; children's picture and painting books; newspaper and
periodicals, unbound, excluding waste; music books; sheet music;
calendars and calendar blocks, paper; maps, hydrographical charts,
atlases, gazetteers, globe covers, and globes (terrestrial and
celestial); exposed and developed microfilm reproducing, in whole or in
part, the content of any of the above; exposed and developed motion
picture film and soundtrack; and advertising printed matter exclusively
related thereto.
    (3) Publicly available technology and software that:
    (i) Are already published or will be published as described in
Sec. 734.7 of this part;
    (ii) Arise during, or result from, fundamental research, as
described in Sec. 734.8 of this part;
    (iii) Are educational, as described in Sec. 734.9 of this part; or
    (iv) Are included in certain patent applications, as described in
Sec. 734.10 of this part.
    (4) Foreign made items that have de minimis U.S. content based on
the principles described in Sec. 734.4 of this part.
    (c) ``Items subject to the EAR'' consist of the items listed on the
Commerce Control List (CCL) in part 774 of the EAR and all other items
which meet the definition of that term. For ease of reference and
classification purposes, items subject to the EAR which are not listed
on the CCL are designated as ``EAR99.''

Sec. 734.4  De minimis U.S. content.

    (a) There is no de minimis level for the export from a foreign
country of a foreign-made computer exceeding 7000 MTOPS containing
U.S.-origin controlled semiconductors (other than memory circuits)
classified under ECCN 3A001 or high speed interconnect devices (ECCN
4A003.g) to Computer Tier 3 and 4 countries described in Sec. 742.12 of
the EAR.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section for certain
computers, for embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR, and for
countries named as terrorist-supporting countries in part 744 of the
EAR, the following are not subject to the EAR:
    (1) Reexports of a foreign-made commodity incorporating controlled
U.S.-origin commodities valued at 10% or less of the total value of the
foreign-made commodity;
    (2) Reexports of foreign-made software incorporating controlled
U.S.-origin software valued at 10% or less of the total value of the
foreign-made software; or
    (3) Reexports of foreign technology commingled with or drawn from
controlled U.S. origin technology valued at 10% or less of the total
value of the foreign technology.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section for certain
computers, for all other countries not included in paragraph (b) of
this section, the following are not subject to the EAR:
    (1) Reexports of a foreign-made commodity incorporating controlled
U.S.-origin commodities valued at 25% or less of the total value of the
foreign-made commodity;
    (2) Reexports of foreign-made software incorporating controlled
U.S.-origin software valued at 25% or less of the total value of the
foreign-made software; or
    (3) Reexports of foreign technology commingled with or drawn from
controlled U.S.-origin technology valued at 25% or less of the total
value of the foreign technology.
    (d) For purposes of determining de minimis levels, technology and
source code used to design or produce foreign-made commodities or
software are not considered to be incorporated into such foreign-made
commodities or software. Commodities subject only to short supply
controls are not included in calculating U.S. content.
    (e) You are responsible for making the necessary calculations to
determine whether the de minimis provisions apply to your situation.
See Supplement No. 2 to part 734 for guidance regarding calculation of
U.S. controlled content.
    (f) See Sec. 770.3 of the EAR for principles that apply to
commingled U.S.-origin technology and software.

Sec. 734.5  Activities of U.S. and foreign persons subject to the EAR.

    The following kinds of activities are subject to the EAR:
    (a) Certain activities of U.S. persons related to the proliferation
of chemical or biological weapons or of missile technology as described
in Sec. 744.6 of the EAR.
    (b) Activities of U.S. or foreign persons prohibited by any order
issued under the EAR, including a Denial Order issued pursuant to part
766 of the EAR.

Sec. 734.6  Assistance available from BXA for determining licensing and
other requirements.

    (a) If you are not sure whether a commodity, software, technology,
or activity is subject to the EAR, or is subject to licensing or other
requirements under the EAR, you may ask BXA for an advisory opinion,
classification, or a determination whether a particular item or
activity is subject to the EAR. In many instances, including those
where the item is specially designed, developed, configured, adapted,
or modified for military application, the item may fall under the
licensing jurisdiction of the Department of State and may be subject to
the controls of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR
parts 120 through 130) (ITAR). In order to determine if the Department
of State has licensing jurisdiction over an item, you should submit a
request for a commodity jurisdiction determination to the Department of
State, Office of Defense Trade Controls. Exporters should note that in
a very limited number of cases, the categories of items may be subject
to both the ITAR and the EAR. The relevant departments are working to
eliminate any unnecessary overlaps that may exist.
    (b) As the agency responsible for administering the EAR, BXA is the
only agency that has the responsibility for determining whether an item
or activity

[[Page 12749]]
is subject to the EAR and, if so, what licensing or other requirements
apply under the EAR. Such a determination only affects EAR
requirements, and does not affect the applicability of any other
regulatory programs.
    (c) If you need help in determining BXA licensing or other
requirements you may ask BXA for help by following the procedures
described in Sec. 748.3 of the EAR.

Sec. 734.7  Published information and software.

    (a) Information is ``published'' when it becomes generally
accessible to the interested public in any form, including:
    (1) Publication in periodicals, books, print, electronic, or any
other media available for general distribution to any member of the
public or to a community of persons interested in the subject matter,
such as those in a scientific or engineering discipline, either free or
at a price that does not exceed the cost of reproduction and
distribution (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions A(1) through
A(6));
    (2) Ready availability at libraries open to the public or at
university libraries (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question
A(6));
    (3) Patents and open (published) patent applications available at
any patent office; and
    (4) Release at an open conference, meeting, seminar, trade show, or
other open gathering.
    (i) A conference or gathering is ``open'' if all technically
qualified members of the public are eligible to attend and attendees
are permitted to take notes or otherwise make a personal record (not
necessarily a recording) of the proceedings and presentations.
    (ii) All technically qualified members of the public may be
considered eligible to attend a conference or other gathering
notwithstanding a registration fee reasonably related to cost and
reflecting an intention that all interested and technically qualified
persons be able to attend, or a limitation on actual attendance, as
long as attendees either are the first who have applied or are selected
on the basis of relevant scientific or technical competence,
experience, or responsibility (See Supplement No. 1 to this part,
Questions B(1) through B(6)).
    (iii) ``Publication'' includes submission of papers to domestic or
foreign editors or reviewers of journals, or to organizers of open
conferences or other open gatherings, with the understanding that the
papers will be made publicly available if favorably received. (See
Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions A(1) and A(3)).
    (b) Software and information is published when it is available for
general distribution either for free or at a price that does not exceed
the cost of reproduction and distribution. See Supplement No. 1 to this
part, Questions G(1) through G(3).

Sec. 734.8  Information resulting from fundamental research.

    (a) Fundamental research. Paragraphs (b) through (d) of this
section and Sec. 734.11 of this part provide specific rules that will
be used to determine whether research in particular institutional
contexts qualifies as ``fundamental research''. The intent behind these
rules is to identify as ``fundamental research'' basic and applied
research in science and engineering, where the resulting information is
ordinarily published and shared broadly within the scientific
community. Such research can be distinguished from proprietary research
and from industrial development, design, production, and product
utilization, the results of which ordinarily are restricted for
proprietary reasons or specific national security reasons as defined in
Sec. 732.10 of this part. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question
D(8)).
    (b) University based research. (1) Research conducted by
scientists, engineers, or students at a university normally will be
considered fundamental research, as described in paragraphs (b) (2)
through (6) of this section. (``University'' means any accredited
institution of higher education located in the United States.)
    (2) Prepublication review by a sponsor of university research
solely to insure that the publication would not inadvertently divulge
proprietary information that the sponsor has furnished to the
researchers does not change the status of the research as fundamental
research. However, release of information from a corporate sponsor to
university researchers where the research results are subject to
prepublication review, is subject to the EAR. (See Supplement No. 1 to
this part, Questions D(7), D(9), and D(10).)
    (3) Prepublication review by a sponsor of university research
solely to ensure that publication would not compromise patent rights
does not change the status of fundamental research, so long as the
review causes no more than a temporary delay in publication of the
research results.
    (4) The initial transfer of information from an industry sponsor to
university researchers is subject to the EAR where the parties have
agreed that the sponsor may withhold from publication some or all of
the information so provided. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part,
Question D(2).)
    (5) University based research is not considered ``fundamental
research'' if the university or its researchers accept (at the request,
for example, of an industrial sponsor) other restrictions on
publication of scientific and technical information resulting from the
project or activity. Scientific and technical information resulting
from the research will nonetheless qualify as fundamental research once
all such restrictions have expired or have been removed. (See
Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question D(7) and D(9).)
    (6) The provisions of Sec. 734.11 of this part will apply if a
university or its researchers accept specific national security
controls (as defined in Sec. 732.11 of this part) on a research project
or activity sponsored by the U.S. Government. (See Supplement No. 1 to
this part, Questions E(1) and E(2).)
    (c) Research based at Federal agencies or FFRDCs. Research
conducted by scientists or engineers working for a Federal agency or a
Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) may be
designated as ``fundamental research'' within any appropriate system
devised by the agency or the FFRDC to control the release of
information by such scientists and engineers. (See Supplement No. 1 to
this part, Questions D(8) and D(11).)
    (d) Corporate research. (1) Research conducted by scientists or
engineers working for a business entity will be considered
``fundamental research'' at such time and to the extent that the
researchers are free to make scientific and technical information
resulting from the research publicly available without restriction or
delay based on proprietary concerns or specific national security
controls as defined in Sec. 734.11 of this part.
    (2) Prepublication review by the company solely to ensure that the
publication would compromise no proprietary information provided by the
company to the researchers is not considered to be a proprietary
restriction under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. However, paragraph
(d)(1) of this section does not authorize the release of information to
university researchers where the research results are subject to
prepublication review. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions
D(8), D(9), and D(10).)
    (3) Prepublication review by the company solely to ensure that
prepublication would compromise no patent rights will not be considered
a proprietary restriction for this purpose, so long as the review
causes no more

[[Page 12750]]
than a temporary delay in publication of the research results.
    (4) However, the initial transfer of information from a business
entity to researchers is not authorized under the ``fundamental
research'' provision where the parties have agreed that the business
entity may withhold from publication some or all of the information so
provided.
    (e) Research based elsewhere. Research conducted by scientists or
engineers who are not working for any of the institutions described in
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section will be treated as corporate
research, as described in paragraph (d) of this section. (See
Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question D(8).)

Sec. 734.9  Educational information.

    ``Educational information'' referred to in Sec. 734.3(b)(3)(iii) of
this part is not subject to the EAR if it is released by instruction in
catalog courses and associated teaching laboratories of academic
institutions. Dissertation research is discussed in Sec. 734.8(b) of
this part. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question C(1) through
C(6).)

Sec. 734.10  Patent applications.

    The information referred to in Sec. 734.3(b)(3)(iv) of this part
is:
    (a) Information contained in a patent application prepared wholly
from foreign-origin technical data where the application is being sent
to the foreign inventor to be executed and returned to the United
States for subsequent filing in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office;
    (b) Information contained in a patent application, or an amendment,
modification, supplement or division of an application, and authorized
for filing in a foreign country in accordance with the regulations of
the Patent and Trademark Office, 37 CFR part 5; <SUP>1 or

    \1\ Regulations issued by the Patent and Trademark Office in 37
CFR part 5 provide for the export to a foreign country of
unclassified technical data in the form of a patent application or
an amendment, modification, or supplement thereto or division
thereof.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Information contained in a patent application when sent to a
foreign country before or within six months after the filing of a
United States patent application for the purpose of obtaining the
signature of an inventor who was in the United States when the
invention was made or who is a co-inventor with a person residing in
the United States.

Sec. 734.11  Government-sponsored research covered by contract
controls.

    (a) If research is funded by the U.S. Government, and specific
national security controls are agreed on to protect information
resulting from the research, Sec. 734.3(b)(3) of this part will not
apply to any export or reexport of such information in violation of
such controls. However, any export or reexport of information resulting
from the research that is consistent with the specific controls may
nonetheless be made under this provision.
    (b) Examples of ``specific national security controls'' include
requirements for prepublication review by the Government, with right to
withhold permission for publication; restrictions on prepublication
dissemination of information to non-U.S. citizens or other categories
of persons; or restrictions on participation of non-U.S. citizens or
other categories of persons in the research. A general reference to one
or more export control laws or regulations or a general reminder that
the Government retains the right to classify is not a ``specific
national security control''. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part,
Questions E(1) and E(2).)

Sec. 734.12  Effect on foreign laws and regulations.

    Any person who complies with any of the license or other
requirements of the EAR is not relieved of the responsibility of
complying with applicable foreign laws and regulations. Conversely, any
person who complies with the license or other requirements of a foreign
law or regulation is not relieved of the responsibility of complying
with U.S. laws and regulations, including the EAR.

Supplement No. 1 to Part 734--Questions and Answers--Technology and
Software Subject to the EAR

    This Supplement No. 1 contains explanatory questions and answers
relating to technology and software that is subject to the EAR. It
is intended to give the public guidance in understanding how BXA
interprets this part, but is only illustrative, not comprehensive.
In addition, facts or circumstances that differ in any material way
from those set forth in the questions or answers will be considered
under the applicable provisions of the EAR. This Supplement is
divided into nine sections according to topic as follows:
    Section A: Publication of technology and exports and reexports
of technology that has been or will be published.
    Section B: Release of technology at conferences.
    Section C: Educational instruction.
    Section D: Research, correspondence, and informal scientific
exchanges.
    Section E: Federal contract controls.
    Section F: Commercial consulting.
    Section G: Software.
    Section H: Availability in a public library.
    Section I: Miscellaneous.

Section A: Publication

    Question A(1): I plan to publish in a foreign journal a
scientific paper describing the results of my research, which is in
an area listed in the EAR as requiring a license to all countries
except Canada. Do I need a license to send a copy to my publisher
abroad?
    Answer: No. This export transaction is not subject to the EAR.
The EAR do not cover technology that is already publicly available,
as well as technology that is made public by the transaction in
question (Secs. 734.3 and 734.7 of this part). Your research results
would be made public by the planned publication. You would not need
a license.
    Question A(2): Would the answer differ depending on where I work
or where I performed the research?
    Answer: No. Of course, the result would be different if your
employer or another sponsor of your research imposed restrictions on
its publication (Sec. 734.8 of this part).
    Question (A)3: Would I need a license to send the paper to the
editors of a foreign journal for review to determine whether it will
be accepted for publication?
    Answer: No. This export transaction is not subject to the EAR
because you are submitting the paper to the editors with the
intention that the paper will be published if favorably received
(Sec. 734.7(a)(4)(iii) of this part).
    Question A(4): The research on which I will be reporting in my
paper is supported by a grant from the Department of Energy (DOE).
The grant requires prepublication clearance by DOE. Does that make
any difference under the Export Administration Regulations?
    Answer: No, the transaction is not subject to the EAR. But if
you published in violation of any Department of Energy controls you
have accepted in the grant, you may be subject to appropriate
administrative, civil, or criminal sanctions under other laws.
    Question A(5): We provide consulting services on the design,
layout, and construction of integrated circuit plants and production
lines. A major part of our business is the publication for sale to
clients of detailed handbooks and reference manuals on key aspects
on the design and manufacturing processes. A typical cost of
publishing such a handbook and manual might be $500; the typical
sales price is about $15,000. Is the publication and sale of such
handbooks or manuals subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Yes. The price is above the cost of reproduction and
distribution (Sec. 734.7(a)(1) of this part). Thus, you would need
to obtain a license or qualify for a License Exception before you
could export or reexport any of these handbooks or manuals.
    Question A(6): My Ph.D. thesis is on technology, listed in the
EAR as requiring a license to all destinations except Canada, which
has never been published for general distribution. However, the
thesis is available at the institution from which I took the degree.
Do I need a license to send another copy to a colleague overseas?
    Answer: That may depend on where in the institution it is
available. If it is not readily available in the university library
(e.g., by filing in open stacks with a reference in the

[[Page 12751]]
catalog), it is not ``publicly available'' and the export or
reexport would be subject to the EAR on that ground. The export or
reexport would not be subject to the EAR if your Ph.D. research
qualified as ``fundamental research'' under Sec. 734.8 of this part.
If not, however, you will need to obtain a license or qualify for a
License Exception before you can send a copy out of the country.
    Question A(7): We sell electronically recorded information,
including software and databases, at wholesale and retail. Our
products are available by mail order to any member of the public,
though intended for specialists in various fields. They are priced
to maximize sales to persons in those fields. Do we need a license
to sell our products to foreign customers?
    Answer: You would not need a license for otherwise controlled
technology or software if the technology and software are made
publicly available at a price that does not exceed the cost of
production and distribution to the technical community. Even if
priced at a higher level, the export or reexport of the technology
or software source code in a library accessible to the public is not
subject to the EAR (Sec. 734.7(a) of this part).

Section B: Conferences

    Question B(1): I have been invited to give a paper at a
prestigious international scientific conference on a subject listed
as requiring a license under the EAR to all countries, except
Canada. Scientists in the field are given an opportunity to submit
applications to attend. Invitations are given to those judged to be
the leading researchers in the field, and attendance is by
invitation only. Attendees will be free to take notes, but not make
electronic or verbatim recordings of the presentations or
discussions. Some of the attendees will be foreigners. Do I need a
license to give my paper?
    Answer: No. Release of information at an open conference and
information that has been released at an open conference is not
subject to the EAR. The conference you describe fits the definition
of an open conference (Sec. 734.7(d) of this part).
    Question B(2): Would it make any difference if there were a
prohibition on making any notes or other personal record of what
transpires at the conference?
    Answer: Yes. To qualify as an ``open'' conference, attendees
must be permitted to take notes or otherwise make a personal record
(although not necessarily a recording). If note taking or the making
of personal records is altogether prohibited, the conference would
not be considered ``open''.
    Question B(3): Would it make any difference if there were also a
registration fee?
    Answer: That would depend on whether the fee is reasonably
related to costs and reflects an intention that all interested and
technically qualified persons should be able to attend
(Sec. 734.7(d)(4)(ii) of this part).
    Question B(4): Would it make any difference if the conference
were to take place in another country?
    Answer: No.
    Question B(5): Must I have a license to send the paper I propose
to present at such a foreign conference to the conference organizer
for review?
    Answer: No. A license is not required under the EAR to submit
papers to foreign organizers of open conferences or other open
gatherings with the intention that the papers will be delivered at
the conference, and so made publicly available, if favorably
received. The submission of the papers is not subject to the EAR
(Sec. 734.7(d)(4)(iii) of this part).
    Question B(6): Would the answers to any of the foregoing
questions be different if my work were supported by the Federal
Government?
    Answer: No. You may export and reexport the papers, even if the
release of the paper violates any agreements you have made with your
government sponsor. However, nothing in the EAR relieves you of
responsibility for conforming to any controls you have agreed to in
your Federal grant or contract.

Section C: Educational Instruction

    Question C(1): I teach a university graduate course on design
and manufacture of very high-speed integrated circuitry. Many of the
students are foreigners. Do I need a license to teach this course?
    Answer: No. Release of information by instruction in catalog
courses and associated teaching laboratories of academic
institutions is not subject to the EAR (Sec. 734.9 of this part).
    Question C(2): Would it make any difference if some of the
students were from countries to which export licenses are required?
    Answer: No.
    Question C(3): Would it make any difference if I talk about
recent and as yet unpublished results from my laboratory research?
    Answer: No.
    Question C(4): Even if that research is funded by the
Government?
    Answer: Even then, but you would not be released from any
separate obligations you have accepted in your grant or contract.
    Question C(5): Would it make any difference if I were teaching
at a foreign university?
    Answer: No.
    Question C(6): We teach proprietary courses on design and
manufacture of high-performance machine tools. Is the instruction in
our classes subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Yes. That instruction would not qualify as ``release of
educational information'' under Sec. 734.9 of this part because your
proprietary business does not qualify as an ``academic institution''
within the meaning of Sec. 734.9 of this part. Conceivably, however,
the instruction might qualify as ``release at an open * * * seminar,
* * * or other open gathering'' under Sec. 734.7(d) of this part.
The conditions for qualification of such a seminar or gathering as
``open'', including a fee ``reasonably related to costs (of the
conference, not of producing the data) and reflecting an intention
that all interested and technically qualified persons be able to
attend,'' would have to be satisfied.

Section D: Research, Correspondence, and Informal Scientific
Exchanges

    Question D(1): Do I need a license in order for a foreign
graduate student to work in my laboratory?
    Answer: Not if the research on which the foreign student is
working qualifies as ``fundamental research'' under Sec. 734.8 of
this part. In that case, the research is not subject to the EAR.
    Question D(2): Our company has entered into a cooperative
research arrangement with a research group at a university. One of
the researchers in that group is a PRC national. We would like to
share some of our proprietary information with the university
research group. We have no way of guaranteeing that this information
will not get into the hands of the PRC scientist. Do we need to
obtain a license to protect against that possibility?
    Answer: No. The EAR do not cover the disclosure of information
to any scientists, engineers, or students at a U.S. university in
the course of industry-university research collaboration under
specific arrangements between the firm and the university, provided
these arrangements do not permit the sponsor to withhold from
publication any of the information that he provides to the
researchers. However, if your company and the researchers have
agreed to a prohibition on publication, then you must obtain a
license or qualify for a License Exception before transferring the
information to the university. It is important that you as the
corporate sponsor and the university get together to discuss whether
foreign nationals will have access to the information, so that you
may obtain any necessary authorization prior to transferring the
information to the research team.
    Question D(3): My university will host a prominent scientist
from the PRC who is an expert on research in engineered ceramics and
composite materials. Do I require a license before telling our
visitor about my latest, as yet unpublished, research results in
those fields?
    Answer: Probably not. If you performed your research at the
university, and you were subject to no contract controls on release
of the research, your research would qualify as ``fundamental
research'' (Sec. 734.8(a) of this part). Information arising during
or resulting from such research is not subject to the EAR
(Sec. 734.3(b)(3) of this part).
    You should probably assume, however, that your visitor will be
debriefed later about anything of potential military value he learns
from you. If you are concerned that giving such information to him,
even though permitted, could jeopardize U.S. security interests, the
Commerce Department can put you in touch with appropriate Government
scientists who can advise you. Write to Department of Commerce,
Bureau of Export Administration, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.
    Question D(4): Would it make any difference if I were proposing
to talk with a PRC expert in China?
    Answer: No, if the information in question arose during or
resulted from the same ``fundamental research.''

[[Page 12752]]

    Question D(5): Could I properly do some work with him in his
research laboratory inside China?
    Answer: Application abroad of personal knowledge or technical
experience acquired in the United States constitutes an export of
that knowledge and experience, and such an export may be subject to
the EAR. If any of the knowledge or experience you export in this
way requires a license under the EAR, you must obtain such a license
or qualify for a License Exception.
    Question D(6): I would like to correspond and share research
results with an Iranian expert in my field, which deals with
technology that requires a license to all destinations except
Canada. Do I need a license to do so?
    Answer: Not as long as we are still talking about information
that arose during or resulted from research that qualifies as
``fundamental'' under the rules spelled out in Sec. 734.8(a) of this
part.
    Question D(7): Suppose the research in question were funded by a
corporate sponsor and I had agreed to prepublication review of any
paper arising from the research?
    Answer: Whether your research would still qualify as
``fundamental'' would depend on the nature and purpose of the
prepublication review. If the review is intended solely to ensure
that your publications will neither compromise patent rights nor
inadvertently divulge proprietary information that the sponsor has
furnished to you, the research could still qualify as
``fundamental.'' But if the sponsor will consider as part of its
prepublication review whether it wants to hold your new research
results as trade secrets or otherwise proprietary information (even
if your voluntary cooperation would be needed for it to do so), your
research would no longer qualify as ``fundamental.'' As used in
these regulations it is the actual and intended openness of research
results that primarily determines whether the research counts as
``fundamental'' and so is not subject to the EAR.
    Question D(8): In determining whether research is thus open and
therefore counts as ``fundamental,'' does it matter where or in what
sort of institution the research is performed?
    Answer: In principle, no. ``Fundamental research'' is performed
in industry, Federal laboratories, or other types of institutions,
as well as in universities. The regulations introduce some
operational presumptions and procedures that can be used both by
those subject to the regulations and by those who administer them to
determine with some precision whether a particular research activity
is covered. Recognizing that common and predictable norms operate in
different types of institutions, the regulations use the
institutional locus of the research as a starting point for these
presumptions and procedures. Nonetheless, it remains the type of
research, and particularly the intent and freedom to publish, that
identifies ``fundamental research,'' not the institutional locus
(Sec. 734.8(a) of this part).
    Question D(9): I am doing research on high-powered lasers in the
central basic-research laboratory of an industrial corporation. I am
required to submit the results of my research for prepublication
review before I can publish them or otherwise make them public. I
would like to compare research results with a scientific colleague
from Vietnam and discuss the results of the research with her when
she visits the United States. Do I need a license to do so?
    Answer: You probably do need a license (Sec. 734.8(d) of this
part). However, if the only restriction on your publishing any of
that information is a prepublication review solely to ensure that
publication would compromise no patent rights or proprietary
information provided by the company to the researcher your research
may be considered ``fundamental research,'' in which case you may be
able to share information because it is not subject to the EAR. Note
that the information will be subject to the EAR if the
prepublication review is intended to withhold the results of the
research from publication.
    Question D(10): Suppose I have already cleared my company's
review process and am free to publish all the information I intend
to share with my colleague, though I have not yet published?
    Answer: If the clearance from your company means that you are
free to make all the information publicly available without
restriction or delay, the information is not subject to the EAR.
(Sec. 734.8(d) of this part)
    Question D(11): I work as a researcher at a Government-owned,
contractor-operated research center. May I share the results of my
unpublished research with foreign nationals without concern for
export controls under the EAR?
    Answer: That is up to the sponsoring agency and the center's
management. If your research is designated ``fundamental research''
within any appropriate system devised by them to control release of
information by scientists and engineers at the center, it will be
treated as such by the Commerce Department, and the research will
not be subject to the EAR. Otherwise, you would need to obtain a
license or qualify for a License Exception, except to publish or
otherwise make the information public (Sec. 734.8(c) of this part).

Section E: Federal Contract Controls

    Question E(1): In a contract for performance of research entered
into with the Department of Defense (DOD), we have agreed to certain
national security controls. DOD is to have ninety days to review any
papers we proposed before they are published and must approve
assignment of any foreign nationals to the project. The work in
question would otherwise qualify as ``fundamental research'' section
under Sec. 734.8 of this part. Is the information arising during or
resulting from this sponsored research subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Under Sec. 734.11 of this part, any export or reexport
of information resulting from government-sponsored research that is
inconsistent with contract controls you have agreed to will not
qualify as ``fundamental research'' and any such export or reexport
would be subject to the EAR. Any such export or reexport that is
consistent with the controls will continue to be eligible for export
and reexport under the ``fundamental research'' rule set forth in
Sec. 734.8(a) of this part. Thus, if you abide by the specific
controls you have agreed to, you need not be concerned about
violating the EAR. If you violate those controls and export or
reexport information as ``fundamental research'' under Sec. 734.8(a)
of this part, you may subject yourself to the sanctions provided for
under the EAR, including criminal sanctions, in addition to
administrative and civil penalties for breach of contract under
other law.
    Question E(2): Do the Export Administration Regulations restrict
my ability to publish the results of my research?
    Answer: The Export Administration Regulations are not the means
for enforcing the national security controls you have agreed to. If
such a publication violates the contract, you would be subject to
administrative, civil, and possible criminal penalties under other
law.

Section F: Commercial Consulting

    Question F(1): I am a professor at a U.S. university, with
expertise in design and creation of submicron devices. I have been
asked to be a consultant for a ``third-world'' company that wishes
to manufacture such devices. Do I need a license to do so?
    Answer: Quite possibly you do. Application abroad of personal
knowledge or technical experience acquired in the United States
constitutes an export of that knowledge and experience that is
subject to the Export Administration Regulations. If any part of the
knowledge or experience your export or reexport deals with
technology that requires a license under the EAR, you will need to
obtain a license or qualify for a License Exception.

Section G: Software <SUP>2

    \2\ Exporters should note that these provisions do not apply to
software controlled under the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (e.g., certain encryption software).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Question G(1): Is the export or reexport of software in machine
readable code subject to the EAR when the source code for such
software is publicly available?
    Answer: If the source code of a software program is publicly
available, then the machine readable code compiled from the source
code is software that is publicly available and therefore not
subject to the EAR.
    Question G(2): Is the export or reexport of software sold at a
price that does not exceed the cost of reproduction and distribution
subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Software in machine readable code is publicly available
if it is available to a community at a price that does not exceed
the cost of reproduction and distribution. Such reproduction and
distribution costs may include variable and fixed allocations of
overhead and normal profit for the reproduction and distribution
functions either in your company or in a third party distribution
system. In your company, such costs may not include recovery for
development, design, or acquisition. In this case, the provider of
the software does not receive a fee for the inherent value of the
software.

[[Page 12753]]

    Question G(3): Is the export or reexport of software subject to
the EAR if it is sold at a price BXA concludes in a classification
letter to be sufficiently low so as not to subject it to the EAR?
    Answer: In response to classification requests, BXA may choose
to classify certain software as not subject to the EAR even though
it is sold at a price above the costs of reproduction and
distribution as long as the price is nonetheless sufficiently low to
qualify for such a classification in the judgment of BXA.

Section H: Available in a Public Library

    Question H(1): Is the export or reexport of information subject
to the EAR if it is available in a library and sold through an
electronic or print service?
    Answer: Electronic and print services for the distribution of
information may be relatively expensive in the marketplace because
of the value vendors add in retrieving and organizing information in
a useful way. If such information is also available in a library--
itself accessible to the public--or has been published in any way,
that information is ``publicly available'' for those reasons, and
the information itself continues not to be subject to the EAR even
though you access the information through an electronic or print
service for which you or your employer pay a substantial fee.
    Question H(2): Is the export or reexport of information subject
to the EAR if the information is available in an electronic form in
a library at no charge to the library patron?
    Answer: Information available in an electronic form at no charge
to the library patron in a library accessible to the public is
information publicly available even though the library pays a
substantial subscription fee for the electronic retrieval service.
    Question H(3): Is the export or reexport of information subject
to the EAR if the information is available in a library and sold for
more than the cost of reproduction and distribution?
    Answer: Information from books, magazines, dissertations,
papers, electronic data bases, and other information available in a
library that is accessible to the public is not subject to the EAR.
This is true even if you purchase such a book at more than the cost
of reproduction and distribution. In other words, such information
is ``publicly available'' even though the author makes a profit on
your particular purchase for the inherent value of the information.

Section I: Miscellaneous

    Question I(1): The manufacturing plant that I work at is
planning to begin admitting groups of the general public to tour the
plant facilities. We are concerned that a license might be required
if the tour groups include foreign nationals. Would such a tour
constitute an export? If so, is the export subject to the EAR?
    Answer: The EAR define exports and reexports of technology to
include release through visual inspection by foreign nationals of
U.S.-origin equipment and facilities. Such an export or reexport
qualifies under the ``publicly available'' provision and would not
be subject to the EAR so long as the tour is truly open to all
members of the public, including your competitors, and you do not
charge a fee that is not reasonably related to the cost of
conducting the tours. Otherwise, you will have to obtain a license,
or qualify for a License Exception, prior to permitting foreign
nationals to tour your facilities (Sec. 734.7 of this part).
    Question I(2): Is the export or reexport of information subject
to the EAR if the information is not in a library or published, but
sold at a price that does not exceed the cost of reproduction and
distribution?
    Answer: Information that is not in a library accessible to the
public and that has not been published in any way, may nonetheless
become ``publicly available'' if you make it both available to a
community of persons and if you sell it at no more than the cost of
reproduction and distribution. Such reproduction and distribution
costs may include variable and fixed cost allocations of overhead
and normal profit for the reproduction and distribution functions
either in your company or in a third party distribution system. In
your company, such costs may not include recovery for development,
design, or acquisition costs of the technology or software. The
reason for this conclusion is that the provider of the information
receives nothing for the inherent value of the information.
    Question I(3): Is the export or reexport of information
contributed to an electronic bulletin board subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Assume each of the following:
    1. Information is uploaded to an electronic bulletin board by a
person that is the owner or originator of the information;
    2. That person does not charge a fee to the bulletin board
administrator or the subscribers of the bulletin board; and
    3. The bulletin board is available for subscription to any
subscriber in a given community regardless of the cost of
subscription.
    Such information is ``publicly available'' and therefore not
subject to the EAR even if it is not elsewhere published and is not
in a library. The reason for this conclusion is that the bulletin
board subscription charges or line charges are for distribution
exclusively, and the provider of the information receives nothing
for the inherent value of the information.
    Question I(4): Is the export or reexport of patented information
fully disclosed on the public record subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Information to the extent it is disclosed on the patent
record open to the public is not subject to the EAR even though you
may use such information only after paying a fee in excess of the
costs of reproduction and distribution. In this case the seller does
receive a fee for the inherent value of the technical data; however,
the export or reexport of the information is nonetheless not subject
to the EAR because any person can obtain the technology from the
public record and further disclose or publish the information. For
that reason, it is impossible to impose export controls that deny
access to the information.

Supplement No. 2 to Part 734--Calculation of Values for De Minimis
Rules

    (a) Use the following guidelines in determining values for
establishing exemptions or for submission of a request for
authorization:
    (1) U.S. content value.
    (i) U.S. content value is the delivered cost to the foreign
manufacturer of the U.S. origin parts, components, or materials.
(When affiliated firms have special arrangements that result in
lower than normal pricing, the cost should reflect ``fair market''
prices that would normally be charged to similar, unaffiliated
customers.)
    (ii) In calculating the U.S. content value, do not include
parts, components, or materials that, according to the CCL (part 774
of the EAR) and the Country Chart (part 738 of the EAR), could be
exported from the United States to the new country of destination
without a license (designated as ``NLR'') or under License Exception
GBS (see part 740 of the EAR).
    (2) The foreign-made product value is the normal selling price
f.o.b. factory (excluding value added taxes or excise taxes).
    (3) To determine the value of the U.S.-origin controlled
content, you should classify the U.S.-origin content on the Commerce
Control List, determine those items that would require a license
from BXA for reexport to the ultimate destination of the foreign-
made product if such parts, components, or materials were reexported
to that destination in the form received, and divide the total value
of the controlled U.S. parts, components, and materials incorporated
into the foreign-made item by the sale price of the foreign-made
item.
    (4) If no U.S. parts, components or materials are incorporated
or if the incorporated U.S. parts, components, and materials are
below the de minimis level, then the foreign-made item is not
subject to the EAR by reason of Sec. 734.4 of this part, the
classification of a foreign-made item is irrelevant in determining
the scope of the EAR, and you should skip Step 4 in Sec. 732.2(d)
and go on to consider Step 6 in Sec. 732.2(f) of the EAR regarding
the foreign-produced direct product rule.
    (b) One-time report prior to reliance upon the de minimis
exclusion.
    (1) Report requirement. Before you may rely upon the de minimis
exclusion for foreign software and technology commingled with U.S.
software or technology, you must file a one-time report for the
foreign software or technology. The report must include the
percentage of U.S.-content by value and a description of your
calculations including relevant values, assumptions, and the basis
or methodologies for making the percentage calculation. The three
criteria important to BXA in its review of your report will be the
export price of the U.S.-content, the assumption regarding future
sales of software, and the choice of the scope of foreign
technology. Your methodologies must be based upon the accounting
standards used in the operation of your business, and you must
specify that standard in your report. Regardless of the accounting
systems,

[[Page 12754]]
standard, or conventions you use in the operation of your business,
you may not depreciate the fair market values reported or otherwise
reduce the fair market values by other accounting conventions such
as depreciation. You may rely upon the de minimis exclusion from the
commingled rule only to the extent you have reported the relevant
calculations, values, assumptions, and the basis or methodologies
for the calculations. These values may be historic or projected. You
may rely on projected values only to the extent that and for so long
as they remain consistent with your report or future values reduce
the U.S.-content under your reported assumptions, basis, and
methodologies. You are not required to file the above report if you
do not choose to take advantage of the de minimis exclusion from the
commingled rule.
    (2) Export price. The report must include a description of the
U.S.-content including its classification on the Commerce Control
List, its performance characteristics and features, and the method
of calculating its fair market value. The fair market value shall be
the arms-length transaction price, if it is available. If an arms-
length transaction price is unavailable, then the report will
describe the valuation method chosen to calculate or derive the fair
market value. Such methods may include comparable market prices or
costs of production and distribution. This rule does not require
calculations based upon any one accounting system or U.S. accounting
standards. However, you must specify the accepted accounting
standards you have chosen, and cost-based methods of valuation must
be based upon records you maintain in the normal course of business.
You should also indicate whether reported values are actual arms-
length market prices or derived from comparable transactions or
costs of production, overhead, and profit. For example, if you chose
to make calculations under the transfer pricing rules of the United
States Internal Revenue Code at section 482, your report should
indicate that this is the source for your methodology, and you
should also indicate which of the several methodologies in these
transfer pricing rules you have chosen.
    (3) Future software sales. For calculations of U.S.-content in
foreign software, you shall include your estimate of future software
sales in units and value along with the rationale and basis for
those estimates in the report.
    (4) Foreign technology and software. For calculations of U.S.-
content in foreign technology and software, you shall include in the
report a description of the foreign technology or software and a
description of its fair market value along with the rationale and
basis for the selection and valuation of such foreign software or
technology. The report does not require information regarding
destinations and end users for reexport. The purpose of the report
is solely to permit the U.S. Government to evaluate the
reasonableness of U.S.-content calculations.
    (5) Report and wait. If you have not been contacted by BXA
concerning your report within thirty days after filing the report
with BXA, you may rely upon the calculations in your report and the
de minimis exclusions for software and technology for so long as you
are not contacted by BXA. BXA may contact you concerning your report
to inquire of you further or to indicate that BXA does not accept
the assumptions or rationale for your calculations. If you receive
such a contact or communication from BXA, you may not rely upon the
de minimis exclusions for software and technology in Sec. 734.4 of
this part until BXA has indicated whether or not you may do so in
the future. You must include in your report the name, title,
address, telephone number, and facsimile number of the person BXA
may contact concerning your report.

PART 736--GENERAL PROHIBITIONS

Sec.
736.1  Introduction.
736.2  General prohibitions and determination of applicability.

Supplement No. 1--General Orders

Supplement No. 2--Administrative Orders

    Authority: 50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.;
E.O. 12924, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 917; E.O. 12938, 3 CFR, 1994
Comp., p. 950; Notice of August 15, 1995 (60 FR 42767, August 17,
1995).

Sec. 736.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR
chapter VII, subchapter C. A person may undertake transactions subject
to the EAR without a license or other authorization, unless the
regulations affirmatively state such a requirement. As such, if an
export, reexport, or activity is subject to the EAR, the general
prohibitions contained in this part and the License Exceptions
specified in part 740 of the EAR must be reviewed to determine if a
license is necessary. In the case of all exports from the United
States, you must document your export as described in part 762 of the
EAR regarding recordkeeping and clear your export through the U.S.
Customs Service as described in part 758 of the EAR regarding export
clearance requirements. Also note that for short supply controls all
prohibitions and License Exceptions are in part 754 of the EAR.
    (a) In this part we tell you:
    (1) The facts that make your proposed export, reexport, or conduct
subject to these general prohibitions, and
    (2) The ten general prohibitions.
    (b) Your obligations under the ten general prohibitions and under
the EAR depend in large part upon the five types of information
described in Sec. 736.2(a) of this part and upon the general
prohibitions described in Sec. 736.2(b) of this part. The ten general
prohibitions contain cross-references to other parts of the EAR that
further define the breadth of the general prohibitions. For that
reason, this part is not freestanding. In part 732, we provide certain
steps you may follow in proper order to help you understand the general
prohibitions and their relationship to other parts of the EAR.
    (c) If you violate any of these ten general prohibitions, or engage
in other conduct contrary to the Export Administration Act, the EAR, or
any order, license, License Exception, or authorization issued
thereunder, as described in part 764 of the EAR regarding enforcement,
you will be subject to the sanctions described in that part.

Sec. 736.2  General prohibitions and determination of applicability.

    (a) Information or facts that determine the applicability of the
general prohibitions. The following five types of facts determine your
obligations under the ten general prohibitions and the EAR generally:
    (1) Classification of the item. The classification of the item on
the Commerce Control List (see part 774 of the EAR);
    (2) Destination. The country of ultimate destination for an export
or reexport (see parts 738 and 774 of the EAR concerning the Country
Chart and the Commerce Control List);
    (3) End-user. The ultimate end-user (see General Prohibition Four
(paragraph (b)(4) of this section) and parts 744 and 764 of the EAR for
a reference to the list of persons you may not deal with);
    (4) End-use. The ultimate end-use (see General Prohibition Five
(paragraph (b)(5) of this section) and part 744 of the EAR for general
end-use restrictions); and
    (5) Conduct. Conduct such as contracting, financing, and freight
forwarding in support of a proliferation project as described in part
744 of the EAR.
    (b) General prohibitions. The following ten general prohibitions
describe certain exports, reexports, and other conduct, subject to the
scope of the EAR, in which you may not engage unless you either have a
license from the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) or qualify under
part 740 of the EAR for a License Exception from each applicable
general prohibition in this paragraph. The License Exceptions at part
740 of the EAR apply only to General Prohibitions One (Exports and
Reexports in the Form Received), Two (Parts and Components Reexports),
and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports); however,
selected License Exceptions are specifically referenced and authorized
in part 746 of the EAR concerning embargo destinations and in
Sec. 744.2(c) of the EAR regarding nuclear end-uses.

[[Page 12755]]

    (1) General Prohibition One--Export and reexport of controlled
items to listed countries (Exports and Reexports). You may not, without
a license or License Exception, export any item subject to the EAR to
another country or reexport any item of U.S.-origin if each of the
following is true:
    (i) The item is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable
Export Control Classification Number (ECCN), and
    (ii) Export to the country of destination requires a license for
the control reason as indicated on the Country Chart at part 738 of the
EAR. (The scope of this prohibition is determined by the correct
classification of your item and the ultimate destination as that
combination is reflected on the Country Chart.) <SUP>1 Note that each
License Exception described at part 740 of the EAR supersedes General
Prohibition One if all terms and conditions of a given License
Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.

    \1\ See part 738 of the EAR for selected controls that are not
specified on the Country Chart.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) General Prohibition Two--Reexport and export from abroad of
foreign-made items incorporating more than a de minimis amount of
controlled U.S. content (Parts and Components Reexports).
    (i) You may not, without a license or License Exception, export,
reexport or export from abroad any foreign-made commodity, software, or
technology incorporating U.S.-origin commodities, software, or
technology respectively that is controlled to the country of ultimate
destination if the foreign-made item meets all three of the following
conditions:
    (A) It incorporates more than the de minimis amount of controlled
U.S. content, as defined in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR concerning the scope
of the EAR;
    (B) It is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable ECCN;
and
    (C) Its export to the country of destination requires a license for
that control reason as indicated on the Country Chart. (The scope of
this prohibition is determined by the correct classification of your
foreign-made item and the ultimate destination, as that combination is
reflected on the Country Chart.)
    (ii) Each License Exception described at part 740 of the EAR
supersedes General Prohibition One if all terms and conditions of a
given License Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.
    (3) General Prohibition Three--Reexport and export from abroad of
the foreign-produced direct product of U.S. technology and software
(Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports).
    (i) Country scope of prohibition. You may not export, reexport, or
export from abroad items subject to the scope of this General
Prohibition Three to Cuba, North Korea, Libya, or a destination in
Country Group D:1 (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (ii) Product scope of foreign-made items subject to prohibition.
This General Prohibition 3 applies if an item meets either the
Conditions defining the direct product of technology or the Conditions
defining the direct product of a plant in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of
this section:
    (A) Conditions defining direct product of technology. Foreign-made
items are subject to this General Prohibition 3 if they meet both of
the following conditions:
    (1) They are the direct product of technology or software that
requires a written assurance as a supporting document for a license or
as a precondition for the use of License Exception TSR at Sec. 740.3(d)
of the EAR, and
    (2) They are subject to national security controls as designated on
the applicable ECCN of the Commerce Control List at part 774 of the
EAR.
    (B) Conditions defining direct product of a plant. Foreign-made
items are also subject to this General Prohibition 3 if they are the
direct product of a complete plant or any major component of a plant if
both of the following conditions are met:
    (1) Such plant or component is the direct product of technology
that requires a written assurance as a supporting document for a
license or as a precondition for the use of License Exception TSR at
Sec. 740.3(d) of the EAR, and
    (2) Such foreign-made direct products of the plant or component are
subject to national security controls as designated on the applicable
ECCN of the Commerce Control List at part 774 of the EAR.
    (iii) License Exceptions. Each License Exception described at part
740 of the EAR supersedes this General Prohibition Three if all terms
and conditions of a given exception are met by the exporter or
reexporter.
    (4) General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders)--Engaging in actions
prohibited by a denial order. (i) You may not take any action that is
prohibited by a denial order issued under part 766 of the EAR,
Administrative Enforcement Proceedings. These orders prohibit many
actions in addition to direct exports by the person denied export
privileges, including some transfers within a single country either in
the United States or abroad by other persons. You are responsible for
ensuring that any of your transactions in which a person who is denied
export privileges is involved do not violate the terms of the order.
The names of persons denied export privileges are published in the
Federal Register and are also included on the Denied Persons List,
which is referenced in Supplement No. 2 to part 764 of the EAR,
Enforcement. The terms of the standard denial order are set forth in
Supplement No. 1 to part 764. You should note that some denial orders
differ from the standard denial order. BXA may, on an exceptional
basis, authorize activity otherwise prohibited by a denial order. See
Sec. 764.3(a)(3) of the EAR.
    (ii) There are no License Exceptions described in part 740 of the
EAR that authorize conduct prohibited by this General Prohibition Four.
    (5) General Prohibition Five--Export or reexport to prohibited end-
uses or end-users (End-Use End-User). You may not, without a license,
knowingly export or reexport any item subject to the EAR to an end-user
of end-use that is prohibited by part 744 of the EAR.
    (6) General Prohibition Six--Export or reexport to embargoed
destinations (Embargo). (i) You may not, without a license or License
Exception authorized under part 746, export or reexport any item
subject to the EAR to a country that is embargoed by the United States
or otherwise made subject to controls as both are described at part 746
of the EAR.
    (ii) License Exceptions to this General Prohibition Six are
described at part 746 of the EAR on Embargoes and Other Special
Controls; and unless a License Exception is authorized in part 746 of
the EAR, the License Exceptions at part 740 of the EAR are not
available to overcome this general prohibition.
    (7) General Prohibition Seven--Support of Proliferation Activities
(U.S. Person Proliferation Activity). If you are a U.S. Person as that
term is defined at Sec. 744.6(c) of the EAR, you may not engage in any
activities prohibited by Sec. 744.6 (a) or (b) of the EAR which
prohibits the performance, without a license from BXA, of certain
financing, contracting, service, support, transportation, freight
forwarding, or employment that you know will assist in certain
proliferation activities described further at part 744 of the EAR.
There are no License Exceptions to this General Prohibition Seven in
part 740 of the EAR unless specifically authorized in that part.
    (8) General Prohibition Eight--In transit shipments and items to be

[[Page 12756]]
unladen from vessels or aircraft (Intransit). (i) Unlading and shipping
in transit. You may not export an item through or transit through a
country listed in (b)(8)(ii) of this section unless a License Exception
or license authorizes such an export directly to such a country of
transit.
    (ii) Country scope. This General Prohibition Eight applies to
Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cuba,
Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Latvia, Lithuania,
Mongolia, North Korea, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine,
Uzbkeistan, Vietnam.
    (9) General Prohibition Nine--Violation of any order, terms, and
conditions (Orders, Terms, and Conditions). You may not violate terms
or conditions of a license or of a License Exception issued under or
made a part of the EAR, and you may not violate any order issued under
or made a part of the EAR. There are no License Exceptions to this
General Prohibition Nine in part 740 of the EAR. Supplements Nos. 1 and
2 to this part provide for certain General Orders and Administrative
Orders.
    (10) General Prohibition Ten--Proceeding with transactions with
knowledge that a violation has occurred or is about to occur (Knowledge
Violation to Occur). You may not sell, transfer, export, reexport,
finance, order, buy, remove, conceal, store, use, loan, dispose of,
transfer, transport, forward, or otherwise service, in whole or in
part, any item subject to the EAR and exported or to be exported with
knowledge that a violation of the Export Administration Regulations,
the Export Administration Act or any order, license, License Exception,
or other authorization issued thereunder has occurred, is about to
occur, or is intended to occur in connection with the item. Nor may you
rely upon any license or License Exception after notice to you of the
suspension or revocation of that license or exception. There are no
License Exceptions to this General Prohibition Ten in part 740 of the
EAR.

Supplement No. 1 to Part 736--General Orders

[Reserved]

August 15, 1995 (60 FR 42767, August 17, 1995).

Sec. 738.1  Introduction.

    (a) Commerce Control List scope. (1) In this part, references to
the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The Bureau
of Export Administration (BXA) maintains the Commerce Control List
(CCL) within the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which
includes items (i.e., commodities, software, and technology) subject to
the export licensing authority of BXA. The CCL does not include those
items exclusively controlled for export or reexport by another
department or agency of the U.S. Government. In instances where
agencies other than the Department of Commerce administer

[[Page 12757]]

controls over related items, entries in the CCL contain a reference to
these controls.
    (2) The CCL is contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the
EAR. Supplement No. 2 to part 774 of the EAR contains the General
Technology and Software Notes relevant to entries contained in the CCL.
    (b) Commerce Country Chart scope. BXA also maintains the Commerce
Country Chart. The Commerce Country Chart, located in Supplement No. 1
to part 738, contains licensing requirements based on destination and
Reason for Control. In combination with the CCL, the Commerce Country
Chart allows you to determine whether a license is required for items
on the CCL to any country in the world.

Sec. 738.2  Commerce Control List (CCL) structure.

    (a) Categories. The CCL is divided into 10 categories, numbered as
follows:

0--Nuclear Materials, Facilities and Equipment and Miscellaneous
1--Materials, Chemicals, ``Microorganisms,'' and Toxins
2--Materials Processing
3--Electronics
4--Computers
5--Telecommunications and Information Security
6--Lasers and Sensors
7--Navigation and Avionics
8--Marine
9--Propulsion Systems, Space Vehicles and Related Equipment

    (b) Groups. Within each category, items are arranged by group. Each
category contains the same five groups. Each Group is identified by the
letters A through E, as follows:

A--Equipment, Assemblies and Components
B--Test, Inspection and Production Equipment
C--Materials
D--Software
E--Technology

    (c) Order of review. In order to classify your item against the
CCL, you should begin with a review of the general characteristics of
your item. This will usually guide you to the appropriate category on
the CCL. Once the appropriate category is identified, you should match
the particular characteristics and functions of your item to a specific
ECCN. If the ECCN contains a list under the ``Items'' heading, you
should review the list to determine within which subparagraph(s) your
items are identified.
    (d) Entries. (1) Composition of an entry. Within each group,
individual items are identified by an Export Control Classification
Number (ECCN). Each number consists of a set of digits and a letter.
The first digit identifies the general category within which the entry
falls (e.g., 3A001). The letter immediately following this first digit
identifies under which of the five groups the item is listed (e.g.,
3A001). The second digit differentiates individual entries by
identifying the type of controls associated with the items contained in
the entry (e.g., 3A001). Listed below are the Reasons for Control
associated with this second digit.

0: National Security reasons (including Dual Use and International
Munitions List) and Items on the NSG Dual Use Annex and Trigger List
1: Missile Technology reasons
2: Nuclear Nonproliferation reasons
3: Chemical & Biological Weapons reasons
9: Anti-terrorism, Crime Control, Regional Stability, Short Supply, UN
Sanctions, etc.

    (i) Since Reasons for Control are not mutually exclusive, numbers
are assigned in order of precedence. As an example, if an item is
controlled for both National Security and Missile Technology reasons,
the entry's third digit will be a ``0''. If the item is controlled only
for Missile Technology the third digit will be ``1''.
    (ii) The numbers in either the second or third digit (e.g., 3A001)
serve to differentiate between multilateral and unilateral entries. An
entry with the number ``9'' as the second digit, identifies the entire
entry as controlled for a unilateral concern (e.g., 2B991 for anti-
terrorism reasons). If the number ``9'' appears as the third digit, the
item is controlled for unilateral purposes based on a proliferation
concern (e.g., 2A292 is controlled for unilateral purposes based on
nuclear nonproliferation concerns).
    (2) Reading an ECCN. A brief description is provided next to each
ECCN. Following this description is the actual entry containing
``License Requirements,'' ``License Exceptions,'' and ``List of Items
Controlled'' sections. A brief description of each section and its use
follows:
    (i) License Requirements. This section contains a separate line
identifying all possible Reasons for Control in order of precedence,
and two columns entitled ``Control(s)'' and ``Country Chart''.
    (A) The ``Controls'' header identifies all applicable Reasons for
Control, in order of restrictiveness, and to what extent each applies
(e.g., to the entire entry or only to certain subparagraphs). Those
requiring licenses for a larger number of countries and/or items are
listed first. As you read down the list the number of countries and/or
items requiring a license declines. Since Reasons for Control are not
mutually exclusive, items controlled within a particular ECCN may be
controlled for more than one reason. The following is a list of all
possible Reasons for Control:

AT  Anti-Terrorism
CB  Chemical & Biological Weapons
CC  Crime Control
MT  Missile Technology
NS  National Security
NP  Nuclear Nonproliferation
RS  Regional Stability
SS  Short Supply
XP  Computers

    (B) The ``Country Chart'' header identifies, for each applicable
Reason for Control, a column name and number (e.g., CB Column 1). These
column identifiers are used to direct you from the CCL to the
appropriate column identifying the countries requiring a license.
Consult part 742 of the EAR for an indepth discussion of the licensing
requirements and policies applicable to each Country Chart column.
    (ii) License Exceptions. This section provides a brief eligibility
statement for each ECCN-driven License Exception that may be applicable
to your transaction, and should be consulted only AFTER you have
determined a license is required based on an analysis of the entry and
the Country Chart. The brief eligibility statement in this section is
provided to assist you in deciding which ECCN-driven License Exception
related to your particular item and destination you should explore
prior to submitting an application. The word ``Yes'' (followed in some
instances by the scope of Yes) appears next to each available ECCN-
driven License Exception. ``N/A'' will be noted for License Exceptions
that are not available within a particular entry. If one or more
License Exceptions appear to apply to your transaction, you must
consult part 740 of the EAR to review the conditions and restrictions
applicable to each available License Exception.
    (iii) List of Items Controlled. (A) Units. The unit of measure
applicable to each entry is identified in the ``Units'' header. Most
measurements used in the CCL are expressed in metric units with an
inch-pound conversion where appropriate. Note that in some ECCNs the
inch-pound unit will be listed first. In instances where other units
are in general usage or specified by law, these will be used instead of
metric. Generally, when there is a difference

[[Page 12758]]
between the metric and inch-pound figures, the metric standard will be
used for classification and licensing purposes.
    (B) Related definitions. This header identifies, where appropriate,
definitions or parameters that apply to all items controlled by the
entry. The information provided in this section is unique to the entry,
and hence not listed in the definitions contained in part 772 of the
EAR.
    (C) Related controls. If another U.S. government agency or
department has export licensing authority over items related to those
controlled by an entry, a statement is included identifying the agency
or department along with the applicable regulatory cite. An additional
cross-reference may be included in instances where the scope of
controls differs between a CCL entry and its corresponding entry on
list maintained by the European Union. This information is provided to
assist readers who use both lists.
    (D) Items. This header contains a positive list of all items
controlled by a particular entry and must be reviewed to determine
whether your item is controlled by that entry. In some entries, the
list is contained within the entry heading. In these entries a note is
included to direct you to the entry heading.

Sec. 738.3  Commerce Country Chart structure.

    (a) Scope. The Commerce Country Chart (Country Chart) allows you to
determine, based on the Reason(s) for Control associated with your
item, if you need a license to export or reexport your item to a
particular destination. There are only two instances where the chart
cannot be used for this purpose:
    (1) Items controlled for short supply reasons. Due to the unique
nature of these controls, entries controlled for Short Supply reasons
will send you directly to part 754 of the EAR. Part 754 of the EAR is
self-contained and includes information on licensing requirements,
licensing policies, and all available License Exceptions, for items
controlled for Short Supply reasons.
    (2) Unique entries. The following are unique entries where you do
not need to consult the Country Chart to determine whether a license is
required.
    (A) ECCNs 0A983 and 5A980. A license is required for all
destinations of items controlled under these entries. No License
Exceptions apply. If your item is controlled by 0A983 or 5A980 you
should proceed directly to part 748 of the EAR for license application
instructions and Sec. 742.11 or Sec. 742.13 of the EAR for information
on the licensing policy relevant to these types of applications.
    (B) ECCNs 0A986, 0A988, 1A988, 2A994, 2D994, 2E994 and 2B985. A
license is required for items controlled under these entries only to
the specific countries identified within each entry.
    (b) Countries. The first column of the Country Chart lists all
countries in alphabetical order. There are a number of destinations
that are not listed in the Country Chart contained in Supplement No. 1
to part 738. If your destination is not listed on the Country Chart and
such destination is a territory, possession, or department of a country
included on the Country Chart, the EAR accords your destination the
same licensing treatment as the country of which it is a territory,
possession, or department. For example, if your destination is the
Cayman Islands, a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, consult
the United Kingdom on the Country Chart for licensing requirements.
    (c) Columns. Stretching out to the right are horizontal headers
identifying the various Reasons for Control. Under each Reason for
Control header are diagonal column identifiers capping individual
columns. Each column identifier consists of the two letter Reason for
Control and a column number. (e.g., CB Column 1). The column
identifiers correspond to those listed in the ``Country Chart'' header
within the ``License Requirements'' section of each ECCN.
    (d) Cells. The symbol ``X'' is used to denote licensing
requirements on the Country Chart. If an ``X'' appears in a particular
cell, transactions subject to that particular Reason for Control/
Destination combination require a license. There is a direct
correlation between the number of ``X''s applicable to your transaction
and the number of licensing reviews your application will undergo.

Sec. 738.4  Determining whether a license is required.

    (a) Using the CCL and the Country Chart. (1) Overview. Once you
have determined that your item is controlled by a specific ECCN, you
must use information contained in the ``License Requirements'' section
of that ECCN in combination with the Country Chart to decide whether a
license is required.
    (2) License decision making process. The following decision making
process must be followed in order to determine whether a license is
required to export or reexport a particular item to a specific
destination:
    (i) Examine the appropriate ECCN in the CCL. Is the item you intend
to export or reexport controlled for a single Reason for Control?
    (A) If yes, identify the single Reason for Control and the relevant
Country Chart column identifier (e.g., CB Column 1).
    (B) If no, identify the Country Chart column identifier for each
applicable Reason for Control (e.g., NS Column 1, NP Column 1, etc.).
    (ii) Review the Country Chart. With each of the applicable Country
Chart Column identifiers noted, turn to the Country Chart (Supplement
No. 1 to part 738). Locate the correct Country Chart column identifier
on the diagonal headings, and determine whether an ``X'' is marked in
the cell next to the country in question for each Country Chart column
identified in the applicable ECCN. If your item is subject to more than
one reason for control, repeat this step using each unique Country
Chart column identifier.
    (A) If yes, a license application must be submitted based on the
particular reason for control and destination, unless a License
Exception applies. If ``Yes'' is noted next to any of the listed
License Exceptions, you should consult part 740 of the EAR to determine
whether you can use any of the available ECCN-drvien License Exceptions
to effect your shipment, rather than applying for a license. Each
affirmative license requirement must be overcome by a License
Exception. If you are unable to qualify for a License Exception based
on each license requirement noted on the Country Chart, you must apply
for a license. Note that other License Exceptions, not related to the
CCL, may also apply to your transaction (See part 740 of the EAR).
    (B) If no, a license is not required based on the particular reason
for control and destination. Provided General Prohibitions Four through
Ten do not apply to your proposed transaction, you may effect your
shipment using the symbol ``NLR''. Proceed to parts 758 and 762 of the
EAR for information on export clearance procedures and recordkeeping
requirements. Note that although you may stop after determining a
license is required based on the first Reason for Control, it is best
to work through each applicable Reason for Control. A full analysis of
every possible licensing requirement based on each applicable Reason
for Control is required to determine the most advantageous License
Exception available for your particular transaction and, if a license
is required, ascertain the scope of review conducted by BXA on your
license application.

[[Page 12759]]

    (b) Sample analysis using the CCL and Country Chart. (1) Scope. The
following sample entry and related analysis is provided to illustrate
the type of thought process you must complete in order to determine
whether a license is required to export or reexport a particular item
to a specific destination using the CCL in combination with the Country
Chart.
    (2) Sample CCL entry.
    2A000: Entry heading.

    b. Having z.
    (3) Sample analysis. After consulting the CCL, I determine my item,
valued at $10,000, is classified under ECCN 2A000.a. I read that the
entire entry is controlled for national security, and anti-terrorism
reasons. Since my item is classified under paragraph .a, and not .b, I
understand that though nuclear nonproliferation controls apply to a
portion the entry, they do not apply to my item. I note that the
appropriate Country Chart column identifiers are NS Column 2 and AT
Column 1. Turning to the Country Chart, I locate my specific
destination, India, and see that an ``X'' appears in the NS Column 2
cell for India, but not in the AT Column 1 cell. I understand that a
license is required, unless my transaction qualifies for a License
Exception or Special Comprehensive License. From the License Exception
LVS value listed in the entry, I know immediately that my proposed
transaction exceeds the value limitation associated with LVS. Noting
that License Exception GBS is ``Yes'' for this entry, I turn to part
740 of the EAR to review the provisions related to use of GBS.

    Authority: 50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.;
E.O. 12924, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 917; Notice of August 15, 1995 (60
FR 42767, August 17, 1995).

Sec. 740.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR
chapter VII, subchapter C.
    (a) Scope. A ``License Exception'' is an authorization contained in
this part that allows you to export or reexport, under stated
conditions, items subject to the Export Administration Regulations
(EAR) that would otherwise require a license under General Prohibitions
One, Two, or Three, as indicated under one or more of the Export
Control Classification Numbers (ECCN) in the Commerce Control List
(CCL) in part 774 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to
General Prohibition Six for embargoed destinations, refer to part 746
of the EAR concerning embargoed destinations to determine the
availability of any License Exception. Special commodity controls apply
to short supply items. Exceptions for items listed on the CCL as
controlled for Short Supply reasons are found in part 754 of the EAR.
If your export or reexport is subject General Prohibition Seven,
consult part 744 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to
General Prohibitions Four, Five, Eight, Nine, or Ten, then no License
Exceptions apply.
    (b) Certification. By using any of the License Exceptions you are
certifying that the terms, provisions, and conditions for the use of
the License Exception described in the EAR have been met. Please refer
to part 758 of the EAR for clearance of shipments and documenting the
use of License Exceptions.
    (c) License Exception groupings and symbols. License Exceptions are
grouped together; each grouping bears a three letter symbol that will
be used for export clearance purposes (see paragraph (d) of this
section). Additionally, each License Exception bears a separate
designator, of three or four letters, for convenience in distinguishing
between License Exceptions and for recordkeeping purposes.
    (d) Shipper's Export Declaration. (1) Clearing exports under
License Exceptions. You must enter on any required Shipper's Export
Declaration (SED) the letter code (e.g., LST, TMP) of the grouping of
License Exceptions under which you are exporting. In the case of
License Exceptions available under LST, except License Exception TSR
(Technology and Software under Restriction), the ECCN of the item being
exported must also be entered. Please refer to Sec. 758.3 of the EAR
for the use of SEDs.
    (2) Clearing exports when no license is required (NLR). Certain
items are listed on the CCL but do not require a license to certain
destinations under General Prohibitions One, (Exports and Reexports in
the Form Received), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), or Three
(Foreign Produced Direct Product Reexports) (Sec. 732.6 (b)(1), (b)(2),
or (b)(3) of the EAR). (You will have determined this by consulting the
Country Chart and finding no ``X'' in the box(es) at the
intersection(s) of your country of destination and the column headings
assigned to your item by the CCL.) If General Prohibitions Four through
Ten (Sec. 732.6 (b)(4) through (b)(10) of the EAR) also do not apply,
you must clear exports of such items by entering the symbol ``NLR'' in
the appropriate place on the Shippers Export Declaration. The term
``NLR'' represents exports of listed items when no license is required.
Such exports do not require that you qualify for a License Exception.
    (e) Destination Control Statement. You may be required to enter an
appropriate Destination Control Statement on commercial documents in
accordance with the Destination Control Statement requirements of
Sec. 758.5 of the EAR.
    (f) Recordkeeping. Records of transactions involving exports under
any of the License Exceptions must be maintained in accordance with the
recordkeeping requirements of part 762 of the EAR.

Sec. 740.2  Restrictions on all License Exceptions.

    (a) You may not use any License Exception if any one or more of the
following apply:
    (1) Your authorization to use a License Exception has been
suspended or revoked, or your intended export does not qualify for a
License Exception.
    (2) The export is contrary to a Denial Order. See part 764 of the
EAR for a description of Denial Orders.
    (3) You know that the item will be reexported and such reexport is
subject to one of the ten General Prohibitions, is not eligible for a
License Exception, and has not been authorized by BXA.
    (4) You know that the export will be used for certain end-uses or
is for certain end-users as provided and prohibited in part 744 of the
EAR.
    (5) The item is for surreptitious interception of wire or oral
communications controlled under ECCN 5A980, unless you are a U.S.
Government agency (see Sec. 740.6(b)(2)(ii) of this part, Governments
(GOVT)).
    (6) The commodity you are shipping is a specially designed crime
control and detection instrument or equipment as described in
Sec. 742.7 of the EAR and you are not shipping to Iceland, New Zealand,
or countries listed in Country Group A:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part
740), unless the shipment is authorized under License Exception BAG,
Sec. 740.9(e) of this part (shotguns and shotgun shells).
    (b) All License Exceptions are subject to revision, suspension, or
revocation, in whole or in part, without notice. It may be necessary
for BXA to stop a shipment or an export transaction at any stage of its
progress, e.g., in order to prevent an unauthorized export or reexport.
If a shipment is already en route, it may be further necessary to order
the return or unloading of the shipment at any port of call.

Sec. 740.3  License Exceptions based on the Commerce Control List
(LST).

    These License Exceptions are listed on the CCL. Each is designated
by a three-letter symbol that appears both in the paragraph of this
section describing its terms and on the CCL. All list-based License
Exceptions use the symbol ``LST'' on shipping documentation for export
clearance purposes.
    (a) Shipments of Limited Value (LVS). (1) Scope. License Exception
LVS authorizes the export and reexport in a single shipment of eligible
commodities as identified by ``LVS--$(value limit)'' on the CCL.
    (2) Eligible Destinations. This License Exception is available for
all destinations in Country Group B (see

[[Page 12769]]
Supplement No. 1 to part 740), provided that the net value of the
commodities included in the same order and controlled under the same
ECCN entry on the CCL does not exceed the amount specified in the LVS
paragraph for that entry.
    (3) Definitions. (i) Order. The term ``order'' as used in this
Sec. 740.3 means a communication from a person in a foreign country, or
that person's representative, expressing an intent to import
commodities from the exporter. Although all of the details of the order
need not be finally determined at the time of export, terms relating to
the kinds and quantities of the commodities to be exported, as well as
the selling prices of these commodities, must be finalized before the
goods can be exported under License Exception LVS.
    (ii) Net value: for LVS shipments. The actual selling price of the
commodities that are included in the same order and are controlled
under the same entry on the CCL, less shipping charges, or the current
market price of the commodities to the same type of purchaser in the
United States, whichever is the larger. In determining the actual
selling price or the current market price of the commodity, the value
of containers in which the commodity is being exported may be excluded.
The value for LVS purposes is that of the controlled commodity that is
being exported, and may not be reduced by subtracting the value of any
content that would not, if shipped separately, be subject to licensing.
Where the total value of the containers and their contents must be
shown on Shipper's Export Declarations under one Schedule B Number, the
exporter, in effecting a shipment under this License Exception, must
indicate the ``net value'' of the contained commodity immediately below
the description of the commodity.
    (iii) Single shipment. All commodities moving at the same time from
one exporter to one consignee or intermediate consignee on the same
exporting carrier even though these commodities will be forwarded to
one or more ultimate consignees. Commodities being transported in this
manner will be treated as a single shipment even if the commodities
represent more than one order or are in separate containers.
    (4) Additional eligibility requirements and restrictions. (i)
Eligible orders. To be eligible for this License Exception, orders must
meet the following criteria:
    (A) Orders must not exceed the applicable ``LVS'' dollar value
limits. An order is eligible for shipment under LVS when the ``net
value'' of the commodities controlled under the same entry on the CCL
does not exceed the amount specified in the ``LVS'' paragraph for that
entry. An LVS shipment may include more than one eligible order because
LVS eligibility is based on the ``net value'' of the commodities in
each order, instead of the ``net value'' of the commodities in the
shipment.
    (B) Orders may not be split to meet the applicable LVS dollar
limits. An order that exceeds the applicable LVS dollar value limit may
not be misrepresented as two or more orders, or split among two or more
shipments, to give the appearance of meeting the applicable LVS dollar
value limit. However an order that meets all the LVS eligibility
requirements, including the applicable LVS dollar value limit, may be
split among two or more shipments.
    (C) Orders must be legitimate. Exporters and consignees may not,
either collectively or individually, structure or adjust orders to meet
the applicable LVS dollar value limits.
    (ii) Restriction on annual value of LVS orders. The total value of
exports per calendar year to the same ultimate or intermediate
consignee of commodities classified under a single ECCN may not exceed
12 times the LVS value limit for that ECCN. This annual value limit
applies to shipments to the same ultimate consignee even though the
shipments are made through more than one intermediate consignee. There
is no restriction on the number of orders that may be included in a
shipment, except that the annual value limit per ECCN must not be
exceeded.
    (iii) Orders where two or more LVS dollar value limits apply. An
order may include commodities that are controlled under more than one
entry on the CCL. In this case, the net value of the entire order may
exceed the LVS dollar value for any single entry on the CCL. However,
the net value of the commodities controlled under each ECCN entry shall
not exceed the LVS dollar value limit specified for that entry.
    Example to paragraph (iii): An order includes commodities valued at
$8,000. The order consists of commodities controlled under two ECCN
entries, each having an LVS value limit of $5000. Commodities in the
order controlled under one ECCN are valued at $3,500 while those
controlled under the other ECCN are valued at $4,500. Since the net
value of the commodities controlled under each entry falls within the
LVS dollar value limits applicable to that entry, the order may be
shipped under this License Exception.
    (iv) Prohibition against evasion of license requirements. Any
activity involving the use of this License Exception to evade license
requirements is prohibited. Such devices include, but are not limited
to, the splitting or structuring of orders to meet applicable LVS
dollar value limits, as prohibited by paragraphs (a)(4)(i) (B) and (C)
of this section.
    (5) Reexports. Commodities may be reexported under this License
Exception, provided that they could be exported from the United States
to the new country of destination under LVS.
    (b) Shipments to Country Group B countries (GBS). License Exception
GBS authorizes exports and reexports to Country Group B (see Supplement
No. 1 to part 740) of those commodities controlled for national
security reasons and identified by ``GBS--Yes'' on the CCL.
    (c) Civil end-users (CIV). (1) Scope. License Exception CIV
authorizes exports and reexports of national security controlled items
identified by ``CIV--Yes'' on the CCL only to civil end-users for civil
end-uses in Country Group D:1. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.) CIV
may not be used for exports and reexports to military end-users or to
known military uses. Such exports and reexports will continue to
require a license. In addition to conventional military activities,
military uses include any proliferation activities described and
prohibited by part 744 of the EAR. A license is also required for
transfer to military end-users or end-uses in eligible countries of
items exported under CIV.
    (d) Technology and software under restriction (TSR). (1) Scope.
License Exception TSR permits exports and reexports of technology and
software subject to national security controls and identified by
``TSR--Yes'' in entries on the CCL only to the destinations in Country
Group B. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.) A written assurance is
required from the consignee before exporting under this License
Exception.
    (i) Required assurance for export of technology. You may not export
or reexport technology under this License Exception until you have
received from the importer a written assurance that, without a BXA
license or License Exception, the importer will not:
    (A) Reexport or release the technology to a national of a country
in Country Groups D:1 or E:2; or
    (B) Export to Country Groups D:1 or E:2 the direct product of the
technology, if such foreign produced direct product is subject to
national security controls as identified on the CCL (See General
Prohibition Three, Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR); or

[[Page 12770]]

    (C) If the direct product of the technology is a complete plant or
any major component of a plant, export to Country Groups D:1 or E:2 the
direct product of the technology, if such foreign produced direct
product is subject to national security controls as identified on the
CCL or is subject to State Department controls under the U.S. Munitions
List (22 CFR part 121).
    (ii) Required assurance for export of software. You may not export
or reexport software under this License Exception until you have
received from the importer a written assurance that, without a BXA
license or License Exception, the importer will neither:
    (A) Reexport or release the software or the source code for the
software to a national of a country in Country Groups D:1 or E:2; nor
    (B) Export to Country Groups D:1 or E:2 the direct product of the
software, if such foreign produced direct product is subject to
national security controls as identified on the CCL. (See General
Prohibition Three, Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR).
    (iii) Form of written assurance. The required assurance may be made
in the form of a letter or any other written communication from the
importer, or the assurance may be incorporated into a licensing
agreement that specifically includes the assurances. An assurance
included in a licensing agreement is acceptable only if the agreement
specifies that the assurance will be honored even after the expiration
date of the licensing agreement. If such a written assurance is not
received, License Exception TSR is not applicable and a license is
required. The license application must include a statement explaining
why assurances could not be obtained.
    (iv) Other License Exceptions. The requirements in this License
Exception do not apply to the export of technology or software under

Sec. 740.4  Temporary imports, exports, and reexports (TMP).

    These License Exceptions authorize various temporary exports and
reexports (TEMP); exports and reexports of items temporarily in the
United States (TUS); and exports and reexports of beta test software
(BETA). License Exceptions in Sec. 740.4 of this part use the symbol
``TMP'' for export clearance purposes.
    (a) Temporary exports (TEMP). (1) Scope. You may export and
reexport commodities and software for temporary use abroad (including
use in international waters) subject to the conditions and exclusions
described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Commodities and software
shipped under this License Exception must be returned to the country
from which they were exported as soon as practicable but, except in
circumstances described in this section, no later than one year from
the date of export. This requirement does not apply if the commodities
and software are consumed or destroyed in the normal course of
authorized temporary use abroad or an extension or other disposition is
permitted by the EAR or in writing by BXA.
    (2) Eligible commodities and software. The following commodities
and software are eligible to be shipped under this License Exception:
    (i) Tools of trade. Usual and reasonable kinds and quantities of
commodities and software for use by employees of the exporter in a
lawful enterprise or undertaking of the exporter. Eligible commodities
and software may include, but are not limited to, such equipment as is
necessary to commission or service goods, provided that the equipment
is appropriate for this purpose and that all goods to be commissioned
or serviced are of foreign origin, or if subject to the EAR, have been
legally exported or reexported. The commodities and software must
remain under the effective control of the exporter or the exporter's
employee. The shipment of commodities and software may accompany the
individual departing from the United States or may be shipped
unaccompanied within one month before the individual's departure from
the United States, or at any time after departure. No tools of the
trade may be taken to Country Group E:2, and only equipment necessary
to commission or service goods may be taken as tools of trade to
Country Group D:1. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.)
    (ii) Kits consisting of replacement parts. Kits consisting of
replacement parts may be exported or reexported under this section to
all destinations, except Country Group E:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to
part 740), provided that:
    (A) The parts would qualify for shipment under paragraph (c) of
this section if exported as one-for-one replacements;
    (B) The kits remain under effective control of the exporter or an
employee of the exporter; and
    (C) All parts in the kit are returned, except that one-for-one
replacements may be made in accordance with the requirements of License
Exception RPL and the defective parts returned (see PTS, Sec. 740.5(a)
of this part).
    (iii) Exhibition and demonstration in Country Group B. Commodities
and software for exhibition or demonstration in Country Group B (see
Supplement No. 1 to part 740) may be exported or reexported under this
provision provided that the exporter maintains ownership of the
commodities and software while they are abroad and provided that the
exporter, an employee of the exporter, or the exporter's designated
sales representative retains effective control over the commodities and
software while they are abroad. The commodities and software may not be
used for their intended purpose while abroad, except to the minimum
extent required for effective demonstration. The commodities and
software may not be exhibited or demonstrated at any one site more than
120 days after installation and debugging, unless authorized by BXA.
However, before or after an exhibition or demonstration, pending
movement to another site, return to the United States or the foreign
reexporter, or BXA approval for other disposition, the commodities and
software may be placed in a bonded warehouse or a storage facility
provided that the exporter retains effective control over their
disposition. The export documentation for this type of transaction must
show the U.S. exporter as ultimate consignee, in care of the person who
will have control over the commodities and software abroad.
    (iv) Inspection and calibration. Commodities to be inspected,
tested, calibrated or repaired abroad.
    (v) Containers. Containers for which another License Exception is
not available and that are necessary for export of commodities.
However, this License Exception does not authorize the export of the
container's contents, which, if not exempt from licensing, must be
separately authorized for export under either a License Exception or a
license.
    (vi) Broadcast material. (A) Video tape containing program material
recorded in the country of export to be publicly broadcast in another
country.
    (B) Blank video tape (raw stock) for use in recording program
material abroad.
    (vii) Assembly in Mexico. Commodities to be exported to Mexico
under Customs entries that require return to the United States after
processing, assembly, or incorporation into end products by companies,
factories, or facilities participating in Mexico's in-bond
industrialization program (Maquilladora), provided that all resulting
end-products (or the commodities themselves) are returned to the United
States.
    (viii) News media. (A) Commodities necessary for news-gathering
purposes (and software necessary to use such commodities) may accompany
``accredited'' news media personnel (i.e., persons with credentials
from a news gathering or reporting firm) to Country Groups D:1 or E:2
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 740) if the commodities:
    (1) Are retained under ``effective control'' of the exporting news
gathering firm;
    (2) Remain in the physical possession of the news media personnel.
The term physical possession for purposes of this paragraph
(a)(2)(viii), news media, is defined as maintaining effective measures
to prevent unauthorized access (e.g., securing equipment in

[[Page 12772]]
locked facilities or hiring security guards to protect the equipment);
and
    (3) Are removed with the news media personnel at the end of the
trip.
    (B) When exporting under this paragraph (a)(2)(viii) from the
United States, the exporter must send a copy of the packing list or
similar identification of the exported commodities, to: U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration, Office of Enforcement
Support, Room H4069, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, DC 20230, or any of its field offices, specifying the
destination and estimated dates of departure and return. The Office of
Export Enforcement (OEE) may spot check returns to assure that this
License Exception is being used properly.
    (C) Commodities or software necessary for news-gathering purposes
that accompany news media personnel to all other destinations shall be
exported or reexported under paragraph (a)(2)(i), tools of trade, of
this section if owned by the news gathering firm, or if they are
personal property of the individual news media personnel. Note that
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), tools of trade and (a)(2)(viii), news media, of
this section do not preclude independent ``accredited'' contract
personnel, who are under control of news gathering firms while on
assignment, from utilizing these provisions, provided that the news
gathering firm designate an employee of the contract firm to be
responsible for the equipment.)
    (3) Special restrictions. (i) Destinations. (A) No commodity or
software may be exported under this License Exception to Country Group
E:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740) except as permitted by paragraph
(a)(2)(viii), news media, of this section;
    (B) No commodity or software may be exported under this License
Exception to Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740)
except:
    (1) Commodities and software exported under paragraph (a)(2)(viii),
news media, of this section;
    (2) Commodities and software exported under paragraph (a)(2)(i),
tools of trade, of this section; and
    (3) Commodities exported as kits of replacement parts, consistent
with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (C) These destination restrictions apply to temporary exports to
and for use on any vessel, aircraft or territory under ownership,
control, lease, or charter by any country in Country Group D:1 or E:2,
or any national thereof. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.)
    (ii) Ineligible commodities or software. Commodities or software
that will be used outside of Country Group A:4 (Nuclear Suppliers
Group) (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740) either directly or indirectly
in any sensitive nuclear activity as described in Sec. 744.2 of the EAR
may not be exported or reexported to any destination under this License
Exception.
    (iii) Use or disposition. No commodity or software may be exported
or reexported under this License Exception if:
    (A) An order to acquire the commodity or software has been received
before shipment;
    (B) The exporter has prior knowledge that the commodity or software
will stay abroad beyond the terms of this License Exception; or
    (C) The commodity or software is for lease or rental abroad.
    (4) Return or disposal of commodities and software. All commodities
and software exported or reexported under this License Exception must,
if not consumed or destroyed in the normal course of authorized
temporary use abroad, be returned as soon as practicable but no later
than one year after the date of export, to the United States or other
country from which the commodities and software were exported under
this License Exception, or shall be disposed of or retained in one of
the following ways:
    (i) Permanent export or reexport. If the exporter or the reexporter
wishes to sell or otherwise dispose of the commodities or software
abroad, except as permitted by this or other applicable License
Exception, the exporter must request authorization by submitting a
license application to BXA at the address listed in part 748 of the
EAR. (See part 748 of the EAR for more information on license
applications.) The request should comply with all applicable provisions
of the EAR covering export directly from the United States to the
proposed destination. The request must also be supported by any
documents that would be required in support of an application for
export license for shipment of the same commodities or software
directly from the United States to the proposed destination. BXA will
advise the exporter of its decision.
    (ii) Use of a license. An outstanding license may also be used to
dispose of commodities or software covered by the License Exception
described in this section, provided that the outstanding license
authorizes direct shipment of the same commodity or software to the
same new ultimate consignee in the new country of destination.
    (iii) Authorization to retain abroad beyond one year. If the
exporter wishes to retain a commodity or software abroad beyond the 12
months authorized by paragraph (a) of this section, the exporter must
request authorization by submitting Form BXA-748P, Multipurpose
Application, 90 days prior to the expiration of the 12 month period.
The request must be sent to BXA at the address listed in part 748 of
the EAR and should include the name and address of the exporter, the
date the commodities or software were exported, a brief product
description, and the justification for the extension. If BXA approves
the extension request, the exporter will receive authorization for a
one-time extension not to exceed six months. BXA normally will not
allow an extension for commodities or software that have been abroad
more than 12 months, nor will a second six month extension be
authorized. Any request for retaining the commodities or software
abroad for a period exceeding 18 months must be made in accordance with
the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.
    (5) Reexports. Commodities and software legally exported from the
United States may be reexported to a new country(ies) of destination
under this License Exception provided its terms and conditions are met
and the commodities and software are returned to the country from which
the reexport occurred.
    (b) Exports of items temporarily in the United States (TUS).
    Scope. License Exception TUS, describes the conditions for
exporting foreign-origin items temporarily in the United States.
Specifically, this License Exception includes the export of items
moving in transit through the United States, imported for display at a
U.S. exhibition or trade fair, returned because unwanted, or returned
because refused entry.

    Note 1 to paragraph (b) of this section: A commodity withdrawn
from a bonded warehouse in the United States under a ``withdrawal
for export'' customs entry is considered as ``moving in transit''.
It is not considered as ``moving in transit'' if it is withdrawn
from a bonded warehouse under any other type of customs entry or if
its transit has been broken for a processing operation, regardless
of the type of customs entry.

    Note 2 to paragraph (b) of this section: Items shipped on board
a vessel or aircraft and passing through the United States from one
foreign country to another may be exported without a license
provided that (a) while passing in transit through the United
States, they have not been unladen from the

[[Page 12773]]

vessel or aircraft on which they entered, and (b) they are not
originally manifested to the United States.)

    (1) Items moving in transit through the United States. Subject to
the following conditions, this License Exception authorizes export of
items moving in transit through the United States under a
Transportation and Exportation (T. & E.) customs entry or an Immediate
Exportation (I.E.) customs entry made at a U.S. Customs Office.
    (i) Items controlled for national security, nuclear proliferation,
missile technology, or chemical and biological weapons reasons may not
be exported to Country Group D:1, 2, 3, or 4 (see Supplement No. 1 to
part 740), respectively, under License Exception TUS.
    (ii) Items may not be exported to Country Group E:2 under this
License Exception.
    (iii) The following may not be exported in transit from the United
States under License Exception TUS:
    (A) Commodities shipped to the United States under an International
Import Certificate, Form BXA-645P;
    (B) Chemicals controlled under ECCN 1C350; or
    (C) Horses for export by sea (refer to short supply controls in
part 754 of the EAR).
    (iv) The provisions of this License Exception apply to all
shipments from Canada moving in transit through the United States to
any foreign destination, regardless of the nature of the commodities or
software or their origin. For such shipments the customs office at the
U.S. port of export will require a copy of Form B-13, Canadian Customs
Entry, certified or stamped by Canadian customs authorities, except
where the shipment is valued at less than $50.00. (In transit shipments
originating in Canada that are exempt from U.S. licensing, or made
under a U.S. license or applicable U.S. License Exception other than
TUS do not require this form.) The commodity or software description,
quantity, ultimate consignee, country of ultimate destination, and all
other pertinent details of the shipment must be the same on a required
Form B-13, as on Commerce Form 7513,<SUP>3 or when Form 7513 is not
required, must be the same as on Customs Form 7512. When there is a
material difference, a corrected Form B-13 authorizing the shipment is
required.

    \3\  The complete names of these forms are: Commerce Form 7513,
``Shipper's Export Declaration for Intransit Goods''; Customs Form
7512, ``Transportation Entry and Manifest of Goods Subject to
Customs Inspection and Permit.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Items imported for display at U.S. exhibitions or trade fairs.
Subject to the following conditions, License Exception TUS authorizes
the export of items that were imported into the United States for
display at an exhibition or trade fair and were either entered under
bond or permitted temporary free import under bond providing for their
export and are being exported in accordance with the terms of that
bond.
    (i) Items may be exported to the country from which imported into
the United States. However, items originally imported from Cuba or
North Korea may not be exported unless the U.S. Government had licensed
the import from that country.
    (ii) Items may be exported to any destination other than the
country from which imported except:
    (A) Items imported into the United States under an International
Import Certificate;
    (B) Exports to Country Group E:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to part
740); or
    (C) Exports to Country Group D:1, 2, 3, or 4 (see Supplement No. 1
to part 740) of items controlled for national security, missile
technology, chemical and biological weapons reasons, or nuclear
proliferation, respectively.
    (3) Return of unwanted shipments. A foreign-origin item may be
returned under this License Exception to the country from which it was
imported if its characteristics and capabilities have not been enhanced
while in the United States. No foreign-origin items may be returned to
Cuba, Libya, or North Korea.
    (4) Return of shipments refused entry. Shipments of items refused
entry by the U.S. Customs Service, the Food and Drug Administration, or
other U.S. Government agency may be returned to the country of origin,
except to:
    (i) A destination in Cuba, Libya, or North Korea; or
    (ii) A destination from which the shipment has been refused entry
because of the Foreign Assets Control Regulations of the Treasury
Department, unless such return is licensed or otherwise authorized by
the Treasury Department, Office of Foreign Assets Control (31 CFR part
500).
    (c) Exports of beta test software (BETA). (1) Scope. This License
Exception authorizes exports and reexports to eligible countries of
beta test software intended for distribution to the general public.
    (2) Eligible countries. The countries that are eligible to receive
exports and reexports under License Exception BETA are all countries
except those Country Groups E:2.
    (3) Eligible software. All software that is controlled by the CCL
(part 774 of the EAR), and under Commerce licensing jurisdiction, is
eligible for export and reexport under this License Exception, subject
to the restrictions in this section.
    (4) Conditions for use. Any beta test software program may be
exported or reexported to eligible countries if all of the conditions
under this section are met:
    (i) The software producer intends to market the software to the
general public after completion of the beta testing, as described in
the General Software Note found in Supplement No. 2 to part 774 of the
EAR;
    (ii) The software producer provides the software to the testing
consignee free-of-charge or at a price that does not exceed the cost of
reproduction and distribution; and
    (iii) The software is designed for installation by the end-user
without further substantial support from the supplier.
    (5) Importer Statement. Prior to shipping any eligible software
under BETA, the exporter or reexporter must obtain the following
statement from the testing consignee, which may be included in a
contract, non-disclosure agreement, or other document that identifies
the importer, the software to be exported, the country of destination,
and the testing consignee.

    We certify that this beta test software will only be used for
beta testing purposes, and will not be rented, leased, sold,
sublicensed, assigned, or otherwise transferred. Further, we certify
that we will not transfer or export any product, process, or service
that is the direct product of the beta test software.
    (6) Use limitations. Only testing consignees that provide the
importer statement required by paragraph (c)(5) of this section may
execute any software received under this License Exception.
    (7) Return or disposal of software. All beta test software exported
under this License Exception must be destroyed abroad or returned to
the exporter within 30 days of the end of the beta test period as
defined by the software producer or, if the software producer does not
define a test period, within 30 days of completion of the consignee's
role in the test. Among other methods, this requirement may be
satisfied by a software module that will destroy the software and all
its copies at or before the end of the beta test period.
Sec. 740.5  Servicing and replacement of parts and equipment (RPL).
    These License Exceptions authorize exports and reexports associated
with one-for-one replacement of parts (PTS) or servicing and
replacement of equipment (SNR). The symbol ``RPL'' is

[[Page 12774]]
used on shipping documentation for export clearance purposes.
    (a) Parts (PTS). (1) Scope. This License Exception authorizes the
export and reexport of one-for-one replacement parts for previously
exported equipment.
    (2) One-for-one replacement of parts. (i) The term ``replacement
parts'' as used in this section means parts needed for the immediate
repair of equipment, including replacement of defective or worn parts.
(It includes subassemblies but does not include test instruments or
operating supplies). (The term ``subassembly'' means a number of
components assembled to perform a specific function or functions within
a commodity. One example would be printed circuit boards with
components mounted thereon. This definition does not include major
subsystems such as those composed of a number of subassemblies.) Items
that improve or change the basic design characteristics, e.g., as to
accuracy, capability, performance or productivity, of the equipment
upon which they are installed, are not deemed to be replacement parts.
For kits consisting of replacement parts, consult Sec. 740.4(a)(2)(ii)
of this part (TEMP).
    (ii) Parts may be exported only to replace, on a one-for-one basis,
parts contained in commodities that were: legally exported from the
United States; legally reexported; or made in a foreign country
incorporating authorized U.S.-origin parts. The conditions of the
original U.S. authorization must not have been violated. Accordingly,
the export of replacement parts may be made only by the party who
originally exported or reexported the commodity to be repaired, or by a
party that has confirmed the appropriate authority for the original
transaction.
    (iii) The parts to be replaced must either be destroyed abroad or
returned promptly to the person who supplied the replacement parts, or
to a foreign firm that is under the effective control of that person.
    (3) Exclusions. (i) No replacement parts may be exported under this
License Exception to repair a commodity exported under a license if
that license included a condition that any subsequent replacement parts
must be exported only under a license.
    (ii) No parts may be exported under this License Exception to be
held abroad as spare parts or equipment for future use. Replacement
parts may be exported to replace spare parts that were authorized to
accompany the export of equipment, as those spare parts are utilized in
the repair of the equipment. This will allow maintenance of the stock
of spares at a consistent level as parts are used.
    (iii) No parts may be exported under PTS to any destination except
Iceland, New Zealand, or the countries listed in Country Group A:1 (see
Supplement No. 1 to part 740) if the item is to be incorporated into or
used in nuclear weapons, nuclear explosive devices, nuclear testing
related to activities described in Sec. 744.2(a) of the EAR, the
chemical processing of irradiated special nuclear or source material,
the production of heavy water, the separation of isotopes of source and
special nuclear materials, or the fabrication of nuclear reactor fuel
containing plutonium, as described in Sec. 744.2(a) of the EAR.
    (iv) No replacement parts shall be exported under this License
Exception to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Libya, or North Korea
(countries designated by the Secretary of State as supporting acts of
international terrorism) if the commodity to be repaired is an
``aircraft'' (as defined in part 772 of the EAR) or national security
controlled commodity.
    (v) The conditions described in this paragraph (a)(3) relating to
replacement of parts do not apply to reexports to a foreign country of
parts as replacements in foreign-origin products, if at the time the
replacements are furnished, the foreign-origin product is eligible for
export to such country under any of the License Exceptions in this part
or the exceptions in Sec. 734.4(b)(2) (ii) and (iii) of the EAR.
    (4) Reexports. Parts exported from the United States may be
reexported to a new country of destination, provided that the
restrictions described in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section
are met. A party reexporting U.S.-origin one-for-one replacement parts
shall ensure that the commodities being repaired were shipped to their
present location in accordance with U.S. law and continue to be legally
used, and that either before or promptly after reexport of the
replacement parts, the replaced parts are either destroyed or returned
to the United States, or to the foreign firm in Country Group B (see
Supplement No. 1 to part 740) that shipped the replacement parts.
    (b) Servicing and Replacement (SNR). (1) Scope. This License
Exception SNR authorizes the export and reexport of items that were
returned to the United States for servicing and the replacement of

United States or a foreign party for servicing may be returned under
this License Exception to the country from which it was sent, provided
that both of the following conditions are met:
    (A) The exporter making the shipment is the same person or firm to
whom the original license was issued; and
    (B) The end-use and the end-user of the serviced commodities or
software and other particulars of the transaction, as set forth in the
application and supporting documentation that formed the basis for
issuance of the license have not changed.
    (iv) Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. No
repaired commodity or software may be exported or reexported to Cuba,
Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria under this section.

may be exported or reexported to replace defective or otherwise
unusable (e.g., erroneously supplied) items.
    (A) The commodity or software to be replaced must have been
previously exported or reexported in its present form under a license
or authorization granted by BXA.
    (B) No commodity or software may be exported or reexported to

    (C) The replacement item may not improve the basic characteristic,
e.g., as to accuracy, capability, performance, or productivity, of the
equipment as

[[Page 12775]]
originally approved for export or reexport under a license issued by
BXA.
    (D) No shipment may be made to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North

defective or otherwise unusable equipment owned or controlled by, or
leased or chartered to, a national of any of those countries.
    (ii) Special conditions applicable to exports to Country Group B
and Country Group D:1. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.) In addition
to the general conditions in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the
following conditions apply to exports or reexports of replacements for

consignee in the country of destination, whichever is shorter.
    (C) The commodity or software to be replaced must either be
destroyed abroad or returned to the United States, or to a foreign firm
in Country Group B that is under the effective control of the U.S.
exporter, or to the foreign firm that is providing the replacement part
or equipment. The destruction or return must be effected before, or
promptly after, the replacement item is exported from the United
States.
    (D) A party reexporting replacements for defective or unacceptable
U.S.-origin equipment must ensure that the commodities or software
being replaced were shipped to their present location in accordance
with U.S. law and continue to be legally used.

Sec. 740.6  Governments and international organizations (GOV).

    These Licenses Exceptions authorize exports and reexports for

Classification Numbers (ECCNs) 6A002, 6A003, 6D102, 6E001, 6E002,
7D001, 7E001, 7E002, and 7E101, as described in Sec. 742.6(a)(1) of the
EAR.
    (3) Definitions. (i) ``Agency of the U.S. Government'' includes all
civilian and military departments, branches, missions, government-owned
corporations, and other agencies of the U.S. Government, but does not
include such national agencies as the American Red Cross or
international organizations in which the United States participates
such as the Organization of American States. Therefore, shipments may

Sec. 740.7  Gift parcels and humanitarian donations (GFT).

    (a) Gift parcels (GIFT). (1) Scope. This License Exception (GIFT)
authorizes exports and reexports of gift parcels by an individual
(donor) addressed to an individual, or a religious, charitable or
educational organization (donee) located in any destination for the use
of the donee or the donee's immediate family (and not for resale). The
gift parcel must be provided free of charge to the donee. However,
payment by the donee of any handling charges or of any fees levied by
the importing country (e.g., import duties, taxes, etc.) is not
considered to be a cost to the donee for purposes of this definition of
``gift parcel.'' <SUP>4

    \4\  Many foreign countries permit the entry, duty-free, of gift
parcels that conform to regulations regarding contents and marking.
To secure this advantage, the sender should show the words ``U.S.A.
Gift Parcel'' on the addressee side of the package and on any
required customs declarations. Information regarding the foreign
postal regulations is available at local post offices. Senders of
gift parcels who wish information regarding import duties of a
foreign country should contact the nearest Commercial Office,
Consulate or Embassy of the country concerned.

    Note to paragraph (a) of this section: A gift parcel, within the
context of this License Exception GIFT, does not include multiple
parcels exported in a single shipment for delivery to individuals
residing in a foreign country. Such multiple gift parcels, if
subject to the General Prohibitions described in Sec. 734.2(b) of
the EAR, must be licensed by BXA. (See Sec. 748.9(e) of the EAR for
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
licensing of multiple gift parcels).

    (2) Commodity, value and other limitations. (i) Eligible
commodities. The commodities eligible for this License Exception are as
follows:
    (A) The commodity must not be controlled for chemical and
biological weapons (CB), missile technology (MT), national security
(NS), or nuclear proliferation (NP) (see Commerce Control List, part
774 of the EAR); and
    (B) The commodity must be of a type and in quantities normally
given as gifts between individuals.

    (1) For Cuba, the only commodities that may be included in a gift
parcel are the following items from Supplement No. 1 to part 746 of the
EAR: food, vitamins, seeds, medicines, medical supplies and devices,
hospital supplies and equipment, equipment for the handicapped,
clothing, personal hygiene items, veterinary medicines and supplies,
fishing equipment and supplies, soap-making equipment, and in addition
receive-only radio equipment for reception of commercial/civil AM/FM
and short wave publicly available frequency bands, and batteries for
such equipment.
    (2) For all other destinations, eligible commodities include all
items described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B)(1) of this section as well as
all other items normally sent as gifts. Gold bullion, gold taels, and
gold bars are prohibited as are items intended for resale or reexport.

    Example to paragraph (a) of this section. A watch or piece of
jewelry is normally sent as a gift. However, multiple watches,
either in one package or in subsequent shipments, would not qualify
for such gift parcels because the quantity exceeds that normally
given between individuals. Similarly, a sewing machine or bicycle,
within the dollar limits of this License Exception, may be an
appropriate gift. However, subsequent shipments of the same item to
the same donee would not be a gift normally given between
individuals.

    (3) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section,
clothing is appropriate, except that export of military wearing apparel
to Country Group D:1 or E:2 under this License Exception is
specifically prohibited, regardless of whether all distinctive U.S.
military insignia, buttons, and other markings are removed.
    (ii) Import requirements. The commodities must be acceptable in
type and quantity by the recipient country for import as gifts.
Commodities exceeding the import limits may not be included in gift
parcels.
    (iii) Frequency. Except for gift parcels of food to Cuba, not more
than one gift parcel may be sent from the same donor to the same donee
in any one calendar month. Parties seeking authorization to exceed this
limit due to compelling humanitarian concerns (e.g., gifts of medicine
to relatives) should submit a license application (BXA-748P) with
complete justification.
    (iv) Value. The combined total domestic retail value of all
commodities included in a gift parcel may not exceed $400, except for
gift parcels to Cuba where the value of non-food items may not exceed
$200. There is no dollar value limit on food contained in a gift parcel
to Cuba.
    (3) How to export gift parcels. (i) A gift parcel must be sent
directly to the donee by the individual donor, or for such donor by a
commercial or other gift-forwarding service or organization. Each gift
parcel must show, on the outside wrapper, the name and address of the
donor, as well as the name and address of the donee, regardless of
whether sent by the donor or by a forwarding service.
    (ii) Each parcel must have the notation ``GIFT--Export License Not
Required'' written on the addressee side of the package and the symbol
``GFT'' written on any required customs declaration.
    (b) Humanitarian donations (NEED). (1) Scope. License Exception
NEED authorizes exports by groups or organizations of donations to meet
basic human needs when those groups or organizations have experience in
maintaining a verifiable system of distribution that ensures delivery
to the intended beneficiaries.
    (2) Basic human needs. Under License Exception NEED, basic human
needs are defined as those requirements essential to individual well-
being: health, food, clothing, shelter, and education. These needs are
considered to extend beyond those of an emergency nature and those that
meet direct needs for mere subsistence.
    (3) Eligible donors. Eligible donors are U.S. charitable
organizations that have an established record of involvement in
donative programs and experience in maintaining and verifying a system
of distribution to ensure delivery of commodities and software to the
intended beneficiaries. Eligible

[[Page 12777]]

distribution arrangements may consist of any one or more of the
following:
    (i) A permanent staff maintained in the recipient country to
monitor the receipt and distribution of the donations to the intended
beneficiaries;
    (ii) Periodic spot-checks in the recipient country by members of
the exporter's staff; or
    (iii) An agreement to utilize the services of a charitable
organization that has a monitoring system in place.
    (4) Donations. To qualify for export under this License Exception,
the items must be provided free of charge to the beneficiary. The
payment by the beneficiary, however, of normal handling charges or fees
levied by the importing country (e.g., import duties, taxes, etc.) is
not considered to be a cost to the beneficiary for purposes of this
section.
    (5) Ineligible commodities and software. The following commodities
and software are not eligible for this License Exception:
    (i) Commodities and software controlled for national security,
chemical or biological weapons, and nuclear non-proliferation, missile
technology or crime control reasons (see supplement No. 1 to part 774
of the EAR);
    (ii) Exports for large-scale projects of the kind associated with
comprehensive economic growth, such as dams and hydroelectric plants;
or
    (iii) Exports to Cuba of medical items excluded by Sec. 746.2(a)(3)
of the EAR.
    (6) Eligible items. Eligible commodities and software are those
listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 740.
    (7) Additional recordkeeping requirements. In addition to the
recordkeeping requirements in part 762 of the EAR, donors must keep
records containing the following information:
    (i) The donor organization's identity and past experience as an
exporter of goods to meet basic human needs;
    (ii) Past and current countries to which the donative programs have
been and are being directed, with particular reference to donative
programs in embargoed destinations;
    (iii) Types of projects and commodities involved in the donative
programs;
    (iv) Specific class(es) of beneficiaries of particular donated
goods intended to be exported under this License Exception; and
    (vi) Information concerning the source of funding for the donative
programs and the projected annual value of exports under this License
Exception.

Sec. 740.8  Technology and software--unrestricted (TSU).

    (a) Operating technology and software (OTS). (1) Scope. This
License Exception permits exports and reexports of operation technology
and software. ``Operation technology'' is the minimum technology
necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance (checking), and
repair of those products that are lawfully exported or reexported under
a license, a License Exception, or NLR. The ``minimum necessary''
operation technology does not include technology for development or
production and includes use technology only to the extent required to
ensure safe and efficient use of the product. Individual entries in the
software and technology subcategories of the CCL may further restrict
the export or reexport of operation technology under this License
Exception.
    (2) Provisions and Destinations. (i) Provisions. Operation software
may be exported or reexported under this License Exception provided
that both of the following conditions are met:
    (A) The operation software is the minimum necessary to operate
equipment authorized for export or reexport; and
    (B) The operation software is in object code.
    (ii) Destinations. Operation software and technology may be
exported or reexported to any destination to which the equipment for
which it is required has been or is being legally exported or
reexported.
    (b) Sales technology (STS). (1) Scope. This License Exception
authorizes exports and reexports of sales technology. ``Sales
technology'' is data supporting a prospective or actual quotation, bid,
or offer to sell, lease, or otherwise supply any item.
    (2) Provisions and destinations. (i) Provisions. Sales technology
may be exported or reexported under this License Exception provided
that:
    (A) The technology is a type customarily transmitted with a
prospective or actual quotation, bid, or offer in accordance with
established business practice; and
    (B) Neither the export nor the reexport will disclose the detailed
design, production, or manufacture technology, or the means of
reconstruction, of either the quoted item or its product. The purpose
of this limitation is to prevent disclosure of technology so detailed
that the consignee could reduce the technology to production.
    (ii) Destinations. Sales technology may be exported or reexported
to any destination.

    Note: Neither this section nor its use means that the U.S.
Government intends, or is committed, to approve a license
application for any commodity, plant, software, or technology that
may be the subject of the transaction to which such quotation, bid,
or offer relates. Exporters are advised to include in any
quotations, bids, or offers, and in any contracts entered into
pursuant to such quotations, bids, or offers, a provision relieving
themselves of liability in the event that a license (when required)
is not approved by the Bureau of Export Administration.

    (c) Software updates (SUD). This License Exception authorizes
exports and reexports of software updates that are intended for and are
limited to correction of errors (``fixes'' to ``bugs'') in software
lawfully exported or reexported (original software). Such software
updates may be exported or reexported only to the same consignee to
whom the original software was exported or reexported, and such
software updates may not enhance the functional capacities of the
original software. Such software updates may be exported or reexported
to any destination to which the software for which they are required
has been legally exported or reexported.
    (d) General Software Note (GSN): ``mass market'' software. (1)
Scope. This License Exception authorizes exports and reexports of
``mass market'' software subject to the General Software Note (see
Supplement No. 2 to part 774 of the EAR; also referenced in this
section).<SUP>5

    \5\ ``Mass market'' software may fall under the classification
of ``general use'' software for export clearance purposes. Exporters
should consult the Census Bureau FTSR for possible SED requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Provisions and destinations.
    (i) Destinations. This License Exception is available to all
destinations except Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
    (ii) Provisions. This License Exception is available for software
that is generally available to the public by being:
    (A) Sold from stock at retail selling points, without restriction,
by means of:
    (1) Over the counter transactions;
    (2) Mail order transactions; or
    (3) Telephone call transactions; and
    (B) Designed for installation by the user without further
substantial support by the supplier.

the limits described in this section. In addition, the commodities or
software must be:
    (1) Owned by the individuals (or by members of their immediate
families) or by crew members of exporting carriers on the dates they
depart from the United States;
    (2) Intended for and necessary and appropriate for the use of the
individuals or members of their immediate families, or by the crew
members of exporting carriers;
    (3) Not intended for sale; and
    (4) Not exported under a bill of lading as cargo if exported by

    (d) Special provision: unaccompanied baggage. Individuals departing
the United States may ship unaccompanied baggage, which is baggage sent
from the United States on a carrier other than that on which an
individual departs. Crew members of exporting carriers may not ship
unaccompanied baggage. Unaccompanied shipments under this License
Exception shall be clearly marked ``BAGGAGE.'' Shipments of
unaccompanied baggage may be made at the time of, or within a
reasonable time before or after departure of the consignee or owner
from the United States. Personal baggage controlled for chemical and
biological weapons (CB), missile technology (MT), national security
(NS) or nuclear nonproliferation (NP) must be shipped within 3 months
before or after the month in which the consignee or owner departs the
United States. However, commodities controlled for CB, MT, NS or NP may

under this License Exception. All shotguns and unused shotgun shells
must be returned to the United States.
    (2) A nonresident alien leaving the United States may export or
reexport under this License Exception only such shotguns and shotgun

    (1) The reexport is made in accordance with the conditions of an
export authorization from the government of the reexporting country;
    (2) The commodities being reexported are not controlled for nuclear
nonproliferation, missile technology or crime control reasons; and
    (3) The reexport is destined to either:
    (i) A country in Country Group B that is not also included in
Country Group D:2, D:3, or D:4; Cambodia; or Laos; and the commodity
being reexported is both controlled for national security reasons and
not controlled for export to Country Group A:1; or
    (ii) A country in Country Group D:1 only (National Security) (see
Supplement No. 1 to part 740), other than Cambodia or Laos, and the
commodity being reexported is controlled for national security reasons.
    (b) Reexports to and among Country Group A:1 and cooperating
countries. Reexports may be made to and among Country Group A:1 and
cooperating countries, provided that eligible commodities are for use
or consumption within a Country Group A:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part

August 17, 1995).
Sec. 742.1  Introduction. In this part, references to the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII,
subchapter C.

    (a) Scope. This part describes all the reasons for control
reflected in the Country Chart in Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the
EAR. In addition, it includes licensing requirements and licensing
policies for the following items that are not reflected on the Country
Chart: specially designed implements of torture, high performance
computers, and communications intercepting devices. This part is
organized so that it lists each reason for control in the order
(reading left to right) in which the control appears on the Country
Chart. In addition to describing the reasons for control and licensing
requirements and policies, this part describes any applicable contract
sanctity provisions that may apply to specific controls and includes a
description of any multilateral regime under which specific controls
are maintained.
    (b) Reasons for control listed on the CCL not covered by this part.
This part describes the license requirements and the licensing policies
for all the ``Reasons for Control'' that are listed on the Commerce
Control List (CCL) except ``Short Supply'' and ``U.N. Sanctions,''
which do not appear on the Country Chart.
    (1) Short Supply. ECCNs containing items subject to short supply
controls (``SS'') refer the exporter to part 754 of the EAR. These
ECCNs are: 0A980 (Horses for export by sea); 1C980 (certain inorganic
chemicals); 1C981 (Crude petroleum, including reconstituted crude
petroleum, tar sands, and crude shale oil); 1C982 (certain other
petroleum products); 1C983 (Natural gas liquids and other natural gas
derivatives); 1C984 (certain manufactured gas and synthetic natural gas
(except when commingled with natural gas and thus subject to export
authorization from the Department of Energy); and 1C988 (Western red
cedar (thuja plicata) logs and timber, and rough, dressed and worked
lumber containing wane).
    (2) U.N. Sanctions. The United Nations imposes sanctions, short of
complete embargoes, against certain countries which may result in
controls that supplement those otherwise maintained under the EAR for
that particular country. This part does not address license
requirements and licensing policies for controls implementing U.N.
sanctions. CCL entries containing items subject to U.N. sanctions will
refer the exporter to part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special
Controls, for any supplemental controls that may apply to exports and
reexports involving these countries.
    (c) Exports and reexports involving Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Iraq,
Iran, and the Bosnian Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This
part does not cover license requirements and licensing policies that
apply to exports and reexports to embargoed destinations (Cuba, Libya,
North Korea, Iraq, Iran and the Bosnian-Serb controlled areas of
Bosnia-Herzegovina). These comprehensive embargoes cover a broader
range of items than those reflected in the CCL. If you are exporting or
reexporting to any of these destinations, you should first review part
746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls.
    (d) Anti-terrorism Controls on Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq, North
Korea, Sudan and Syria. Commerce maintains anti-terrorism controls on
Iran, Syria and Sudan under section 6(a) of the Export Administration
Act. Items controlled under section 6(a) to these three countries are
described in Supplement No. 2 to part 742. Commerce also maintains
controls under EAA section 6(j) of the EAA to Cuba, Libya, Iraq, Iran,
North Korea, Sudan and Syria. Items controlled to these seven countries
under EAA section 6(j) are also described in Supplement 2 to part 742.
The Secretaries of Commerce and State are required to notify
appropriate Committees of the Congress 30 days before issuing a license
for an item controlled under section 6(j) to Cuba, Libya, North Korea,
Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria. As noted in paragraph (c) of this section,
if you are exporting or reexporting to Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq and
North Korea, you should review Part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other
Special Controls.
    (e) End-user and end-use based controls. This part does not cover
prohibitions and licensing requirements for exports of items not
included on the

[[Page 12787]]
CCL that are subject to end-use and end-user controls: certain nuclear
end-uses; certain missile end-uses; certain chemical and biological
weapons end-uses; certain naval nuclear propulsion end-uses; certain
activities of U.S. persons; certain exports to and for the use of
certain foreign vessels or aircraft; and certain exports to all
countries for Libyan aircraft. Licensing requirements and policies for
these exports are contained in part 744 of the EAR.
    (f) Overlapping license policies. Many items on the CCL are subject
to more than one type of control (e.g., national security (NS), missile
technology (MT), nuclear nonproliferation (NP), regional stability
(RS)). In addition, applications for all items on the CCL, other than
those controlled for short supply reasons, may be reviewed for missile
technology (see Sec. 742.5(b)(3) of this part), nuclear
nonproliferation (see Sec. 742.3(b)(2) of this part), or chemical and
biological weapons (see Sec. 742.3(b)(3) of this part), if the end-use
or end-user may be involved in certain proliferation activities.
Finally, many multilaterally controlled items are reviewed for anti-
terrorism reasons if they are destined for a terrorism-supporting
country (see paragraph (d) of this section). Your application for a
license will be reviewed under all applicable licensing policies. A
license will be issued only if an application can be approved under all
applicable licensing policies.

Sec. 742.2  Proliferation of chemical and biological weapons.

    (a) License requirements. The following controls are maintained in
support of the U.S. foreign policy of opposing the proliferation and
illegal use of chemical and biological weapons:
    (1) If CB Column 1 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part
738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is
required to all destinations except Canada for the following:
    (i) Human pathogens, zoonoses, toxins, animal pathogens,
genetically modified microorganisms and plant pathogens identified in
ECCNs 1C351, 1C352, 1C353 and 1C354; and
    (ii) Technology (ECCN 1E391) for the production and/or disposal of
microbiological commodities described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this
section.
    (2) If CB Column 2 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part
738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is
required to all destinations except countries in Country Group A:3 (see
Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) (Australia Group members) for
the following:
    (i) Chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350 (precursor and intermediate
chemicals used in the production of chemical warfare agents).
    (A) This licensing requirement includes chemical mixtures
containing any chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, except as specified
in Note 2 to that ECCN.
    (B) This licensing requirement does not include chemical compounds
created with any chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, unless those
compounds are also identified in ECCN 1C350.
    (ii) Software (ECCN 1D390) for process control that is specifically
configured to control or initiate production of the chemical precursors
controlled by ECCN 1C350.
    (iii) Technology (ECCN 1E390) for the production and/or disposal of
chemical precursors described in ECCN 1C350, and technology involving
the following for facilities designed or intended to produce chemicals
described in ECCN 1C350:
    (A) Overall plant design;
    (B) Design, specification, or procurement of equipment;
    (C) Supervision of construction, installation, or operation of
complete plant or components thereof;
    (D) Training of personnel; or
    (E) Consultation on specific problems involving such facilities.
    (3) If CB Column 3 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part
738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is
required to Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the
EAR) for the following:
    (i) Equipment and materials identified in ECCNs 2B350 and 2B351 on
the CCL, which can be used in the production of chemical weapons
precursors or chemical warfare agents, and equipment and materials
identified in ECCN 2B352, which can be used in the production of
biological agents; and
    (ii) Technology (ECCN 2E301) for production of the commodities
covered in ECCNs 2B350, 2B351, 2B352, 2B353 and 2B354.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) License applications for the items
described in paragraph (a) of this section will be considered on a
case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport would
make a material contribution to the design, development, production,
stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons. When an export
or reexport is deemed to make such a contribution, the license will be
denied.
    (2) The following factors are among those that will be considered
to determine what action should be taken on individual license
applications:
    (i) The specific nature of the end-use;
    (ii) The significance of the export and reexport in terms of its
contribution to the design, development, production, stockpiling, or
use of chemical or biological weapons;
    (iii) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country;
    (iv) The types of assurances or guarantees against design,
development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological
weapons that are given in a particular case; and
    (v) The existence of a pre-existing contract.
    (3) BXA will review license applications in accordance with the
licensing policy described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for
items not described in paragraph (a) of this section that:
    (i) Require a license for reasons other than short supply;
    (ii) Are destined to any country except countries in Country Group
A:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) (Australia Group
members); and
    (iii) Could be destined for the design, development, production,
stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons, or for a
facility engaged in such activities.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity dates are set forth in
Supplement No. 1 to part 742. Applicants who wish that a preexisting
contract be considered in reviewing their license applications must
submit documentation sufficient to establish the existence of such a
contract.
    (d) Australia Group. The Australia Group, a multilateral body that
works to halt the spread of chemical and biological weapons, has
developed common control lists of items specifically related to
chemical and biological weapons. Australia Group members are listed in
Country Group A:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
Controls on items listed in paragraph (a) of this section are
consistent with lists agreed to in the Australia Group.

Sec. 742.3  Nuclear nonproliferation.

    (a) License requirements. Section 309(c) of the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Act of 1978 requires BXA to identify items subject to the
EAR that could be of significance for nuclear explosive purposes if
used for activities other than those authorized at the time of export
or reexport. ECCNs on the CCL that include the symbol ``NP 1'' or ``NP
2'' in the ``Country Chart'' column of the ``License Requirements''
section identify items that could be of significance for nuclear
explosive purposes and are therefore subject to licensing

[[Page 12788]]
requirements under this part and under section 309(c) of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. These items are referred to as ``The
Nuclear Referral List'' and are subject to the following licensing
requirements:
    (1) If NP Column 1 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part
738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is
required to all destinations except Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)
member countries (Country Group A:4) (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740
of the EAR).
    (2) If NP Column 2 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part
738 of the EAR) is indicated in the applicable ECCN, a license is
required to Country Group D:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the
EAR).
    (3) Other nuclear-related license requirements are described in
Secs. 744.2 and 744.5 of the EAR.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) To implement the controls in paragraph
(a) of this section, the following factors are among those used to
determine what action should be taken on individual applications:
    (i) Whether the items to be transferred are appropriate for the
stated end-use and whether that stated end-use is appropriate for the
end-user;
    (ii) The significance for nuclear purposes of the particular item;
    (iii) Whether the items to be exported or reexported are to be used
in research on, or for the development, design, manufacture,
construction, operation, or maintenance of, any reprocessing or
enrichment facility;
    (iv) The types of assurances or guarantees given against use for
nuclear explosive purposes or proliferation in the particular case;
    (v) Whether any party to the transaction has been engaged in
clandestine or illegal procurement activities;
    (vi) Whether an application for a license to export or reexport to
the end-user has previously been denied, or whether the end-user has
previously diverted items received under a general license, a License
Exception, or a validated license to unauthorized activities;
    (vii) Whether the export or reexport would present an unacceptable
risk of diversion to a nuclear explosive activity or unsafeguarded
nuclear fuel-cycle activity described in Sec. 744.2(a) of the EAR; and
    (viii) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country,
based on consideration of the following factors:
    (A) Whether the importing country is a party to the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or to the Treaty for the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) or to a similar
international legally-binding nuclear nonproliferation agreement;
    (B) Whether the importing country has all of its nuclear
activities, facilities, or installations that are operational, being
designed, or under construction under International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) safeguards or equivalent full scope safeguards;
    (C) Whether there is an agreement for cooperation in the civil uses
of atomic energy between the U.S. and the importing country;
    (D) Whether the actions, statements, and policies of the government
of the importing country are in support of nuclear nonproliferation and
whether that government is in compliance with its international
obligations in the field of non-proliferation;
    (E) The degree to which the government of the importing country
cooperates in non-proliferation policy generally (e.g., willingness to
consult on international nonproliferation issues); and
    (F) Information on the importing country's nuclear intentions and
activities.
    (2) In addition, BXA will review license applications in accordance
with the licensing policy described in paragraph (b) of this section
for items not on the Nuclear Referral List that:
    (i) Require a license on the CCL for reasons other than ``short
supply;'' and
    (ii) Are intended for a nuclear related end-use or end-user.
    (3) For the People's Republic of China, the general licensing
policy for applications for those items that would make a direct and
significant contribution to nuclear weapons and their delivery systems
is extended review or denial.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not
available for license applications reviewed under this section.
    (d) Nuclear Suppliers Group. Most items on the Nuclear Referral
List that require a license under NP Column No. 1 on the Country Chart
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) are contained in the
Annex to the ``Guidelines for Transfers of Nuclear-Related Dual-Use
Equipment, Material, and Related Technology'' (the Annex), as published
by the International Atomic Energy Agency in INFCIRC/254/Revision 1/
Part 2. The adherents to INFCIRC/254/Revision 1/Part 2, which includes
the Nuclear Suppliers Guidelines, have agreed to establish export
licensing procedures for the transfer of items identified in the Annex.
Items that are listed as requiring a license under NP Column No. 2 on
the Country Chart (see Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) are not
included in the Annex and are controlled only by the United States.

Sec. 742.4  National security.

    (a) License requirements. It is the policy of the United States to
restrict the export and reexport of items that would make a significant
contribution to the military potential of any other country or
combination of countries that would prove detrimental to the national
security of the United States. Accordingly, a license is required for
exports and reexports to all destinations, except Canada, for all items
in ECCNs on the CCL that include NS Column 1 in the Country Chart
column of the ``License Requirements'' section. A license is required
to all destinations except Country Group A:1 and cooperating countries
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 740) for all items in ECCNs on the CCL
that include NS Column 2 in the Country Chart column of the ``License
Requirements'' section. The purpose of the controls is to ensure that
these items do not make a contribution to the military potential of
countries in Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the
EAR) that would prove detrimental to the national security of the
United States. License Exception GBS is available for the export and
reexport of certain national security controlled items to Country Group
B (see Sec. 740.3(b) and Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) The policy for national security
controlled items exported or reexported to any country except a country
in Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) is
to approve applications unless there is a significant risk that the
items will be diverted to a country in Country Group D:1.
    (2) Except for those countries described in paragraphs (b)(5)
through (b)(7) of this section, the general policy for exports and
reexports of items to Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part
740 of the EAR) is to approve applications when BXA determines, on a
case-by-case basis, that the items are for civilian use or would
otherwise not make a significant contribution to the military potential
of the country of destination that would prove detrimental to the
national security of the United States.
    (3) To permit such policy judgments to be made, each application is
reviewed in the light of prevailing policies with full consideration of
all

[[Page 12789]]
aspects of the proposed transaction. The review generally includes:
    (i) An analysis of the kinds and quantities of items to be shipped;
    (ii) Their military or civilian uses;
    (iii) The unrestricted availability abroad of the same or
comparable items;
    (iv) The country of destination;
    (v) The ultimate end-users in the country of destination; and
    (vi) The intended end-use.
    (4) Although each proposed transaction is considered individually,
items described in Advisory Notes on the Commerce Control List are more
likely to be approved than others.
    (5) In recognition of efforts made to adopt safeguard measures for
exports and reexports, Bulgaria, Latvia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania,
Mongolia, and Russia are accorded enhanced favorable consideration
licensing treatment.
    (6) The general policy for Cambodia and Laos is to approve license
applications when BXA determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the
items are for an authorized use in Cambodia or Laos and are not likely
to be diverted to another country or use contrary to the national
security or foreign policy controls of the United States.
    (7) For the People's Republic of China, the general licensing
policy is to approve applications, except that those items that would
make a direct and significant contribution to electronic and anti-
submarine warfare, intelligence gathering, power projection, and air
superiority receive extended review or denial. Each application will be
considered individually. Items may be approved even though they may
contribute to Chinese military development or the end-user or end-use
is military. Note that the Advisory Notes in the CCL headed ``Note for
the People's Republic of China'' provide guidance on equipment likely
to be approved more rapidly for China.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not
available for license applications reviewed under this section.
    (d) [Reserved]

Sec. 742.5  Missile technology.

    (a) License requirements. (1) In support of U.S. foreign policy to
limit the proliferation of missiles, a license is required to export
and reexport items related to the design, development, production, or
use of missiles. These items are identified in ECCNs on the CCL as MT
Column No. 1 in the Country Chart column of the ``License
Requirements'' section. Licenses for these items are required to all
destinations, except Canada, as indicated by MT Column 1 of the Country
Chart (see Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).
    (2) The term ``missiles'' is defined as rocket systems (including
ballistic missile systems, space launch vehicles, and sounding rockets)
and unmanned air vehicle systems (including cruise missile systems,
target drones, and reconnaissance drones) capable of delivering at
least 500 kilograms (kg) payload to a range of at least 300 kilometers
(km).
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) Applications to export and reexport items
identified in ECCNs on the CCL as MT Column No. 1 in the Country Chart
column of the ``License Requirements'' section will be considered on a
case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport would
make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles.
Applications for exports and reexports of such items contained in
Category 7A or described by ECCN 9A101 on the CCL will be considered
more favorably if such exports or reexports are determined to be
destined to a manned aircraft, satellite, land vehicle, or marine
vessel, in quantities appropriate for replacement parts for such
applications. When an export or reexport is deemed to make a material
contribution to the proliferation of missiles, the license will be
denied.
    (2) The following factors are among those that will be considered
in reviewing individual applications.
    (i) The specific nature of the end-use;
    (ii) The significance of the export and reexport in terms of its
contribution to the design, development, production, or use of
missiles;
    (iii) The capabilities and objectives of the missile and space
programs of the recipient country;
    (iv) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country;
    (v) The types of assurances or guarantees against design,
development, production, or use of missiles that are given in a
particular case; and
    (vi) The existence of a preexisting contract.
    (3) Controls on other items. BXA will review license applications,
in accordance with the licensing policy described in paragraph (b)(1)
of this section, for items not described in paragraph (a) of this
section that:
    (i) Require a validated license for reasons other than short
supply; and
    (ii) Could be destined for the design, development, production, or
use of missiles, or for a facility engaged in such activities.
    (c) Contract sanctity. The following contract sanctity dates have
been established:
    (1) License applications for batch mixers specified in ECCN 1B115.a
involving contracts that were entered into prior to January 19, 1990,
will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
    (2) License applications subject to ECCN 1B115.b or .c that involve
a contract entered into prior to March 7, 1991, will be considered on a
case-by-case basis.
    (3) Applicants who wish that a pre-existing contract be considered
in reviewing their license applications must submit documentation
sufficient to establish the existence of a contract.
    (d) Missile Technology Control Regime. Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR) members are listed in Country Group A:2 (see Supplement
No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). Controls on items identified in
paragraph (a) of this section are consistent with the list agreed to in
the MTCR and included in the MTCR Annex.

Sec. 742.6  Regional stability.

    (a) License requirements. The following controls are maintained in
support of U.S. foreign policy to maintain regional stability:
    (1) As indicated in the CCL and in RS Column 1 of the Country Chart
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR), a license is required to
all destinations, except Canada, for items described on the CCL under
ECCNs 6A002.a.1, a.2, a.3, or .c; 6A003.b.3 and b.4; 6D102 (only
software for development of items in 6A002.a.1, a.2, a.3 or .c); 6E001
(only technology for development of items in 6A002.a.1, a.2, a.3, and
.c, or 6A003.b.3 and b.4); 6E002 (only technology for production of
items in 6A002.a.1, a.2, a.3, or .c, or 6A003.b.3 or b.4); 7D001 (only
software for development or production of items in 7A001, 7A002, or
7A003); 7E001 (only technology for the development of inertial
navigation systems, inertial equipment, and specially designed
components therefor for civil aircraft); 7E002 (only technology for the
production of inertial navigation systems, inertial equipment, and
specially designed components therefor for civil aircraft).
    (2) As indicated in the CCL and in RS Column 2 of the Country Chart
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR), a license is required to
any destination except countries in Country Group A:1 (see Supplement
No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), Iceland and New Zealand for military
vehicles and certain commodities (specially designed) used to
manufacture military equipment, described on the CCL in ECCNs 0A018.c,
1B018.a, 2B018, and 9A018.a and .b.

[[Page 12790]]

    (b) Licensing policy. (1) Applications to export and reexport items
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be reviewed on a
case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport could
contribute directly or indirectly to any country's military
capabilities in a manner that would alter or destabilize a region's
military balance contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United
States.
    (2) Applications to export and reexport commodities described in
paragraph (a)(2) of this section will generally be considered favorably
on a case-by-case basis unless there is evidence that the export or
reexport would contribute significantly to the destabilization of the
region to which the equipment is destined.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not
available for license applications reviewed under this section.
    (d) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation
from like-minded countries in maintaining regional stability controls,
at this time these controls are maintained only by the United States.

Sec. 742.7  Crime control.

    (a) License requirements. In support of U.S. foreign policy to
promote the observance of human rights throughout the world, a license
is required to export and reexport crime control and detection
equipment, related technology and software as follows:
    (1) Crime control and detection instruments and equipment and
related technology and software identified in the appropriate ECCNs on
the CCL under CC Column No. 1 in the Country Chart column of the
``License Requirements'' section. A license is required to countries
listed in CC Column 1 (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR). Items
affected by this requirement are identified on the CCL under the
following ECCNs: 0A982, 0A984, 0A985, 0E984, 1A984, 3A980, 3A981,
3D980, 3E980, 4A003 (fingerprint computers only), 4A980, 4D001 (for
fingerprint computers only), 4D980, 4E001 (for fingerprint computers
only); 4E980, 6A002 (police-model infrared viewers only), 6E001 (for
police-model infrared viewers only), 6E002 (for police-model infrared
viewers only), and 9A980.
    (2) Shotguns with a barrel length of 24 inches or more identified
in ECCN 0A984 on the CCL under CC Column No. 2 in the Country Chart
column of the ``License Requirements'' section regardless of end-user
to countries listed in CC Column 2 (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the
EAR).
    (3) Shotguns with barrel length over 24 inches, identified in ECCN
0A984 on the CCL under CC Column No. 3 in the Country Chart column of
the ``License Requirements'' only if for sale or resale to police or
law enforcement entities to countries listed in CC Column 3 (Supplement
No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).
    (b) Licensing policy. Applications for items controlled under this
section will generally be considered favorably on a case-by-case basis
unless there is evidence that the government of the importing country
may have violated internationally recognized human rights and that the
judicious use of export controls would be helpful in deterring the
development of a consistent pattern of such violations or in distancing
the United States from such violations.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not
available for license applications reviewed under this section.
    (d) U.S. controls . Although the United States seeks cooperation
from like-minded countries in maintaining controls on crime control and
detection items, at this time these controls are maintained only by the
United States.

Sec. 742.8  Anti-Terrorism: Iran.

    (a) License requirements. (1) If AT column 1 or AT column 2 of the
Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to Part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in
the appropriate ECCN, a license is required for export to Iran for
anti-terrorism purposes. In addition, portable electric power
generators and related software and technology (ECCNs 2A994, 2D994 and
2E994) are controlled for export to Iran for anti-terrorism purposes.
See paragraph (a)(5) of this section for controls maintained by the
Department of the Treasury.
    (2) If AT column 1 or AT column 2 of the Country Chart (Supplement
No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a
license is required for reexport to Iran for anti-terrorism purposes,
except for ECCNs 2A994, 3A993, 5A992, 5A995, 6A990, 6A994, 7A994,
8A992, 8A994, 9A990, 9A992 and 9A994. In addition, items in these ECCNs
are not counted as controlled U.S. content for the purpose of
determining license requirements for U.S. parts, components or
materials incorporated into foreign-made products. However, the export
from the United States to any destination with knowledge that they will
be reexported directly or indirectly, in whole or in part to Iran is
prohibited without a license. See Sec. 740.9 of the EAR for additional
information. See paragraph (a)(5) of this section for controls
maintained by the Department of the Treasury.
    (3) The Secretary of State has designated Iran as a country whose
Government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international
terrorism.
    (4) In support of U.S. foreign policy on terrorism-supporting
countries, BXA maintains two types of anti-terrorism controls on the
export and reexport of items described in Supplement 2 to part 742.
    (i) Items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of
Supplement No. 2 to part 742 are controlled under section 6(j) of the
Export Administration Act, as amended (EAA), if destined to military,
police, intelligence or other sensitive end-users.
    (ii) Items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of
Supplement No. 2 to part 742 destined to non-sensitive end-users, as
well as items described in paragraphs (c)(6) through (c)(39) to all
end-users, are controlled to Iran under section 6(a) of the EAA. (See
Supplement No. 2 to part 742 for more information on items controlled
under sections 6(a) and 6(j) of the EAA and Sec. 750.6 of the EAR for
procedures for processing license applications for items controlled
under EAA section 6(j).)
    (5) Exports and certain reexports to Iran are subject to a
comprehensive embargo administered by the Department of the Treasury's
Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). If you wish to export or
reexport to Iran, the Government of Iran or any entity owned or
controlled by that Government, you should review part 746 of the EAR
and consult with OFAC. Please note that authorization from OFAC
constitutes authorization under the EAR and no separate license or
authorization from BXA is required.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) The Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act
of October 23, 1992, requires BXA to deny licenses for items controlled
to Iran for national security (section 5 of the 1979 EAA) or foreign
policy reasons (section 6 of the 1979 EAA), absent contract sanctity or
a Presidential waiver. License applications for which contract sanctity
is established may be considered under policies in effect prior to the
enactment of that Act. Otherwise, licenses for such items to Iran are
subject to a general policy of denial.
    (2) License applications for items controlled under section 6(a) of
the EAA will also be reviewed to determine whether requirements of
section 6(j) apply. Whenever the Secretary of State determines that an
export or reexport could make a significant contribution to the
military potential of Iran, including

[[Page 12791]]
its military logistics capability, or could enhance Iran's ability to
support acts of international terrorism, the Secretaries of State and
Commerce will notify the Congress 30 days prior to the issuance of a
license.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity dates and related policies
for Iran are listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 742. Applicants who
wish a pre-existing contract to be considered must submit sufficient
evidence to establish the existence of a contract.
    (d) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation
from like-minded countries in maintaining anti-terrorism controls, at
this time these controls are maintained only by the United States.

Sec. 742.9  Anti-terrorism: Syria.

    (a) License requirements. (1) If AT Column 1 of the Country Chart
(Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in the
appropriate ECCN, a license is required for export and reexport to
Syria for anti-terrorism purposes.
    (2) The Secretary of State has designated Syria as a country whose
government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international
terrorism.
    (3) In support of U.S. foreign policy against terrorism, BXA
maintains two types of anti-terrorism controls on the export and
reexport to Syria of items described in Supplement No. 2 to part 742.
    (i) Items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of
Supplement No. 2 to part 742, if destined to military, police,
intelligence or other end-users in Syria, are controlled under section
6(j) of the Export Administration Act, as amended (EAA).
    (ii) Items listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of Supplement
No. 2 to part 742 destined to other end-users in Syria, as well as
items to all end-users listed in (c)(6) through (c)(8), (c)(10) through
(c)(14), (c)(16) through (c)(19), and (c)(22) through (c)(39) of
Supplement No. 2 to part 742, are controlled to Syria under section
6(a) of the EAA.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) Applications for export and reexport to
all end-users in Syria of the following items will generally be denied:
    (i) Items that are controlled for chemical and biological weapons
proliferation reasons to any destination. These are items that contain
CB Column 1, CB Column 2, or CB Column 3 in the Country Chart column of
the ``License Requirements'' section of an ECCN on the CCL.
    (ii) Military-related items controlled for national security
reasons to any destination. These are items that contain NS Column 1 in

and related spare parts and components. These are items controlled to
any destination for national security reasons and items controlled to
Syria for anti-terrorism purposes. Such items contain an NS Column 1,
NS Column 2, or AT Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the
``License Requirements'' section of an ECCN on the CCL. Note that,
consistent with the general rule that applies to computing U.S. parts
and components content incorporated in foreign made products, all
aircraft-related items that require a license to Syria will be included
as controlled US content for purposes of such license requirements.
    (v) Cryptographic, cryptoanalytic, and cryptologic items controlled
to any destination for national security reasons. Such items contain an
AT Column 1 and an NS Column 1 or NS Column 2 in the Country Chart
column of the ``License Requirements'' section of an ECCN on the CCL.
    (vi) Explosive device detectors controlled under ECCN 2A993.
    (2) Applications for export and reexport to Syria of all other
items described in paragraph (a) of this section, and not described by
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, will generally be denied if the
export or reexport is destined to a military end-user or for military
end-use. Applications for non-military end-users or for non-military
end-uses will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2),
of this section, applications for Syria will be considered on a case-
by-case basis if:
    (i) The transaction involves the reexport to Syria of items where
Syria was not the intended ultimate destination at the time of original
export from the United States, provided that the exports from the U.S.
occurred prior to the applicable contract sanctity date (or, where the
contract sanctity date is December 16, 1986, prior to June 18, 1987).
    (ii) The U.S. content of foreign-produced commodities is 20% or
less by value; or
    (iii) The commodities are medical items.

    Note to paragraph (b) of this section: Applicants who wish any
of the factors described in paragraph (b) of this section to be
considered in reviewing their license applications must submit
adequate documentation demonstrating the value of the U.S. content,
the specifications and medical use of the equipment, or the date of
export from the United States.

    (4) License applications for items reviewed under 6(a) controls
will also be reviewed to determine the applicability of 6(j) controls
to the transaction. When it is determined that an export or reexport
could make a significant contribution to the military potential of
Syria, including its military logistics capability, or could enhance
Syria's ability to support acts of international terrorism, the
Secretaries of State and Commerce will notify the Congress 30 days
prior to issuance of a license.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity dates and related
licensing policies for Syria are set forth in Supplement No. 2 to part
742. Applicants who wish a pre-existing contract to be considered must
submit sufficient documentation to establish the existence of a
contract.
    (d) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation
from like-minded countries in maintaining anti-terrorism controls, at
this time these controls are maintained only by the United States.

Sec. 742.10  Anti-terrorism: Sudan.

    (a) License requirements. (1) If AT column 1 or AT column 2 <SUP>1
of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is
indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is required for export to
Sudan for anti-terrorism purposes.

    \1\ AT column 1 refers to items controlled to Iran, Sudan, and
Syria for anti-terrorism purposes. AT column 2 refers to additional
items controlled to Iran and Sudan for anti-terrorism purposes. In
addition, items included in ECCNs 2A994, 2D994 and 2E994 are
controlled to Iran for anti-terrorism purposes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) If AT column 1 or AT column 2 of the Country Chart (Supplement
No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a

except for ECCNs 2A994, 3A993, 5A992, 5A995, 6A990, 6A994, 7A994,
8A992, 8A994, 9A990, 9A992 and 9A994. In addition, items in these ECCNs
are not counted as controlled U.S. content for the purpose

[[Page 12792]]

of determining license requirements for U.S. parts, components or
materials incorporated into foreign made products. However, the export
from the United States to any destination with knowledge that they will
be reexported directly or indirectly, in whole or in part to Sudan is
prohibited without a license. See Sec. 740.9 of the EAR for additional
information.
    (3) The Secretary of State has designated Sudan as a country whose
government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international

to the transaction. When it is determined that an export or reexport
could make a significant contribution to the military potential of
Sudan, including its military logistics capability, or could enhance
Sudan's ability to support acts of international terrorism, the
appropriate committees of the Congress will be notified 30 days before
issuance of a license to export or reexport such items.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity dates and related
licensing information for Sudan are set forth in Supplement No. 2 to
part 742. Applicants who wish a pre-existing contract to be considered
must submit sufficient documentation to establish the existence of a
contract.
    (d) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation
from like-minded countries in maintaining anti-terrorism controls, at
this time these controls are maintained only by the United States.

Sec. 742.11  Specially designed implements of torture.

    (a) License requirements. In support of U.S. foreign policy to
promote the observance of human rights throughout the world, a license
is required to export specially designed implements of torture
controlled by 0A983 to all destinations, including Canada.
    (b) Licensing policy. Applications for such licenses will generally
be denied to all destinations.
    (c) Contract sanctity. The contract sanctity date is November 9,
1995. Contract sanctity will be a factor in considering only
applications for export to the NATO countries, Japan, Australia, and
New Zealand.
    (d) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation
from like-minded countries in maintaining controls on implements of
torture, at this time these controls are maintained only by the United
States.

Sec. 742.12  High performance computers.

    (a) License and recordkeeping requirements. (1) This section
contains special provisions for exports, reexports, and certain intra-
country transfers of high performance computers, including software,
and technology. This section affects the following ECCNs: 4A001, 4A002,
4A003, 4D001, 4D002, and 4E001. It applies to computers with a
Composite Theoretical Performance (CTP) greater than 2000, stated in
Million Theoretical Operations Per Second (MTOPS). Licenses are
required under this section for ECCN's having an ``XP'' under ``Reason
for Control'' when License Exception CTP is not available (see
Sec. 740.3(e) of the EAR). License requirements reflected in this
section are based on particular destinations, end-users, or end-uses.
For the calculation of CTP, see the Technical Note that follows the
Advisory Notes for Category 4 in the Commerce Control List. Note that
License Exception CTP contains restrictions on access by nationals of
certain countries, and on reexports and transfers of computers.

[[Page 12793]]

    (2) In recognition of the strategic and proliferation significance
of high performance computers, a license is required for the export or
reexport of high performance computers to destinations, end-users, and
end-uses, as specified in this section and on the CCL. These license
requirements supplement requirements that apply for other control
reasons, such as nuclear nonproliferation provided in Sec. 742.3 of the
EAR. The license requirements described in this Sec. 742.12 are not
reflected on the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the
EAR). Four Computer Country Tiers have been established for the
purposes of these controls. Countries included in Computer Tiers 1, 2,
and 3 are listed in License Exception CTP in Sec. 740.3(e) of the EAR.
Computer Tier 4 consists of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea,
Sudan, and Syria.
    (3) Exporters must keep accurate records of each export to any
destination of a computer with a CTP equal to or greater than 2,000
MTOPS, irrespective of whether the export is made under License
Exception or otherwise. These records will be made available to the
U.S. Government upon request. The records will include the following
information:
    (i) Date of shipment;
    (ii) Name and address of the end-user and each intermediate
consignee;
    (iii) CTP of each computer in shipment;
    (iv) Volume of computers in shipment;
    (v) Dollar value of shipment; and
    (vi) End-Use.
    (4) Exporters are hereby notified that consistent with the
commitments reached with the Wassenaar Arrangement, exporters will be
required to submit to BXA consolidated reports on exports to certain
destinations every six months of computers with a CTP equal to or
greater than 2,000 MTOPS. These reports will include for each such
export all the information required to be kept pursuant to paragraph
(3) of Sec. 742.12(a). Exports of computers above 2,000 MTOPS to
certain destinations will be subject to the reporting requirement once
the initial elements of the Wassenaar Arrangement are adopted, and the
first report will be due thereafter.
    (b) Licensing policy. Licensing policies described in this section
vary according to the country of destination, and the end-use or end-
user involved in the transaction. Note that in addition, license
applications for items covered by Sec. 742.12 will also be reviewed
under the nuclear nonproliferation licensing policy in Sec. 742.3(b).
In certain cases, licenses may be subject to safeguard conditions. The
specific conditions that may be imposed by BXA will depend on the
country of destination, and the end-use or end-user of the export. BXA
may also require end-use certification which, in appropriate cases, is
certified by the government of the importing country. The range of
possible safeguard conditions and related information are provided in
Supplement No. 3 to part 742.
    (1) Computer Tier 1.
    (i) License requirement. No license is required under this
Sec. 742.12 for exports or reexports of computers to and among
countries listed in Computer Tier 1, for consumption in such countries

    (ii) Licensing policy. A license is not required under this
Sec. 742.12.
    (2) Computer Tier 2.
    (i) License requirement. A license is required to export or
reexport a computer having a Composite Theoretical Performance (CTP)
greater than 10,000 Millions of Theoretical Operations Per Second
(MTOPS) to a country in Computer Tier 2.
    (ii) Licensing policy. License applications for a country in
Computer Tier 2 will generally be approved.
    (3) Computer Tier 3.
    (i) License requirement.
    (A) A license is required to export or reexport computers with a
CTP greater than 2,000 MTOPS to countries in Computer Tier 3 to
military end-users and end-uses and to nuclear, chemical, biological,
or missile end-users and end-uses defined in part 744 of the EAR in
Computer Tier 3 countries.
    (B) A license is required to export or reexport computers with a
CTP greater than 7,000 MTOPS to all end-users and end-uses located in
countries in Computer Tier 3.
    (ii) Licensing policy. License applications for exports and
reexports to military end-users and end-uses and nuclear, chemical,
biological, or missile end-users and end-uses defined in part 744 of
the EAR in countries in Computer Tier 3 will be reviewed on a case-by-
case basis using the following criteria:
    (A) The presence and activities of countries and end-users of
national security and proliferation concern and the relationships that
exist between the government of the importing country and such
countries and end-users;
    (B) The ultimate consignee's participation in, or support of, any
of the following:
    (1) Activities that involve national security concerns; or
    (2) Nuclear, chemical, biological or missile proliferation
activities described in part 744 of the EAR;
    (C) The extent to which the importing country is involved in
nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile proliferation activities
described in part 744 of the EAR;
    (D) The end-user, whether the end-use is single-purpose or
multiple-purpose.
    (iii) Licensing policy for other end-uses and end-users. License
applications for exports and reexports to other end-users and end-uses
located in countries in Computer Tier 3 will generally be approved.
    (4) Computer Tier 4.
    (i) License requirement. A license is required to export or
reexport any items covered by this section to a country in Country Tier
4.
    (ii) Licensing policy. The licensing policies for countries in
Computer Tier 4 are the same as described in the following EAR
sections: for Sudan see Sec. 742.10(b); for Syria see Sec. 742.9(b);
for Cuba see Sec. 746.2; for Iran see Sec. 746.7; for Iraq see
Sec. 746.3; for Libya see Sec. 746.4; and for North Korea see
Sec. 746.5.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not
available for license applications involving exports and reexports of
high performance computers.
    (d) High performance computer regime. The United States and Japan
participate in a high performance computer regime. Other countries are
expected to join. The regime provides uniform and effective safeguards
to protect high performance computers from unauthorized destinations,
end-users and end-uses.

Sec. 742.13  Communications intercepting devices.

    (a) License requirement. (1) As set forth in ECCN 5A980, a license
is required for the export or reexport to any destination, including
Canada, of any electronic, mechanical, or other device primarily useful
for surreptitious interception of wire or oral communications. This
control implements a provision of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe
Streets Act of 1968 (Public Law 90-361). This license requirement is
not reflected on the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the
EAR).
    (2) Communications intercepting devices are electronic, mechanical,
or other devices that can be used for interception of wire or oral
communications if their design renders them primarily useful for
surreptitious listening even though they may also have innocent uses. A
device is not restricted merely because it is small or

[[Page 12794]]
may be adapted to wiretapping or eavesdropping. Some examples of
devices to which these restrictions apply are: the martini olive
transmitter; the infinity transmitter; the spike mike; and the
disguised microphone appearing as a wristwatch, cufflink, or cigarette
pack; etc. The restrictions do not apply to devices such as the
parabolic microphone or other directional microphones ordinarily used
by broadcasters at sports events, since these devices are not primarily
useful for surreptitious listening.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) License applications will generally be
approved for:
    (i) A provider of wire or electronic communication services or an
officer, agent, or employee of, or person under contract with, such a
provider in the normal course of the business of providing that wire or
electronic communication service; and
    (ii) Officers, agents, or employees of, or person under contract
with the United States, one of the 50 States, or a political
subdivision thereof, when engaged in the normal course of government
activities.
    (2) Other applications will generally be denied.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not
available for license applications involving exports and reexports of
communications interception devices.
    (d) U.S. controls. Controls on this equipment are maintained by the
United States government in accordance with the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act of 1968.

Supplement No. 2 to Part 742--Anti-Terrorism Controls; Iran, Syria, and
Sudan Contract Sanctity Dates and Related Policies

    Note: Exports and reexports of items in performance of contracts
entered into before the applicable contract sanctity date(s) will be
eligible for review on a case-by-case basis or other applicable
licensing policies that were in effect prior to the contract
sanctity date. The contract sanctity dates set forth in this
Supplement are for the guidance of exporters. Contract sanctity
dates are established in the course of the imposition of foreign
policy controls on specific items and are the relevant dates for the
purpose of licensing determinations involving such items. If you
believe that a specific contract sanctity date is applicable to your
transaction, you should include all relevant information with your
license application. BXA will determine any applicable contract
sanctity date at the time an application with relevant supporting
documents is submitted.

    (a) Terrorist-supporting countries. The Secretary of State has
designated Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria as
countries whose governments have repeatedly provided support for
acts of international terrorism under section 6(j) of the Export
Administration Act (EAA).
    (b) Items controlled under EAA sections 6(j) and 6(a). Whenever
the Secretary of State determines that an export or reexport to any
of these countries could make a significant contribution to the
military potential of such country, including its military logistics
capability, or could enhance the ability of such country to support
acts of international terrorism, the item is subject to mandatory
control under section EAA 6(j) and the Secretaries of Commerce and
State are required to notify appropriate Committees of the Congress
30 days before a license for such an item may be issued.
    (1) On December 28, 1993, the Secretary of State determined that
the export to Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan or Syria
of items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this
Supplement, if destined to military, police, intelligence or other
sensitive end-users, are controlled under EAA section 6(j).
Therefore, the 30-day advance Congressional notification requirement
applies to the export or reexport of these items to sensitive end-
users in any of these countries.
    (2) License applications for items controlled to designated
terrorist-supporting countries under EAA section 6(a) will also be
reviewed to determine whether the Congressional notification
requirements of EAA section 6(j) apply.
    (3) Items controlled for anti-terrorism reasons under section
6(a) to Iran, Sudan and Syria are:

[[Page 12795]]

    (i) items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) to non-
sensitive end-users, and
    (ii) the following items to all end-users: for Iran, items in
paragraphs (c)(6) through (c)(39) of this Supplement; for Sudan,
items in paragraphs (c)(6) through (c)(14), and (c)(16) through
(c)(39) of this Supplement; for Syria, items in paragraphs (c)(6)
through (c)(8), (c)(10) through (c)(14), (c)(16) through (c)(19),
and (c)(22) through (c)(39) of this Supplement.
    (c) The license requirements and licensing policies for items
controlled for anti-terrorism reasons to Iran, Syria and Sudan are
generally described in Secs. 742.8, 742.9 and 742.10 of this part.
This Supplement provides guidance on licensing policies for Syria
and Sudan and related contract sanctity dates that may be available
for transactions benefitting from pre-existing contracts involving
Syria and Sudan. This supplement also provides information on
licensing policies and contract sanctity dates for Iran. Exporters
are advised that the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets
Control administers a comprehensive trade and investment embargo
against Iran (See Executive Orders 12957 and 12959 of March 15, 1995
and May 6, 1995, respectively.) Exporters are further advised that
exports and reexports to Iran of items that are listed on the CCL as
requiring a license for national security or foreign policy reasons
are subject to a policy of denial under the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-
Proliferation Act of October 23, 1992 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note (1994)).

Supplement No. 3 to Part 742--High Performance Computers; Safeguard
Conditions and Related Information

    This Supplement sets forth the security conditions and safeguard
plans for the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of high
performance computers that may be imposed by BXA to certain
destinations. The licensing policies for the export, reexport, or
in-country transfer of high performance computers are set forth in
Sec. 742.12 of this part.
    (a) Safeguard conditions. Following interagency review of the
application, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) will instruct
the exporter to submit a safeguard plan signed by the ultimate
consignee and certified by the export control authorities of the
importing country (see Certification by export control authorities
of importing country in this Supplement). The safeguard plan must
indicate that the ultimate consignee agrees to implement those
safeguards required by the BXA as a condition of issuing the
license. BXA will inform exporters concerning which of the following
safeguards will be imposed as license conditions:
    (1) The applicant will assume responsibility for providing
adequate security against physical diversion of the computer during
shipment (e.g., delivery by either attended or monitored shipment,
using the most secure route possible--this precludes using the
services or facilities of any country in Computer Tier 4).
    (2) There will be no reexport or intra-country transfer of the
computer without prior written authorization from BXA.
    (3) The computer systems will be used only for those activities
approved on the license or reexport authorization.
    (4) There will be no changes either in the end-users or the end-
uses indicated on the license without prior written authorization by
BXA.
    (5) Only software that supports the approved end-uses will be
shipped with the computer system.
    (6) The end-user will station security personnel at the computer
using facility to ensure that the appropriate security measures are
implemented.
    (7) The exporter will station representatives at the computer
using facility, or make such individuals readily available, to guide
the security personnel in the implementation and operation of the
security measures.
    (8) The security personnel will undertake the following measures
under the guidance of the exporter's representatives:
    (i) The physical security of the computer using facility;
    (ii) The establishment of a system to ensure the round-the-clock
supervision of computer security;
    (iii) The inspection, if necessary, of any program or software
to be run on the computer system in order to ensure that all usage
conforms to the conditions of the license;
    (iv) The suspension, if necessary, of any run in progress and
the inspection of any output generated by the computer to determine
whether the program runs or output conform with the conditions of
the license;
    (v) The inspection of usage logs daily to ensure conformity with
the conditions of the license and the retention of records of these
logs for at least a year;
    (vi) The determination of the acceptability of computer users to
ensure conformity with the conditions of the license;
    (vii) The immediate reporting of any security breaches or
suspected security breaches to the government of the importing
country and to the exporter's representatives;
    (viii) The execution of the following key tasks:

(A) Establishment of new accounts;
(B) Assignment of passwords;
(C) Random sampling of data;
(D) Generation of daily logs;

    (ix) The maintenance of the integrity and security of tapes and
data files containing archived user files, log data, or system
backups.
    (9) The exporter's representatives will be present when certain
key functions are being carried out (e.g., the establishment of new
accounts, the assignment of passwords, the random sampling of data,
the generating of daily logs, the setting of limits to computer
resources available to users in the development mode, the
certification of

[[Page 12801]]
programs for conformity to the approved end-uses before they are
allowed to run in the production mode, and the modification to
previously certified production programs).
    (10) The security personnel and the exporter's representatives
will provide monthly reports on the usage of the computer system and
on the implementation of the safeguards.
    (11) The computer system will be housed in one secure building
and protected against theft and unauthorized entry at all times.
    (12) Restricted nationals, i.e., nationals of Computer Tier 4
countries, will not be allowed access to computers:
    (i) No physical or computational access to computers may be
granted to restricted nationals without prior written authorization
from BXA, except that commercial consignees as described in this
Supplement are prohibited only from giving such nationals user-
accessible programmability without prior written authorization;
    (ii) No passwords or IDs may be issued to restricted nationals;
    (iii) No work may be performed on the computer on behalf of
restricted nationals; and
    (iv) No conscious or direct ties may be established to networks
(including their subscribers) operated by restricted nationals.
    (13) Physical access to the computer, the operator consoles, and
sensitive storage areas of the computer using facility will be
controlled by the security personnel, under the guidance and
monitoring of the exporter's representatives, and will be limited to
the fewest number of people needed to maintain and run the computer
system.
    (14) The computer will be equipped with the necessary software
to: Permit access to authorized persons only, detect attempts to
gain unauthorized access, set and maintain limits on usage,
establish accountability for usage, and generate logs and other
records of usage. This software will also maintain the integrity of
data and program files, the accounting and audit system, the
password or computational access control system, and the operating
system itself.
    (i) The operating system will be configured so that all jobs can
be designated and tracked as either program development jobs or as
production jobs.
    (ii) In the program development mode, users will be free,
following verification that their application conforms to the agreed
end-use, to create, edit, or modify programs, to use utilities such
as editors, debuggers, or compilers and to verify program operation.
Programs in the development mode will be subject to inspection as
provided by paragraph (a)(8)(iii) of this Supplement.
    (iii) In the production mode, users will have access to the full
range of computer resources, but will be prohibited from modifying
any program or using utilities that could modify any program. Before
being allowed to run in the production mode, a program will have to
be certified for conformity to approved end-uses by the security
personnel and the exporter's representatives.
    (iv) Programs certified for execution in the production mode
will be protected from unauthorized modification by appropriate
software and physical security measures. Any modifications to
previously certified production programs will be approved by the
security personnel under the guidance and monitoring of the
exporter's representatives.
    (v) The computer will be provided with accounting and audit
software to ensure that detailed logs are maintained to record all
computer usage. A separate log of security-related events will also
be kept.
    (vi) For each job executed in the production mode, the operating
system will record execution characteristics in order to permit
generation of a statistical profile of the program executed.
    (15) The source code of the operating system will be accessible
only to the exporter's representatives. Only those individuals will
make changes in this source code.
    (16) The security personnel, under the guidance of the
exporter's representatives, will change passwords for individuals
frequently and at unpredictable intervals.
    (17) The security personnel, under the guidance of the
exporter's representatives, will have the right to deny passwords to
anyone. Passwords will be denied to anyone whose activity does not
conform to the conditions of the license.
    (18) Misuse of passwords by users will result in denial of
further access to the computer.
    (19) The exporter's representatives will install a strict
password system and provide guidance on its implementation.
    (20) Only the exporter's representatives will be trained in
making changes in the password system and only they will make such
changes.
    (21) No computer will be networked to other computers outside
the computer center without prior authorization from BXA.
    (22) Generally, remote terminals will not be allowed outside the
computer using facility without prior authorization by BXA. If
remote terminals are specifically authorized by the license:
    (i) The terminals will have physical security equivalent to the
safeguards at the computer using facility;
    (ii) The terminals will be constrained to minimal amounts of
computer resources (CPU time, memory access, number of input-output
operations, and other resources);
    (iii) The terminals will not be allowed direct computational
access to the computer (i.e., the security personnel, under the
guidance of the exporter's representatives, will validate the
password and identity of the user of any remote terminals before any
such user is permitted to access the computer); all terminals will
be connected to the computer system by a dedicated access line and a
network access controller.
    (23) There will be no direct input to the computer from remote
terminals. Any data originating from outside the computer using
facility, except for direct input from terminals within the same
compound as the computer using facility, will first be processed by
a separate processor or network access controller in order to permit
examination of the data prior to its entry into the computer.
    (24) The exporter will perform all maintenance of the computer
system.
    (25) Spare parts kept on site will be limited to the minimum
amount. Spares will be kept in an area accessible only to the
exporter's representatives. These representatives will maintain a
strict audit system to account for all spare parts.
    (26) No development or production technology on the computer
system will be sent with the computer to the ultimate consignee.
    (27) The end-user must immediately report any suspicions or
facts concerning possible violations of the safeguards to the
exporter and to the export control authorities of the importing
country.
    (28) The exporter must immediately report any information
concerning possible violations of the safeguards to BXA. A violation
of the safeguards might constitute grounds for suspension or
termination of the license, preventing the shipment of unshipped
spare parts, or the denial of additional licenses for spare parts,
etc.
    (29) The end-user will be audited quarterly by an independent
consultant who has been approved by the export control authorities
of the importing and exporting countries, but is employed at the
expense of the end-user. The consultant will audit the computer
usage and the implementation of the safeguards.
    (30) The installation and operation of the computer will be
coordinated and controlled by the following management structure:
    (i) Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will comprise
nationals of the importing country who will oversee the management
and operation of the computer.
    (ii) Security Staff. The Security Staff will be selected by the
end-user or the government of the importing country to ensure that
the required safeguards are implemented. This staff will be
responsible for conducting an annual audit to evaluate physical
security, administrative procedures, and technical controls.
    (iii) Technical Consultative Committee. This committee will
comprise technical experts from the importing country and the
exporting company who will provide guidance in operating and
maintaining the computer. At least one member of the committee will
be an employee of the exporter. The committee will approve all
accounts and maintain an accurate list of all users. In addition,
the committee will advise the Steering Committee and the Security
Staff concerning the security measures needed to ensure compliance
with the safeguards required by the license.
    (31) An ultimate consignee who is a multiple-purpose end-user,
such as a university, will establish a peer review group comprising
experts who represent each department or application area authorized
for use on the computer under the conditions of the license. This
group shall have the following responsibilities:
    (i) Review all requests for computer usage and make
recommendations concerning the acceptability of all projects and
users;
    (ii) Submit these recommendations to the Security Staff and
Technical Consultative Committee for review and approval (see
paragraph (a)(28) of this Supplement);
    (iii) Establish acceptable computer resource parameters for each
project and

[[Page 12802]]
review the results to verify their conformity with the authorized
end-uses, restrictions, and parameters; and
    (iv) Prepare monthly reports that would include a description of
any runs exceeding the established parameters and submit them to the
security staff.
    (32) The end-user will also cooperate with any post-shipment
inquiries or inspections by the U.S. Government or exporting company
officials to verify the disposition and/or use of the computer,
including access to the following:
    (i) Usage logs, which should include, at a minimum, computer
users, dates, times of use, and amount of system time used;
    (ii) Computer access authorization logs, which should include,
at a minimum, computer users, project names, and purpose of
projects.
    (33) The end-user will also cooperate with the U.S. Government
or exporting company officials concerning the physical inspection of
the computer using facility, on short notice, at least once a year
and will provide access to all data relevant to computer usage. This
inspection will include:
    (i) Analyzing any programs or software run on the computer to
ensure that all usage complies with the authorized end-uses on the
license. This will be done by examining user files (e.g., source
codes, machine codes, input/output data) that are either on-line at
the time of the inspection or that have been previously sampled and
securely stored.
    (ii) Checking current and archived usage logs for conformity
with the authorized end-uses and the restrictions imposed by the
license.
    (iii) Verifying the acceptability of all computer users in
conformity with the authorized end-uses and the restrictions imposed
by the license.
    (34) Usage requests that exceed the quantity of monthly CPU time
specified on the license shall not be approved without prior written
authorization from the BXA. Requests for computational access
approval shall include a description of the intended purpose for
which access is sought.
    (35) In addition to, or in lieu of, the normal access by on-site
exporting company staff or its representatives, the company, when
required by the exporting government, will provide a separate remote
electronic access capability to the computer for the purposes of
maintenance, troubleshooting, inspection of work in progress, and
auditing of all work performed on the computer. On-site and central
exporting company hardware and software maintenance facilities, at
the direction of the exporting company staff or its representatives,
to gather information such as:
    (i) Statistical profiles of production jobs;
    (ii) Logs of jobs run in both production and development mode;
    (iii) Logs and reports of security related events.
    If such method is used, the remote maintenance facilities will
be considered part of the operating system and protected
accordingly, and will be available only to exporting company
operational staff or its representatives. The maintenance hardware
and software and associated communication links will be protected to
ensure the integrity and authenticity of data and programs and to
prevent tampering with hardware.
    (36) The export company staff or its representatives will be
required to provide personnel for a specified period of time at the
computer facility for management, operation, and safeguarding of the
computer.
    (b) Certification by export control authorities of importing
country.
    (1) The following importing government certification may be
required under Sec. 742.12 of this part:
    This is to certify that (name of ultimate consignee) has
declared to (name of appropriate foreign government agency) that the
computer (model name) will be used only for the purposes specified
in the end-use statement and that the ultimate consignee will
establish and adhere to all the safeguard conditions and perform all
other undertakings described in the end-use statement.
    The (name of appropriate foreign government agency) will advise
the United States Government of any evidence that might reasonably
indicate the existence of circumstances (e.g., transfer of
ownership) that could affect the objectives of the security
safeguard conditions.
    (2) Other importing government assurances regarding prohibited
activities may also be required on a case-by-case basis.
    (c) Commercial consignees.

Sec. 744.1  General provisions.

    (a) Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR are
references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part contains
prohibitions against exports, reexports, and selected transfers to
certain end-users and end-uses as introduced under General Prohibition
Four (Denial Orders) and prohibitions against exports or reexports to
certain end-uses as introduced, under General Prohibition Five (End-
use/End-users). Sections 744.2, 744.3, 744.4, and 744.5 prohibit
exports and reexports of items subject to the EAR to defined nuclear,
missile, chemical and biological weapons, and nuclear maritime end-
uses. Section 744.6 prohibits certain activities by U.S. persons in
support of certain nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological end-uses
regardless of whether that support involves the export or reexport of
items subject to the EAR. Sections 744.7 and 744.8 prohibit exports and
reexports of certain items for certain aircraft and vessels. In
addition, these sections include license review standards for export
license applications submitted as required by these sections. It should
also be noted that part 764 of the EAR prohibits exports, reexports and
certain in-country transfers of items subject to the EAR to denied
parties.
    (b) Steps. The following are steps you should follow in using the
provisions of this part:
    (1) Review end-use and end-user prohibitions. First, review each
end-use and end-user prohibition described in this part to learn the
scope of these prohibitions.
    (2) Determine applicability. Second, determine whether any of the
end-use and end-user prohibitions described in this part are applicable
to your planned export, reexport, or other activity. See Supplement No.
1 to part 732 for guidance.

Sec. 744.2   Restrictions on certain nuclear end-uses.

    (a) General prohibition. In addition to the license requirements
for items

[[Page 12803]]
specified on the CCL, you may not export or reexport to any
destination, other than countries in the Supplement No. 3 to this part,
any item subject to the EAR without a license if at the time of the
export or reexport you know <SUP>1 the item will be used directly or
indirectly in any one or more of the following activities described in
paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section:

    \1\  Part 772 of the EAR defines ``knowledge'' for all of the
EAR except part 760, Restrictive Trade Practices and Boycotts. The
definition, which includes variants such as ``know'' and ``reason to
know'', encompasses more than positive knowledge. Thus, the use of
``know'' in this section in place of the former wording ``know or
have reason to know'' does not lessen or otherwise change the
responsibilities of persons subject to the EAR.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Nuclear explosive activities. Nuclear explosive activities,
including research on or development, design, manufacture,
construction, testing or maintenance of any nuclear explosive device,
or components or subsystems of such a device.\2\ \3\

    \2\ Nuclear explosive devices and any article, material,
equipment, or device specifically designed or specially modified for
use in the design, development, or fabrication of nuclear weapons or
nuclear explosive devices are subject to export licensing or other
requirements of the Office of Defense Trade Controls, U.S.
Department of State, or the licensing or other restrictions
specified in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Similarly,
items specifically designed or specifically modified for use in
devising, carrying out, or evaluating nuclear weapons tests or
nuclear explosions (except such items as are in normal commercial
use for other purposes) are subject to the same requirements.
    \3\ Also see Secs. 744.5 and 748.4 of the EAR for special
provisions relating to technical data for maritime nuclear
propulsion plants and other commodities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Unsafeguarded nuclear activities. Activities including research
on, or development, design, manufacture, construction, operation, or
maintenance of any nuclear reactor, critical facility, facility for the
fabrication of nuclear fuel, facility for the conversion of nuclear
material from one chemical form to another, or separate storage
installation, where there is no obligation to accept International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards at the relevant facility or
installation when it contains any source or special fissionable
material (regardless of whether or not it contains such material at the
time of export), or where any such obligation is not met.
    (3) Safeguarded and unsafeguarded nuclear activities. Safeguarded
and unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle activities, including research on
or development, design, manufacture, construction, operation or
maintenance of any of the following facilities, or components for such
facilities: <SUP>4

    \4\  Such activities may also require a specific authorization
from the Secretary of Energy pursuant to Sec. 57.b.(2) of the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended, as implemented by the Department of
Energy's regulations published in 10 CFR 810.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Facilities for the chemical processing of irradiated special
nuclear or source material;
    (ii) Facilities for the production of heavy water;
    (iii) Facilities for the separation of isotopes of source and
special nuclear material; or
    (iv) Facilities for the fabrication of nuclear reactor fuel
containing plutonium.
    (b) Additional prohibition on exporters or reexporters informed by
BXA. BXA may inform an exporter or reexporter, either individually by
specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is
required for export or reexport of specified items to specified end-
users, because BXA has determined that there is an unacceptable risk of
use in, or diversion to, any of the activities described in paragraph
(a) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the
direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration.
When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written
notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Export Administration. The absence of any such notification does
not excuse the exporter or reexporter from compliance with the license
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Exceptions. Despite the prohibitions described in paragraph (a)
and (b) of this section, you may export technology subject to the EAR
under the License Exception provided in Sec. 740.8(a) of the EAR for
operating technology and software (OTS) and under the License Exception
provided in Sec. 740.8(b) of the EAR for sales technology (STS) but
only to and for use in countries listed in Country Group A:1 (see
Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) and New Zealand. All the terms
and conditions of License Exception 13 apply except that this exception
may only be used for exports to the countries listed in Country Group
A:1 and New Zealand notwithstanding the provisions of part 740 of the
EAR.
    (d) License review standards. The following factors are among those
used by the United States to determine whether to grant or deny license
applications required under this section:
    (1) Whether the commodities, software, or technology to be
transferred are appropriate for the stated end-use and whether that
stated end-use is appropriate for the end-user;
    (2) The significance for nuclear purposes of the particular
commodity, software, or technology;
    (3) Whether the commodities, software, or technology to be exported
are to be used in research on or for the development, design,
manufacture, construction, operation, or maintenance of any
reprocessing or enrichment facility;
    (4) The types of assurances or guarantees given against use for
nuclear explosive purposes or proliferation in the particular case;
    (5) Whether the end-user has been engaged in clandestine or illegal
procurement activities;
    (6) Whether an application for a license to export to the end-user
has previously been denied, or whether the end-use has previously
diverted items received under a license, License Exception, or NLR to
unauthorized activities;
    (7) Whether the export would present an unacceptable risk of
diversion to a nuclear explosive activity or unsafeguarded nuclear
fuel-cycle activity described in Sec. 744.2 of this part; and
    (8) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country,
based on consideration of the following factors:
    (i) Whether the importing country is a party to the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or to the Treaty for the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) (see Supplement
No. 2 to part 742 of the EAR), or to a similar international legally-
binding nuclear nonproliferation agreement;
    (ii) Whether the importing country has all of its nuclear
activities, facilities or installations that are operational, being
designed, or under construction, under International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) safeguards or equivalent full scope safeguards;
    (iii) Whether there is an agreement for cooperation in the civil
uses of atomic energy between the U.S. and the importing country;
    (iv) Whether the actions, statements, and policies of the
government of the importing country are in support of nuclear
nonproliferation and whether that government is in compliance with its
international obligations in the field of nonproliferation;
    (v) The degree to which the government of the importing country
cooperates in nonproliferation policy generally (e.g., willingness to
consult on international nonproliferation issues);
    (vi) Intelligence data on the importing country's nuclear
intentions and activities.

[[Page 12804]]

Sec. 744.3  Restrictions on certain missile end-uses.

    (a) General prohibition. In addition to the license requirements
for items specified on the CCL, you may not export or reexport an item
subject to the EAR to any destination, including Canada, without a
license if at the time of the export or reexport you know the item:
    (1) Is destined to or for a project listed in the footnote to
Country Group D:4 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or
    (2) Will be used in the design, development, production or use of
missiles in or by a country listed in Country Group D:4, whether or not
that use involves a listed project.
    (b) Additional prohibition on exporters informed by BXA. BXA may
inform the exporter or reexporter, either individually by specific
notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for
a specific export or reexport, or for exports or reexports of specified
items to a certain end-user, because there is an unacceptable risk of
use in or diversion to activities described in paragraph (a) of this
section, anywhere in the world. Specific notice is to be given only by,
or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export
Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be
followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. However, the
absence of any such notification does not excuse the exporter from
compliance with the license requirements of paragraph (a) of this
section. An illustrative list of projects is included in a footnote to
Country Group D:4. Exporters and reexporters are deemed to have been
informed that an individual license is required to export or reexport
to these projects. Exporters should be aware that the list of projects
in Country Group D:4 is not comprehensive; extra caution should be
exercised when making any shipments to a country listed in Country
Group D:4.
    (c) Exceptions. No License Exceptions apply to the prohibitions
described in paragraph (a) and (b) of this section.
    (d) License review standards for certain missile end-uses. (1)
Applications to export the items subject to this section will be
considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export
would make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles.
When an export is deemed to make a material contribution, the license
will be denied.
    (2) The following factors are among those that will be considered
to determine what action should be taken on an application required by
this section:
    (i) The specific nature of the end-use;
    (ii) The significance of the export in terms of its contribution to
the design, development, production, or use of missiles;
    (iii) The capabilities and objectives of the missile and space
programs of the recipient country;
    (iv) The non-proliferation credentials of the importing country;
    (v) The types of assurances or guarantees against design,
development, production or use for missiles delivery purposes that are
given in a particular case; and
    (vi) The existence of a pre-existing contract.

Sec. 744.4  Restrictions on certain chemical and biological weapons
end-uses.

    (a) General prohibition. In addition to the license requirements
for items specified on the CCL, you may not export or reexport an item
subject to the EAR to any destination, including Canada, without a
license if at the time of the export or reexport you know the item will
be used in the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of
chemical or biological weapons in or by a country listed in Country
Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (b) Additional prohibition on exporters informed by BXA. BXA may
inform the exporter or reexporter, either individually by specific
notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for
a specific export or reexport, or for export or reexport of specified
items to a certain end-user, because there is an unacceptable risk of
use in or diversion to such activities, anywhere in the world. Specific
notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy
Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is
provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two
working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export
Administration. However, the absence of any such notification does not
excuse the exporter from compliance with the license requirements of
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Exceptions. No License Exceptions apply to the prohibitions
described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (d) License review standards. (1) Applications to export or
reexport items subject to this section will be considered on a case-by-
case basis to determine whether the export or reexport would make a
material contribution to the design, development, production,
stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons. When an export
is deemed to make such a contribution, the license will be denied.
    (2) The following factors are among those that will be considered
to determine what action should be taken on an application required
under this section:
    (i) The specific nature of the end-use;
    (ii) The significance of the export in terms of its contribution to
the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or
biological weapons;
    (iii) The non-proliferation credentials of the importing country;
    (iv) The types of assurances or guarantees against design,
development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological
weapons that are given in a particular case; and
    (v) The existence of a pre-existing contract.<SUP>5

Sec. 744.5  Restrictions on certain maritime nuclear propulsion end-
uses.

    (a) General prohibition. In addition to the license requirements
for items specified on the CCL, you may not export or reexport certain
technology subject to the EAR to any destination, including Canada,
without a license if at the time of the export or reexport you know the
item is for use in connection with a foreign maritime nuclear
propulsion project. This prohibition applies to any technology relating
to maritime nuclear propulsion plants, their land prototypes, and
special facilities for their construction, support, or maintenance,
including any machinery, devices, components, or equipment specifically
developed or designed for use in such plants or facilities.
    (b) Exceptions. The exceptions provided in part 740 of the EAR do
not apply to the prohibitions described in paragraph (a) of this
section.
    (c) License review standards. It is the policy of the United States
Government not to participate in and not to authorize United States
firms or individuals to participate in foreign naval nuclear propulsion
plant projects, except under an Agreement for Cooperation on naval
nuclear propulsion executed in accordance with Sec. 123(d) of the
Atomic Energy Act of 1954. However, it is the policy of the United
States Government to encourage United States firms and individuals to
participate in maritime (civil) nuclear propulsion plant projects in
friendly foreign countries provided

[[Page 12805]]
that United States naval nuclear propulsion information is not
disclosed.

Sec. 744.6  Restrictions on certain activities of U.S. persons.

    (a) General prohibitions--(1) Activities related to exports. (i) No
U.S. person as defined in paragraph (c) of this section may, without a
license from BXA, export, reexport, or transfer to or in any country
other country, any item where that person knows that such item:
    (A) Will be used in the design, development, production, or use of
nuclear explosive devices in or by a country listed in Country Group
D:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (B) Will be used in the design, development, production, or use of

of the EAR).
    (ii) No U.S. person shall, without a license from BXA, knowingly
support an export, reexport, or transfer that does not have a license
as required by this section. Support means any action, including
financing, transportation, and freight forwarding, by which a person
facilitates an export, reexport, or transfer without being the actual
exporter or reexporter.
    (2) Other activities unrelated to exports. No U.S. person shall,
without a license from BXA:
    (i) Perform any contract, service, or employment that the U.S.
person knows will directly assist in the design, development,
production, or use of missiles in or by a country listed in Country
Group D:4 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or
    (ii) Perform any contract, service, or employment that the U.S.
person knows directly will directly assist in the design, development,
production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons in or
by a country listed in Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part
740 of the EAR).
    (3) Whole plant requirement. No U.S. person shall, without a
license from BXA, participate in the design, construction, export, or
reexport of a whole plant to make chemical weapons precursors
identified in ECCN 1C350, in countries other than those listed in
Country Group A:3 (Australia Group) (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740
of the EAR).
    (b) Additional prohibitions on U.S. persons informed by BXA. BXA
may inform U.S. persons, either individually or through amendment to
the EAR, that a license is required because an activity could involve
the types of participation and support described in paragraph (a) of
this section anywhere in the world.
    Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice
is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two
working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export
Administration. However, the absence of any such notification does not
excuse the exporter from compliance with the license requirements of
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Definition of U.S. person. For purposes of this section, the
term U.S. person includes:
    (1) Any individual who is a citizen of the United States, a
permanent resident alien of the United States, or a protected
individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3);
    (2) Any juridical person organized under the laws of the United
States or any jurisdiction within the United States, including foreign
branches; and
    (3) Any person in the United States.
    (d) Exceptions. No License Exceptions apply to the prohibitions
described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (e) License review standards. Applications to engage in activities
otherwise prohibited by this section will be denied if the activities
would make a material contribution to the design, development,
production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons, or
of missiles.

Sec. 744.7  Restrictions on certain exports to and for the use of
certain foreign vessels or aircraft.

    (a) General end-use prohibition. In addition to the license
requirements for items specified on the CCL, you may not export or
reexport an item subject to the EAR to, or for the use of, a foreign
vessel or aircraft, whether an operating vessel or aircraft or one
under construction, located in any port including a Canadian port,
unless a License Exception or NLR permits the shipment to be made:
    (1) To the country in which the vessel or aircraft is located, and
    (2) To the country in which the vessel or aircraft is registered,
or will be registered in the case of a vessel or aircraft under
construction, and
    (3) To the country, including a national thereof, which is
currently controlling, leasing, or chartering the vessel or aircraft.
    (b) Exception for U.S. and Canadian carriers.
    (1) Notwithstanding the general end-use prohibition in paragraph
(a) of this section, export and reexport may be made of the commodities
described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, for use by or on a
specific vessel or plane of U.S. or Canadian registry located at any
seaport or airport outside the United States or Canada except a port in
North Korea or Country Group D:1 (excluding the PRC and Romania), (see
Supplement No. 1 to part 740) provided that such commodities are <SUP>6

Sec. 746.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR
chapter VII, subchapter C. This part implements broad based controls
for items and activities subject to the EAR imposed to implement or
U.S. government policies. Two categories of controls are included in
this part.
    (a) Comprehensive controls. This part contains or refers to all the
BXA licensing requirements, licensing policies, and License Exceptions
for countries subject to general embargoes, currently Cuba, Libya,
North Korea, Iran and Iraq. This part is the focal point for all the
EAR requirements for transactions involving these countries.
    (1) Cuba, Libya, North Korea. All the items on the Commerce Control
List (CCL) require a license to Cuba, Libya, or North Korea. In
addition, most other items subject to the EAR, but not included on the
CCL, designated by the Number ``EAR99'', require a license to Cuba,
Libya, and North Korea. Most items requiring a license to these
destinations are subject to a general policy of denial. Because these
controls extend to virtually all exports, they do not appear in the
Country Chart in part 738 of the EAR, nor are they reflected in the
Commerce Control List in part 774 of the EAR.
    (2) Iran and Iraq. While BXA maintains controls on exports and
reexports to Iran and Iraq, comprehensive embargoes on transactions
involving these countries are administered by the Department of the
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
    (b) Rwanda. The second category of EAR controls apply to Rwanda
included in this part are those that are supplemental to controls set
forth in the Country Chart in part 738. Such controls

[[Page 12807]]
are listed under each affected ECCN on the CCL in part 774 of the EAR.
    (c) This part also contains descriptions of controls maintained by
the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Treasury Department and by
Office of Defense Trade Controls in the Department of State.
Comprehensive embargoes and supplemental controls implemented by BXA
under the EAR usually also involve controls on items and activities
maintained by these agencies. This part sets forth the allocation of
licensing responsibilities between BXA and these other agencies.
References to the requirements of other agencies are informational; for
current, complete, and authoritative requirements, you should consult
the appropriate agency's regulations.
    (d) Supplement No. 1 to this part provides you with general
information on United Nations sanctions administered by the Department
of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) (31 CFR part
590) on UNITA in Angola.
    (e) Supplement No. 2 to this part provides you with general
information on United Nations arms embargoes administered by the
Department of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130) on all the countries
of the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Slovenia),
Liberia and Somalia.
    (f) Supplement No. 3 to this part provides you with information on
embargoes on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)
and certain areas of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina administered by
OFAC (31 CFR part 585).

Sec. 746.2  Cuba.

    (a) License requirements. As authorized by section 6 of the Export
Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA) and by the Trading with
the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended, you will need a license to export or
reexport all items subject to the EAR (see part 734 of the EAR for the
scope of items subject to the EAR) to Cuba, except as follows.
    (1) License Exceptions. You may export without a license if your
transaction meets all the applicable terms and conditions of any of the
following License Exceptions. To determine the scope and eligibility
requirements, you will need to turn to the sections or specific
paragraphs of part 740 of the EAR (License Exceptions). Read each
License Exception carefully, as the provisions available for embargoed
countries are generally narrow.
    (i) Temporary Exports (TEMP) by the news media (see
Sec. 740.4(a)(2)(viii) of the EAR).
    (ii) Operating Technology and Software (OTS) for legally exported
commodities (see Sec. 740.8(a) of the EAR).
    (iii) Sales Technology (STS) (see Sec. 740.8(b) of the EAR).
    (iv) Software Updates (SUD) for legally exported software (see
Sec. 740.8(c) of the EAR).
    (v) Parts (PTS) for one-for-one replacement in certain legally
exported commodities (see Sec. 740.5(a) of the EAR).
    (vi) Baggage (BAG) (see Sec. 740.9 of the EAR).
    (vii) Governments and international organizations (GOV) (see
Sec. 740.6 of the EAR).
    (viii) Gift parcels and humanitarian donations (GFT) (see
Sec. 740.7 of the EAR).
    (ix) Items in transit (TUS) from Canada through the U.S. (see
Sec. 740.4(b)(1)(iv) of the EAR).
    (x) Aircraft and Vessels (AVS) for certain aircraft on temporary
sojourn (see Sec. 740.10(a) of the EAR).
    (2) [Reserved.]
    (b) Licensing policy. Items requiring a license are subject to a
general policy of denial, except as follows:
    (1) Medicines, medical supplies, instruments and equipment.
Applications to export medicines, medical supplies, instruments and
equipment will generally be approved, except:
    (i) To the extent restrictions would be permitted under section
5(m) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA), or
section 203(b)(2) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act;
    (ii) If there is a reasonable likelihood that the item to be
exported will be used for purposes of torture or other human rights
abuses;
    (iii) If there is a reasonable likelihood that the item to be
exported will be reexported;
    (iv) If the item to be exported could be used in the production of
any biotechnological product; or
    (v) If it is determined that the United States government is unable
to verify, by on-site inspection or other means, that the item to be
exported will be used for the purpose for which it was intended and
only for the use and benefit of the Cuban people, but this exception
shall not apply to donations of medicines for humanitarian purposes to
a nongovernmental organization in Cuba.
    (2) Telecommunications commodities may be authorized on a case-by-
case basis, provided the commodities are part of an FCC-approved
project and are necessary to provide efficient and adequate
telecommunications services between the United States and Cuba.
    (3) Exports from third countries to Cuba of non-strategic foreign-
made products that contain an insubstantial proportion of U.S.-origin
materials, parts, or components will generally be considered favorably
on a case-by-case basis, provided all of the following conditions are
satisfied:
    (i) The local law requires, or policy favors, trade with Cuba;
    (ii) The U.S.-origin content does not exceed 20 percent of the
value of the product to be exported from the third country. Requests
where the U.S.-origin parts, components, or materials represent more
than 20 percent by value of the foreign-made product will generally be
denied. See Supplement No. 3 to part 734 of the EAR for instructions on
how to calculate value; and
    (iii) You are not a U.S.-owned or -controlled entity in a third
country as defined by OFAC regulations, 31 CFR part 515, or you are a
U.S.-owned or controlled entity in a third country and one or more of
the following situations applies:
    (A) You have a contract for the proposed export that was entered
into prior to October 23, 1992.
    (B) Your transaction involves the export of foreign-produced
medicine, or medical supplies, instruments, or equipment incorporating
U.S.-origin parts, components or materials, in which case the
application will be reviewed according to the provisions of paragraph
(b)(1) of this section.
    (C) Your transaction is for the export of foreign-produced
telecommunications commodities incorporating U.S.-origin parts,
components and materials, in which case the application will be
reviewed under the licensing policy set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of
this section.
    (D) Your transaction is for the export of donated food to
individuals or non-governmental organizations in Cuba and does not
qualify for the humanitarian License Exception.
    (c) Cuba has been designated by the Secretary of State as a country
whose government has repeatedly provided support for acts of
international terrorism. For anti-terrorism controls, see Supplement 2
to part 742 of the EAR.
    (d) Related controls. OFAC maintains controls on the activities of
persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction, wherever located, involving
transactions with Cuba or any specially designated Cuban national, as
provided in 31 CFR part 515.

[[Page 12808]]

Sec. 746.3  Iraq.

    (a) License requirements. OFAC administers an embargo against Iraq
under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
of 1977, as amended, and the United Nations Participation Act of 1945,
as amended, and in conformance with United Nations Security Council
Resolutions. The applicable OFAC regulations, the Iraqi Sanctions
Regulations, are found in 31 CFR part 575. You should consult with OFAC
for authorization to export or reexport items subject to U.S.
jurisdiction to Iraq, or to any entity owned or controlled by, or
specially designated as acting for or on behalf of, the Government of
Iraq. Under the EAR, you need a license to export or reexport to Iraq
any item on the CCL containing a CB Column 1, CB Column 2, CB Column 3,
NP Column 1, NP Column 2, NS Column 1, NS Column 2, MT Column 1, RS
Column 1, RS Column 2, CC Column 1, CC Column 2, CC Column 3 in the
Country Chart Column of the License Requirements section of an ECCN, or
classified under ECCNs 1C980, 1C981, 1C982, 1C983, 1C984, 5A980, 0A980,
and 0A983; however, to avoid duplication, an authorization from OFAC
constitutes authorization under the EAR, and no separate BXA
authorization is necessary. Except as noted in Sec. 746.3(a)(1) of this
part, you may not use any BXA License Exception or other BXA
authorization to export or reexport to Iraq.
    (1) License Exceptions. You may export or reexport without a
license if your transaction meets all the applicable terms and
conditions of one of the following License Exceptions. Read each
License Exception carefully, as the provisions available for embargoed
countries are generally narrow.
    (i) Baggage (BAG) (See Sec. 740.9 of the EAR).
    (ii) Governments and international organizations (GOV) (See
Sec. 740.6 of the EAR).
    (2) Exports for the official use of the United Nations, its
personnel or agencies (excluding its relief or developmental agencies).
You must consult with OFAC to determine what transactions are eligible.
    (b) Iraq has been designated by the Secretary of State as a country
that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international
terrorism. For anti-terrorism controls, see Supplement 2 to part 742 of
the EAR.
    (c) Related controls. OFAC maintains controls on the activities of
U.S. persons, wherever located, involving transactions with Iraq or any
specially designated Iraqi national, as provided in 31 CFR part 575.

Sec. 746.4  Libya.

    (a) Introduction. The Department of the Treasury and the Department
of Commerce maintain comprehensive controls on exports and reexports to
Libya. OFAC maintains comprehensive controls on exports and
transshipments to Libya under the Libyan Sanctions Regulations (31 CFR
part 550). To avoid duplicate licensing procedures, OFAC and BXA have
allocated licensing responsibility as follows: OFAC licenses direct
exports and transshipments to Libya; BXA licenses reexports, exports of
foreign-manufactured items containing U.S.-origin parts, components or
materials, and exports of foreign-produced direct product of U.S.
technology or software. Issuance of an OFAC license also constitutes
authorization under the EAR, and no license from BXA is necessary.
Exports and reexports subject to the EAR that are not subject to the
Libyan Sanctions Regulations continue to require authorization from
BXA.
    (b) License requirements--(1) Exports. OFAC and BXA both require a
license for virtually all exports (including transshipments) to Libya.
Except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section or specified in OFAC
regulation, you may not use any BXA License Exception or other BXA
authorization to export or transship to Libya. You will need a license
from OFAC for all direct exports and transshipments to Libya except
those eligible for the following BXA License Exceptions:
    (i) Baggage (BAG) (see Sec. 740.9 of the EAR).
    (ii) Governments and international organizations (GOV) (see
Sec. 740.6 of the EAR).
    (iii) Gift parcels (GIFT) (see Sec. 740.7(a) of the EAR).
    (2) Reexports. You will need a license from BXA to reexport any
U.S.-origin item from a third country to Libya, any foreign-
manufactured item containing U.S.-origin parts, components or
materials, as defined in Sec. 734.2(b)(2) of the EAR, or any national
security-controlled foreign-produced direct product of U.S. technology
or software, as defined in Sec. 734.2(b)(3) of the EAR, exported from
the U.S. after March 12, 1982. You will need a license from BXA to
reexport all items subject to the EAR (see part 734 of the EAR) to
Libya, except:
    (i) Food, medicines, medical supplies, and agricultural
commodities;
    (ii) Reexports eligible for the following License Exceptions (read
each License Exception carefully, as the provisions available for
embargoed countries are generally narrow):
    (A) Temporary Exports (TEMP) reexports by the news media (see
Sec. 740.4(a)(2)(viii) of the EAR).
    (B) Operating Technology and Software (OTS) for legally exported
commodities (see Sec. 740.8(a) of the EAR).
    (C) Sales Technology (STS) (see Sec. 740.8(b) of the EAR).

exported commodities (Sec. 740.5(a) of the EAR).
    (F) Baggage (BAG) (Sec. 740.9 of the EAR).
    (G) Aircraft and Vessels (AVS) for vessels only (see
Sec. 740.10(c)(1) of the EAR).
    (H) Governments and international organizations (GOV) (see
Sec. 740.6 of the EAR).
    (I) Gift parcels and humanitarian donations (GFT) (see Sec. 740.7
of the EAR).
    (3) License applications submitted to BXA must provide specific
answers to the following questions:
    (i) How was the product received at its current location, and under
what type of authorization;
    (ii) On what date was it received; and
    (iii) How are inventories maintained at the current site?
    (c) Licensing policy. (1) You should consult with OFAC regarding
licensing policy for transactions subject to OFAC regulation.
    (2) The licensing policy for BXA controls is as follows. Licenses
will generally be denied for:
    (i) Items controlled for national security purposes and related
technology and software, including controlled foreign produced products
of U.S. technology and software exported from the United States after
March 12, 1982; and
    (ii) Oil and gas equipment and technology and software, if listed
in paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section, or if determined by BXA not
to be readily available from sources outside the United States; and
    (iii) Commodities, software, and technology destined for the
petrochemical processing complex at Ras Lanuf, if listed in paragraph
(c)(2)(vii) of this section, or where such items would contribute
directly to the development or construction of that complex (items
destined for the township at Ras Lanuf, or for the public utilities or
harbor facilities associated with that township, generally will not be
regarded as making such a contribution where their functions will

[[Page 12809]]
be primarily related to the township, utilities or harbor);
    (iv) Aircraft (including helicopters) or aircraft parts,
components, or accessories to Libya or the provision of engineering and
maintenance servicing of Libyan aircraft or aircraft components;
    (v) Arms and related material of all types, including the sale or
transfer of weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment,
paramilitary police equipment, spare parts for the aforementioned, and
equipment or supplies for the manufacture or maintenance of the

    (vi) Materials destined for the construction, improvement or
maintenance of Libyan civilian or military airfields and associated
facilities and equipment or any engineering or other services or
components destined for the maintenance of any Libyan civil or military
airfields or associated facilities and equipment, except emergency
equipment and equipment and services directly related to civilian air
traffic control; and
    (vii) Items listed in paragraphs (c)(2)(vii) (A) through (E) and
equipment and supplies for the manufacture or maintenance of such
items:
    (A) Pumps of medium or large capacity (equal to or larger than 3500

    (E) Spare parts for any of the items described in paragraph
(c)(2)(vii) of this section.
    (3) Notwithstanding the presumptions of denial in paragraphs (c)(2)
(i) through (iii), licenses will generally be issued items not included
in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) through (vii) when the transaction involves:
    (i) The export or reexport of commodities or technology and
software under a contract in effect prior to March 12, 1982, where
failure to obtain a license would not excuse performance under the
contract;
    (ii) Reexport of items not controlled for national security
purposes that had been exported from the United States prior to March
12, 1982 or exports of foreign products incorporating such items as
components; or

in foreign-manufactured products destined for Libya, where the U.S.
content is 20 percent or less by value.
    (4) Notwithstanding the presumption of denial in paragraph (c)(2)
(iv) through (vii), applications for reexports under a contract pre-

    (iii) Other unusual situations such as transactions involving firms
with contractual commitments in effect before March 12, 1982.
    (6) Licenses will generally be considered favorably on a case-by-
case basis for the reexport of reasonable quantities for civil use of
off-highway wheel tractors of carriage capacity of 9t (10 tons) or
more, as defined in ECCN 9A992, provided such tractors are not for uses
described in paragraph (c)(2) (iv) through (vi) of this section.
    (7) All other reexports not covered by United Nations resolutions
will generally be approved, subject to any other licensing policies
applicable to a particular transaction.

transaction meets all the applicable terms and conditions of any of the
License Exceptions specified in this paragraph. To determine scope and
eligibility requirements, you will need to turn to the sections or
specific paragraphs of part 740 of the EAR (License Exceptions). Read

Sec. 746.7  Iran.

    The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
administers a comprehensive trade and investment embargo against Iran
under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
of 1977, as amended, section 505 of the International Security and
Development Cooperation Act of 1985, and Executive Orders 12957 and
12959 of March 15, 1995 and May 6, 1995, respectively. This embargo
includes prohibitions on export and certain reexport transactions
involving Iran, including transactions dealing with items subject to
the EAR. (See OFAC's Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part
560.) BXA continues to maintain licensing requirements on exports and
reexports to Iran under the EAR as described in paragraph (a)(2) of
this section. No person may export or reexport items subject to both
the EAR and OFAC's Iranian Transactions Regulations without prior OFAC
authorization.
    (a) License requirements.
    (1) OFAC administered embargo. You should consult with OFAC if:
    (i) You seek authorization to export from the United States; or
    (ii) You are a United States person (as defined in OFAC's Iranian
Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part 560) and seek authorization to
export or reexport from a third country; or
    (iii) You seek authorization to reexport U.S.-origin items that
were subject to any export license application requirements prior to
Executive Order 12959 of May 6, 1995.
    (2) BXA license requirements. A license is required under the EAR:
    (i) To export to Iran any item on the CCL containing a CB Column 1,

ECCNs 1C980, 1C981, 1C982, 1C983, 1C984, 5A980, 0A980, and 0A983; or
    (ii) To reexport to Iran any of the items identified in
Sec. 746.7(a)(2)(i), except for ECCNs 2A994, 3A993, 5A992, 5A995,
6A990, 6A994, 7A994, 8A992, 8A994, 9A990, 9A992, or 9A994. However, the
export of these items from the United States to any destination with
knowledge that they will be reexported, in whole or in part, to Iran,
is prohibited without a license; or
    (iii) To export or reexport items subject to the general
prohibitions, including proliferation end-use prohibitions (see part
736 of the EAR).
    (3) BXA authorization. To avoid duplication, exporters or
reexporters are not required to seek separate authorization from BXA
for an export or reexport subject both to the EAR and to OFAC's Iranian
Transactions Regulations. Therefore, if OFAC authorizes an export or
reexport, no separate authorization from BXA is necessary.
    (4) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the term ``United
States person'' means any United States citizen, permanent resident
alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States (including
foreign branches), or any person in the United States; the term
``foreign person'' means those not defined as United States persons.
    (b) Iran has been designated by the Secretary of State as a country
that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international
terrorism. For anti-terrorism controls, see Sec. 742.8 of the EAR and
Supplement 2 to part 742.

Sec. 746.8  Rwanda.

    (a) Introduction. In addition to the controls on Rwanda reflected
on the Country Chart in Supplement 1 to part 738 of the EAR, there are
special controls on items that fall within the scope of a United
Nations Security Council arms embargo.
    (b) License requirements. (1) Under Executive Order 12918 of May
26, 1994, and in conformity with United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
Resolution 918 of May 17, 1994, an embargo applies to the sale or
supply to Rwanda of arms and related materiel of all types and
regardless of origin, including weapons and ammunition, military
vehicles and equipment, paramilitary police equipment, and spare parts
for such items. You will therefore need a license for the sale, supply
or export to Rwanda of embargoed items, as listed in paragraph
(b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, from the territory of the United
States by any person. You will also need a license for the export,
reexport, sale or supply to Rwanda of such items by any United States
person in any foreign country or other location. (Reexport controls
imposed by this embargo apply only to reexports by U.S. persons.) You
will also need a license for the use of any U.S.-registered aircraft or
vessel to supply or transport to Rwanda any such items. These
requirements apply to embargoed items, regardless of origin.
    (i) Crime Control and Detection Equipment as identified on the CCL
under CC Columns No. 1, 2 or 3 in the Country Chart column of the
``License Requirements'' section of the applicable ECCN.
    (ii) Items described by any ECCN ending in ``18,'' and items
described by ECCNs 1A988, 2B985, 5A980, 6A002.a.1,a.2,a.3 and c,
6A003.b.3 and b.4, 6D102, 6E001, 6E002, 9A115, 9A991.a, 09A84, 0A986,
and 0A988.
    (2) This embargo became effective at 11:59 p.m. EDT on May 26,
1994.

[[Page 12811]]

    (3) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the term:
    (i) Person means a natural person as well as a corporation,
business association, partnership, society, trust, or any other entity,
organization or group, including governmental entities; and
    (ii) United States person means any citizen or national of the
United States, any lawful permanent resident of the United States, or
any corporation, business association, partnership, society, trust, or
any other entity, organization or group, including governmental
entities, organized under the laws of the United States (including
foreign branches).
    (c) Licensing policy. Applications for export or reexport of all
items listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section are
subject to a general policy of denial. Consistent with United Nations
Security Council Resolution 918 and the United Nations Participation
Act, this embargo is effective notwithstanding the existence of any
rights or obligations conferred or imposed by any international
agreement or any contract entered into or any license or permit granted
prior to that date, except to the extent provided in regulations,
orders, directives or licenses that may be issued in the future under
Executive Order 12918 or under the EAR.
    (d) Related controls. The Department of State, Office of Defense
Trade Controls, maintains controls on arms and military equipment under
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120 through
130).

Supplement 1 to Part 746--Special Sanctions on Angola Administered by
the Office of Foreign Assets Control

    (a) Angola. BXA maintains controls on Angola as reflected on the
Country Chart in Supplement 1 to part 738 of the EAR. (See also
Sec. 746.7 of this part.) In addition, OFAC administers sanctions
against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA). Under Executive Order 12865 of September 26, 1993, and
consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution 864 of
September 15, 1993, OFAC administers an embargo on the sale or
supply of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons
and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment and spare parts, and
petroleum and petroleum products to:
    (1) UNITA; or
    (2) The territory of Angola, other than through points of entry
designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, in the following
schedule:

    (b) Exporters should apply to OFAC for authorization to export
embargoed items to UNITA or to points of entry not designated by the
Secretary of the Treasury. Exports of embargoed items that are also
controlled on the CCL to end-users other than UNITA and to points of
entry designated by the Secretary of the Treasury continue to
require a license from BXA. In addition, all other items controlled
on the CCL to Angola continue to require a license from BXA.

Supplement 2 to Part 746--United Nations Arms Embargoes Administered by
the Department of State: Liberia, Somalia, and Countries of the Former
Yugoslavia (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovenia)

    (a) Former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Bosnia-
Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Serbia and Montenegro, and Slovenia). The Department of State
administers an embargo on all weapons and military equipment,
consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution 713 of
September 25, 1991, to the countries of the former Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, and
Slovenia). Exporters are advised to consult with the Department of
State, Office of Defense Trade Controls (22 CFR parts 120 through
130), regarding exports of weapons and military equipment to these
destinations.

all weapons and military equipment to Liberia, consistent with
United Nations Security Council Resolution 788 of November 19, 1992.

regarding exports of weapons and military equipment.
    (c) Somalia. The Department of State administers an embargo on
all weapons and military equipment to Somalia, consistent with
United Nations Security Council Resolution 733 of February 23, 1992.

regarding exports of weapons and military equipment.

Supplement No. 3 to Part 746--Controls on the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia
Administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control

    Note: OFAC administers a comprehensive embargo on the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), certain areas of
Croatia, and Bosnian Serb-controlled areas of the Republic of
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Effective January 16, 1996, OFAC suspended the
application of sanctions on Croatia and Serbia and Montenegro.
Therefore, exporters should consult the Country Chart in Supplement
No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR for BXA controls. OFAC controls on
Bosnian Serb-controlled area of Bosnia-Herzegovina remain in effect.
(See amendment to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) and Bosnian Serb-Controlled Areas of the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina Sanctions Regulations in the Federal Register
of January 19, 1996 (61 FR 1282) (31 CFR part 585).) This suspension
affects paragraphs (a) and (c) of this Supplement.

    (a) Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia & Montenegro). OFAC
administers an embargo on exports and reexports to the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (FRY(S & M)). OFAC
administers this embargo under Executive Orders 12808 of May 30,
1992, 12810 of June 5, 1992, 12831 of January 15, 1993, 12846 of
April 25, 1993, and 12934 of October 25, 1994, and consistent with
United Nations Security Council Resolutions 757 of May 30, 1992, 787
of November 16, 1992, 820 of April 17, 1993, and 942 of September
23, 1994. Under this embargo, no items subject to U.S. jurisdiction
may be exported, directly or indirectly, to the FRY (S & M), or to
any entity operated from the FRY (S & M), or owned or controlled by,
or specially designated as acting for or on behalf of the Government
of the FRY (S & M). The applicable OFAC regulations, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) Sanctions
Regulations, are found in 31 CFR part 585. Exporters should apply to
OFAC for authorization to export or reexport items subject to the
EAR to the FRY (S & M). An authorization from OFAC constitutes
authorization under the EAR, and no BXA license is necessary.
    (b) Bosnia-Herzegovina. (1) BXA maintains the controls reflected
on the Country Chart in Supplement 1 to part 738 of the EAR on
Bosnia-Herzegovina, except to the extent OFAC maintains controls on
exports or reexports to that country.
    (2) OFAC maintains a comprehensive embargo on trade, including
exports from the United States or by U.S. persons to, or through,
those areas of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the control
of the Bosnian Serb forces, or activity of any kind that promotes or
is intended to promote such dealing. OFAC maintains this embargo
under Executive Orders 12846 of April 25, 1993 and 12934 of October
25, 1994, and consistent with United Nations Security Council
Resolutions 820 of April 17, 1993 and 942 of September 23, 1994. The
applicable OFAC regulations, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro) Sanctions Regulations, are found in 31 CFR
part 585. U.S. persons should apply to OFAC for authorization to
engage in trade-related transactions involving those areas of the
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the control of the Bosnian Serb
forces. An authorization from OFAC constitutes authorization under
the EAR, and no BXA license is necessary. You will need a license
from BXA for items controlled on the CCL to

[[Page 12812]]
Bosnia-Herzegovina when the export or reexport is destined to areas
in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina not controlled by the Bosnian
Serb forces. You may need a license from BXA to reexport U.S.-origin
items from third countries to areas of the Republic of Bosnia-
Herzegovina under the control of the Bosnian Serb forces.
    (c) Croatia. (1) BXA maintains the controls reflected on the
Country Chart in Supplement 1 to part 738 of the EAR on Croatia,
except to the extent OFAC maintains controls on exports or reexports
to that country.
    (2) OFAC prohibits any dealing by a U.S. person relating to the
export to, or transshipment through, the United Nations Protected
Areas in the Republic of Croatia. OFAC maintains this embargo under
Executive Order 12846 of April 25, 1993, and consistent with United
Nations Security Council Resolution 820 of April 17, 1993. The
applicable OFAC regulations, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro) Sanctions Regulations, are found in 31 CFR
part 585. U.S. persons should apply to OFAC for authorization to
engage in trade-related transactions involving the United Nations
Protected Areas in the Republic of Croatia. An authorization from
OFAC constitutes authorization under the EAR, and no BXA license is
necessary. You will need a license from BXA for items controlled on
the CCL to Croatia when the export or reexport is destined to areas
other than the United Nations Protected Areas in the Republic of
Croatia. Foreign persons may need a license from BXA to reexport
U.S.-origin items from third countries to the United Nations
Protected Areas in the Republic of Croatia.

Administration Regulations (EAR). All terms, conditions, provisions,
and instructions, including the applicant and consignee certifications,
contained in such form(s) are incorporated as part of the EAR. For the
purposes of this part, the term ``application'' refers to the Form BXA-

provision contained in this part relates solely to a license
application the term ``license application'' will appear.
    (b) BXA responses. BXA will give a formal classification, advisory
opinion or licensing decision only through the review of a properly
completed application supported by all relevant facts and required
documentation submitted in writing or electronically to BXA.
    (c) Confidentiality. Consistent with section 12(c) of the Export
Administration Act, as amended, information obtained for the purposes
of considering license applications, and other information obtained by

accept applications sent C.O.D.

Sec. 748.3  Classification and Advisory Opinions.

    (a) Introduction. In light of your responsibility to classify your
item, you may ask BXA to provide you with the correct Export Control
Classification Number (ECCN) to the paragraph (or subparagraph if
appropriate). BXA will advise you whether or not your item is subject
to the EAR and, if applicable, the appropriate ECCN. This type of
request is commonly referred to as a ``Classification Request''. If
requested, for a given end-use, end-user, and/or destination, BXA will
advise you whether a license is required, or likely to be granted, for
a particular transaction. Note that these responses do not bind BXA to
issuing a license in the future. This type of request, along with
requests for guidance regarding other interpretations of the EAR are
commonly referred to as ``Advisory Opinions''.
    (b) Classification requests. You must submit your Classification
Request using Form BXA-748P or its electronic equivalent. See the
instructions contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 748 to complete the
Blocks identified for this type of request. Classification Requests
must be sent to BXA at one of the addresses listed in Sec. 748.2(c) of
this part or submitted electronically. Be

[[Page 12813]]
certain that your request is complete and does not omit any essential
information.
    (1) Each Classification Request must be limited to 5 items.
Exceptions may be granted by BXA on a case-by-case basis for several
related items if the relationship between the items is satisfactorily
substantiated in the request. Classification requests must be supported
by any descriptive literature, brochures, precise technical
specifications or papers that describe the items in sufficient
technical detail to enable classification by BXA.
    (2) You must complete Blocks 1 through 5, 14, 22(b)(c)(d) and (i)
(enter your recommended classification information in these blocks), 24
and 25 on the application when submitting a Classification request. If
you are requesting BXA to classify an item for which precise
specifications are identified in Sec. 748.8 of this part, these
specifications must be addressed in, or attached to, your application.
Consult Sec. 738.2 of the EAR for guidance on classifying items on the
Commerce Control List.
    (c) Advisory Opinions. Advisory Opinions must be submitted in
writing to the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c) of the EAR. Both your
letter and envelope must be marked ``Advisory Opinion.''
    (1) Your letter must contain the following information if you are
requesting guidance regarding interpretations of the EAR:
    (i) The name, title, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the
person to contact,
    (ii) Your complete address comprised of street address, city,
state, country, and postal code; and
    (2) If you are requesting BXA to determine whether a license is
required, or the licensing policy related to a particular end-use, end-
user, and/or destination, in addition to the information required in
Sec. 748.3(c)(1) you must also include:
    (i) All available information on the parties to the transaction and
the proposed end-use or end-user,
    (ii) The model number for each item, where appropriate,
    (iii) The Export Control Classification Number, if known, for each
item; and
    (iv) Any descriptive literature, brochures, technical
specifications or papers that describe the items in sufficient
technical detail to enable BXA to verify the correct classification.

Sec. 748.4  Basic guidance related to applying for a license.

    (a) Disclosure and substantiation of facts on license applications.
You, as the applicant, are required to make the complete disclosure of
all parties in interest to the transaction so that BXA may decide on
the license application with the fullest knowledge of all relevant
facts. If the license application is filed for an account other than
that of the applicant, the agent, as applicant must disclose the name
of the agent's principal. Where there is any doubt as to which of
several persons should be named as a party to the license, you must
disclose the names of all such persons and the functions to be
performed by each in Block 24 on your application or an attachment to
your license application.
    (b) Applications for the export of items from the United States. A
license application to export items from the United States may be made
only by a person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States who
is in fact the exporter, or by the applicant's duly authorized agent.
This limitation does not apply to applications for the reexport of
items previously exported. An application may be made on behalf of a
person not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States by an
authorized agent in the United States, who then becomes the applicant.
    (c) Prohibited from applying for a license. No person convicted of
a violation of any statute specified in section 11(h) of the Export
Administration Act, as amended, at the discretion of the Secretary of
Commerce, may apply for any license for a period up to 10 years from
the date of the conviction. See Sec. 766.25 of the EAR.
    (d) Prior action on a shipment. If you have obtained a license
without disclosure of the facts described in this section, the license
will be deemed to have been obtained without disclosure of all facts
material to the granting of the license and the license so obtained
will be deemed void. See part 764 of the EAR for other sanctions that
may result in the event a violation occurs.
    (1) Licenses for items subject to detention or seizure. If you
submit a license application for items that you know have been detained
or seized by the Office of Export Enforcement or by the U.S. Customs
Service, you must disclose this fact to BXA when you submit your
license application.
    (2) Licenses for items previously exported. You may not submit a
license application to BXA covering a shipment that is already laden
aboard the exporting carrier, exported or reexported. If such export or
reexport should not have been made without first securing a license
authorizing the shipment, you must send a letter of explanation to the
Office of Export Enforcement, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and
Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., H4520, Washington, D.C., 20230. The letter
must state why a license was not obtained and disclose all facts
concerning the shipment that would normally have been disclosed on the
license application. You will be informed of any action and furnished
any instructions by the Office of Export Enforcement.
    (e) Multiple shipments. Your license application need not be
limited to a single shipment, but may represent a reasonable estimate
of items to be shipped throughout the validity of the license. Do not
wait until the license you are using expires before submitting a new
application. You may submit a new application prior to the expiration
of your current license in order to ensure uninterrupted shipping.
    (f) Second application. You may not submit a second license
application covering the same proposed transaction while the first is
pending action by BXA.
    (g) Resubmission. If a license application is returned without
action to you by BXA or your application represents a transaction
previously denied by BXA, and you want to resubmit the license
application, a new license application must be completed in accordance
with the instructions contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 748. Cite
the Application Control Number on your original application in Block 24
on the new license application.
    (h) Emergency processing. If you believe an emergency situation
beyond your control necessitates expedited processing of your license
application, you should contact BXA's Exporter Counseling Division of
the Office of Exporter Services. This office may be reached by
telephone on (202) 482-4811 or by facsimile on (202) 482-3617. These
procedures do not apply to emergency handling of Special Comprehensive
License applications.
    (1) How to request emergency handling. If your license application
is already pending with BXA, contact the Exporter Counseling Division
directly on either number listed in paragraph (h) of this section. If
you have not yet submitted your license application, include a written
letter with the title ``Emergency Handling Request'' with your license
application. The letter must include:
    (i) A justification for the request, supported, where appropriate,
with copies of orders, communications, or other documentation to
substantiate that your request constitutes a valid emergency. You may
be specifically requested to supply other documents not included with
your submission.

    (ii) An acknowledgement by you that any license issued under these
emergency procedures will have a limited validity period as described
in Sec. 750.7(g) of the EAR, and that it generally will not be
extended.
    (2) Prompt delivery of emergency handling requests. You are
responsible for prompt delivery of your request and license application
to BXA. You may hand-carry your request and license application or use
the services of an overnight courier to ensure prompt delivery. If you
desire to hand-carry your request and license application, you may hand
deliver it to the Exporter Counseling Division at the address stated in
Sec. 748.2(a) of this part. If you decide to use an overnight courier,
use the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c) of this part. The envelope
containing your license application should be labeled ``Attn: Exporter
Counseling Division, Emergency Handling Request Enclosed''.
    (3) Review of emergency handling requests. BXA views an emergency
as an unforeseeable situation over which you have no control. On the
day of receipt, BXA will evaluate your license application and decide
whether emergency handling is warranted. Frequent emergency request
will be given particularly close scrutiny. This procedure is not
designed to become a substitute for timely filing of license
applications.
    (4) Action on license applications processed under emergency
procedures. If you have submitted an emergency request, you will be
contacted by the Exporter Counseling Division informing you of whether
or not your request for emergency processing has been granted. If your
license is approved under emergency handling procedures, you will be
notified by BXA of the approval by telephone or in person. You will be
given the license number and verbal authorization to effect shipment
immediately, without waiting for the actual license. Any license
approved under these emergency handling procedures will have a limited
validity period as described in Sec. 750.7(g) of the EAR.

Sec. 748.5  Parties to the transaction on a license application.

    (a) Applicant. (1) The ``applicant'' is defined as the person who,
as the principal party in interest in the transaction, has the power
and responsibility for determining and controlling the exporting or
reexporting of the items. BXA is primarily concerned with the identity
of the applicant and the applicant's role in the transaction, and not
the terms of sale.
    (2) Ordinarily, a seller who delivers items in the United States to
a foreign buyer, or to the latter's forwarder or other agent, would not
be in a position to assume responsibility for the export and would not
be a proper applicant. This would normally be the situation where sale
is made f.o.b. factory, although such terms of sale may relate only to
price and are not necessarily inconsistent with the assumption by the
seller of full responsibility for effecting the export or reexport. The
seller can still be liable if the seller knows that the importer or its
agent will not obtain the required license.
    (3) If the seller intends to leave the responsibility for effecting
an export or reexport in the hands of the foreign importer or the
latter's forwarding or purchasing agent in the United States, the
foreign importer should apply for the license in the foreign importer's
own name if the foreign importer is subject to the jurisdiction of the
United States at the time of export. Otherwise, the importer's
forwarding or purchasing agent or other person subject to the
jurisdiction of the U.S. must appear as applicant and exporter. In this
situation you, as the applicant, must disclose your role as agent and
the name of your principal.
    (b) Order party. The order party is that person in the United
States who conducted the direct negotiations or correspondence with the
foreign purchaser or ultimate consignee and who, as a result of these
negotiations, received the order from the foreign purchaser or ultimate
consignee.
    (c) Purchaser. The purchaser is that person abroad who has entered
into the transaction with the applicant to purchase an item for
delivery to the ultimate consignee. A bank, freight forwarder,
forwarding agent, or other intermediary is not the purchaser. The
purchaser and ultimate consignee may be the same entity.
    (d) Intermediate consignee. The intermediate consignee is the bank,
forwarding agent, or other intermediary (if any) who acts in a foreign
country as an agent for the exporter or reexporter, the purchaser, or
the ultimate consignee, for the purpose of effecting delivery of the
export or reexport to the ultimate consignee.
    (e) Ultimate consignee. The ultimate consignee is the person
located abroad who is the true party in interest in actually receiving
the export for the designated end-use. A bank, freight forwarder,
forwarding agent, or other party, when acting as an intermediary, is
not acceptable as the ultimate consignee.

Sec. 748.6  General instructions for license applications.

    (a) Form and instructions. An application for license, whether to
export or reexport, must be submitted on Form BXA-748P, Multipurpose
Application (revised June 15, 1996 or later), and Form BXA-748P-A, Item
Appendix, and Form BXA-748P-B, End-User Appendix. Facsimiles or copies
of these forms are not acceptable. Instructions for preparing Form BXA-
748P are contained in Supplement No. 1 to this part 748. See
Sec. 748.7(a) of this part for instructions on submitting license
applications electronically.
    (b) Application Control Number. Each application form includes a
preprinted Application Control Number. The Application Control Number,
consisting of a letter followed by six digits, is for use by BXA when
processing applications, and by applicants when communicating with BXA
concerning pending applications. This number is used for tracking
purposes within the U.S. Government. The Application Control Number is
not a license number.
    (c) Approval or denial in entirety. License applications may be
approved in whole or in part, denied in whole or in part, or returned
without action. However, you may specifically request that your license
application be considered as a whole and either approved or denied in
its entirety.
    (d) Combining items on license applications. Any items may be
combined on a single application, however, if the items differ
dramatically (e.g., computers and shotguns) the number of BXA offices
to which a license application may be referred for review may increase
significantly. Accordingly, it is recommended that you limit items on
each license application to those that are similar and/or related.
    (e) Assembly and additional information. All documents or
correspondence accompanying your license application should bear the
Application Control Number, and be stapled together. Where necessary,
BXA may require you to submit additional information beyond that stated
in the EAR confirming or amplifying information contained in your
license application.
    (f) Changes in facts. Answers to all items on the license
application will be deemed to be continuing representations of the
existing facts or circumstances. Any material or substantive change in
the terms of the order, or in the facts relating to the transaction,
must be promptly reported to BXA, whether a license has been granted or
the license application is still

[[Page 12815]]
under consideration. If a license has been granted and such changes are
not excepted in Sec. 750.7(c) of the EAR, they must be reported
immediately to BXA, even though shipments against the license may be
partially or wholly completed, during the validity period of the
license.
    (g) Request for extended license validity period. An extended
validity period will generally be granted if your transaction is
related to a multi-year project, when production lead time will not
permit export or reexport during the normal validity period or for
other similar circumstances. A continuing requirement to supply spare
or replacement parts will not normally justify an extended validity
period. To request an extended validity period, include justification
for your request in Block 24 on the application.

Sec. 748.7  Applying electronically for a license or Classification
request.

    (a) Authorization. You may apply electronically once you have been
authorized to do so by BXA. An authorization to submit applications
electronically may be limited or withdrawn by BXA at any time. There
are no prerequisites for obtaining permission to submit electronically
or limitations in terms of country eligibility. However, BXA may direct
for any reason that any electronic application be resubmitted in
writing, in whole or in part
    (1) Requesting approval to submit applications electronically. To
submit applications electronically, your company must submit a written
request to BXA at one of the addresses identified in Sec. 748.2(c) of
this part. Both the envelope and letter must be marked ``Attn:
Electronic Submission Request''. Your letter must contain your
company's name, and the address, telephone number, and name of the
principal contact person in your company. Before approving your
request, BXA will provide you with language for a number of required
certifications. Once you have completed the necessary certifications,
you may be approved by BXA to submit applications electronically.
    (2) Assignment and use of company and personal identification
numbers. (i) Each company granted permission to submit applications
electronically will be assigned a company identification number. Each
person approved by BXA to submit applications electronically for the
company will be assigned a personal identification number (``PIN'')
telephonically by BXA. A PIN will be assigned to you only if your
company has certified to BXA that you are authorized to act for it in
making electronic submissions under the EAR.
    (ii) Your company may reveal the assigned company identification
number only to the PIN holders, their supervisors, employees, or agents
of the company with a commercial justification for knowing the company
identification number.
    (iii) An individual PIN holder may not:
    (A) Disclose the PIN to anyone;
    (B) Record the PIN either in writing or electronically;
    (C) Authorize another person to use the PIN; or
    (D) Use the PIN following termination by BXA or your company of
your authorization or approval for PIN use.
    (iv) To prevent misuse of the PIN:
    (A) If a PIN is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised, the company
and the PIN holder must report the loss, theft or compromise of the PIN
immediately by telephoning BXA at (202) 482-0436. You must confirm this
notification in writing within two business days to BXA at the address
provided in Sec. 748.2(c) of this part.
    (B) Your company is responsible for immediately notifying BXA
whenever a PIN holder leaves the employ of the company or otherwise
ceases to be authorized by the company to submit applications
electronically on its behalf.
    (v) No person may use, copy, steal or otherwise compromise a PIN
assigned to another person; and no person may use, copy, steal or
otherwise compromise the company identification number where the
company has not authorized such person to have access to the number.
    (b) Electronic submission of applications. (1) All applications.
Upon submission of the required certifications and approval of the
company's request to use electronic submission, BXA will provide
instructions both on the method to transmit applications electronically
and the process for submitting required supporting documents and
technical specifications. These instructions may be modified by BXA
from time to time.
    (2) License Applications. The electronic submission of an
application for license will constitute an export control document.
Such submissions must provide the same information as written
applications and are subject to the recordkeeping provisions of part
762 of the EAR. The applicant company and PIN holder submitting the
application will be deemed to make all representations and
certifications as if the submission were made in writing by the company
and signed by the submitting PIN holder. Electronic submission of a
license application will be considered complete upon the transmittal of
the application to BXA or to an entity under contract to receive such
applications for BXA.
    (c) Maintenance of a log. Your company must maintain a log, either
manually or electronically, specifying the date and time of each
electronic submission, the ECCNs of items on each electronic
submission, and the name of the employee or agent submitting the
license application. This log may not be altered. Written corrections
must be made in a manner that does not erase or cover original entries.
If the log is maintained electronically, corrections may only be made
as notations.
    (d) Updating. An applicant company must promptly notify BXA of any
change in its name or address. If your company wishes to have an
individual added as a PIN holder, your company must advise BXA and
follow the instructions provided by BXA. Your company should conduct
periodic reviews to ensure that PINs are held only by individuals whose
current responsibilities make it necessary and appropriate that they
act for the company in this capacity.

Sec. 748.8  Unique license application requirements.

    In addition to the instructions contained in Supplement No. 1 to
this part 748, you must also ensure that the additional requirements
for certain items or types of transactions described in this section
are addressed in your license application. See Supplement No. 2 to this
part 748 if your application involves:
    (a) Chemicals, medicinals, and pharmaceuticals.
    (b) Communications intercepting devices.
    (c) Digital computers, telecommunications, and related equipment.
    (d) Gift parcels; consolidated in a single shipment.
    (e) Intransit shipments through the United States.
    (f) Intransit shipments outside of the United States.
    (g) Nuclear Nonproliferation items and end-uses.
    (h) Numerical control devices, motion control boards, numerically
controlled machine tools, dimensional inspection machines, direct
numerical control systems, specially designed assemblies and specially
designed software.
    (i) Parts, components, and materials incorporated abroad into
foreign-made products.
    (j) Ship stores, plane stores, supplies, and equipment.
    (k) Regional stability controlled items.
    (l) Reexports.

[[Page 12816]]

    (m) Robots.
    (n) Short Supply controlled items.
    (o) Technology.
    (p) Temporary exports or reexports.

Sec. 748.9  Support documents for license applications.

    (a) Exemptions. If you plan to submit a license application
involving one of the following situations, no support documentation is
required. Simply submit the license application.
    (1) All exports and reexports involving ultimate consignees located
in any of the following destinations:

Bahamas
Barbados
Belize
Bermuda
Bolivia
Brazil
Canada
Chile
Colombia
Costa Rica
Dominican Republic
Ecuador
El Salvador
French West Indies
French Guiana
Greenland
Guatemala
Guyana
Haiti
Honduras
Jamaica
Leeward and Windward Islands
Mexico
Miquelon and St. Pierre Islands
Netherlands Antilles
Nicaragua
Panama
Paraguay
Peru
Surinam
Trinidad and Tobago
Uruguay
Venezuela

    (2) The ultimate consignee or purchaser is a foreign government(s)
or foreign government agency(ies). To determine whether the parties to
your transaction meet the definition of ``government agency'' refer to
the definition contained in part 772 of the EAR. Remember, if either
the ultimate consignee or purchaser is not a foreign government or
foreign government agency, a statement is required from the
nongovernmental party. However, support documents are required from
governments of the People's Republic of China, India, Bulgaria, Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia.
    (3) The license application is filed by, or on behalf of, a relief
agency registered with the Advisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid,
U.S. Agency for International Development, for export to a member
agency in the foreign country.
    (4) The license application is submitted to export or reexport
items for temporary exhibit, demonstration, or testing purposes.
    (5) The license application is submitted for items controlled for
short supply reasons (see part 754 of the EAR).
    (6) The license application is submitted under the Special
Comprehensive License procedure described in part 752 of the EAR.
    (b) Support document requirements. License applications not exempt
under paragraph (a) of this section generally must be supported by
documents designed to elicit information concerning the disposition of
the items intended for export or reexport. These support documents must
be either submitted at the time the license application is filed or
retained in the applicant's files in accordance with the recordkeeping
provisions of part 762 of the EAR. The type of support documentation
required is dependent on the item involved and the country of ultimate
destination. To determine which type of support documentation is
required, answer the following questions:
    (1) Does your transaction involve items controlled for national
security reasons?
    (i) If yes, continue with question number 2 in paragraph (b)(2) of
this section.
    (ii) If no, your transaction may require a Statement by Ultimate
Consignee and Purchaser.
    (2) Does your transaction involve items controlled for national
security reasons destined for one of the following countries? (This
applies only to those overseas destinations specifically listed.)

Argentina
Australia
Austria
Belgium
Bulgaria
China (PRC)
Czech Republic
Denmark
Finland
France
Germany
Greece
Hong Kong
Hungary
India
Ireland, Republic of
Italy
Japan
Korea, Republic of
Liechtenstein
Luxembourg
Netherlands
New Zealand
Norway
Pakistan
Poland
Portugal
Romania
Singapore
Slovakia
Spain
Sweden
Switzerland
Taiwan
Turkey
United Kingdom

    (i) If yes, your transaction may require an Import or End-User
Certificate. Note that if the destination is the People's Republic of
China, a Statement of Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser may be
substituted for a PRC End-User Certificate under the following
conditions:
    (1) The item to be exported is described in an Advisory Note for
Country Group D:1 (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) on the
CCL; or
    (2) The item to be exported (i.e., replacement parts and sub-
assemblies) is for servicing previously exported items and is valued at
$75,000 or less; or
    (3) The End-User is not a Chinese entity.
    (ii) If no, your transaction may require a Statement by Ultimate
Consignee or Purchaser.
    (c) License applications requiring support documents. License
applications requiring support by either a Statement by the Ultimate
Consignee and Purchaser or an Import or End-User Certificate must
indicate the type of support document obtained in Block 6 or 7 on your
application with an ``X'' in the appropriate box. If the support
document is an Import or End User Certificate, you must also identify
the originating country and number of the Certificate in Block 13 on
your application. If a license application is submitted without either
the correct Block or Box marked on the application or the required
support document, the license application will be immediately returned
without action unless the satisfactory reasons for failing to obtain
the document are supplied in Block 24 or in an attachment to your
license application.
    (1) License applications supported by an Import or End User
Certificate. If submission of the original certificate is not required
by Sec. 748.10(g) of this part, you may submit your license application
upon receipt of a facsimile

[[Page 12817]]
or other legible copy of the Import or End User Certificate provided
that no shipment is made against any license issued based upon the
Import or End User Certificate prior to receipt and retention of the
original statement by the applicant. If Sec. 748.10(g) of this part
requires submission of the original certificate with your license
application, you must submit the original. Copies will not be accepted.
    (2) License applications supported by Ultimate Consignee and
Purchaser statements. These types of license applications may be
submitted upon receipt of a facsimile or other legible copy of the
original statement provided that the original manually-signed statement
is retained by the ultimate consignee, and you retain a copy of the
statement.
    (d) Exceptions to obtaining the required support document. BXA will
consider the granting of an exception to the requirement for supporting
document where the requirements cannot be met due to circumstances
beyond your control. An exception will not be granted contrary to the
objectives of the U.S. export control laws and regulations. Refer to
Sec. 748.12(d) of this part for specific instructions on procedures for
requesting an exception.
    (e) Validity period. (1) When an Import or End-User Certificate or
a Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser is required to support
one or more license applications, you must submit the first license
application within the validity period shown on the Certificate, or 6
months from the date the Certificate was issued or Statement signed,
whichever is shorter.
    (2) All subsequent license applications supported by the same
Import or End-Use Certificate must be submitted to BXA within one year
from the date that the first license application supported by the same
Import or End-Use Certificate was submitted to BXA.
    (3) All subsequent license applications supported by the same
Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser must be submitted within
two years of the first application if the statement was completed as a
single transaction statement. If the statement was completed as a
multiple transaction statement, all applications must be submitted
within two years of signature by the consignee or purchaser, whichever
was last.
    (f) English translation requirements. All abbreviations, coded
terms, or other expressions on support documents having special
significance in the trade or to the parties to the transaction must be
explained on an attachment to the document. Documents in a language
other than English must be accompanied by an attachment giving an
accurate English translation, either made by a translating service or
certified by you to be correct. Explanations or translations should be
provided on a separate piece of paper, and not entered on the support
documents themselves.
    (g) Responsibility for full disclosure. (1) Information contained
in a support document cannot be construed as extending or expanding or
otherwise modifying the specific information supplied in a license
application or license issued by BXA. The license application covering
the transaction discloses all facts pertaining to the transaction. The
authorizations contained in the resulting license are not extended by
information contained in an Import Certificate, End-User Certificate or
Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser regarding reexport from
the country of destination or any other facts relative to the
transaction that are not reported on the license application.
    (2) Misrepresentations, either through failure to disclose facts,
concealing a material fact, or furnishing false information, will
subject responsible parties to administrative action by BXA.
Administrative action may include suspension, revocation, or denial of
licensing privileges and denial of other participation in exports from
the United States.
    (3) In obtaining the required support document, you as the
applicant are not relieved of the responsibility for full disclosure of
any other information concerning the ultimate destination and end-use,
end-user of which you know, even if inconsistent with the
representations made in the Import Certificate, End-User Certificate,
or Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser. You are responsible
for promptly notifying BXA of any change in the facts contained in the
support document that comes to your attention.
    (h) Effect on license application review. BXA reserves the right in
all respects to determine to what extent any license will be issued
covering items for which an Import or End-User Certificate has been
issued by a foreign government. BXA will not seek or undertake to give
consideration to recommendations from the foreign government as to the
action to be taken on a license application. A supporting document
issued by a foreign government will be only one of the factors upon
which BXA will base its licensing action, since end-uses and other
considerations are important factors in the decision making process.
    (i) Request for return of support documents submitted to BXA. If an
applicant is requested by a foreign importer to return an unused or
partially used Import or End-User Certificate submitted to BXA in
support of a license application, the procedure provided in this
paragraph (i) should be followed:
    (1) The applicant must send a letter request for return of an
Import or End-User Certificate to the address stated in Sec. 748.2(c)
of this part, ``Attn: Import/End-User Certificate Request''.
    (2) The letter request must include the name and address of the
importer, the Application Control Number under which the original
Import or End-User Certificate was submitted, the Application Control
Numbers for any subsequent license applications supported by the same
certificate, and one of the following statements, if applicable:
    (i) If the certificate covers a quantity greater than the total
quantity identified on the license application(s) submitted against it,
a statement that the certificate will not be used in connection with
another license application.
    (ii) If you do not intend to make any additional shipments under a
license covered by the certificate, or are in possession of an expired
license covered by the certificate, a statement to this effect,
indicating the unshipped items.
    (j) Recordkeeping requirements for returning certificates retained
by the applicant. (1) Though the recordkeeping provisions of the EAR
require that all original support documents be retained for a period of
five years, an unused or partially used certificate may be returned at
the request of a foreign importer provided that you submit the original
certificate, accompanied by a letter of explanation, a copy of each
license covered by the certificate, and a list of all shipments made
against each license to BXA at the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c). BXA
will notify you in writing whether your request has been granted. The
following information must be contained in your letter of explanation:
    (i) A statement citing the foreign importer's request for return of
the certificate;
    (ii) The license number(s) that have been issued against the
certificate (including both outstanding and expired licenses); and
    (iii) If the certificate covers a quantity greater that the total
quantity stated on the license(s), you must include a statement that
the certificate will not be used in connection with another license
application.

[[Page 12818]]

    (2) If your request is granted, BXA will return the certificate to
you. You must make a copy of the certificate before you return the
original to the importer. This copy must show all the information
contained on the original certificate including any notation made on
the certificate by BXA. The copies must be retained on file along with
your correspondence in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions in
part 762 of the EAR.

Sec. 748.10  Import and End-User Certificates.

    (a) Scope. There are a variety of Import and End-User Certificates
currently in use by various governments. The control exercised by the
government issuing the Import or End-User Certificate is in addition to
the conditions and restrictions placed on the transaction by BXA. The
laws and regulations of the United States are in no way modified,
changed, or superseded by the issuance of an Import or End-User
Certificate. This section describes exceptions and relationships true
for both Import and End-User Certificates, and applies only to
transactions involving national security controlled items destined for
one of the countries identified in Sec. 748.9(b)(2) of this part.
    (b) Import or End-User Certificate. An Import or End-User
Certificate must be obtained, unless your transaction meets one of the
exemptions stated in Sec. 748.9(a) of this part, if:
    (1) Any items on your license application are controlled for
national security reasons (NS),
    (2) The ultimate destination is a country listed in
Sec. 748.9(b)(2) of this part; and
    (3) Your license application involves the export of items
classified in a single entry on the CCL, the total value of which
exceeds $5,000.
    (i) Your license application may list several separate CCL entries.
If any entry controlled for national security reasons exceeds $5,000,
then an Import or End-User Certificate must be obtained covering all
items controlled for national security reasons on your license
application;
    (ii) If your license application involves a lesser transaction that
is part of a larger order for items controlled for national security
reasons in a single ECCN exceeding $5,000, an Import or End-User
Certificate must be obtained.
    (iii) You may be specifically requested by BXA to obtain an Import
Certificate for a transaction valued under $5,000.
    (c) How to obtain an Import or End-User Certificate. (1) Applicants
must request that the importer (e.g., ultimate consignee or purchaser)
obtain the Import or End-User Certificate, and that it be issued
covering only those items that are controlled for national security
reasons. Importers should not be requested to obtain an Import or End-
User Certificate for items that are controlled for reasons other than
national security. Upon receipt, the importer must transmit the
original document to the applicant.
    (2) The applicant's name must appear on the Import or End-User
Certificate submitted to BXA as either the applicant, supplier, or
order party. The Import Certificate may be made out to either the
ultimate consignee or the purchaser, even though they are different
parties, as long as both are located in the same country.

    Note to paragraph (c) of this section: You should furnish the
consignee with the item description contained in the CCL to be used
in applying for the Import or End-User Certificate. It is also
advisable to furnish a manufacturer's catalog, brochure, or
technical specifications if the item is new.

    (3) If your transaction requires support of a PRC End-User
Certificate, you must ensure the following information is included on
the PRC End-User Certificate signed by an official of the Department of
Science and Technology of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) with MOFTEC's seal affixed to it:
    (i) Title of contract and contract number (optional);
    (ii) Names of importer and exporter;
    (iii) End-User and end-use;
    (iv) Description of the item, quantity and dollar value; and
    (v) Signature of the importer and date.
    (d) Where to obtain Import and End-User Certificates. See
Supplement No. 4 to this part for a list of the authorities
administering the Import Certificate/Delivery Verification and End-User
Certificate Systems in other countries.
    (e) Triangular symbol on International Import Certificates.
    (1) In accordance with international practice, the issuing
government may stamp a triangular symbol on the International Import
Certificate (IIC). This symbol is notification that the importer does
not intend to import or retain the items in the country issuing the
certificate, but that, in any case, the items will not be delivered to
any destination except in accordance with the export regulations of the
issuing country'.
    (2) If you receive an IIC bearing a triangular symbol, you must
identify all parties to the transaction on the license application,
including those located outside the country issuing the IIC. If the
importer declines to provide you with this information, you may advise
the importer to provide the information directly to BXA, through a U.S.
Foreign Commercial Service office, or in a sealed envelope to you
marked ``To be opened by BXA only''.
    (f) Multiple license applications supported by one certificate. An
Import or End-User Certificate may cover more than one purchase order
and more than one item. Where the certificate includes items for which
more than one license application will be submitted, you must include
in Block 24 on your application, or in an attachment to each license
application submitted against the certificate, the following
certification:

    I (We) certify that the quantities of items shown on this
license application, based on the Certificate identified in Block 13
of this license application, when added to the quantities shown on
all other license applications submitted to BXA based on the same
Certificate, do not total more than the total quantities shown on
the above cited Certificate.

    (g) Submission of Import and End-User Certificates. If a PRC End-
User Certificate is required for your proposed transaction, you must
submit the original certificate with your license application. Copies
will not be accepted. All other certificates must be retained on file
by the applicant in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions of
part 762 of the EAR, and not submitted with the license application.
    (h) Alterations. After an Import or End-User Certificate is issued
by a foreign government, no corrections, additions, or alterations may
be made on the Certificate by any person. If you desire to explain any
information contained on the Certificate, you may attach a signed
statement to the Certificate.
    (i) Request for Delivery Verification. BXA will, on a selective
basis, require Delivery Verification documents for shipments supported
by Import Certificates. You will be notified if Delivery Verification
is required at the time of issuance of the license. Please refer to
Sec. 748.13 of this part for detailed information on these procedures.
    (j) Retention procedures. You must retain on file the original copy
of any certificate issued in support of a license application submitted
to BXA, unless the original is submitted with the license application.
All recordkeeping provisions contained in part 762 of the EAR apply to
this requirement, except that reproductions may not be substituted for
the officially authenticated original in this instance.

[[Page 12819]]

Sec. 748.11  Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser.

    (a) Exceptions to completing a Statement by Ultimate Consignee and
Purchaser. A Statement by the Ultimate Consignee and/or Purchaser
involved in a transaction must be completed unless:
    (1) An International Import Certificate, a People's Republic of
China End-User Certificate, an Indian Import Certificate, or a
Bulgarian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian or Slovak Import
Certificate is required in support of the license application;
    (2) The applicant is the same person as the ultimate consignee,
provided the required statements are contained in Block 24 on the
license application. This exemption does not apply where the applicant
and consignee are separate entities, such as parent and subsidiary, or
affiliated or associated firms;
    (3) The application is valued at $5000 or less, and is not part of
a larger transaction; or
    (4) The transaction meets one of the exemptions stated in
Sec. 748.9(a) of this part.
    (b) Submission of the Statement by Ultimate Consignee and
Purchaser. A copy of the statement must be submitted with your license
application if the country of ultimate destination is listed in either
Country Group D:2, D:3, or D:4 (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the
EAR). The copy submitted by the applicant must be of sufficient quality
to ensure all assertions made on the statement are legible and that the
signatures are sufficiently legible to permit identification of the
signature as that of the signer. The applicant must receive the
manually-signed original within 60 days from the date the original is
signed by the ultimate consignee. The applicant must, upon receipt,
retain the manually-signed original, and both the ultimate consignee
and purchaser should retain a copy of the statement in accordance with
the recordkeeping provisions contained in part 762 of the EAR.
    (c) Form or letter. The ultimate consignee and purchaser must
complete either a statement on company letterhead in accordance with
paragraph (e) of this section or Form BXA-711, Statement by Ultimate
Consignee and Purchaser. If the consignee and purchaser elect to
complete the statement on letterhead and both the ultimate consignee
and purchaser are the same entity, only one statement is necessary. If
the ultimate consignee and purchaser are separate entities, separate
statements must be prepared and signed. If the ultimate consignee and
purchaser elects to complete Form BXA-711, only one Form BXA-711
(containing the signatures of the ultimate consignee and purchaser)
need be completed. Whether your ultimate consignee and purchaser sign a
written statement or complete Form BXA-711, the following constraints
apply:
    (1) Responsible officials representing the ultimate consignee and
purchaser must sign the statement. ``Responsible official'' is defined
as someone with personal knowledge of the information included in the
statement, and authority to bind the ultimate consignee or purchaser
for whom they sign, and who has the power and authority to control the
use and disposition of the licensed items.
    (2) The authority to sign the statement may not be delegated to any
person (agent, employee, or other) whose authority to sign is not
inherent in his or her official position with the ultimate consignee or
purchaser for whom he or she signs. The signing official may be located
in the U.S. or in a foreign country. The official title of the person
signing the statement must also be included.
    (3) The consignee and/or purchaser must submit information that is
true and correct to the best of their knowledge and must promptly send
a new statement to the applicant if changes in the facts or intentions
contained in their statement(s) occur after the statement(s) have been
forwarded to the applicant. Once a statement has been signed, no
corrections, additions, or alterations may be made. If a signed
statement is incomplete or incorrect in any respect, a new statement
must be prepared, signed and forwarded to the applicant.
    (d) Instructions for completing Form BXA-711. Instructions on
completing Form BXA-711 are contained in Supplement No. 3 to this part.
The ultimate consignee and purchaser may sign a legible copy of Form
BXA-711. It is not necessary to require your ultimate consignee and
purchaser sign an original Form BXA-711, provided all information
contained on the copy is legible.
    (e) Instructions for completing the statement on letterhead.
Information in response to each of the following criteria must be
included in the statement. If any information is unknown, that fact
should be disclosed in the statement. Preprinted information supplied
on the statement, including the name, address, or nature of business of
the ultimate consignee or purchaser appearing on the letterhead or
order form is acceptable but will not constitute evidence of either the
signer's identity, the country of ultimate destination, or end-use of
the items described in the license application.
    (1) Paragraph 1. One of the following certifications must be
included depending on whether the statement is proffered in support of
a single license application or multiple license applications:
    (i) Single. This statement is to be considered part of a license
application submitted by [name and address of applicant].
    (ii) Multiple. This statement is to be considered a part of every
license application submitted by [name and address of applicant] until

shall promptly send a replacement statement to [name of the applicant]
disclosing any material change of facts or intentions described in this
statement that occur after this statement has been prepared and
forwarded to [name of applicant]. We acknowledge that the making of any
false statement or concealment of any material fact in connection with

in whole or in part, of participation in U.S. exports or reexports.
    (ii) Except as specifically authorized by the U.S. Export
Administration Regulations, or by written approval from the Bureau of
Export Administration, we will not reexport, resell, or otherwise
dispose of any items approved on a license supported by this statement:
    (1) To any country not approved for export as brought to our
attention by the U.S. exporter; or
    (2) To any person if there is reason to believe that it will result
directly or indirectly in disposition of the items contrary to the
representations made in this statement or contrary to the U.S. Export
Administration Regulations.
    (iii) We understand that acceptance of this statement as a support
document cannot be construed as an authorization by BXA to reexport the
items in the form in which received even though we may have indicated
the intention to reexport, and that authorization to reexport is not
granted in an export license on the basis of information provided in
the statement, but as a result of a specific request in a license
application.

Sec. 748.12  Special provisions for support documents.

    (a) Grace periods. Whenever the requirement for an Import or End-
User Certificate or Statement by Ultimate Consignee or Purchaser is
imposed or extended by a change in the regulations, the license
application need not conform to the new support documentation
requirements for a period of 45 days after the effective date of the
regulatory change published in the Federal Register.
    (1) Requirements are usually imposed or extended by virtue of one
of the following:
    (i) Addition or removal of national security controls over a
particular item; or
    (ii) Development of an Import Certificate/Delivery Verification or
End-User Certificate program by a foreign country; or
    (iii) Removal of an item from eligibility under the Special
Comprehensive License described in part 752 of the EAR, when you hold
such a special license and have been exporting the item under that
license.
    (2) License applications filed during the 45 day grace period must
be accompanied by any evidence available to you that will support
representations concerning the ultimate consignee, ultimate
destination, and end use, such as copies of the order, letters of
credit, correspondence between you and ultimate consignee, or other
documents received from the ultimate consignee. You must also identify
the regulatory change (including its effective date) that justifies
exercise of the 45 day grace period. Note that an Import or End-User
Certificate will not be accepted, after the stated grace period, for
license applications involving items that are no longer controlled for
national security reasons. If an item is removed from national security
controls, you must obtain a Statement by Ultimate Consignee and
Purchaser as described in Sec. 748.11 of this part. Likewise, any item
newly controlled for national security purposes requires support of an
Import or End-User Certificate as described in Sec. 748.10 of this part
after expiration of the stated grace period.
    (b) Reexports. If a support document would be required for an
export, the same document would be required for reexport to Country
Group D:1 and E:2 (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (c) Granting of exceptions to the support documentation
requirement. An exception to obtaining the required support
documentation will be considered by BXA, however, an exception will not
be granted contrary to the objectives of the U.S. export control
program. A request for exception may involve either a single
transaction, or where the reason necessitating the request is
continuing in nature, multiple transactions. If satisfied by the
evidence presented, BXA may waive the support document requirement and
accept the license application for processing. Favorable consideration
of a request for exception generally will be given in instances where
the support document requirement:
    (1) Imposes an undue hardship on you and/or ultimate consignee
(e.g., refusal by the foreign government to issue an Import or End-User
Certificate and such refusal constitutes discrimination against you);
or
    (2) Cannot be complied with (e.g., the items will be held in a
foreign trade zone or bonded warehouse for subsequent distribution in
one or more countries); or
    (3) Is not applicable to the transaction (e.g., the items will not
be imported for consumption into the named country of destination).
    (d) Procedures for requesting an exception. (1) Requests for
exception must be submitted with the license application to which the
request relates. Where the request relates to more than one license
application it should be submitted with the first license application
and referred to in Block 24 on any subsequent license application. The
request for exception must be submitted in writing on the applicant's
letterhead.
    (2) In instances where you are requesting exception from obtaining
an Import or End-User Certificate, the request must be accompanied by a
manually-signed original Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser
as described in Sec. 748.11 of this part.
    (3) At a minimum, the letter request must include:
    (i) Name and address of ultimate consignee;
    (ii) Name and address of purchaser, if different from ultimate
consignee;
    (iii) Location of foreign trade zone or bonded warehouse if the
items will be exported to a foreign trade zone or bonded warehouse;
    (iv) Type of request, i.e., whether for a single transaction or
multiple transactions;
    (v) Full explanation of the reason(s) for requesting the exception;
    (vi) Nature and duration of the business relationship between you
and ultimate consignee and purchaser shown on the license application;
    (vii) Whether you have previously obtained and/or submitted to BXA
an Import or End-User Certificate issued in the name of the ultimate
consignee and/or purchaser, and a list of the Application Control
Number(s) to which the certificate(s) applied; and
    (viii) Any other facts to justify granting an exception.
    (4) Action by BXA. (i) Single transaction request. Where a single
transaction is involved, BXA will act on the request for exception at
the same time as the license application with which the request is
submitted. In those instances where the related license application is
approved, the issuance of the license will serve as an automatic notice
to the applicant that the exception was approved. If any restrictions
are placed on granting of the exception, these will appear on the
approval. If the request for exception is not approved, BXA will advise
you by letter.

[[Page 12821]]

    (ii) Multiple transactions request. Where multiple transactions are
involved, BXA will advise you by letter of the action taken on the
exception request. The letter will contain any conditions or
restrictions that BXA finds necessary to impose (including an exception
termination date if appropriate). In addition, a written acceptance of
these conditions or restrictions may be required from the parties to
the transaction.
    (e) Availability of original. The original certificate or statement
must be kept on file, and made available for inspection in accordance
with the provisions of part 762 of the EAR. To ensure compliance with
this recordkeeping requirement, BXA will require applicants, on a
random basis, to submit specific original certificates and statements
that have been retained on file. Applicants will be notified in writing
of any such request.

 Sec. 748.13  Delivery Verification (DV).

    (a) Scope. (1) BXA may request applicants to obtain verifications
of delivery on a selective basis. A Delivery Verification Certificate
(DV) is a document issued by the government of the country of ultimate
destination after the export has taken place and the items have either
entered the export jurisdiction of the recipient country or are
otherwise accounted for by the importer to the issuing government.
Governments that issue DVs are listed in Supplement No. 4 to this part.
    (2) If BXA decides to request verification of delivery, the request
will appear as a condition on the face of the license. If the license
is sent directly to a party other than the applicant authorized to
receive the license (e.g., agent, forwarder, broker, etc.), such party
is responsible for notifying the licensee immediately in writing that a
DV is required.
    (b) Exception to obtaining Delivery Verification. The DV
requirement for a particular transaction is automatically canceled if,
subsequent to the issuance of a license, the item is no longer
controlled for national security reasons. In this instance, the
licensee must send a letter to BXA at the address listed in
Sec. 748.2(c) of this part, stating that the items on the license are
no longer controlled for national security reasons, and accordingly,
the request for DV will not be fulfilled by the licensee.
    (c) Procedure for obtaining Delivery Verification. When notified
that a DV is required by BXA, the licensee must transmit to the
importer a written request for a DV at the time of making each shipment
under the license (whenever possible, this request should be submitted
together with the related bill of lading or air waybill). The request
must include the number of the Import or End-User Certificate for the
transaction referred to on the license, and notify the importer that
this same Import or End-User Certificate number should be shown on the
DV.
    (1) The importer must obtain the DV from the appropriate government
ministry identified in Supplement No. 4 to this part, and forward the
completed DV to the licensee. The DV must cover the items described on
the license that have been shipped. Note that BXA must be able to
relate the description provided in the DV to the approved license. In
order to ensure the same terminology is used, the licensee should
provide the importer with the description as it appears on the license.
    (2) The original copy of the DV must be sent to BXA within 90 days
after the last shipment has been made against the license. If
verification of delivery is required for items covered by a license
against which partial shipments have been made, the licensee shall
obtain the required DV for each partial shipment, and retain these on
file until all shipments have been made against the license. Once all
shipments against the license have been made (or the licensee has
determined that none will be), the licensee must forward, in one
package, all applicable DVs to BXA at the address listed in
Sec. 748.2(c) of this part.
    (3) The documents must be forwarded with a dated letter giving the
license number, the name, title and signature of the authorized
representative, and one of the following statements:
    (i) The total quantity authorized by license number ______ has been
exported, and all delivery verification documents are attached.
    (ii) A part of the quantity authorized by license number ______
will not be exported. Delivery verification documents covering all
items exported are attached.
    (iii) No shipment has been made against this license, and none is
contemplated.
    (d) Inability to obtain Delivery Verification Certificates. If a
licensee is unable to obtain the required DV (within the time frame
stated above, or at all) from the importer, the licensee must promptly
notify BXA and, upon request, make available all information and
records, including correspondence, regarding the attempt to obtain the
DV.

appropriate. This explanation must contain an analysis of the item
in terms of the technical control parameters specified in the
appropriate ECCN. If you do not identify a recommended
classification in Block 22(a), you must state the reason you cannot
determine the appropriate classification, identifying any
ambiguities or deficiencies in the regulations that precluded you
from determining the correct classification.
    If additional space is necessary, use Block 24 on Form BXA-748P-
A or B.
    Block 25: You, as the applicant or duly authorized agent of the
applicant, must manually sign the application. If you are an agent

Supplement No. 5 to Part 748--U.S. Import Certificate and Delivery
Verification Procedure

    The United States participates in an Import Certificate/Delivery
Verification procedure. Under this procedure, U.S. importers are
sometimes required to provide their foreign suppliers with an U.S.
International Import Certificate that is validated by the U.S.
Government. This certificate tells the government of the exporter's
country that the items covered by the certificate will be imported
into the U.S. Economy and will not be reexported except as
authorized by U.S. export control regulations. In addition, in some
cases, the exporter's government may require a delivery
verification. Under this procedure, the U.S. Customs Service
validates a certificate confirming that the items have entered the
U.S. economy. The U.S. importer must return this certificate to the
foreign exporter.
    This supplement establishes the procedures and requirements of
BXA with respect to both of these programs. Paragraph (a) of this
Supplement contains the requirements and procedures of the U.S.
International Import Certificate procedure. Paragraph (b) of this
Supplement contains the requirements and procedures of the Delivery
Verification procedure.
    (a) U.S. International Import Certificates. If you are a U.S.
importer, a foreign supplier may request you to obtain a U.S. import
certificate. The reason for this request is that the exporter's
government requires a U.S. import certificate as a condition to
issuing an export license. To obtain such a certificate you will
have to fill in and execute the U.S. International Import
Certificate form (Form BXA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53) and submit it to
the U.S. government agency that has jurisdiction over the items you
are importing. In doing so, you will be making a representation to
the United States Government that you will import the items
described in the certificate into the United States or if not so
imported, you will not divert, transship or reexport them to another
destination with the explicit approval of the U.S. government agency
that has jurisdiction over those items. (Representations that items
will be entered into the U.S. do not preclude the temporary
unloading of items in a foreign trade zone for subsequent entry into
the economy of the U.S.) If the items described in the certificate
are subject to U.S. Department of Commerce jurisdiction, the
Department will validate the certificate and return it to you. You
may then send the certificate to your foreign supplier. In this way
the government of the exporting country is assured that the items
will become subject to the export control laws of the United States.
    (1) Items for which the U.S. Department of Commerce issues U.S.
International Import Certificates and forms to use. The Department
of Commerce issues U.S. International Import Certificates for the
following types of items.
    (i) Items controlled for National Security reasons. Items under
the export licensing jurisdiction of BXA that are identified as
controlled for national security reasons on the Commerce Control
List (Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR). You will need to
submit in triplicate a completed Form BXA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53;
    (ii) Nuclear equipment and materials. Items subject to the
export licensing jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
for nuclear equipment and materials. (see 10 CFR part 110). You will
need to submit in quadruplicate a completed Form BXA-645P/ATF-4522/
DSP-53; and
    (iii) Munitions Items. Items listed on the U.S. Munitions List
(see 22 CFR part 121) that do not appear on the more limited U.S.

[[Page 12828]]
Munitions Import List (27 CFR 47.21). You will need to submit in
triplicate a completed Form BXA-645P. For triangular transactions
(See paragraph (a)(5) of this Supplement) involving items on the
U.S. Munitions List, you must contact the Department of State,
Office of Defense Trade Controls and use Form BXA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-
53. You should contact the Treasury Department, Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms for items appearing on the U.S. Munitions
Import List. You will need to use Form ATF-4522.
    (2) Where to submit forms. U.S. International Import
Certificates and requests to amend certificates may be presented for
validation either in person or by mail at the following locations.
    (i) By mail to the Bureau of Export Administration, P.O. Box
273, Washington D.C. 20044, Attn: Import Certificate Request; or
    (ii) In person or by mail at one of the following Department of
Commerce U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service District Offices:
Boston, MA
Buffalo, NY
Chicago, IL
Cincinnati, OH
Cleveland, OH
Dallas, TX
Detroit, MI
Houston, TX
Kansas City, MO
Los Angeles, CA
Miami, FL
New Orleans, LO
New York, NY
Philadelphia, PA
Phoenix, AZ
Pittsburgh, PA
Portland, OR
St. Louis, MO
San Francisco, CA
Savannah, GA
Seattle, WA
Trenton, NJ

    (3) U.S. International Import Certificate validity periods. The
U.S. International Import Certificate must be submitted to the
foreign government within six months from the date of certification
by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The expiration of this six-month
period in no way affects the responsibility of the importer to
fulfill the commitments made in obtaining the certificate. If the
certificate is not presented to the government of the exporting
country before the expiration of its validity period, the exporter
must apply for a new certificate. The original unused U.S.
International Import Certificate must be returned to BXA at the
address specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement.
    (4) Statements on the certificate or amendments are
representations to the U.S. Government which continue in effect.
    (i) All statements and representations made in a U.S.
International Import Certificate or an amendment thereto, will be
deemed to be continuing in nature until the transaction described in
the certificate is completed and the items are delivered into the
economy of the importing country.
    (ii) Any change of fact or intention in regard to the
transaction described in the certificate shall be promptly disclosed
to BXA by the U.S. importer by presentation of an amended
certificate. The amended certificate must describe all of the
changes and be accompanied by the original certificate bearing the
certification of BXA. If the original certificate has been
transferred to the foreign exporter, you must, where possible,
attempt to obtain the original certificate prior to applying for an
amendment. If the original certificate is unobtainable because the
foreign exporter has submitted it to the appropriate foreign
government, or for any other reason, then you must submit a written
statement with your amendment giving the reasons for your failure to
submit the original certificate.
    (5) Certificates for Triangular transaction (items will not
enter the U.S. or applicant is not sure that they will enter the
United States).
    (i) In accordance with international practice, BXA will, upon
request, stamp the certificate with a triangular symbol as
notification to the government of the exporting country that the
U.S. importer is uncertain whether the items will be imported into
the U. S. or knows that the items will not be imported into the
U.S., but that, in any case, the items will not be delivered to any
other destination except in accordance with the EAR.
    (ii) The triangular symbol on a certificate U.S. International
Import Certificate is not, in and of itself, an approval by BXA to
transfer or sell items to a foreign consignee. Note that a
triangular Certificate will not be issued covering foreign excess
property sold abroad by the U.S. Department of Defense.
    (6) Approval to export items to a foreign consignee prior to
delivery under a U.S. International Import Certificate. The written
approval of BXA is required before items covered by a U.S.
International Import Certificate (whether or not bearing a
triangular symbol) may be shipped to a destination other than the
U.S. or Canada or sold to a foreign purchaser, and before title to
or possession of such items may be transferred to a foreign
transferee. This requirement does not apply after the items have
been delivered in accordance with the undertaking set forth in the
Certificate or if at the time of such shipment, sale, passage of
possession or passage of title, a License Exception or a NLR
provision of the EAR would authorize the transaction.
    (i) If prior approval is required, a letter requesting
authorization to release the shipment shall be submitted to BXA at
the address listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement.
    (ii) The letter must contain the certificate number; date
issued; location of the issuing office; names, addresses, and
identities of all parties to the complete transaction; and the
quantity, dollar value, and description of the items. The letter
must be accompanied by the U.S. International Import Certificate,
and all other documentation required by the EAR for the item and
country of ultimate destination, as identified in part 748 of the
EAR. If requirements stated in part 748 of the EAR do not apply to
your transaction, you must identify the intended end-use of the
items in your letter.
    (iii) Where the letter request is approved and is supported by a
foreign import certificate, no further approval from BXA is required
for the purchaser or transferee to resell or again transfer the
items. However, where BXA approves a request that was not supported
by a foreign import certificate, the person to whom approval is
granted is required to inform the purchaser or transferee, in
writing, that the items are to be shipped to the approved
destination only and that no other disposition of the items is
permitted without the approval of BXA.
    (iv) If the transaction is approved, a validated letter of
approval will be sent to the U.S. purchaser for retention in his
records. Where a DV or other official government confirmation of
delivery is required, the letter will so indicate.
    (v) If the items covered by a certificate have been imported
into a destination other than the U.S. and the foreign exporter of
the items requests a Delivery Verification, the person who obtained
the certificate must obtain a DV from the person to whom the items
were delivered in the actual importing country. (If a DV is
unobtainable, other official government confirmation of delivery
must be obtained.) The DV or other official government confirmation
of delivery must be submitted to BXA together with an explanatory
letter giving the U.S. International Import Certificate number, date
issued, and location of issuing office. BXA will then issue Form
ITA-6008, Delivery Compliance Notice, in two copies, the original of
which must be forwarded to the country of origin in order to serve
as evidence to the exporting country that the requirements of the
U.S. Government have been satisfied with respect to delivery of the
items.
    (vi) Delivery, sale, or transfer of items to another U.S.
purchaser.
    (A) Items covered by a U.S. International Import Certificate may
not be sold, and title to or possession of such items may not be
transferred, to another U.S. purchaser or transferee before the
items are delivered to the U.S. (or to an approved foreign
destination, as provided by paragraph (a)(5) of this Supplement),
except in accordance with the provisions described in paragraph
(a)(6) of this Supplement. The provisions of this paragraph do not
apply after the items have been delivered in accordance with the
undertaking set forth in the certificate.
    (B) Resale or transfer to another U.S. purchaser or transferee
requires the prior approval of BXA only in cases where the buyer or
transferee is listed in Supplement No. 1 to part 766 of the EAR.
However, you, as the person who obtained the certificate are
required to notify BXA of any change in facts or intentions relating
to the transaction, and in all cases you will be held responsible
for the delivery of the items in accordance with the EAR. You are
required in all cases to secure, prior to sale or transfer, and to
retain in your files in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions
contained in part 762 of the EAR, written acceptance by the
purchaser or transferee of:
    (1) All obligations undertaken by, and imposed under the EAR,
upon the holder of the certificate; and

[[Page 12829]]

    (2) An undertaking that all subsequent sales or transfers will
be made subject to the same conditions.
    (iii) The responsibility of the certificate holder for obtaining
a DV also applies to those cases where the items are resold to a
U.S. purchaser (See paragraph (b)(1) of this Supplement.
    (vii) Reexport or transshipment of items after delivery to U.S.
Items imported into the U.S. under the provisions of a U.S.
International Import Certificate may not be reexported to any
destination under the provisions of License Exception TUS (see
Sec. 740.4(c) of the EAR). However, all other provisions of the EAR
applicable to items of domestic origin shall apply to the reexport
of items of foreign origin shipped to the U.S. under a U.S.
International Import Certificate.
    (viii) Lost or destroyed U.S. International Import Certificates.
If a U.S. International Import Certificate is lost or destroyed, a
duplicate copy may be obtained by the person in the U.S. who
executed the original U.S. International Import Certificate by
submitting to any of the offices listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of
this supplement new Form BXA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53 in the same way as
an original request, except that the forms shall be accompanied by a
letter detailing the circumstances under which the original
certificate was lost or destroyed and certifying:
    (A) That the original U.S. International Import Certificate No.
______, dated ______, issued to (name and address of U.S. importer)
for import from (foreign exporter's name and address) has been lost
or destroyed; and
    (B) That if the original U.S. International Import Certificate
is found, the applicant agrees to return the original or duplicate
of the certificate to the Bureau of Export Administration.
    (ix) Unused U.S. International Import Certificates. If the
transaction will not be completed and the U.S. International Import
Certificate will not be used, return the certificate for
cancellation to BXA at the address listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of
this supplement.
    (b) Delivery Verification Certificate. U.S. importers may be
requested by their foreign suppliers to furnish them with a
certified Form BXA-647P, Delivery Verification Certificate, covering
items imported into the U.S. These requests are made by foreign
governments to assure that strategic items shipped to the U.S. are
not diverted from their intended destination. In these instances,
the issuance of an export license by the foreign country is
conditioned upon the subsequent receipt of a Delivery Verification
Certificate from the U.S. importer. Accordingly, your compliance
with your foreign exporter's request for a Delivery Verification is
necessary to ensure your foreign exporter fulfills its government
obligations and is able to participate in future transactions with
you. Failure to comply may subject your exporter to penalties that
may prevent future trade.
    (1) The responsibility of a person or firm executing a U.S.
International Import Certificate for providing the foreign exporter
with confirmation of delivery of the items includes instances where
the items are resold or transferred to another U.S. person or firm
prior to actual delivery to the U.S. or to an approved foreign
destination. The person who executed the U.S. International Import
Certificate shall secure in writing from the U.S. purchaser or
transferee, and retain in your files in accordance with the
recordkeeping provisions stated in part 762 of the EAR:
    (i) Acceptance of the obligation to provide the purchaser or
transferee with either the Delivery Verification (or other official
government confirmation of delivery if a Delivery Verification is
unobtainable) or assurance that this document was submitted to BXA;
and
    (ii) An undertaking that each succeeding U.S. transferee or
purchaser will assume the same obligation or assurance. In each case
the seller or transferor must transmit to the U.S. purchaser or
transferee the U.S. International Import Certificate number covering
the export from the foreign country and request that they pass it on
to any other U.S. purchasers or transferees.
    (2) Completion and certification of Delivery Verification
Certificates. If you are requested by your foreign exporter to
provide a Delivery Verification, you must obtain Form BXA-647P from
a U.S. customs office or one of the offices listed in paragraph
(a)(2) of this supplement and complete all blocks (except those
below the line titled ``To be completed by U.S. Customs Service'')
on the form. The language used in the block titled ``Description of
Goods'' must describe the items in the same terms as those shown on
the applicable U.S. International Import Certificate. Upon
completion Form BXA-647P must be presented, in duplicate, to a U.S.
customs office. The U.S. customs office will certify Form BXA-647P
only where the import is made under a warehouse or consumption
entry.
    (3) Disposition of certified Delivery Verification Certificates.
The importer must send the original certified Delivery Verification
Certificate to the foreign exporter or otherwise dispose of it in
accordance with the instructions of the exporting country. The
duplicate copy will be retained by the U.S. customs office.
    (4)(i) Issuance of a U.S. Delivery Compliance Notice in lieu of
a Delivery Verification Certificate. If you are requested to provide
a Delivery Verification Certificate but do not wish to disclose the
name of your customer to the foreign exporter (e.g., in the event
that the items are resold or transferred to another person or firm
before the items enter the U.S.), you may submit an originally
completed Form BXA-647P together with an explanatory letter
requesting a Delivery Compliance Notice, to BXA at the address
listed in (a)(2)(i) of this supplement.
    (ii) BXA will provide you with a notice signifying that the
items were imported into the U.S. and that a satisfactory DV has
been submitted to BXA. You must then forward the original notice to
your foreign exporter for submission to the foreign government. A
copy of the notice should be retained in your files in accordance
with the recordkeeping provisions stated in part 762 of the EAR.
    (5)(i) Lost or destroyed Delivery Verification Certificate. When
a Delivery Verification Certificate is lost or destroyed, the U.S.
importer must submit a letter to BXA at the address listed in
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement certifying that:
    (A) The original Delivery Verification Certificate has been lost
or destroyed;
    (B) The circumstances under which it was lost or destroyed;
    (C) The type of customs entry (warehouse or consumption), entry
number, and date of entry; and
    (D) The number and date of the related U.S. International Import
Certificate.
    (ii) BXA will, in applicable cases, notify the exporting
government that a Delivery Verification Certificate been issued.
    (c) Penalties and sanctions for violations. The enforcement
provisions of part 764 and Supplement No. 2 to part 736 of the EAR
apply to transactions involving imports into the U.S. covered by
this supplement and to both foreign and U.S. parties involved in a
violation of this supplement. Any provisions of part 764 and
Supplement No. 2 to part 736 of the EAR which, by their terms,
relate to ``exports'' or ``exports from the U.S.'' are also deemed
to apply and extend to imports into the U.S., applications for U.S.
International Import Certificates (Forms BXA-645P presented to U.S.
Department of Commerce for certification), U.S. International Import
Certificates, and Delivery Verification Certificates, described in
this supplement. (Applications the documents described in this
supplement, are included within the definition of export control
documents provided in part 772 of the EAR.) Refer to Sec. 764.3 of
the EAR for more information.

Sec. 750.1  Scope.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR
chapter VII, subchapter C. This part describes the Bureau of Export
Administration's (BXA) process for reviewing your application for a
license, including processing times, denials, revocations, issuance,
duplicates, transfers, and

[[Page 12830]]
shipping tolerances on approved licenses. The processing times for
Classification and Advisory Opinion requests are also provided along
with directions on obtaining status on your pending application.

Sec. 750.2  Processing of Classification Requests and Advisory
Opinions.

    (a) Classification requests. All classification requests submitted
in accordance with procedures described in Sec. 748.3 (a) and (b) of
the EAR will be answered within 14 calendar days after receipt. All
responses will inform the person of the proper classification (e.g.,
whether or not the item is subject to the Export Administration
Regulations (EAR) and, if applicable, the appropriate Export Control
Classification Number [ECCN]).
    (b) Advisory Opinion requests. All advisory opinions submitted in
accordance with procedures described in Sec. 748.3(a) and (c) of the
EAR will be answered within 30 calendar days after receipt.

Sec. 750.3  Review of license applications by BXA and other government
agencies and departments.

    (a) Review by BXA. In reviewing specific license applications, BXA
will conduct a complete analysis of the license application along with
all documentation submitted in support of the application. In addition
to reviewing the item and end-use, BXA will consider the reliability of
each party to the transaction and review any available intelligence
information. To the maximum extent possible, BXA will make licensing
decisions without referral of license applications to other agencies,
however, BXA may consult with other U.S. departments and agencies
regarding any license application.
    (b) Review by other departments or agencies. (1) The Departments of
Defense, Energy, State, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
(ACDA) have the authority to review any license application submitted
under the EAR. In addition, BXA may, where appropriate, refer license
applications to other U.S. government departments or agencies. These
agencies and departments will be referred to as ``agencies'' for the
purposes of this part. Though these agencies have the authority to
review any license application, they may determine that they do not
need to review certain types of license applications. In these
instances, the agency will provide BXA with a Delegation of Authority
to process those license applications without review by that particular
agency.
    (2) The Departments of Defense, Energy, State, and ACDA are
generally concerned with license applications involving items
controlled for national security, missile technology, nuclear
nonproliferation, and chemical and biological weapons proliferation
reasons or destined for countries and/or end uses of concern. In
particular, these agencies are concerned with reviewing license
applications as follows:
    (i) The Department of Defense is concerned primarily with items
controlled for national security and regional stability reasons;
    (ii) The Department of Energy is concerned primarily with items
controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons;
    (iii) The Department of State is concerned primarily with items
controlled for regional stability, anti-terrorism, crime control
reasons, and sanctions; and
    (iv) ACDA is concerned primarily with items controlled for national
security, nuclear nonproliferation, regional stability, and anti-
terrorism reasons.

Sec. 750.4  Procedures for processing license applications.

    (a) Overview. (1) All license applications will be resolved or
referred to the President no later than 90 calendar days from the date
of BXA's registration of the license application. Processing times for
the purposes of this section are defined in calendar days. The
procedures and time limits described in this part apply to all license
applications registered on or after February 4, 1996. The procedures
and time limits in effect prior to December 6, 1995 will apply to
license applications registered prior to February 4, 1996.
    (2) Properly completed license applications will be registered
promptly upon receipt by BXA. Registration is defined as the point at
which the application is entered into BXA's electronic license
processing system. If your application contains deficiencies that
prevent BXA from registering your application, BXA will attempt to
contact you to correct the deficiencies, however, if BXA is unable to
contact you, the license application will be returned without being
registered. The specific deficiencies requiring return will be
enumerated in a notice accompanying the returned license application.
If a license application is registered, but BXA is unable to correct
deficiencies crucial to processing the license application, it will be
returned without action. The notice will identify the deficiencies and
the action necessary to correct the deficiencies. If you decide to
resubmit the license application, it will be treated as a new license
application when calculating license processing time frames.
    (b) Actions not included in processing time calculations. The
following actions will not be counted in the time period calculations
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the processing of
license applications:
    (1) Agreement by the applicant to the delay. BXA may request
applicants provide additional information in support of their license
application, respond to questions arising during processing, or accept
proposed conditions or riders on their license application. If BXA has
provided the applicant with an intent to deny letter described in
Sec. 750.6 of this part, processing times may be suspended in order to
negotiate modifications to a license application and obtain agreement
to such modifications from the foreign parties to the license
application.
    (2) Pre-license checks. If a pre-license check, to establish the
identity and reliability of the recipient of the controlled items, is
conducted through government channels, provided that:
    (i) The need for such a pre-license check is established by the
Secretary, or by another agency, if the request for a pre-license check
is made by such agency and the request is made in accordance with the
following time frames;
    (A) The pre-license check is requested within 5 days of the
determination that it is necessary; and
    (B) The analysis resulting from the pre-license check is completed
within 5 days.
    (3) Government-to-Government assurances. Requests for government-
to-government assurances of suitable end-use of items approved for
export or reexport when failure to obtain such assurances would result
in rejection of the license application, provided that:
    (i) The request for such assurances is sent to the Secretary of
State within five days of the determination that the assurances are
required;
    (ii) The Secretary of State initiates the request of the relevant
government within 10 days of receipt of the request for such
assurances; and
    (iii) The license is issued within 5 days of the Secretary's
receipt of the requested assurances.
    (4) Consultations. Consultation with other governments, if such
consultation is provided for by a relevant bilateral

[[Page 12831]]
arrangement or multilateral regime as a precondition for approving a
license.
    (5) Multilateral reviews. Multilateral review of a license
application if such review is required by the relevant multilateral
regime.
    (6) Congressional notification. Under Section 6(j) of the Export
Administration Act, as amended (EAA), the Secretaries of Commerce and
State are required to notify appropriate Committees of the Congress 30
days prior to issuing a license to any country designated by the
Secretary of State as being terrorist supporting for any items that
could make a significant contribution to the military potential of such
countries, or could enhance the ability of such countries to support
acts of international terrorism. Accordingly, the issuance of any
license subject to this requirement will be delayed for 30 days.
    (i) Designated countries. The following countries have been
designated by the Secretary of State as terrorist-supporting countries:
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
    (ii) Items subject to notification requirement. License
applications involving the export or reexport of the following items to
the military, police, intelligence or other sensitive end-users are
subject to this notification requirement:
    (A) All items controlled for national security reasons, except
digital computers with a Composite Theoretical Performance (CTP) less
than 500 Mtops;
    (B) All items controlled for chemical and biological weapons
proliferation reasons;
    (C) All items controlled for missile technology reasons;
    (D) All items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons; and
    (E) All items controlled by the CCL where the entry heading
identifies the items controlled as those contained in the International
Munitions List.
    (iii) Additional notifications. The Secretaries of Commerce and
State must also notify the appropriate Congressional committees 30 days
before a license is issued for the export or reexport of any item
controlled on the CCL to a designated country if the Secretary of State
determines that the export or reexport ``could make a significant
contribution to the military potential of such country, including its
military logistics capability, or could enhance the ability of such
country to support acts of international terrorism.''
    (c) Initial processing. Within 9 days of license application
registration, BXA will, as appropriate:
    (1) Contact the applicant if additional information is required, if
the license application is improperly completed, or required support
documents are missing, to request additional or corrected information;
    (2) Assure the stated classification on the license application is
correct;
    (3) Return the license application if a license is not required
with a statement notifying the applicant that a license is not
required;
    (4) Approve the license application or notify the applicant of the
intent to deny the license application; or
    (5) Refer the license application electronically along with all
necessary recommendations and analysis concurrently to all agencies
unless the application is subject to a Delegation of Authority. Any
relevant information not contained in the electronic file will be
simultaneously forwarded in paper copy.
    (d) Review by other agencies and/or interagency groups.
    (1) Within 10 days of receipt of a referral the reviewing agency
must advise BXA of any information not contained in the referral as
described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. BXA will promptly
request such information from the applicant. The time that elapses
between the date the information is requested by the reviewing agency
and the date the information is received by the reviewing agency will
not be counted in processing time frames.
    (2) Within 30 days of receipt of the initial referral, the
reviewing agency will provide BXA with a recommendation either to
approve (with or without conditions or riders) or deny the license
application. As appropriate, such a recommendation may be made with the
benefit of consultation and/or discussions in interagency groups
established to provide expertise and coordinate interagency
consultation. These interagency groups consist of:
    (i) The Missile Technology Export Control Group (MTEC). The MTEC,
chaired by the Department of State, reviews license applications
involving items controlled for missile technology reasons. The MTEC
also reviews license applications involving items not controlled for
missile technology (MT) reasons, but destined for a country and/or end-
use/end-user of MT concern.
    (ii) The SubGroup on Nuclear Export Coordination (SNEC). The SNEC,
chaired by the Department of State, reviews license applications
involving items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons. The
SNEC also reviews license applications involving items not controlled
for nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons, but destined for a country
and/or end-use/end-user of NP concern.
    (iii) The Shield. The Shield, chaired by the Department of State,
reviews license applications involving items controlled for chemical
and biological weapons reasons. The Shield also reviews license
applications involving items not controlled for chemical and biological
weapons (CBW) reasons, but destined for a country and/or end-use/end-
user of CBW concern.
    (e) Recommendations by reviewing agencies. Reviewing agencies
recommending denial of a license application must provide a statement
of reasons, consistent with the provisions of the EAA or EAR, and cite
both the statutory and the regulatory basis for the recommendation to
deny. A reviewing agency that fails to provide a recommendation within
30 days with a statement of reasons supported by the statutory and
regulatory basis shall be deemed to have no objection to the final
decision of BXA.
    (f) Interagency dispute resolution and escalation procedures--(1)
Escalation to the Operating Committee (OC). (i) In any instance where
the reviewing agencies are not in agreement on final disposition of a
license application, it will be escalated to the OC for resolution. The
Chair of the OC will consider the recommendations of the reviewing
agencies and any information provided by the applicant in person during
an open OC session. Each agency will be informed of the Chair's
decision on the license application within 14 days after the deadline
for receiving agency recommendations.
    (ii) If any agency disagrees with the OC Chair's decision, the
agency may escalate the decision by appealing to the Chair of the
Advisory Committee on Export Policy for resolution. If such a request
for escalation is not made within 5 days of the decision of the OC
Chair, the Chair's decision will be final.
    (2) Escalation to the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP).
Requests for escalation to the ACEP must be in writing from an official
appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate,
or a person properly acting in such capacity, and cite both the
statutory and the regulatory basis for the appeal. The ACEP will review
all relevant information and recommendations. The Chair of the ACEP
will inform the reviewing agencies of the majority vote decision of the
ACEP within 11 days from the date of receipt of the escalation request.
Within 5 days of the decision, any dissenting agency may appeal in
writing the ACEP's decision to the

[[Page 12832]]
Secretary of Commerce in the Secretary's capacity as the Chair of the
Export Administration Review Board. The written request must be made by
the head of the agency requesting escalation and cite both the
statutory and the regulatory basis for the appeal. Within the same
period of time, the Secretary may initiate a meeting on his or her own
initiative to consider a license application. In the absence of a
timely appeal, the decision of the ACEP will be final.
    (3) Escalation to the Export Administration Review Board (EARB).
The EARB will review all relevant information and recommendations, and
such other export control matters as may be appropriate. The Secretary
of Commerce will inform the reviewing agencies of the majority vote
decision of the EARB within 11 days from the date of receipt of the
appeal. Within 5 days of the decision, any agency dissenting from the
decision of the EARB may appeal the decision to the President. The
appeal must be in writing from the head of the dissenting agency. In
the absence of a timely appeal, the decision of the EARB will be final.

Sec. 750.5  Status of pending applications and other requests.

    (a) Information available. You may contact BXA for status of your
pending Classification Request, Advisory Opinion, or license
application. For Advisory Opinion requests, telephone (202) 482-4905 or
send a fax to (202) 219-9179. For license applications and
Classification requests, telephone BXA's System for Tracking Export
License Applications (``STELA'') at (202) 482-2752. STELA is an
automated voice response system, that upon request via any standard
touch-tone telephone, will provide you with up to the minute status on
any license application pending at BXA. Requests for status may be made
only by the applicant or the applicant's agent.
    (b) STELA's hours. STELA is operational Monday through Friday from
7:15am to 11:15pm and on Saturday from 8:00am to 4:00pm, Eastern Time.
If you have any difficulty accessing STELA, contact during normal
business hours, one of BXA's offices listed in Sec. 748.2(a) of the
EAR.
    (c) Procedures to access information on STELA. Once you dial STELA
you will be instructed to enter your Application Control Number using
your push button telephone keys. After you enter the Application
Control Number, STELA will provide you with the current status of your
license application or Classification request.

Sec. 750.6  Denial of license applications.

    (a) Intent to deny notification. If BXA intends to deny your
license application, BXA will notify you in writing within 5 days of
the decision. The notification will include:
    (1) The intent to deny decision;
    (2) The statutory and regulatory basis for the denial;
    (3) To the extent consistent with the national security and foreign
policy of the United States, the specific considerations that led to
the decision to deny the license application;
    (4) What, if any, modifications or restrictions to the license
application would allow BXA to reconsider the license application;
    (5) The name of the BXA representative in a position to discuss the
issues with the applicant; and
    (6) The availability of appeal procedures.
    (b) Response to intent to deny notification. You will be allowed 20
days from the date of the notification to respond to the decision
before the license application is denied. If you respond to the
notification, BXA will advise you if, as a result of your response, the
decision to deny has been changed. Unless you are so advised by the
45th day after the date of the notification, the denial will become
final, without further notice. You will then have 45 days from the date
of final denial to exercise the right to appeal under part 756 of the
EAR.

Sec. 750.7  Issuance of licenses.

    (a) Scope. A license authorizes only a specific transaction, or
series of transactions, as described in the license application and any
supporting documents. A license application may be approved in whole or
in part or further limited by conditions or other restrictions
appearing on the license itself or in the EAR. When a license
application is approved by the BXA, a license is issued as described in
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Issuance of a license. After a license application is approved,
a computer generated license is issued by the Department of Commerce
bearing the license number and a validation date. Where appropriate,
the license will also show an expiration date. Where necessary,
attachments to a license will also be validated with the Department of
Commerce seal and the date of validation. Exporters must use the
complete license number when preparing a Shipper's Export Declaration
(SED) and other export control documents, and in communicating with the
Department of Commerce concerning the license.
    (c) Changes to the license. The following non-material changes do
not require submission of a ``Replacement'' license or any other
notification to BXA. (If you wish to make any change not identified in
this paragraph, you will need to submit a ``Replacement'' license in
accordance with the instructions contained in Supplement No. 1 to part
748 of the EAR, Block 11):
    (1) Decrease in unit price or total value;
    (2) Increase in price or quantity if permitted under the shipping
tolerances in Sec. 750.11 of this part;
    (3) Increase in price that can be justified on the basis of changes
in point of delivery, port of export, or as a result of transportation
cost, drayage, port charges, warehousing, currency fluctuations, etc.;
    (4) Establishment of unit or total price in conformance with a
``price statement'' on a license that permits price to be based on the
market price at a specified date plus an exporter's mark-up, or like
basis;
    (5) Change in intermediate consignee if the new intermediate
consignee is located in the country of ultimate destination as shown on
the license, except a change in, or addition of, an intermediate
consignee involving a consolidated shipment;
    (6) Change in continuity of shipment by unloading from carrier at a
country listed in Country Group B (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of
the EAR) port not in the country of ultimate destination, without the
designation of an intermediate consignee on the shipping documents and
license, provided:
    (i) The purpose is to transfer the shipment to another vessel,
barge, or vehicle, solely for onforwarding to the country of
destination shown on the shipping documents and the license;
    (ii) The shipment is moving on a through bill of lading;
    (iii) The carrier is not registered in, owned or controlled by, or
under charter or lease to a country in Country Group D:1 or E:2 (see
Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), or a national of any of these
countries;
    (iv) The carrier retains custody of the shipment until it is
delivered to the ultimate consignee; and
    (v) The original bill of lading or air waybill first issued at the
port of export is delivered with the shipment to the ultimate
consignee;
    (7) Change in address of purchaser or ultimate consignee if the new
address is located within the same country shown on the license; or
    (8) Change in ECCN, unit of quantity, unit price, or wording of the
item

[[Page 12833]]
description (where necessary only for the purpose of conforming to an
official revision in the CCL). This does not cover an actual change in
the item to be shipped, or an increase in the price or quantity.
    (d) Responsibility of the licensee. If a license is issued to you,
you become the licensee. The licensee will be held accountable for use
of the license, whether as a principal (exporting for your own account)
or as an agent (including an agent acting for the account of a foreign
principal who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States).
You, as the licensee, assume responsibility for effecting the export or
reexport, for proper use of the license, and for due performance of all
of the license's terms and conditions. The obligations arising under
the provisions of the EAA and the EAR are the same whether the license
application is submitted and issued in writing or electronically.
    (e) Prohibited use of a license. No person convicted of a violation
of any statute specified in section 11(h) of the EAA, at the discretion
of the Secretary of Commerce, may apply for any license for a period up
to 10 years from the date of the conviction. See Sec. 766.25 of the
EAR.
    (f) Quantity of commodities authorized. Unlike software and
technology, commodities will be approved with a quantity or dollar
value limit. The ``Unit'' paragraph within each CCL commodity entry
will list a specific ``Unit'' for those commodities controlled by that
entry. Any license resulting from a license application to export or
reexport commodities will be licensed in terms of the specified
``Unit''. If a commodity is licensed in terms of ``$ value'', the unit
of quantity commonly used in trade may also be shown on the license.
Though this unit may be shown on the approved license, the quantity of
commodities authorized is limited entirely by the total dollar value
shown on the approved license.
    (g) License validity period. Licenses involving the export or
reexport of items will generally have a 24-month validity period,
unless a different validity period has been requested and specifically
approved by BXA. Exceptions from the 24-month validity period include,
license applications reviewed and approved as an ``emergency'' (See
Sec. 748.5 (g) of the EAR), license applications for items controlled
for short supply reasons, and Special Comprehensive Licenses.
    Emergency licenses will expire no later than the last day of the
calendar month following the month in which the emergency license is
issued. Licenses for items controlled for short supply reasons will be
limited to a 12-month validity period. The expiration date will be
clearly stated on the face of the license. If the expiration date falls
on a legal holiday (Federal or State), the validity period is
automatically extended to midnight of the first day of business
following the expiration date. (See part 752 of the EAR for validity
periods for Special Comprehensive Licenses.)
    (1) Extended validity period. Validity periods in excess of 24
months generally will not be granted. BXA will consider granting a
validity period exceeding 24 months when extenuating circumstances
warrant such an extension, however, no changes will be approved related
to any other particular on the license (e.g., parties to the
transaction, countries of ultimate destination, etc.). For example, an
extended validity period will generally be granted where the
transaction is related to a multi-year project, when production lead
time will not permit an export or reexport during the original validity
period of the license, when an unforeseen emergency prevents shipment
within the 24-month validity of the license, or for other similar
circumstances. A continuing requirement to supply spare or replacement
parts will not normally justify an extended validity period. Licenses
issued in accordance with the emergency clearance provisions contained
in Sec. 748.5(g) of the EAR will not be extended. See Sec. 752.9 of the
EAR for information relating to the extension of a Special
Comprehensive License.
    (2) Request for extension. (i) The applicant must submit a letter
in writing to request an extension in the validity period of a
previously approved license. The subject of the letter must be titled:
``Request for Validity Period Extension'' and contain the following
information:
    (A) The name, address, and telephone number of the requestor;
    (B) A copy of the original license, with the license number,
validation date, and current expiration date legible; and
    (C) Justification for the extension;
    (ii) It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that all
applicable support documents remain valid and are in the possession of
the applicant. If the request for extension is approved, BXA will
provide the applicant with a written response.
    (h) Specific types of licenses--(1) Licenses for temporary exports
or reexports. If you have been granted a license for the temporary
export or reexport of items and you decide not to return the items to
the United States, you must submit a license application requesting
authorization to dispose of the items. Except when the items are to be
used on a temporary basis at a new destination (and returned to the
United States after such use), you must ensure that your license
application is accompanied by all documents that would be required if
you had requested a license to export or reexport the same item
directly to the new destination.
    (2) Intransit within the United States. If you have been issued a
license authorizing an intransit shipment (that does not qualify for
License Exception TUS) through the United States, your license will be
valid only for the export of the intransit shipment wholly of foreign
origin and for which a Transportation and Exportation customs entry or
an Immediate Exportation customs entry is outstanding.
    (3) Intransit outside the United States. If you have been issued a
license authorizing unlading or transit through a country listed in the
General Prohibition Eight contained in Sec. 736.2(b)(8) of the EAR, and
you did not know the identity of the intermediate consignee at the time
of the original license application, you must notify BXA in writing
once you have ascertained the identity of the intermediate consignee.
Your notification must contain the original license number, and the
complete name, address, and telephone number of the intermediate
consignee. The written request must be submitted to BXA at the address
listed in Sec. 748.2(c) of the EAR.
    (4) Replacement license. If you have been issued a ``replacement''
license (for changes to your original license that were not covered in
paragraph (c) of this section), you must attach the ``replacement''
license to the original, and retain both.
    (i) Records. If you have been issued a license you must retain the
license, and maintain complete records in accordance with part 762 of
the EAR including any licenses (whether used or unused, valid or
expired) and all supporting documents and shipping records.

Sec. 750.8  Revocation or suspension of licenses.

    (a) Revocation. All licenses for exports or reexports are subject
to revision, suspension, or revocation, in whole or in part, without
notice whenever it is known that the EAR have been violated or that a
violation is about to occur. BXA's Office of Exporter Services may
revoke any license in which a person who has been convicted of one of
the statutes specified in section 11(h) of the EAA, at the

[[Page 12834]]
discretion of the Secretary of Commerce, has an interest in the license
at the time of the conviction. It may be necessary for BXA to stop a
shipment or an export or reexport transaction at any stage in the
process (e.g., in order to prevent an unauthorized export or reexport).
If a shipment is already en route, it may be further necessary for BXA
to order the return or unloading of such shipment at any port of call
in accordance with the provisions of the EAA.
    (b) Return of revoked or suspended licenses. If BXA revokes or
suspends a license, the licensee shall return the license immediately
upon notification that the license has been suspended or revoked. The
license must be returned to BXA at the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c)
of the EAR, Attn:'' Return of Revoked/Suspended License''. All
applicable supporting documents and records of shipments must be
retained by the licensee in accordance with the recordkeeping
provisions of part 762 of the EAR. If the licensee fails to return a
license immediately upon notification that it has been suspended or
revoked, BXA may impose sanctions provided for in part 764 of the EAR.

Sec. 750.9  Duplicate licenses.

    (a) Lost, stolen or destroyed. If a license is lost, stolen or
destroyed, you, as the licensee, may obtain a duplicate of the license
by submitting a letter to the BXA at the address listed in
Sec. 748.2(c) of the EAR, Attention: Duplicate License Request''. You
must certify in your letter:
    (1) That the original license ([number] issued to [name and address
of licensee]) has been lost, stolen or destroyed;
    (2) The circumstances under which it was lost, stolen or destroyed;
and
    (3) If the original license is found, the licensee will return
either the original or duplicate license to the BXA. Note that if
shipment was made against the original license, those shipments must be
counted against the duplicate license. If you are issued a duplicate
license you must retain the duplicate license in accordance with the
recordkeeping provisions of part 762 of the EAR.
    (b) Hong Kong Trade Department. BXA will automatically issue a
duplicate license whenever the license lists a party in Hong Kong as
the intermediate consignee, or when Hong Kong is identified as the
country from which the reexport will take place. The duplicate license
will be labeled ``Duplicate for Hong Kong Trade Department''. This
duplicate must be forwarded to the reexporter or intermediate consignee
for submission to the Hong Kong Trade Department. The original license
must be retained on file by the licensee in accordance with the
recordkeeping provisions contained in part 762 of the EAR.

Sec. 750.10  Transfers of licenses for exports.

    (a) Authorization. As the licensee, you may not transfer a license
issued for the export of items from the United States to any other
party, except with the prior written approval of BXA. BXA may authorize
a transfer of a license for export to a transferee who is subject to
the jurisdiction of the United States, is a principal party in
interest, and will assume all powers and responsibilities under the
license for the control of the shipment of the items out of the United
States. BXA will approve only one transfer of the same license and only
transfers of licenses to export items.
    (b) How to request the transfer of licenses--(1) Letter from
licensee. You, as the licensee, must submit a letter in writing to
request a transfer of a license or licenses. The letter must contain
the following information:
    (i) The reasons for the requested transfer;
    (ii) Either a list of the outstanding license numbers or a
statement that all outstanding licenses in the name of the licensee are
to be transferred, and the total number of such outstanding licenses;
    (iii) A list of all license applications for export to be
transferred that are pending with BXA, identifying the Application
Control Number for each, or other information that will assist in
identifying the pending license applications;
    (iv) Name and address of the person you intend to transfer the
licenses and license applications to;
    (v) The facts necessitating transfer;
    (vi) A statement as to whether or not any consideration has been,
or will be, paid for the transfer; and
    (vii) Identification by name of the legal document (certificate,
agreement, etc.) or other authority by which the new firm name is
legally established, the new corporation or firm created, or the assets
transferred and showing the effective date of such document and the
state where filed or recorded.
    (2) Information from transferee. The person to whom you wish to
transfer your license(s) must provide you a signed letter, that must be
submitted with your request, containing the following:
    (i) That the transferee is a principal party in interest in the
transaction covered by the license, or is acting as agent for a
principal party in interest;
    (ii) That the transferee is subject to the jurisdiction of the
United States;
    (iii) That the transferee assumes all powers and responsibilities
under the license for the control of the shipment of the items out of
the United States;
    (iv) Whether any consideration has been, has not been, or will be
paid for the transfer;
    (v) The name and address of the foreign principal in instances
where the transferee will make the export as an agent on behalf of a
foreign principal; and
    (vi) If the license is to be transferred to a subsidiary or firm,
or if you transfer to the transferee all, or a substantial portion, of
your assets or business, the transferee must certify that the legal
authority changing the exporter imposes on the transferee the
responsibility to accept and fulfill the obligations of the transferor
under the transactions covered by the license; and
    (vii) The following certification:
    The undersigned hereby certifies that, if license number(s)
____________ is (are) transferred in accordance with my (our) request,
any and all documents evidencing the order covered by this (these)
license(s) will be retained and made available upon request in
compliance with the recordkeeping provisions contained in Part 762 of
the Export Administration Regulations. The undersigned further
certifies compliance with all requirements of the Export Administration
Regulations regarding these licenses.
    (c) Notification of transfer and recordkeeping. Unless instructed
otherwise by BXA, you must retain the license(s) pending notification
by the BXA of the action taken. If the request is approved, you must
forward the license(s) to the transferee and the validated letter
received from BXA authorizing the transfer. If the transfer request is
not approved, the license(s) must either be returned to BXA or used by
you if you so choose and have retained the legal and operational
capacity fully to meet the responsibilities imposed by the license(s).
If your initial request is returned by BXA for additional information,
after obtaining the necessary information you may resubmit your
request.

Sec. 750.11  Shipping tolerances.

    (a) Applicability and use of shipping tolerances. Under some
circumstances, you may use a license issued for the export of items
from the United States to export more than the quantity or value shown
on that license. This additional amount is called a shipping tolerance.
This section tells you, as the licensee, when you may take advantage of
a shipping tolerance and the amount

[[Page 12835]]
of shipping tolerance you are permitted to use.
    (1) If you have already shipped the full amount approved on your
license, you may not use this shipping tolerance provision. No further
shipment may be made under the license.
    (2) The amount of shipping tolerance you are permitted is based on
the ``Unit'' specified for the item you want to export in the
applicable ECCN on the CCL (see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the
EAR). You must calculate shipping tolerance based on the applicable
``Unit'' whether that be Number, Dollar Value, or Area, Weight, or
other Measure. You may not use any other unit that may appear on your
license.
    (b) Calculating shipping tolerances. There are three basic rules,
one for items licensed by ``Dollar Value'', one for items licensed by
``Number'', and another for items licensed by ``Area, Weight or other
Measure''.
    (1) Items licensed by ``Dollar Value''. If the ``Unit'' paragraph
in the ECCN applicable to your item reads ``Sec. value'' or ``in
Sec. value'', there is no shipping tolerance. You may not ship more
than the total dollar value stated on your license.
    (2) Items licensed by ``Number''. If the ``Unit'' paragraph in the
ECCN applicable to your item reads ``Number'' or ``in Number'', there
is no shipping tolerance with respect to the number of units. However,
the value of all of your shipments under one license may exceed the
total dollar value stated on that license by up to 25%.
    (3) Items licensed by ``Area, Weight or Measure''. If the ``Unit''
paragraph in the ECCN applicable to your item reads ``kilograms'' or
``square meters'' or some other unit of area, weight or measure, your
shipment may exceed the unshipped balance of the area, weight or other
measure listed on your license by up to 10% and the total dollar value
shown on your license by up to 25%, unless;
    (i) Your license stipulates a specific shipping tolerance; or
    (ii) Your item is controlled for short supply reasons and a smaller
tolerance has been established. (See part 754 of the EAR).
    (c) Examples of shipping tolerances.--(1) A license authorizes the
export of 100,000 kilograms of an item controlled by an ECCN where the
``Unit'' is stated as ``kilograms'', the total cost of which is
$1,000,000:
    (i) One shipment. If one shipment is made, the quantity that may be
exported may not exceed 110,000 kg (10% tolerance on the unshipped
Area, Weight, or Measure balance), and the total cost of that one
shipment may not exceed $1,250,000:

$1,000,000..  (the total value shown on the license)
+250,000....  (25% of the total value shown on the license)
-------------
$1,250,000..


    (ii) Two shipments. If the first shipment is for 40,000 kg (valued
at $400,000), the second shipment may not exceed 66,000 kg (10% of the
unshipped balance of 60,000 kg (6,000 kg) plus the unshipped balance),
and the total cost of the second shipment shall not exceed $850,000:

$600,000....  (the value of the unshipped balance of 60,000 kg)
+250,000....  (25% of the original total value shown on the license)
-------------
$850,000....


    (iii) Three shipments. If the first shipment is for 40,000 kg
(valued at $400,000) the second shipment is for 20,000 kg (valued at
$200,000), the third shipment may not exceed 44,000 kg (10% of the
unshipped balance of 40,000 kg (4,000 kg) plus the unshipped balance),
and the total cost of the third shipment can not exceed $650,000:

$400,000....  (the value of the unshipped balance of 40,000 kg)
+250,000....  (25% of the original total value on the license)
-------------
$650,000....


    (2) A license authorizes the export of an item controlled by an
ECCN where the ``Unit'' is stated as ``$ value'', the total cost of
which is $5,000,000. There is no shipping tolerance on this license
because the items are controlled by an ECCN where ``$ value'' is the
stated ``Unit''.
    (3) A license authorizes the export of 10 pieces of equipment
controlled by an ECCN where the ``Unit'' is stated as ``Number'', with
a total value of $10,000,000 and the export of parts and accessories
covered by that same entry valued at $1,000,000:
    (i)(A) If one shipment is made, the quantity of equipment that may
be exported may not exceed 10 pieces of equipment because there is no
shipping tolerance on the ``number'' of units. That one shipment of
equipment may not exceed $12,500,000:

$10,000,000.  (the total value shown on the license)
+2,500,000..  (25% of the total value shown on the license)
-------------
$12,500,000.


    (B) If the one shipment includes parts and accessories, those parts
and accessories may not exceed $1,000,000 because there is no shipping
tolerance on any commodity licensed in terms of dollar value.
    (ii)(A) If the first shipment is for 4 pieces of equipment valued
at $4,000,000, the second shipment may not exceed 6 pieces of equipment
(no tolerance on ``number'') valued at no more than $8,500,000:

$6,000,000..  (the value of the unshipped 6 pieces).
+2,500,000..  (25% of the original total value shown on the license).
-------------
$8,500,000..


    (B) If the first shipment includes $300,000 of parts and
accessories, the second shipment may not exceed $700,000 of parts and
accessories because there is no shipping tolerance on any commodity
licensed in terms of dollar value.
    (iii)(A) If the first shipment is for 4 pieces of equipment valued
at $4,000,000 and the second shipment is for 3 pieces of equipment
valued at $3,000,000, the third shipment may not exceed 3 pieces of
equipment (no tolerance on ``number'') valued at no more than
$5,500,000:

$3,000,000..  (the value of the unshipped 3 pieces).
+2,500,000..  (25% of the original value shown on the license),
-------------
$5,500,000..


    (B) If the first shipment includes $300,000 of parts and
accessories and the second shipment includes another $300,000, the
third shipment may not exceed $400,000 because there is no shipping
tolerance on commodities licensed in terms of dollar value.

E.O. 12924, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 917; Notice of August 15, 1995 (60
FR 42767, August 17, 1995).

Sec. 752.1  Scope.

    (a)(1) Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR are
references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part describes the
provisions of the Special Comprehensive License (SCL). You may apply
for an SCL, when appropriate, in lieu of a license described in part
748 of the EAR, or a License Exception described in part 740 of the
EAR, for multiple exports and reexports of items subject to the EAR.
The SCL provides authorization to make specified exports and reexports
that are otherwise prohibited by General Prohibitions One, Two, and
Three described in part 734 of the EAR. The existence of an SCL does
not supersede an exporter's obligation to request a separate license as
may be required by part 744 of the EAR. Because the Bureau of Export
Administration (BXA) does not review each individual transaction
authorized by an SCL, parties to the SCL must have the mechanisms in
place to ensure that each export and reexport made under an SCL meets
all the terms and conditions of the license and are in accordance with
all applicable provisions of the EAR. It is through the design and
effective implementation of an Internal Control Program (ICP) that the
SCL holder and the SCL consignee (referred to as ``consignee'' for
purposes of this part) assure that exports and reexports are not made
contrary to the EAR.
    (2) Definitions. (i) SCL holder. As used in this part, ``SCL
holder'' is that party approved on an SCL to perform activities
approved under the SCL.
    (ii) SCL consignee. As used in this part, ``SCL consignee'' or
``consignee'' means any party authorized to receive items under the SCL
and named as a consignee on an approved Form BXA-752, Statement by
Consignee in Support of Special Comprehensive License.
    (b) ICP requirement. To qualify for an SCL, you must develop an
ICP. Section 752.11 of this part includes a general description of the
elements of the ICP, and guidance on which elements your company must
implement before making shipments under the SCL. The elements of the
ICP your company will develop reflect the complexity of the activities
authorized under the SCL, the countries and items involved, and the
relationship between the SCL holder and the approved consignees. BXA
may require you to include in your ICP any combination of elements,
depending upon the nature of your SCL application. During your pre-
application consultation required by Sec. 752.5(a)(1), BXA will provide
you guidance on which elements you must implement.

Sec. 752.2  Eligible activities.

    (a) Possible authorizations. Under the SCL, BXA may authorize you
to perform any number of activities, which can be grouped under the
general categories of ``service'', ``end-user'', ``distribution'' and
``other'' activities. Examples of the general categories include:
    (1) Service activities. Exporting items subject to the EAR as spare
and replacement parts for servicing or stocking.
    (2) End-user activities. Exporting and reexporting items subject to
the EAR for use as capital equipment.
    (3) Distribution activities. Exporting and reexporting items
subject to the EAR for the purpose of resale and reexport by
consignees.
    (4) Other activities. Other activities not included in paragraphs
(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section may be authorized by BXA under
the SCL on a case-by-case basis.
    (b) Prohibited activities. The general prohibitions described in
Sec. 736.2(b)(4) through (10) of the EAR apply to all exports and
reexports by, and conduct of, all parties approved on your SCL, unless
you are specifically authorized under the SCL to perform such
activities, or the particular activity otherwise qualifies for a
License Exception described in part 740 of the EAR.

Sec. 752.3  Eligible items.

    (a) All items subject to the EAR, including items eligible for
License Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR, are eligible for
export and reexport under the SCL, except:
    (1) Items controlled for missile technology reasons that are
identified by the letters MT in the applicable ``Reason for Control''
paragraph on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (see Supplement No. 1 to
part 774 of the EAR);
    (2) Items controlled by ECCNs 1C351, 1C352, 1C353, 1C354, 1E001,
1E351, 1E391, 2B352, and 2E301 on the CCL that can be used in the
production of biological weapons;
    (3) Items controlled by ECCNs 1C350, 1D390, 1E001, 1E350, 1E391,
2B350, and 2B351 on the CCL that can be used in the production of
chemical weapons precursors and chemical warfare agents, to
destinations listed in Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part
740 of the EAR);
    (4) Items controlled for short supply reasons that are identified
by the letters ``SS'' in the applicable ``Reason for Control''
paragraph on the CCL;
    (5) Maritime (civil) nuclear propulsion systems or associated
design or production software and technology identified in Sec. 744.5
of the EAR;
    (6) Communications intercepting devices controlled by ECCN 5A980 on
the CCL;
    (7) Items specifically identified as ineligible by BXA on your
approved SCL; and
    (8) Additional items consistent with international commitments.
    (b) Items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons that are
identified by the letters NP in the applicable ``Reason for Control''
paragraph on the CCL may be authorized on a case-by-case basis provided
controls are in place to screen for proscribed end-users or end-uses.

Sec. 752.4  Eligible countries.

    (a) General provisions. All countries are eligible under the SCL
except:
    (1) Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
    (2) Other countries that BXA may designate on a case-by-case basis
as ineligible to receive items under the SCL.
    (b) Servicing prohibitions. Under the SCL, you may not service any
item when you know that the item is owned or controlled by, or under
the lease or charter of, entities in countries identified in paragraphs
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section or any national of such countries.

Sec. 752.5  Steps you must follow to apply for an SCL.

    (a) Step One: Establish applicant reliability--(1) Pre-application
consultation. To apply for an SCL, BXA must determine your reliability
as a potential SCL holder. BXA usually does this through consultation
with company officials and a review of the criteria identified in
paragraph (a)(2) of this

[[Page 12837]]
section. To determine whether your company requires a consultation
before you apply for an SCL, contact BXA at the address, phone, or
telefacsimile numbers included in Sec. 752.17 of this part.
    (2) Criteria for determining eligibility. BXA will review the
following criteria to help determine SCL holder eligibility:
    (i) Evidence of past licensing history and projected, continuous
large volume exports;
    (ii) Reliability of all parties relative to their compliance with
the EAR;
    (iii) Commitment of all parties of the necessary resources to
implement and maintain an adequate ICP; and
    (iv) Evidence of all parties knowledge of all provisions of the
EAR.
    (b) Step Two: Establish consignee reliability--(1) Requirements.
You must make an initial determination of the reliability of all
consignees that are listed on your application for an SCL, based upon
the criteria described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) Determining reliability. The criteria that you should take into
consideration include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) Criteria. (A) The proposed consignee has a satisfactory record
established through BXA pre-license checks, or extensive experience as
a consignee under any license issued by BXA;
    (B) The proposed consignee is a wholly-owned subsidiary or a
controlled-in-fact affiliate of the applicant or of a consignee that is
already approved on an SCL. See part 772 of the EAR for a definition of
controlled-in-fact; or
    (C) You have evidence of an established, on-going business
relationship with the proposed consignee.
    (ii) Exception. The provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this
section do not preclude the authority of BXA to determine the
reliability and eligibility of a proposed consignee. BXA may, based
upon any negative information on the proposed consignees, deny a
proposed consignee.
    (c) Step Three: Prepare your documentation. Complete Form BXA-748P,
Multipurpose Application, Form BXA-748P-A, Item Appendix, Form BXA-
748P-B, End-User Appendix, an ICP, a comprehensive narrative statement,
Form BXA-752, Statement by Consignee in Support of Special
Comprehensive License, Form BXA-752-A, Reexport Territories, and all
applicable certifications. Submit this documentation to BXA at one of
the addresses included in Sec. 752.17 of this part.
    (1) Form BXA-748P, Multipurpose Application, and Form BXA-748P-A,
Item Appendix. You must complete Form BXA-748P and Form 748P-A
according to the instructions found in Supplement Nos. 1 and 2 of this
part.
    (2) Form BXA-748P-B, End-User Appendix. You must identify end-users
on Form BXA-748P-B if you are requesting approval to export or reexport
items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation or chemical and
biological control reasons.
    (3) ICP. You must provide a copy of your proposed ICP as required
by Sec. 752.11 of this part. You must indicate whether any of the
elements of the ICP will not be implemented and explain why these
elements were deemed inapplicable. Existence of a properly constructed
ICP will not relieve you of your responsibility to comply with
requirements of all applicable regulations pertaining to your SCL;
    (4) Comprehensive narrative statement. Prepare a comprehensive
narrative statement on your company letterhead that includes the
following information:
    (i) An overview of the total business activity that will be
performed by you and all other parties who will receive items under the
authority of your SCL, including consignees, subcontractors, and
vessels;
    (ii) A description of the nature and anticipated volume of regular
and repetitive transactions proposed by consignees under the license;
    (iii) An explanation of the relationship between the parties to the
application, such as affiliate, subsidiary, or parent, etc;
    (iv) A certification that you will implement, upon approval of the
application by BXA, an ICP that incorporates all applicable elements
listed in Sec. 752.11 of this part and any additional elements as
required by BXA upon approval of the SCL; and
    (v) Information on whether proposed consignees are end-users or
will reexport the items received under your SCL. You must describe the

Sec. 752.8  SCL application review process.

    (a) Scope. Under an SCL, you are authorized to make multiple
exports and reexports without review and approval of each individual
transaction by BXA. To approve an SCL, BXA must be satisfied that the
persons benefiting from this license will adhere to the conditions of
the license and the EAR, and that approval of the application will not
be detrimental to U.S. national security, nonproliferation, or foreign
policy interests. In reviewing and approving a specific SCL request,
BXA retains the right to limit the eligibility of items or to prohibit
the export, reexport, or transfer of items under the SCL to specific
firms, individuals, or countries.
    (b) Elements of review. To permit BXA to make such judgments, BXA
will thoroughly analyze your past export and reexport transactions,
inspect your export and reexport documents, and interview company
officials of both the applicant and the consignees, as necessary. If
BXA cannot verify that an appropriate ICP will be implemented upon
approval of the SCL by BXA, or establish the reliability of the
proposed parties to the application, it may deny the application, or
modify it by eliminating certain consignees, items, countries, or
activities.
    (c) Order requirement. You do not need to have in your possession
an order from the proposed consignee at the time you apply for an SCL.
However, evidence of a consignee's firm intention to place orders on a
continuing basis is required.
    (d) Criteria for review. BXA will consider the following factors
during the processing of your SCL application:
    (1) The specific nature of proposed end-use and end-uses;
    (2) The significance of the export in terms of its contribution to
the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of nuclear or
chemical or biological weapons, or missiles;
    (3) The types of assurances against design, development,
production, stockpiling, or use of nuclear or chemical and biological
weapons, or missiles that are included in the ICP;

[[Page 12839]]

    (4) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country;
    (5) Corporate commitment of the resources necessary to implement
and maintain an adequate ICP;
    (6) Evidence of past licensing history of the applicant and
consignees, and projected, continuous large volume exports and/or
reexports;
    (7) Reliability of all parties;
    (8) Information on all parties' compliance with the provisions of
the EAR; and
    (9) All parties' knowledge of the EAR.
    (e) Application processing time-frames. Upon receiving an SCL
application, BXA may review the application for up to two weeks to
determine whether the SCL application is complete. When all
documentation requirements are met, BXA will register the application.
After the date of registration, the SCL application will be processed
according to the procedures described in part 750 of the EAR.

Sec. 752.11  Internal Control Programs.

    (a) Scope--(1) Introduction. It is through Internal Control
Programs (ICPs) that the SCL holder and the consignee assure that
exports and reexports are not made contrary to the EAR. The elements of
your ICP will reflect the complexity of the activities authorized under
the SCL, the countries and items involved, and the relationship between
the SCL holder and the approved consignees.
    (2) General requirements. Prior to making any exports and reexports
under an SCL, you and your consignees, when required, must implement an
ICP that is designed to ensure compliance with the SCL and the EAR.
This section provides an overview of the elements that comprise an ICP.
You may obtain from BXA at the address found in Sec. 752.17 of this
part guidelines to assist you in developing an adequate ICP. You must
submit with your application for an SCL a copy of your proposed ICP,
along with any consignee ICPs, when required, incorporating the
elements described in this section, as appropriate. BXA may require you
to modify your ICP depending upon the activities, items, and
destinations requested on your application for an SCL.
    (b) Requirements. You may not make any shipments under an SCL until
you and your consignees, when appropriate, implement all the elements
of the required ICP. If there are elements that you consider
inapplicable, you must explain the reasons for this determination at
the time of application for an SCL. Existence of a properly constructed
ICP will not relieve the SCL holder of liability for improper use or
failure to comply with the requirements of the EAR.
    (c) Elements of an ICP. Following is a list of ICP elements. The
specific elements that should be included in your ICP depend upon the
complexity of the activities authorized under your SCL, the countries
and items involved, and the relationship between the SCL holder and the
approved consignees.
    (1) A clear statement of corporate policy communicated to all
levels of the firm involved in exports and reexports, traffic, and
related functions, emphasizing the importance of SCL compliance;
    (2) Identification of positions (and maintenance of current list of
individuals occupying the positions) in the SCL holder firm and
consignee firms responsible for compliance with the requirements of the
SCL procedure;
    (3) A system for timely distribution to consignees and verification
of receipt by consignees of the Denied Persons List (Supplement No. 2
to part 764 of the EAR) and other regulatory materials necessary to
ensure compliance;
    (4) A system for screening items, training and servicing
transactions against Denied Persons List (Supplement No. 2 to part 764
of the EAR) and any relevant updates to the Denied Persons List;
    (5) A system for assuring compliance with items and destination
restrictions, including controls over reexports by consignees and
direct exports to consignee customers;
    (6) A compliance review program covering the SCL holder and
extending to all consignees;
    (7) A system for assuring compliance with controls on exports and
reexports of nuclear items and to nuclear end-uses described in
Secs. 742.3 and 744.2 of the EAR;
    (8) An on-going program for informing and educating employees
responsible for processing transactions involving items received under
the SCL about applicable regulations, limits, and restrictions of the
SCL;
    (9) A program for recordkeeping as required by the EAR;
    (10) An order processing system that documents employee clearance
of transactions in accordance with applicable elements of the company
ICP;
    (11) A system for monitoring in-transit shipments and shipments to
bonded warehouses and free trade zones;
    (12) A system for notifying BXA promptly if the SCL holder knows
that a consignee is not in compliance with terms of the SCL;
    (13) A system to screen against customers who are known to have, or
are suspected of having, unauthorized dealings with specially
designated regions and countries for which nonproliferation controls
apply;
    (i) The signs of potential diversion that you should take into
consideration include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (A) Your customer is little known (financial information
unavailable from normal commercial sources and corporate principals
unknown by trade sources);
    (B) Your customer does not wish to use commonly available
installation and maintenance services;
    (C) Your customer is reluctant to provide end-use and end-user
information;
    (D) Your customer requests atypical payment terms or currencies;

[[Page 12842]]

    (E) Customer order amounts, packaging, or delivery routing
requirements do not correspond with normal industry practice.
    (F) The performance/design characteristics of the items ordered are
incompatible with customer's line of business or stated end-use;
    (G) Your customer provides only a ``P.O. Box'' address or has
facilities that appear inappropriate for the items ordered;
    (H) Your customer's order is for parts known to be inappropriate,
or for which the customer appears to have no legitimate need (e.g.,
there is no indication of prior authorized shipment of system for which
the parts are sought); and
    (I) Your customer is known to have, or is suspected of having,
unauthorized dealings with parties and/or destinations in ineligible
countries.
    (ii) When any of the above characteristics have been identified,
but through follow-up inquiries or investigation have not been
satisfactorily resolved, the consignee should not transact any business
with the customer under the SCL. Apply for a license according to part
748 of the EAR. You should explain the basis for the concern regarding
the proposed customer, and state that you are an SCL consignee. Also,
cite the SCL number, and your consignee number;
    (14) A system for assuring compliance with controls over exports
and reexports for missile-related end-uses and end-users described in
Sec. 744.3 of the EAR;
    (15) A system for assuring compliance with control over exports and
reexports of chemical precursors and biological agents and related
items and end-uses described in Secs. 742.2 and 744.4 of the EAR;

Sec. 752.12  Recordkeeping requirements.

    (a) SCL holder and consignees. In addition to the recordkeeping
requirements of part 762 of the EAR, the SCL holder and each consignee
must maintain copies of manuals, guidelines, policy statements,
internal audit procedures, reports, and other documents making up the
ICP of each party included under an SCL. Also, all parties must
maintain copies of the most current Denied Persons List (see Supplement
No. 2 to part 764 of the EAR) as well as all updates, and all other
regulatory materials necessary to ensure compliance with the SCL, such
as relevant changes to the EAR, product classification, additions,
deletions, or other administrative changes to the SCL, transmittal
letters and consignee's confirmations of receipt of these materials.
    (b) Consignees. All consignees must retain all records of the types
of activities identified in Sec. 752.2(a)(3) of this part. Records on
such sales or reexports must include the following:
    (1) Full name and address of individual or firm to whom sale or
reexport was made;
    (2) Full description of each item sold or reexported;
    (3) Units of quantity and value of each item sold or reexported;
and
    (4) Date of sale or reexport.

Sec. 752.13  Inspection of records.

    (a) Availability of records. You and all consignees must make
available all of the records required by Sec. 752.12 of this part and
Sec. 762.2 of the EAR for inspection, upon request, by BXA or by any
other representative of the U.S. Government, in accordance with part
762 of the EAR.
    (b) Relationship of foreign laws. Foreign law may prohibit
inspection of records by a U.S. Government representative in the
foreign country where the records are located. In that event, the
consignee must submit with the required copies of Form BXA-752 an
alternative arrangement for BXA to review consignee activities and
determine whether or not the consignee has complied with U.S. export
control laws and regulations, which must be approved by BXA.
    (c) Failure to comply. Parties failing to comply with requests to
inspect documents may be subject to orders denying export privileges
described in part 764 of the EAR or to the administrative actions
described in part 766 of the EAR.

Sec. 752.14  System reviews.

    (a) Post-license system reviews. BXA may conduct system reviews of
the SCL holder as well as any consignee. Generally, BXA will give
reasonable notice to SCL holders and consignees in advance of a system
review. The review will involve interviews with company officials, the
inspection of records, and the review of ICPs. BXA may conduct special
unannounced system reviews if BXA has reason to believe an SCL holder
or consignee has improperly used or has failed to comply with the SCL.
    (b) Other reviews. BXA may require an SCL holder or consignee to
submit to its office a list of all sales made under the SCL during a
specified time-frame. Also, BXA may request from any consignee a list
of transactions during a specified period involving direct shipments of
items received under SCLs to customers of other consignees and sales to
customers in reexport territories authorized by BXA on the consignee's
validated Form BXA-752.

Sec. 752.15  Export clearance.

    (a) Shipper's Export Declaration (SED). The SED covering an export
made under an SCL must be prepared in accordance with standard
instructions described in Sec. 758.3 of the EAR. If the SCL holder has
implemented the Bureau of Census Monthly Reporting System, the SCL
holder must comply with the Census requirements.
    (1) Item descriptions. Item descriptions on the SED must indicate
specifically the ECCN and item description conforming to the applicable
CCL description and incorporating any additional information where
required by Schedule B; (e.g., type, size, name of specific item,
etc.).
    (2) Value of shipments. There is no value limitation on shipments
under the SCL; however, you must indicate the value of each shipment on
the SED.
    (3) SCL number. The SED must include the SCL number followed by a
blank space, and then the consignee number identifying the SCL's
approved consignee to whom the shipment is authorized.
    (b) Destination control statement. The SCL holder must enter a
destination control statement on all copies of the bill of lading or
air way-bill, and the commercial invoice covering exports under the
SCL, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 758.6 of the EAR. Use of
a destination control statement does not preclude the consignee from
reexporting to any of the SCL holder's other approved consignees or to
other countries for which specific prior approval has been received
from BXA. In such instances, reexport is not contrary to U.S. law and,
therefore, is not prohibited. Another destination control statement may
be required or approved by BXA on a case-by-case basis.

Sec. 752.16  Administrative actions.

    (a)(1) If BXA is not satisfied that you or other parties to the SCL
are complying with all conditions and requirements of the SCL, or that
ICPs employed by parties to such licenses are not adequate, BXA may, in
addition to any enforcement action pursuant to part 764 of the EAR,
take any licensing action it deems appropriate, including the
following:
    (i) Suspend the privileges under the SCL in whole or in part, or
impose other restrictions;
    (ii) Revoke the SCL in whole or in part;

[[Page 12843]]

    (iii) Prohibit consignees from receiving items authorized under the
SCL, or otherwise restrict their activities under the SCL;
    (iv) Restrict items that may be shipped under the SCL;
    (v) Require that certain exports, transfers or reexports be
individually authorized by BXA;
    (vi) Restrict parties to whom consignees may sell under the SCL;
and
    (vii) Require that an SCL holder provide an audit report to BXA of
selected consignees or overseas operations.
    (2) Whenever necessary to protect the national interest of the
U.S., BXA may take any licensing action it deems appropriate, without
regard to contracts or agreements entered into before such
administrative action, including those described in paragraphs (a)(1)
(i) through (vii) of this section.
    (b) Appeals. Actions taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
section may be appealed under the provisions of part 756 of the EAR.

Sec. 752.17  BXA mailing addresses.

    You should use the following addresses when submitting to BXA

Sec. 754.1  Introduction.

    (a) Scope. In this part, references to the Export Administration
Regulations (EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.
This part implements the provisions of section 7, ``Short Supply
Controls,'' of the Export Administration Act (EAA) and similar
provisions in other laws that are not based on national security and
foreign policy grounds.
    (b) Contents. Specifically, this part deals with the following:
    (1) It sets forth the license requirements and licensing policies
for commodities that contain the symbol ``SS'' in the ``Reason for
Control'' part of ``License Requirements'' section of the applicable
Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) identified on the Commerce
Control List (Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR). In appropriate
cases, it also provides for License Exceptions from the short supply
licensing requirements described in this part. The license requirements
and policies that are described in this part cover the following:
    (i) Crude oil described by ECCN 1C981 (Crude petroleum, including
reconstituted crude petroleum, tar sands, and crude shale oil listed in
Supplement No. 1 to this part). For specific licensing requirements for
these items, see Sec. 754.2 of this part.
    (ii) Petroleum products other than crude oil listed in Supplement
No. 1 to this part, that were produced or derived from the Naval
Petroleum Reserves (NPR) or became available for export as a result of
an exchange of any NPR-produced or -derived commodities described by
the following ECCNs. For specific licensing requirements for these
items, see Sec. 754.3 of this part.
    (A) ECCN 1C980 (Inorganic chemicals);
    (B) ECCN 1C982 (Other petroleum products);
    (C) ECCN 1C983 (Natural gas liquids and other natural gas
derivatives); and
    (D) ECCN 1C984 (Manufactured gas and synthetic natural gas (except
when commingled with natural gas and thus subject to export
authorization from the Department of Energy).
    (iii) Unprocessed western red cedar described by ECCN 1C988
(Western red cedar (thuja plicata) logs and timber, and rough, dressed
and worked lumber containing wane listed in Supplement No. 2 to this
part). For specific licensing requirements for these items, see
Sec. 754.4 of this part.
    (iv) Horses exported by sea for slaughter covered by ECCN 0A980
(Horses for export by sea). For specific licensing requirements, see
Sec. 754.5 of this part.
    (2) It incorporates statutory provisions for the registration of
U.S. agricultural commodities for exemption from short supply
limitations on export (see Sec. 754.6 of this part); and
    (3) It incorporates statutory provisions for the filing and review
of petitions seeking the imposition of monitoring or controls on
recyclable metallic materials and procedures for related public
hearings (see Sec. 754.7 of this part).

[[Page 12845]]

    (c) Reexports. Reexports of items controlled by this part require a
license only if such a requirement is specifically set forth in this
part or is set forth on the license authorizing the export from the
United States.
    (d) Additional requirements for embargoed destinations. For exports
involving embargoed destinations, you must satisfy the requirements of
this part and also of part 746 of the EAR (Embargoes and Other Special
Controls).

Sec. 754.2  Crude oil.

    (a) License requirement. As indicated by the SS notation in the
``License Requirements'' section of ECCN 1C981 on the CCL (Supplement
No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR), a license is required for the export of
crude oil to all destinations, including Canada. See paragraph (h) of
this section for a License Exception permitting the export of certain
oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and paragraph (i) of this
section for a License Exception for certain shipments of samples.
``Crude oil'' is defined as a mixture of hydrocarbons that existed in
liquid phase in underground reservoirs and remains liquid at
atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating
facilities and which has not been processed through a crude oil
distillation tower. Included are reconstituted crude petroleum, and
lease condensate and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands,
gilsonite, and oil shale. Drip gases are also included, but topped
crude oil, residual oil, and other finished and unfinished oils are
excluded.
    (b) License policy. (1) BXA will approve applications to export
crude oil for the following kinds of transactions if BXA determines
that the export is consistent with the specific requirements pertinent
to that export:
    (i) Exports from Alaska's Cook Inlet (see paragraph (d) of this
section);
    (ii) Exports to Canada for consumption or use therein (see
paragraph (e) of this section);
    (iii) Exports in connection with refining or exchange of strategic
petroleum reserve oil (see paragraph (f) of this section);
    (iv) Exports of heavy California crude oil up to an average volume
not to exceed 25 MB/D (see paragraph (g) of this section);
    (v) Exports that are consistent with international agreements as
described in the statutes listed in paragraph (c) of this section;
    (vi) Exports that are consistent with findings made by the
President under an applicable statute, including the statutes described
in paragraph (c) of this section; and
    (vii) Exports of foreign origin crude oil where, based on written
documentation satisfactory to BXA, the exporter can demonstrate that
the oil is not of U.S. origin and has not been commingled with oil of
U.S. origin. See paragraph (h) of this section for the provisions of
License Exception SPR permitting exports of certain crude oil from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
    (2) BXA will review other applications to export crude oil on a
case-by-case basis and, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this
section, generally will approve such applications if BXA determines
that the proposed export is consistent with the national interest and
the purposes of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA). Although
BXA will consider all applications for approval, generally, the
following kinds of transactions will be among those that BXA will
determine to be in the national interest and consistent with the
purposes of EPCA.
    (i) The export is part of an overall transaction:
    (A) That will result directly in the importation into the United
States of an equal or greater quantity and an equal or better quality
of crude oil or of a quantity and quality of petroleum products listed
in Supplement No. 1 to this part that is not less than the quantity and
quality of commodities that would be derived from the refining of the
crude oil for which an export license is sought;
    (B) That will take place only under contracts that may be
terminated if the petroleum supplies of the United States are
interrupted or seriously threatened; and
    (C) In which the applicant can demonstrate that, for compelling
economic or technological reasons that are beyond the control of the
applicant, the crude oil cannot reasonably be marketed in the United
States.
    (ii) Exports involving temporary exports or exchanges that are
consistent with the exceptions from the restrictions of the statutes
listed in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Additional statutory controls. (1) The following statutes
provide controls on the export of domestically produced crude oil based
on its place of origin or mode of transport. If such other statutory
controls apply, an export may only be approved if the President makes
the findings required by the applicable law.
    (i) Section 201 of Public Law 104-58, entitled ``Exports of Alaskan
North Slope Oil,'' provides for exports of domestically produced crude
oil transported by pipeline over rights-of-way granted pursuant to
section 203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C.
1652) (``TAPS crude oil'').
    (ii) The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 restricts exports of
domestically produced crude oil transported by pipeline over rights-of-
way granted pursuant to section 28(u) of that Act (30 U.S.C. 185(u))
(``MLA'').
    (iii) The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act restricts exports of
crude oil produced from the outer Continental Shelf (29 U.S.C. 1354)
(``OCSLA'').
    (iv) The Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act restricts the
export of crude oil produced from the naval petroleum reserves (10
U.S.C. 7430) (``NPRPA'').
    (2) Supplement No. 3 to this part describes the relevant statutory
provisions. In cases where a particular statute applies, a Presidential
finding is necessary before the export can be authorized. You should
note that in certain cases it is possible that more than one statute
could apply to a particular export of crude oil.
    (d) Exports from Alaska's Cook Inlet. The licensing policy is to
approve applications for exports of crude oil that was derived from the
state-owned submerged lands of Alaska's Cook Inlet and has not been, or
will not be, transported by a pipeline over a federal right-of-way
subject to the MLA or the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization
Act.<SUP>1

    \1\ On November 6, 1985, the Secretary of Commerce determined
that the export of crude oil derived from State waters in Alaska's
Cook Inlet is consistent with the national interest and the purposes
of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Exports to Canada for consumption or use therein. (1) Except
for TAPS crude oil, the licensing policy is to approve applications for
exports of crude oil to Canada for consumption or use therein.
    (2) The licensing policy for TAPS crude oil is to approve
applications for an average of no more than 50,000 barrels of oil per
day for consumption or use in Canada, subject to the following
procedures and conditions:
    (i) Any ocean transportation of the commodity will be made by
vessels documented for United States coastwise trade under 46 U.S.C.
12106. Only barge voyages between the State of Washington and
Vancouver, British Columbia, and comparable barge movements across
waters between the U.S. and Canada may be excluded from this
requirement. The Bureau of Export Administration will determine, in
consultation with the Maritime

[[Page 12846]]
Administration, whether such transportation is ``ocean''
transportation; and
    (ii) Authorization to export TAPS crude oil will be granted on a
quarterly basis. Applications will be accepted by BXA no earlier than
two months prior to the beginning of the calendar quarter in question,
but must be received no later than the 25th day of the second month
preceding the calendar quarter. For example, for the calendar quarter
beginning April 1 and ending June 30, applications will be accepted
beginning February 1, but must be received no later than February 25.
    (iii) The quantity stated on each application must be the total
number of barrels for the quarter, not a per-day rate. This quantity
must not exceed 50,000 barrels times the number of calendar days in the
quarter.
    (iv) Each application must include support documents providing
evidence that the applicant has either:
    (A) Title to the quantity of barrels stated in the application; or
    (B) A contract to purchase the quantity of barrels stated in the
application.
    (v) The quantity of barrels authorized on each license for export
during the calendar quarter will be determined by the BXA as a prorated
amount based on:
    (A) The quantity requested on each license application; and
    (B) The total number of barrels that may be exported by all license
holders during the quarter (50,000 barrels per day multiplied by the
number of calendar days during the quarter).
    (vi) Applicants may combine their licensed quantities for as many
as four consecutive calendar quarters into one or more shipments,
provided that the validity period of none of the affected licenses has
expired.
    (vii) BXA will carry forward any portion of the 50,000 barrels per
day quota that has not been allocated during a calendar quarter, except
that no un-allocated portions will be carried over to a new calendar
year. The un-allocated volume for a calendar quarter will be added,
until expended, to the quotas available for each quarter through the
end of the calendar year.
    (f) Refining or exchange of Strategic Petroleum Reserve Oil. (1)
Exports of crude oil withdrawn from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
(SPR) will be approved if BXA, in consultation with the Department of
Energy, determines that such exports will directly result in the
importation into the United States of refined petroleum products that
are needed in the United States and that otherwise would not be
available for importation without the export of the crude oil from the
SPR.
    (2) Licenses may be granted to export, for refining or exchange
outside of the United States, SPR crude oil that will be sold and
delivered, pursuant to a drawdown and distribution of the SPR, in
connection with an arrangement for importing refined petroleum products
into the United States.
    (3) BXA will approve license applications subject to the following
conditions:
    (i) You must provide BXA evidence of the following:
    (A) A title to the quantity of barrels of SPR crude stated in the
application; or
    (B) A contract to purchase, for importation, into the United States
the quantity of barrels of SPR crude stated in the application.
    (ii) The following documentation must be submitted to BXA no later
than fourteen days following the date that the refined petroleum
products are imported in the U.S. in exchange for the export of SPR
crude:
    (A) Evidence that the exporter of the SPR crude has title to or a
contract to purchase refined petroleum product;
    (B) A copy of the shipping manifest that identifies the refined
petroleum products; and
    (C) A copy of the entry documentation required by the U.S. Customs
Service that show the refined petroleum products were imported into the
United States, or a copy of the delivery receipt when the refined
petroleum products are for delivery to the U.S. military outside of the
United States.
    (4) You must complete both the export of the SPR crude and the
import of the refined petroleum products no later than 30 days
following the issuance of the export license, except in the case of
delivery to the U.S. military outside of the United States, in which
case the delivery of the refined petroleum products must be completed
no later than the end of the term of the contract with the Department
of Defense.
    (g) Exports of certain California crude oil. The export of
California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20.0 degrees API or

    (B) Documentation showing that the applicant has a contract to
export the quantity of barrels stated in the application. The contract
may be contingent upon issuance of the export license to the applicant.
    (v) BXA will carry forward any portion of the 25 MB/D quota that
has not been licensed, except that no unallocated portions will be
carried forward more than 90 days into a new calendar year.
Applications to export against any carry-forward must be filed with BXA
by January 15 of the carry-forward year.
    (vi) BXA will return to the available authorized export quota any
portion of the 25 MB/D per day quota that has been licensed, but not

Supplement No. 3 to Part 754--Statutory Provisions Dealing With Exports
of Crude Oil

[The statutory material published in this Supplement is for the
information of the reader only. See the U.S. Code for the official
text of this material.]

Public Law 104-58

SEC. 201. EXPORTS OF ALASKAN NORTH SLOPE OIL.

    Section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 185(s)) is
amended by amending subsection(s) to read as follows:

``EXPORTS OF ALASKAN NORTH SLOPE OIL

    (1) Subject to paragraphs (2) through (6) of this subsection and
notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or any other
provision of laws (including any regulation) applicable to the
export of oil transported by pipeline over right-of-way granted
pursuant to section 203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization
Act (43 U.S.C. 1652), such oil may be exported unless the President
finds that exportation of this oil is not in the national interest.
The President shall make his national interest determination within
five months of the date of enactment of this subsection. In
evaluating whether exports of this oil are in the national interest,
the President shall at a minimum consider--
    (A) whether exports of this oil would diminish the total
quantity or quality of petroleum available to the United States;
    (B) the results of an appropriate environmental review,
including consideration of appropriate measures to mitigate any
potential adverse effects of exports of this oil on the environment,
which shall be completed within four months of the date of the
enactment of this subsection; and
    (C) whether exports of this oil are likely to cause sustained
material oil supply shortages or sustained oil prices significantly
above world market levels that would cause sustained material
adverse employment effects in the United States or that would cause
substantial harm to consumers, including noncontiguous States and
Pacific territories.
    If the President determines that exports of this oil are in the
national interest, he may impose such terms and conditions (other
than a volume limitation) as are necessary or appropriate to ensure
that such exports are consistent with the national interest.
    (2) Except in the case of oil exported to a country with which
the United States entered into a bilateral international oil supply
agreement before November 26, 1979, or to a country pursuant to the
International Emergency Oil Sharing Plan of the International Energy
Agency, any oil transported by pipeline over right-of-way granted
pursuant to section 203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization
Act (43 U.S.C. 1652) shall, when exported, be transported by a
vessel documented under the laws of the United States and owned by a
citizen of the United States (as determined in accordance with
section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C. App. 802)).
    (3) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the authority of
the President under the Constitution, the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National
Emergencies Act ( ) U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), or Part B of title II of
the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6271-76) to
prohibit exports.
    (4) The Secretary of Commerce shall issue any rules necessary
for implementation of the President's national interest
determination, including any licensing requirements and conditions,
within 30 days of the date of such determination by the President.
The Secretary of Commerce shall consult with the Secretary of Energy
in administering the provisions of this subsection.
    (5) If the Secretary of Commerce finds that exporting oil under
authority of this subsection has caused sustained material oil
supply shortage or sustained oil prices significantly above world
market levels and further finds that these supply shortages or price
increases have caused or are likely to cause sustained material
adverse employment effects in the United States, the Secretary of
Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall
recommend, and the President may take, appropriate action concerning
exports of this oil, which may include modifying or revoking
authority to export such oil.
    (6) Administrative action under this subsection is not subject
to sections 551 and 553 through 559 of title 5, United States Code.

oil which is either exchanged in similar quantity for convenience or
increased efficiency of transportation with persons or the
government of an adjacent foreign state, or which is temporarily
exported for convenience or increased efficiency of transportation
across parts of an adjacent foreign state and reenters the United
States, shall be subject to all of the limitations and licensing

App. 2401 and following) and, in addition, before any crude oil
subject this section may be exported under the limitations and
licensing requirements and penalty and enforcement provisions of the
Export Administration Act of 1979 the President must make and
publish an express finding that such exports will not diminish the
total quantity or quality of petroleum available to the United
States, and are in the national interest and are in accord with the
provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979: Provided, That
the President shall submit reports to the Congress containing
findings made under

[[Page 12851]]
this section, and after the date of receipt of such report Congress
shall have a period of sixty calendar days, thirty days of which
Congress must have been in session, to consider whether exports
under the terms of this section are in the national interest. If the
Congress within this time period passes a concurrent resolution of
disapproval stating disagreement with the President's finding
concerning the national interest, further exports made pursuant to
the aforementioned Presidential finding shall cease.

any petroleum subject to this section may be exported under the
limitations and licensing requirement and penalty and enforcement
provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979, the President

diminish the total quality or quantity of petroleum available to the
United States and that such exports are in the national interest and
are in accord with the Export Administration Act of 1979.

in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the Supplement, terminated on September
30, 1979, pursuant to the terms of that Act.
    (b) Condition precedent to exportation; express finding by
President of no increase in reliance on imported oil or gas.
    Before any oil or gas subject to this section may be exported
under the requirements and provisions of the Export Administration
Act of 1969, the President shall make and publish an express finding
that such exports will not increase reliance on imported oil or gas,
are in the national interest, and are in accord with the provisions
of the Export Administration Act of 1969.
    (c) Report of findings by President to Congress; joint
resolution of disagreement with findings of President.
    The President shall submit reports to Congress containing
findings made under this section, and after the date of receipt of

whether export under the terms of this section are in the national
interest. If the Congress within such time period passes a
concurrent resolution of disapproval stating disagreement with the
President's finding concerning the national interest, further
exports made pursuant to such Presidential findings shall cease.
    (d) Exchange or temporary exportation of oil and gas for
convenience or efficiency of transportation.
    The provisions of this section shall not apply to any oil or gas
which is either exchanged in similar quantity for convenience or
increase efficiency of transportation with persons or the government
of a foreign state, or which is temporarily exported for convenience
or increased efficiency of transportation across parts of an
adjacent foreign state and reenters the United States, or which is
exchanged or exported pursuant to an existing international
agreement.

by an administrative action taken by the Bureau of Export
Administration (BXA) may appeal to the Under Secretary for
reconsideration of that administration action. The following types of
administrative actions are not subject to the appeals procedures
described in this part 756:
    (1) Issuance, amendment, revocation, or appeal of a regulation.
(These requests may be submitted to BXA at any time.)

to the Deputy Under Secretary for Export Administration or to another
BXA official the authority to review and decide the appeal. In
addition, the Under Secretary may designate any BXA official to be an
appeals coordinator to assist in the review and processing of an appeal
under this part. The responsibilities of an appeals coordinator may
include presiding over informal hearings.
    (b) Appeal procedures--(1) Filing. An appeal under this part must
be received by the Under Secretary for Export Administration, Bureau of
Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room H-3886C, 14th

    (2) Content of appeal. The appeal must include a full written
statement in support of appellant's position. The appeal must include a
precise statement of why the appellant believes the administrative
action has a direct and adverse effect and should be reversed or
modified. The Under Secretary may request additional information that
would be helpful in resolving the appeal, and may accept additional
submissions. The Under Secretary will not ordinarily accept any
submission filed more than 30 days after the filing of the appeal or of
any requested submission.
    (3) Request for informal hearing. In addition to the written
statement submitted in support of an appeal, an appellant may request,
in writing, at the time an appeal is filed, an opportunity for an
informal hearing. The Under Secretary may grant or deny a request for
an informal hearing. Any hearings will be held in the District of
Columbia unless the Under Secretary determines, based upon good cause
shown, that another location would be better.
    (4) Informal hearing procedures. (i) Presentations. The Under
Secretary shall provide an opportunity for the appellant to make an
oral presentation based on the materials previously submitted by the
appellant or made available by the Department in connection with the

    Authority: 50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.;
E.O. 12924, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 917; Notice of August 15, 1995 (60
FR 42767, August 17, 1995).

Sec. 758.1  Export clearance requirements.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR
chapter VII, subchapter C.
    (a) Responsibility of licensee, exporter and agent. (1) If you are
issued a BXA license, or you rely on a License Exception described in
part 740 of the EAR, you are responsible for the proper use of that
license or License Exception and for the performance of all of its
terms and conditions.
    (2) If you export without either a license issued by BXA or a
License Exception, you are responsible for determining that the
transaction is outside the scope of the EAR or the export is designated
as ``No License Required'' as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this
section.
    (3)(i) ``No License Required''. Items that are listed on the
Commerce Control List (CCL) (Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR)
but that do not require a license by reason of the Country Chart
contained in Supplement 1 to part 738 of the EAR, and items designated
EAR99 (See Sec. 734.3(c) of the EAR entitled ``Scope of the EAR'') must
be designated as ``NLR'', or ``no license required'', on your shipping
documents in accordance with the provisions of this part.
    (ii) NLR notation. Entering the symbol NLR is a representation to
the U.S. Government that the items being exported are listed on the CCL
but do not require a license by reason of the Country Chart or that
they are within the scope of EAR99 (See Sec. 734.3(c) of the EAR
entitled ``Scope of the EAR''); that they do not require a license
under General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and
Components Reexports), or Three (Foreign-produced Direct Product
Reexports); that General Prohibitions Four through Ten do not apply to
the given export, reexport, or other activity; and that the items are
subject to the EAR.
    (4) License Exception symbol. Entering a License Exception symbol
on an export control document is a representation to the U.S.
Government that the transaction meets all of the terms and conditions
of the License Exception cited. (See part 740 of the EAR for details
regarding License Exceptions.)
    (5) Software and technology not subject to the EAR. If you are
exporting software or technology that is outside the scope of the EAR
as described in Secs. 734.7 through 734.11 of the EAR, you may use the
symbol TSPA. Use of this symbol is optional; however, if you enter it
on an export control document, you are making a representation to the
U.S. Government that the technology or software is outside the scope of
the EAR.
    (b) Forwarding agent.--(1) Authorizing a forwarding agent. A
forwarding agent is a person the exporter authorizes to perform
services that facilitate the export described on the Shipper's Export
Declaration (SED). The agent must be authorized to act on behalf of the
exporter either for the specific transaction for which the agent is
submitting the SED or under a general power of attorney. The Foreign
Trade Statistics Regulations of the Bureau of the Census (15 CFR part
30) provide the specific requirements for obtaining authorization as a
forwarding agent.
    (2) Forwarding agent as licensee. If the forwarding agent is
appointed at the suggestion of a foreign buyer, the seller may insist
that the agent apply for the export license. See Sec. 748.4(a)(1) of
the EAR which defines parties to a transaction.
    (3) Record and proof of agent's authority. The power-of-attorney or
other authorization from the exporter must be retained on file in the
forwarding agent's office while the authorization is in force and for a
period of five years after the last action taken by the forwarding
agent under the authority. During this retention period, the forwarding
agent must make its delegation of authority from the exporter available
for inspection on demand, in accordance with the provisions of
Sec. 762.6 of the EAR. This recordkeeping and inspection requirement
also applies to any redelegation of the forwarding agent's authority
and to any person to whom the forwarding agent redelegates its
authority. (For further recordkeeping requirements see part 762 of the
EAR).
    (c) Responsibility for compliance. Acting through a forwarding
agent, or other agent or delegation or redelegation of authority, does
not relieve anyone of responsibility for compliance with the EAR.
Forwarding agents, carriers and others who participate in transactions
that are subject to the EAR are also responsible for complying with the
EAR.
    (d) Exports by U.S. Mail.--(1) Exports made under a license issued
by BXA. Before making an export by U.S. Mail that is authorized by a
license issued by BXA, you must enter the license number on the address
side of the parcel and submit a properly executed SED to the post
office at the place of mailing, when required by the regulations in
this part and/or the Foreign Trade Statistics

[[Page 12853]]
Regulations of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. <SUP>1

    \1\ The Shipper's Export Declaration (U.S. Department of
Commerce form 7525-V) may be purchased from the Superintendent of
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, or
it may be privately printed. Form 7525-V-Alt (Intermodal), must be
privately printed. Privately printed forms must strictly conform to
the official form in all respects. Samples of these forms may be
obtained from the Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233, local
Customs offices, and the U.S. Department of Commerce District
Offices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Shipments without a license. The requirements of this paragraph
apply whenever you export items that do not require a license under the
EAR. These requirements apply regardless of whether your transaction
does not require a license because the item you are going to ship is
encompassed with EAR99 (See Sec. 734.3(c) of the EAR entitled ``Scope
of the EAR''), because the item, although on the list, does not require
a license to be exported to the destination to which you intend to ship
or because the transaction qualifies for a License Exception as
described in part 740 of the EAR.
    (i) Shipments to Canada for consumption therein. An SED is not
required for exports of items to Canada if the items are for
consumption in Canada and the export transaction does not require a
license from BXA. Note that if the item you are exporting to Canada is
controlled by another government agency, the regulations of that agency
may require you to file a SED.
    (ii) Shipments to Puerto Rico or U.S. territories or possessions.
Exports of items to Puerto Rico or the U.S. territories or possessions
do not require a license issued by BXA. However, the regulations of the
Census Bureau (15 CFR part 30) may still require you to file a SED.
    (iii) Shipments valued over $500. When mailing an item from one
business concern to another where the total value of the items being
shipped exceeds $500, you must present an executed SED to the post
office at the place of mailing unless the EAR or the Bureau of the
Census Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations specifically provide an
exception to this requirement. If either the exporter or recipient is
not a business concern, no SED is required.
    (iv) Designation on SED and/or parcel. If you are exporting an item
that is encompassed within EAR99 (See Sec. 734.3(c) of the EAR entitled
``Scope of the EAR''), or one that is listed on the CCL but no license
is required to the destination to which you are shipping, or you are
exporting pursuant to a License Exception, as described in part 740 of
the EAR, you must enter the appropriate symbol indicating the absence
of a license requirement either NLR, meaning ``No License Required'' or
the applicable License Exception symbol, on the SED and on the address
side of the parcel along with the phrase ``Export License Not
Required.'' If your transaction is one for which you are not required
to file a SED, you must enter the appropriate symbol NLR, meaning no
license required or of the applicable License Exception on the address
side of the parcel along with the phrase ``Export License Not
Required.'' If you are exporting technology or software that is outside
the scope of the EAR as described in Sec. 734.7 through 734.11 you may
enter the symbol TSPA.
    (A) By entering the symbol NLR you are representing to the U.S.
Government that the items you are exporting are listed on the CCL (See
Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) but do not require a license
by reason of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the
EAR) or because they are encompassed within the EAR99 (See
Sec. 734.3(c) of the EAR entitled ``Scope of the EAR''); that they do
not require a license under General Prohibitions One (Exports and
reexports of controlled items to listed countries), Two (Parts and
Components Reexports), or Three (Foreign Produced Direct Product
Reexports); that General Prohibitions Four through Ten do not apply to
the given export, reexport, or other activity; and that the item is
subject to the EAR.
    (B) By entering a License Exception symbol, you are representing to
the U.S. Government that your transaction meets all of the terms and
conditions of the License Exception you are using. (See part 740 of the
EAR for details regarding License Exceptions).
    (C) By entering the symbol TSPA you are representing to the U.S.
Government that the technology or software you are exporting is outside
the scope of the EAR.
    (v) Gift parcels. If you are sending a gift parcel pursuant to the
requirements of Sec. 746.16 of the EAR, you must enter the phrase
``Gift--export license not required'' on any customs declaration
documents and on the address side of the parcel.
    (vi) Software and technology. If you are exporting software or
technology, the export of which is authorized under the License
Exceptions in Sec. 740.17 through Sec. 740.21 of the EAR, you do not
need to make any notation on the package. If you are exporting software
or technology that is outside the scope of the EAR, check to see if any
other agency's regulations require specific markings on the package.
    (3) When you enter any of the symbols or phrases referred to in
paragraph (d) of this section on the documents or packages, you are
certifying to the post office and to BXA that you are exporting the
package in compliance with all of the terms and provisions of an
applicable License Exception or other authority to export.
    (e) Exports by means other than U.S. Mail. (1) When SEDs are
required to be submitted, the exporter or the exporter's agent must
present a duly executed SED to the exporting carrier before the vessel,
aircraft, or overland transport depart.
    (i) Exemptions to SED. A SED is not required for:
    (A) Any shipment, other than a shipment made under a license issued
by BXA, to any country in Country Group B (See Supplement No. 1 to part
740 of the EAR) or to the People's Republic of China if the shipment is
valued at $2,500 or less per Schedule B Number. The schedule B number
of an item is that shown in the current edition of Schedule B,
Statistical Classification of Domestic and Foreign Commodities Exported
from the United States. In this Sec. 758.1(e), ``shipment'' means all
items classified under a single Schedule B Number, shipped on the same
carrier, from one exporter to one importer. The Foreign Trade
Statistics Regulations of the Bureau of the Census (15 CFR part 30)
shall govern the valuation of items when determining whether a shipment
meets the $2,500 threshold of this Sec. 758.1(e)(1)(i)(A).
    (B) Any shipment reported under the provisions of the Monthly
Reporting Procedure (Sec. 758.3(o) of this part); or
    (C) Any shipment made under any other exception to the SED
requirements found in Subpart D of the Bureau of the Census' Foreign
Trade Statistics Regulations. See Supplement No. 1 to this part 758.)
    (ii) Exceptions from SED requirements. (A) Statement on shipping
documents. If you are exempt by paragraph (e)(1) of this section from
the requirement of filing a SED, the Bureau of the Census Foreign Trade
Statistics Regulations (FTSR) (15 CFR 30.50), require you to make a
statement on the bill of lading, air waybill, or other loading document
describing the basis for the exemption and referencing the specific
section of the FTSR where the exemption is provided, unless the
exemption is based on value and destination. If the exemption is based
on the value and destination of your shipment, you must state the basis
for the exemption, but you do not have to cite a reference to the
specific section of the FTSR containing the exemption.

[[Page 12854]]

    (B) Monthly reporting procedures. (1) All forwarders or brokers who
use the monthly reporting procedures described in FTSR Sec. 30.39 (15
CFR 30.39) on behalf of exporters who are not themselves exempt from
the individual filing requirement must also include on the bill of
lading, air waybill (including house air waybill), or other loading
document either the number of and expiration date of an export license
issued by BXA, or the appropriate symbol indicating the inapplicability
of an export license requirement (either NLR, meaning ``No License
Required'' or of the applicable License Exception, from part 740 of the
EAR).
    (2) The notation required by paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B)(1) of this
section applies to any bill of lading or other loading document,
including one issued by a consolidator (indirect carrier) for an export
included in a consolidated shipment. However, this requirement does not
apply to a ``master'' bill of lading or other loading document issued
by a carrier to cover a consolidated shipment. The bill of lading or
other loading document must be available for inspection along with the
goods or data prior to lading on the carrier.
    (2) Export carrier SED information. The exporting carrier, or if
none is utilized, the exporter or agent is responsible for the accuracy
of the following items of information (where required) on the SED:
    (i) Name of carrier (including flag of vessel),
    (ii) U.S. Customs port of export,
    (iii) Method of transportation,
    (iv) Foreign port of unloading,
    (v) Bill of lading or air waybill number, and
    (vi) Whether or not containerized.
    (3) Exports not requiring a license. Even if your shipment does not
require a license from BXA, it may still require a SED. Before
shipping, check the Bureau of the Census Foreign Trade Statistics
Regulations for the complete SED requirements.
    (f) Shipments transiting Canada en route to other countries--(1)
Shipments moving under individual SED. When an export to a foreign
country is made in transit through Canada, and the shipment is one for
which an individual SED is required by this part 758, the U.S. exporter
must submit to the Canadian Customs authorities at the Canadian port of
entry a copy of the U.S. SED, Form 7525-V, certified by the exporter as
``A True Copy'' of the original SED.
    (2) Shipments for which individual SED are not required. When an
export to a foreign country is made in transit through Canada, and the
shipment is one for which an individual SED is not required because:
    (i) The forwarder or broker is authorized to report export
information to Census by means other than an individual SED; or
    (ii) The shipment qualifies for a specific exemption (listed in
Subpart D of the Census Bureau Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations),
the forwarder or broker must include the number of and expiration date
of the license issued by BXA, or the appropriate symbol indicating the
inapplicability of an export license requirement (either NLR, meaning
``No License Required'' of the applicable License Exception from part
740 of the EAR on the bill of lading or other loading document as
directed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section). The bill of lading or
other loading document properly annotated with respect to the FTSR SED
exemption or exception, along with the license authorization, when
required, must be displayed to the Canadian Customs authorities at the
Canadian port of entry and a copy provided, if requested by the
Canadian authorities.

Sec. 758.2  Use of export license.

    (a) License valid for shipment from any port. A license issued by
BXA authorizes exports from the United States from any U.S. port of
export unless the license notes otherwise. Items that leave the United
States at one port, cross adjacent foreign territory, and reenter the
United States at another port before final export to a foreign country
will be treated as an export from the last U.S. port of export.
    (b) Shipments against expiring license. (1) Any item that has not
departed from the last U.S. port of export by midnight of the
expiration date of the license may not be exported under that license
unless the shipment meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) or
(ii) of this section.
    (i) BXA grants an extension; or
    (ii) Prior to midnight of the expiration date of the license, the
items:
    (A) Were laden aboard the vessel; or
    (B) Were located on a pier ready for loading and not for storage,
and were booked for a vessel that was at the pier ready for loading; or
    (2) When the vessel is expected to be available at the pier for
loading before the license expires, but exceptional and unforeseen
circumstances delay it, the items may be exported without an extension
of the license, if in the judgment of the U.S. Customs Service or BXA,
undue hardship would otherwise result.
    (c) Reshipment of undelivered items. If the consignee does not
receive an export made under a license because the carrier failed to
deliver it, the exporter may reship the same or an identical item
subject to the same limitations as to quantity or value as described on
the license to the same consignee and destination under the same
license. Before reshipping, the exporter must submit to the OEXS
satisfactory evidence of the original export and of the delivery
failure, together with a satisfactory explanation of the delivery
failure. If an item is to be reshipped to any person other than the
original consignee, the shipment is deemed to be a new export and is
subject to all current EAR regarding the specific item and destination.

Sec. 758.3  Shipper's Export Declaration (SED).

    (a) SED presentation requirement. Both the Foreign Trade Statistics
Regulations of the Census Bureau (15 CFR part 30) and these Export
Administration Regulations require that SED's be submitted to the U.S.
Government. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but if you are
required to submit a SED you must prepare it in accordance with the
rules of the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations (FTSR) and present
the number of copies specified in the FTSR at the port of export.
    (b) SED is a statement to the U.S. Government. Your SED is a
statement to the U.S. Government in which you assert that all of the
information shown on the SED is true. You may execute and submit the
SED only if you are the exporter or the duly authorized forwarding
agent of an exporter.
    (c) Limitation on time when SED may be used. No one may use a SED
to export, or facilitate or effect an export, after the expiration of
the applicable license or after the termination of the applicable
License Exception or provisions of the EAR that authorize export
without a license, except as provided in Sec. 750.7(f) (License
validity period) of the EAR and Sec. 758.2(b) (Shipments against
expiring license) of this part.
    (d) Additional copies of the SED. You are required to submit
additional copes of the SED when:
    (1) BXA or one of its component offices asks you to send it copies
of the SED for exports:
    (i) Authorized by a license (see paragraph (l) of this section);
    (ii) Authorized by a Special Comprehensive License (see
Sec. 752.16(a)(5) of the EAR; or
    (iii) The items are controlled for short supply reasons (see part
754 of the EAR); or

[[Page 12855]]

    (iv) Required by Sec. 758.1(f) (shipments transiting Canada) of
this part.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (e) Statements on SED. Whenever a SED is presented to a carrier, a
customs office, or a postmaster, the exporter represents that:
    (1) All statements and information on the SED have been furnished
by the exporter or on the exporter's behalf to effect an export under
the provisions of the EAR;
    (2) Export of the items described on the SED is authorized under
the ``No License Required'' provisions of the EAR as described in
Sec. 758.1(a) of this part, a License Exception described in part 740
of the EAR or the license identified on the SED;
    (3) Statements contained on the SED are consistent with the
contents of the license or the terms, provisions, and conditions of the
applicable License Exception or of the applicable ``No License
Required'' provisions of the EAR as described in Sec. 758.1(a) of this
part; and
    (4) All other terms, provisions, and conditions of the EAR
applicable to the export have been met.
    (f) Items that may be listed on the same SED. (1) General. Except
as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, more than one item
may be listed on the same SED provided they are contained in one
shipment on board a single carrier and are going from the same exporter
to the same consignee. Even if some of the items are being shipped
under authority of a license and others under a License Exception or
the ``No License Required'' provisions of the EAR (as described in
Sec. 758.1(a) of this part), they may still be shown on one SED. For
the second and subsequent authorizations used, the applicable license
number and expiration date, License Exception symbol, or the ``No
License Required'' symbol (NLR) must be shown along with the
descriptions (including quantity, if required, Schedule B Number, and
value) to which each authorization applies, in the designated spaces on
a separate SED Continuation Sheet. The following apply for notations
made on SED:
    (i) Entering the license number and expiration date is a
representation to the U.S. Government that the transaction is
authorized by the license cited.
    (ii) Entering a License Exception symbol, or ``NLR'' is a
representation to the U.S. Government that the shipment meets one of
the applicable provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 758.1 of this
part.
    (2) Exception. Separate SED's must be prepared and presented for
each vehicle when more than one vehicle is used to make the shipment.
Customs Directors may waive this requirement if a shipment is made
under a single bill of lading or other loading document and all the
items listed on the SED are cleared simultaneously.
    (g) Schedule B number and item description--(1) Schedule B number.
You must enter the Schedule B number, as shown in the current edition
of Schedule B, Statistical Classification of Domestic and Foreign
Commodities Exported from the United States, in the designated column
of the SED regardless of whether the shipment is being exported under
authority of a license issued by BXA, a License Exception described in
part 740 of the EAR, or the ``No License Required'' provisions of the
EAR as described in Sec. 758.1(a) of this part.
    (2) Item description for exports under a license. (i) General. If
your export is being made under the authority of a license issued by
BXA, you must enter the item description shown on the license on the
SED. However, if part of the description on the license is underlined,
you need place only the underlined portions on the SED. The item
description on the license will be stated in CCL terms, which may be
inadequate to meet Census Bureau requirements. In this event, the item
description you place on the SED must give enough additional detail to
permit verification of the Schedule B number (e.g., size, material, or
degree of fabrication).
    (ii) Distinguishing characteristics or specifications. If a
commodity classification in Schedule B has instructions such as
``specify by name,'' ``state species,'' etc., you must furnish that
information in the column of the SED provided for the commodity
description. When a single SED covers more than one item classifiable
under a single classification carrying the ``specify by name'' or
similar requirement, you must enter each item separately in this
column. However, if more than five items are involved, all classifiable
under one Schedule B number, only the five items of greatest value in
the classification need be shown separately. Separate quantities,
values, and shipping weights for individual items are not required in
either case.
    (3) Item description for License Exception shipments or shipments
for which no license is required. For items that may be exported under
the authority of a License Exception, or under the ``No License
Required'' provisions of the EAR (as described in Sec. 758.1(a) of this
part), you must enter a description in sufficient detail to permit
review by the U.S. Government and verification of the Schedule B number
entered on the SED.
    (h) License number or other authorization designation. (1) Exports
under authority of a license issued by BXA. You must show the license
number and expiration date, the Export Control Classification Number
(ECCN) and the item description, in the designated spaces of a SED
covering an export under a license issued by BXA (The space for the
item description on the SED form may be headed ``commodity
description''). If you intend to include other items on the SED that
may be exported under a License Exception, or under the ``No License
Required'' provisions of the EAR, (as described in Sec. 758.1(a) of
this part) you must show the License Exception or ``NLR'' symbol, along
with the specific description (quantity, Schedule B, value) of the
item(s) to which the authorization applies in the designated spaces on
a separate SED continuation sheet.
    (2) Exports not needing a license. In addition to the item
description, the appropriate License Exception symbol, or the ``No
License Required'' symbol (NLR) must be shown in the appropriate column
of each SED or SED continuation sheet covering a shipment under
authority of a License Exception (see part 740 of the EAR), or ``No
License Required'' provisions of the EAR (as described in Sec. 758.1(a)
of this part). If several authorizations are to be listed on one SED,
the SED and continuation sheets must be completed as described in
paragraph (f)(1) of this section. If the item(s) will be exported under
the provisions of LST (License Exceptions GBS, CIV, LVS) or under the
``NLR'' provisions of the EAR (as described in Sec. 758.1(a) of this
part) and the item(s) are covered by entries on the Commerce Control
List that have the column identifier ``NS Column 2'' controlled for
``NS'' reasons, the ECCN must also be shown in the designated space on
the SED or SED continuation sheet. The following apply for notations
made on SED:
    (i) Entering the license number and expiration date is a
representation to the U.S. Government that the transaction is
authorized by the license cited.
    (ii) Entering a License Exception symbol, or ``NLR'' is a
representation to the U.S. Government that the shipment meets one of
the applicable provisions of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(4) of
Sec. 758.1 of this part.
    (3) If you are exporting technology or software that is outside the
scope of the EAR as described in Secs. 734.7 through 734.11 of the EAR,
you may enter the symbol TSPA on the SED. Use of this

[[Page 12856]]
symbol is optional, however, if you enter it, you are representing to
the U.S. Government that the software or technology you are exporting
is outside the scope of the EAR.
    (i) Optional ports of unlading. (1) Applicability. If, prior to the
departure of the exporting carrier, the exporter does not know at what
port the shipment will be unloaded, the exporter may designate optional
ports of unlading on the SED and bill of lading or air waybill in
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. There are
restrictions on the countries in which these optional ports may be
located. The restrictions depend on whether the export is authorized
under the ``No license Required'' provisions of the EAR (as described
in Sec. 758.1(a) of this part), the License Exceptions described in
part 740 of the EAR, or a license (See paragraph (j)(3) of this
section).
    (2) Exemptions. You may never designate an optional port of
unlading for a shipment destined directly or indirectly to Country
Group D:1 in Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR (except for the
People's Republic of China), Libya, Cuba, or North Korea.
    (3) Shipments for which no license is required or which are
authorized by a License Exception. (i) For exports under the authority
of the ``No License Required'' provisions of the EAR (as described in
Sec. 758.1(a) of this part), if the exporter does not know which of
several countries in Country Group B or the People's Republic of China
is the country of ultimate destination, the exporter may name optional
ports of unlading in one or more of these countries.
    (ii) When an export under any License Exception is shipped in
transit through a country other than the country of ultimate
destination, the exporter may designate optional ports of unlading in
one or more countries, together with the name and address of the
intermediate consignee in each country designated.
    (4) Restrictions on optional ports of unlading. The optional ports
of unlading, which the exporter designates on the SED pursuant to
paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section, must be in a country to which the
item being unloaded may be exported directly from the United States
under the same or another applicable ``No License Required'' provision
of the EAR (described in Sec. 758.1(a) of this part), or License
Exception contained in the EAR.
    (5) Shipments under a license issued by BXA. For exports under a
license, optional ports of unlading are restricted to the country of
ultimate destination, unless either the transaction complies with the
provisions of Sec. 750.7 of the EAR dealing with continuity of
shipments, or the license designates intermediate consignees in other
countries. In the latter case, the optional ports of unlading must be
designated as optional intransit points on the SED, or if there is no
SED, on the Shipper's Letter of Instructions, or, if there is neither,
the optional port of unlading must appear on another document
containing instructions that the exporter conveys (either directly or
through an agent) to the carrier, and on the bill of lading or air
waybill.
    (6) Correcting the SED. As soon as the exporter, or the exporter's
forwarding agent or carrier determines at which port the shipment is to
be unloaded (whether in the country of ultimate destination or in a
country of transit), that person must correct the SED to show the
specific port of unloading and the name and address of the intermediate
consignee to whom delivery is to be made. An intermediate consignee
must be shown if the port of unloading is located in a country other
than the country of destination. If the export is unloaded at more than
one port, the quantity and value unloaded at each port and the name and
address of each intermediate consignee must be given. The procedures
for correcting and filing SEDs may be found in paragraph (n) of this
section.
    (j) Signature on SED. The exporter or the exporter's authorized
forwarding agent, or an authorized employee of either, may sign the
SED. In general, the requisite authority rests with employees who, by
their official titles, are apparently vested with power to deal with
exports, such as export managers or such corporate officers as the
president, vice president, treasurer, and secretary of a corporation,
any partner of a partnership, and any responsible head of any other
form of private or quasi-governmental organization, and assistant
officers. The signature of such person, whether that of the exporter or
authorized agent or employee, constitutes a representation by the
exporter that all statements and information in the SED are true and
correct. In addition, if the signature is that of the forwarding agent,
or the forwarding agent's duly authorized officer or employee, such
signature constitutes a like representation by the forwarding agent.
    (k) Attachment to SED. (1) If you need additional space for any
information on the SED, you may use additional copies of the SED or
copies of the continuation sheet. In such cases, only one SED need be
signed. You must number the additional sheets in sequence and securely
attach them to the executed SED. You must insert the following
statement on the last line of the description line of the SED form
itself:

    This SED consists of this sheet and ________ continuation
sheets.

    (2) No portion of any form attached as a continuation sheet may be
torn off or removed.
    (l) Special requirements for additional information and documents.
(1) A license may bear on its face a requirement to submit a SED or
other documents (or information) to the Office of Export Enforcement in
addition to that furnished when the application was filed. The exporter
and the person submitting the documents represent that the documents
are complete, truthful and accurate. The Export Administration
Regulations prohibit the making of false representations to the U.S.
Government in any export control matter (see Sec. 764.2(g) of the EAR).
The licensee must furnish the documents to: Office of Export
Enforcement, Room H-4520, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and
Constitution Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20230.
    (2) When required, the licensee must:
    (i) Prepare one copy of the SED in addition to the number of copies
otherwise required;
    (ii) Enter the additional information called for by the license in
the space between the column provided for marks and numbers of the
shipment and the column provided for its value on all copies of the
SED; and
    (iii) Unless otherwise specified on the license, attach the
required documents (either original or certified copy) to the extra
copy of the SED.
    (m) SED for shipments moving in- transit. (1) Applicability. Use
the SED for In-transit Goods, Commerce Form 7513,<SUP>2 for the
following types of transactions:

    \2\  Form 7513 may be purchased from the Superintendent of
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402,
the local customs offices, or may be privately printed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Items departing the United States by vessel, which transited
through, or transshipped in, ports of the United States, destined from
one foreign country or area to another.
    (ii) Foreign merchandise exported from a General Order Warehouse
and the export of foreign-origin merchandise that was rejected after
government inspection or examination. Shipments in bond transiting the
United States being exported by means of any carrier other than a
vessel may be cleared for export without presenting a Form 7513, unless
a license is required for the export.

[[Page 12857]]

    (2) Exports from Foreign Trade Zones. You may not use Form 7513 for
any exports from Foreign Trade Zones. Such shipments require the filing
of the SED (Form 7525-V), unless otherwise exempted, with the
applicable zone number reported on the Document.
    (3) Additional information. The following additional information
must be entered on a SED for In-transit Goods:
    (i) The name and address of the intermediate consignee in a foreign
destination, if any, must be shown below the description of the items.
    (ii) Underneath the name and address of the intermediate consignee,
one of the following statements, whichever is appropriate, must be
entered:
    (A) For intransit shipments of foreign-origin merchandise (see part
772 of the EAR for a definition of ``foreign-origin,''), enter the
following statement:
    The merchandise described herein is of foreign-origin.
    (B) For intransit shipments of domestic (U.S.) merchandise, enter
the following statement:
    The merchandise described herein is of the growth, production, or
manufacture of the United States.
    (C) For intransit shipments of items of U.S.-origin eligible for
License Exception TUS (See Sec. 740.9 of the EAR), enter the following
statement:
    The merchandise described herein is of the growth, production, or
manufacture of the United States, but has been so altered by further
processing, manufacture, or assembly in a foreign country that it has
either been substantially enhanced in value, or has lost its original
identity with respect to form.
    (iii) The items must be described in terms of Schedule B, including
the appropriate Schedule B number.
    (4) See Sec. 30.8 of the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations (15
CFR 30.8) for additional requirements concerning the information that
must be placed on a SED for In-transit Goods.
    (n) Correction, change, alteration, or amendment of SED. (1)
Methods of changing SED's. The exporter or the exporter's agent must
report corrections, cancellations, additions or amendments to
information reported on SEDs to the Customs Director at the port of
exportation (or, in the case of mail shipments, to the Postmaster at
the post office where the shipment was mailed) as soon as the need for
such changes is determined. See the Foreign Trade Statistics
Regulations (15 CFR part 30) for additional information about how to
correct SEDs and file the corrections. If you are required by paragraph
(l) of this section to file a copy of the original SED with the Office
of Export Enforcement (OEE), a copy of the changed SED should be sent
to OEE at the address shown in paragraph (l) of this section with the
words ``Correction Copy'' conspicuously shown in the upper right
portion of the form.
    (2) Responsibility. Nothing in this section relieves you or any
person or firm making changes on the SED from responsibility for any
such changes. Acceptance of a changed SED by the Customs office does
not imply approval of any act involved in the shipment or acceptance of
the truth or accuracy of the information provided.
    (o) Summary monthly reports in lieu of individual SED's. (1) Scope.
This paragraph contains only basic information about the monthly filing
procedures for the SED. Details of the procedure may be found in
Sec. 30.39 of the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations (FTSR) of the
Bureau of the Census (15 CFR 30.39). Exporters interested in the
procedure should consult Sec. 30.39 of the FTSR to ascertain
qualifications, how to apply for the privilege of participating, how to
file electronically after approval is given, and other pertinent facts.
    (2) Applicability. Approved parties may file monthly SEDs with the
Bureau of the Census for export to destinations in Country Groups B and
D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (3) How to request monthly reporting privileges. (i) Addresses. (A)
A request for the privilege of participating in monthly reporting
procedures should be forwarded to: Foreign Trade Division, Bureau of
the Census, Washington, D.C. 20233.
    (B) A copy of all requests must be sent to: Office of Export
Enforcement, Room H-4616, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th St. and
Constitution Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20230.
    (ii) Certification requirements. The request must include the
following certification by the applicant:

    I (We) certify that I (we) have established adequate internal
procedures and safeguards to assure compliance with the requirements
set forth in the U.S. Department of Commerce Export Administration
Regulations and Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations. Among other
things, these procedures and safeguards assure:

    (1) A proper determination as to whether a license is required
for a particular export;
    (2) Actual receipt of the export license, if required, before
the shipment is exported;
    (3) Compliance with all the terms of the license, License
Exception, or NLR provisions of the EAR as applicable;
    (4) Return of licenses to BXA in accordance with Sec. 750.8(b)
of the Export Administration Regulations, if requested;
    (5) Compliance with the destination control statement provisions
of Secs. 758.5 and 758.6 of the Export Administration Regulations;
    (6) Compliance with the prohibition against export transactions
that involve persons who have been denied U.S. export privileges;
and
    (7) Compliance with the recordkeeping requirements of part 762
of the EAR and, in addition, I (we) agree that my (our) office
records will be made available for inspection by the Bureau of the
Census, BXA or the U.S. Customs Service, upon request, to verify
that a given shipment was properly included in a particular monthly
report.

    (4) Exporter's agent. If the exporter intends to authorize a
forwarding agent to file electronically on the exporter's behalf, the
exporter's request must include the name and address of each such
forwarding agent.
    (5) Authorization by Census to use monthly reporting procedure. Any
authorization to file summary monthly reports in lieu of individual
SEDs may be granted only by the Bureau of the Census with the
concurrence of BXA.
    (6) Export clearance. (i) Destination control statement. In
addition to the exporter's responsibility for assuring that the proper
destination control statement is placed on the commercial invoice as
required by Sec. 758.6 of this part, the exporter or the exporter's
forwarding agent is responsible for assuring that the carrier places
the proper destination control statement on the related bill of lading
or air waybill.
    (ii) Detention and examination. Shipments being reported under the
summary filing procedure described in this paragraph are subject to
inspection, examination and detention, as provided in Sec. 758.7 of
this part, whenever an official of BXA, a customs officer, or a
postmaster deems such action necessary to assure compliance with the
EAR.
    (7) Revocation of authorization. An authorization to file summary
monthly reports in lieu of individual SED's, granted under the
provisions of Sec. 30.39 of the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations
(15 CFR 30.39) and this paragraph, may be revoked, suspended, or
revised at any time.
    (8) Effect of other provisions. Insofar as consistent with the
provisions of this paragraph that relate specifically to filing
electronically in lieu of individual SED's, the other provisions of
this part 758 apply to exports reported under this procedure.

Sec. 758.4  Conformity of documents for shipments under export licenses

    (a) Applicability. The rules of conformity in this section apply to
shipping documents used in connection with any shipment under the
authority

[[Page 12858]]
of a license issued by BXA except ``master'' air waybills issued by
consolidators. These rules apply to any individual air waybill issued
by a consolidator (indirect carrier) for an export included in a
consolidated shipment and to any air waybill issued by anyone in
connection with an export not included in a consolidated shipment.
    (b) Compliance. You may not issue, prepare, or procure a bill of
lading that is contrary to the provisions of this section. Officials of
BXA and the U.S. Customs Service are authorized to require any document
or to use any other appropriate methods to ensure compliance with the
rules of conformity in this section.
    (c) Rules of conformity. (1) General. The following documents must
be consistent with each other:
    (i) The license issued by BXA;
    (ii) One of the following applicable documents:
    (A) The SED;
    (B) If there is no SED, the Shipper's Letter of Instructions; or
    (C) If there is neither, another document containing instructions
that the exporter conveys (either directly or through an agent) to the
carrier; and
    (iii) The outbound bill of lading (including a railroad through
bill of lading) covering a particular export shipment must be
consistent with one another.
    (2) Signs of inconsistent documents. The bill of lading, whether in
negotiable or nonnegotiable form, is not consistent with those other
documents if:
    (i) It does not provide for delivery of the shipment (cargo) at a
port located in the country of either the ultimate or intermediate
consignee named in the documents described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of
this section;
    (ii) It contains any indication that the shipment is intransit to a
country of ultimate destination different from that named in the
appropriate one of the documents described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of
this section, or that the shipment is not for consumption in such
country of ultimate destination. For example, it would be inconsistent
to consign a shipment to the ultimate destination with a qualifying
phrase indicating the shipment is ``in transit'' at that destination,
or to consign the shipment to a free zone or free port;
    (iii) It names as shipper any person other than the licensee (the
person to whom a license is issued) or the licensee's duly authorized
forwarding agent. Where shipments from more than one licensee are
consolidated on a single bill of lading, the shipper named on the bill
of lading must also appear as the authorized forwarding agent for each
exporter on each document described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this
section.
    (iv) The name and address of the ultimate consignee are not shown
either in the space provided for ``consignee'' or in the body of the
bill of lading under the caption ``ultimate consignee and notify
party'' or, in the case of the air waybill, under the caption ``also
notify.'' However, where shipments to more than one ultimate consignee
are consolidated on one bill of lading and not all are shown in the
body of the bill of lading, the name of the intermediate consignee
(customs broker or consolidator's agent in the foreign country) who
will receive and distribute the items to the ultimate consignees must
appear on the bill of lading, the export license(s), and documents
listed in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (3) Additional rules for negotiable bills of lading. A negotiable
bill of lading (an ``order'' bill of lading) is deemed consistent with
the appropriate one of the documents described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)
of this section only if the consignee or order party named on the bill
of lading is also named in the SED, the Shipper's Letter of
Instructions or the other document.
    (i) Sometimes ``order'' bills of lading consign the items they
cover to the order of the shipper, to the order of an intermediate
consignee such as a bank, foreign freight forwarder, or other
intermediary, or to the order of a purchaser who is not the same person
as the ultimate consignee. An ``order'' bill of lading issued in any of
these forms constitutes a representation by the shipper that:
    (A) The items covered by the appropriate one of the documents
described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section and bill of lading
are ultimately destined to the ultimate consignee stated on the
license;
    (B) The ``order'' bill of lading has not been used for the purpose
of evading the terms and conditions of the license; and
    (C) Pursuant to the contract of carriage, the items will be
delivered at a port located in the country of the ultimate consignee or
of the intermediate consignee named on the appropriate one of the
documents described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (4) Item description. On the bill of lading the items may be
described in terms of the freight tariff classification or other type
of classification, but may not be inconsistent with the description
shown on the appropriate one of the documents described in paragraph
(c)(1)(ii). These documents must include the same item description as
shown on the related license, and, in addition, it must include more
detailed information where required by the Bureau of the Census.
    (5) Carrier's manifest. If the carrier's outward foreign manifest
filed with the U.S. customs office contains the names of shippers or
consignees, these names must not be inconsistent with the names shown
on the bill of lading and the appropriate one of the documents
described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.

Sec. 758.5  General destination control requirements

    (a) Scope. This section sets forth some actions the parties to a
transaction authorized by a license issued by BXA are prohibited from
taking. The purpose of these prohibitions is to prevent items licensed
for export from being diverted while in transit or thereafter. It also
sets forth the duties of the parties when the goods are unloaded in a
country other than that of the ultimate consignee or intermediate
consignee as stated on the export license.
    (b) Destination on bill of lading or air waybill--(1) Requirements
to prevent diversions. (i) Statements on bill of lading or air waybill.
(A) A carrier (or any other person on behalf of any carrier) may not
issue a bill of lading or air waybill providing for delivery of cargo
at any foreign port located outside the country of the ultimate
consignee, or the intermediate consignee, named on the appropriate one
of the documents described in Sec. 758.4(c)(1)(ii) of this part.
    (B) Optional ports on bill of lading or air waybill. No carrier may
issue a bill of lading or air waybill providing for delivery of cargo
at optional ports to the ultimate consignee named on one of the
appropriate documents described in Sec. 758.4(c)(1) (i) and (ii) of
this part where one of such optional ports is not in the country of
ultimate destination named on the license or SED, or if there is no
SED, the Shipper's Letter of Instructions, or if there is neither,
another document containing instructions that the exporter conveys
(either directly or through an agent) to the carrier, without prior
written authorization from BXA. However, where the appropriate document
described in Sec. 758.4(c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this part provide for
delivery of cargo to optional intermediate consignees located in ports
in different countries, the carrier may issue a bill of lading or air
waybill providing for delivery at such optional ports.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) Delivery of cargo. No carrier may deliver cargo to any country
other than

[[Page 12859]]
the country of the ultimate consignee, or the intermediate consignee,
named on the appropriate one of the documents described in
Sec. 758.4(c)(1)(ii) of this part at the request or option of the
shipper, consignor, exporter, purchaser, or ultimate consignee, or
their agents, or any other person having custody or control of the
shipment, without prior written authorization from BXA to the carrier
or its agent.
    (c) Duties when items are unloaded in a unauthorized country. If
the items are unloaded in a country other than that of the intermediate
or ultimate consignee as stated on the appropriate one of the documents
described in Sec. 758.4(c)(1)(ii) of this part, the procedures
described in this paragraph must be followed.
    (1) Reasons beyond carrier's control. Nothing contained in the EAR
shall be deemed to prohibit a carrier from unloading cargo at a port
outside the country of intermediate or ultimate destination shown on
the appropriate one of the documents described in Sec. 758.4(c)(1)(ii)
of this part, where for reasons beyond the control of the carrier (as
set forth in the standard provisions of the carrier's bill of lading or
air waybill, such as acts of God, perils of the sea, damage to the
carrier, strikes, war, political disturbances, or insurrections), it is
not feasible to deliver the cargo at the licensed port of destination.
    (2) Required actions for unscheduled unloading. (i) If the item is
unloaded in a country to which that item may be exported without a
license issued by BXA, no one is required to notify BXA of the
unloading. The exporter may dispose of the items in that country
without approval of BXA. When making such a disposition you must still
comply with any conditions or requirements of the License Exception or
other provisions of the EAR that would authorize the export of the item
being unloaded to the country in which you are disposing of it, and any
regulations of other government agencies that apply to the transaction.
This paragraph does not authorize anyone to take any action with
knowledge that a violation of the Export Administration Act, the EAR,
or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder, has occurred,
is about to occur or is intended to occur, or to deliver to a denied
party or to take any other action prohibited by the EAR.
    (ii) If a license issued by BXA would be required to export the
item to the country in which it is unloaded:
    (A) No person may take any steps to effect delivery or entry of the
items into the commerce of the country where unloaded without prior
approval of BXA;
    (B) The carrier must take steps to assure that the items are placed
in custody under bond or other guaranty not to enter the commerce of
such country or any country other than the countries of the ultimate
and intermediate consignees shown on the appropriate one of the
documents described in Sec. 758.4(c)(1)(ii) of this part, without prior
approval of BXA;
    (iii) The carrier, the carrier's agent located in the United
States, and the exporter each have specific responsibilities to notify
BXA regarding any unscheduled unloading. The specific responsibilities
of each party are as follows:
    (A) The carrier must, within 10 days after date of unloading,
report the facts to the nearest American Consulate and to the agent of
the carrier located in the United States. Within 10 days after receipt
of such report, the agent must send a copy of the report to BXA. The
report must include:
    (1) A copy of the manifest of such diverted cargo;
    (2) A statement of the place of unloading; and;
    (3) The name and address of the person in whose custody the items
were delivered.
    (B) BXA will inform the exporter of the unloading. Within 10 days
following receipt of this notice, the exporter must inform BXA of the
proposed disposition of the items. The exporter may not dispose of the
items without approval of BXA.

Sec. 758.6  Destination control statement

    (a) Requirement for destination control statement. (1) The
destination control statement shown in paragraph (b) of this section
must be entered on all copies of the bill of lading, the air waybill
and the commercial invoice covering any export from the United States
if:
    (i) The export is made under authority of a license, including the
Special Comprehensive License;
    (ii) The export is made under the authority of the following
License Exceptions: LST (GBS, CIV, LVS), RPL (PTS, SNR), and TMP (TMP,
TUS); or
    (iii) The export is made under the ``No License Required''
provisions of the EAR (as described in Sec. 758.1(a) of this part) if
the reason for control of the item as stated in the entry on the CCL is
NS or NP.
    (2) An exporter or the exporter's agent may enter a destination
control statement on the shipping documents for exports for which no
destination control statement is required.
    (b) Text of destination control statement.

    These commodities, technology or software were exported from the
United States in accordance with the Export Administration
Regulations. Diversion contrary to U.S. law prohibited.

    (c) Additional destination information. In addition to the
destination control statement, an exporter or exporter's agent may
supply additional information on the shipping documents, including the
country(ies) to which export or reexport is authorized.
    (d) Permissive reexports. If reexport or diversion from the
original transaction is contemplated and the change from the original
transaction is consistent with the license, License Exception, the NLR
provisions of the EAR or other authorization and with all other
requirements of the EAR, the exporter may so advise its foreign
importer without obtaining further authorization from BXA.
    (e) Responsibility for assuring that the destination control
statement is used--(1) Exporters. The exporter is responsible for
assuring entry of the destination control statement on the commercial
invoice, regardless of whether the exporter actually prepares this
document. The exporter has this responsibility even if the invoice is
prepared by an order party or the exporter acts through an agent.
    (2) Agents of exporters (forwarding agents). Agents of exporters
are also responsible for assuring entry of the destination control
statement on the commercial invoice.
    (i) If the agent receives from the exporter a copy of a commercial
invoice without the correct destination control statement, the agent
must:
    (A) Notify the exporter in writing;
    (B) Request written assurance from the exporter that:
    (1) The destination control statement has been properly entered on
all other copies of the commercial invoice; and
    (2) Any person who received an invoice without the statement has
been informed in writing of the restrictions in the statement;
    (ii) And either:
    (A) Enter the appropriate statement on the agent's copy of the
invoice; or
    (B) Return it to the exporter for completion; and
    (iii) Keep and make available for inspection, in accordance with
part 762 of the EAR, a copy of that person's notification to the
exporter and the original of the exporter's assurance required by
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. (For further recordkeeping
requirements, see part 762 of the EAR.)

[[Page 12860]]

    (iv) If the agent prepares the invoice, the agent's
responsibilities are governed by paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (3) Forwarders, carriers and other parties who prepare invoices. If
a forwarder, a carrier acting as a forwarder, or any other party
prepares, presents, and/or executes the invoice, the forwarder,
carrier, or other party is also responsible for assuring that an
appropriate statement is entered on the invoice.
    (4) Carriers and other parties who issue bills of lading or air
waybills. The carrier, or any other party that issues the bill of
lading or air waybill, is responsible for assuring that the destination
control statement appearing on the corresponding invoice also appears
on the bill of lading or air waybill.
    (f) Responsibility for distributing copies of the invoice. The
exporter or other person issuing any invoice containing a destination
control statement must send copies in a manner which assures their
arrival either with or prior to arrival of the items being exported to:
    (1) The ultimate consignee and the purchaser named in the SED;
    (2) The intermediate consignee; and
    (3) Any other persons named in the invoice who are located in a
foreign country. Nothing contained in this part shall be construed to
limit the persons or classes of persons to whom such invoices, bills of
lading or air waybills are usually and customarily sent in the course
of export trade. The shipper or other person issuing the commercial
invoice may comply with the requirements of this section even if the
copy of the invoice sent to any of the persons listed in paragraphs
(f)(1) or (2) this section omits all reference to price or sales
commission provided such invoice otherwise adequately identifies the
shipment. As an alternative in lieu of a copy of the commercial
invoice, such person may send a copy of the bill of lading or air
waybill containing the destination control statement.
    (g) Requirements for bill of lading or air waybill. (1) General. No
carrier may issue (and no one may prepare or procure) a bill of lading
or air waybill covering an export for which a destination control
statement is required under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this
section, unless all copies of such bill of lading or air waybill
(including all non-negotiable and office copies) contain the
destination control statement in clearly legible form.
    (2) Exception for ``master'' air waybills. In the case of shipments
by air (other than airmail or air parcel post), the requirement of
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section applies to any air waybill,
including one issued by a consolidator (indirect carrier) for an export
included in a consolidated shipment. However, the provisions of
paragraph (f) of this section do not apply to a ``master'' air waybill
issued by a carrier to cover a consolidated shipment.
    (h) Requirements for the commercial invoice. No licensee, shipper,
consignor, exporter, agent, or any other person may prepare or issue a
commercial invoice for a shipment for which a destination control
statement is required under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this
section, unless all copies of the invoice(s) contain the statement in
clearly legible form.
    (i) Carrier's responsibility before releasing cargo. No carrier may
release custody of a shipment covered by the provisions of this section
to any party without surrender by that party, to the carrier, of a copy
of the bill of lading or air waybill bearing on its face the applicable
destination control statement, unless either:
    (1) Simultaneously with the release, the carrier delivers to such
party a written copy of the destination control statement, contained in
the carrier's copy of the bill of lading or air waybill for the
shipment. The written copy must identify the shipment by bill of lading
or air waybill number, name of carrier, voyage or flight number, date,
and port of arrival. The carrier must also secure either a signed
receipted copy of the written statement or other equivalent written
evidence that the statement has been delivered by the carrier; or,
    (2) The regulations of the importing country require the carrier to
deliver the items directly into the physical possession and control of
customs or other government agency for delivery to the consignee or the
consignee's agent. In this case, the carrier need not give to, or
receive from, the customs or other government agency, or the consignee
or the consignee's agent, any document bearing the destination control
statement.

Sec. 758.7  Authority of the Office of Export Enforcement, the Bureau
of Export Administration, Customs offices and Postmasters in clearing
shipments

    (a) Actions to assure compliance with the EAR. Officials of BXA,
the Office of Export Enforcement, the U.S. Customs Service and
postmasters, including post office officials, are authorized and
directed to take appropriate action to assure compliance with the EAR.
This includes assuring that:
    (1) Exports without a license issued by BXA are either outside the
scope of the license requirements of the Export Administration
Regulations or authorized by a License Exception; and
    (2) Exports purporting to be authorized by licenses issued by BXA
are, in fact, so authorized and the transaction complies with the terms
of the license.
    (b) Types of actions. The officials designated in paragraph (a) of
this section are authorized to take the following types of actions:
    (1) Inspection of items. (i) Purpose of inspection. All items
declared for export are subject to inspection for the purpose of
verifying the items specified in the SED, or if there is no SED, the
bill of lading or other loading document covering the items about to be
exported, and the value and quantity thereof, and to assure observance
of the other provisions of the Export Administration Regulations. This
authority applies to all exports within the scope of the Export
Administration Act or Export Administration Regulations whether or not
such exports require a license issued by BXA. The inspection may
include, but is not limited to, item identification, technical
appraisal (analysis), or both.
    (ii) Place of inspection. Inspection shall be made at the place of
lading or where officials authorized to make those inspections are
stationed for that purpose.
    (iii) Technical identification. Where, in the judgment of the
official making the inspection, the item cannot be properly identified,
a sample may be taken for more detailed examination or for laboratory
analysis.
    (A) Obtaining samples. The sample will be obtained by the official
making the inspection in accordance with the provisions for sampling
imported merchandise. The size of the sample will be the minimum
representative amount necessary for identification or analysis. This
will depend on such factors as the physical condition of the material
(whether solid, liquid, or gas) and the size and shape of the
container.
    (B) Notification to exporter and consignee. When a sample is taken,
the exporter (or the exporter's agent) and the ultimate consignee will
be notified by letter from one of the official designated in paragraph
(a) of this section, showing the port of export, date of sampling,
export license number (if any) or other authorization, invoice number
quantity of sample taken, description of item, marks and packing case
numbers, and manufacturer's number for the item. The original letter
will be sent to the exporter or the exporter's agent, the duplicate
will be placed in the container that had been opened, and the
triplicate will be retained by the inspecting office.

[[Page 12861]]

    (C) Disposal of samples. Samples will be disposed of in accordance
with the U.S. Customs Service procedure for imported commodities.
    (2) Inspection of documents. (i) General. Officials designated in
paragraph (a) of this section are authorized to require exporters or
their agents, and owners and operators of exporting carriers or their
agents, to produce for inspection or copying: invoices, orders, letters
of credit, inspection reports, packing lists, shipping documents and
instructions, correspondence, and any other relevant documents, as well
as furnish other information bearing upon a particular shipment being
exported or intended to be exported.
    (ii) Cartridge and shell case scrap. When cartridge or shell cases
are being exported as scrap (whether or not they have been heated,
flame-treated, mangled, crushed, or cut) from the United States, the
U.S. Customs Service is authorized to require the exporter to furnish
information bearing on the identity and relationships of all parties to
the transaction and produce a copy of the bid offer by the armed
services in order to assure that the terms of the Export Administration
Regulations are being met and that the material being shipped is scrap.
    (3) Questioning of individuals. Officials designated in paragraph
(a) of this section are authorized to question the owner or operator of
an exporting carrier and the carrier's agent(s), as well as the
exporter and the exporter's agent(s), concerning a particular shipment
exported or intended to be exported.
    (4) Prohibiting lading. Officials designated in paragraph (a) of
this section are authorized to prevent the lading of items on an
exporting carrier whenever those officials have reasonable cause to
believe that the export or removal from the United States is contrary
to the Export Administration Regulations.
    (5) Inspection of exporting carrier. The U.S. Customs Service is
authorized to inspect and search any exporting carrier at any time to
determine whether items are intended to be, or are being, exported or
removed from the United States contrary to the Export Administration
Regulations. Officials of the Office of Export Enforcement may conduct
such inspections with the concurrence of the U.S. Customs Service.
    (6) Seizure and detention. Customs officers are authorized, under
Title 22 of the United States Code, section 401, et seq., to seize and
detain any items whenever an attempt is made to export such items in
violation of the Export Administration Regulations, or whenever they
know or have probable cause to believe that the items are intended to
be, are being, or have been exported in violation of the EAR. Seized
items are subject to forfeiture. In addition to the authority of
Customs officers to seize and detain items, both customs officials and
officials of the Office of Export Enforcement are authorized to detain
any shipment held for review of the SED, or if there is no SED, the
bill of lading or other loading document covering the items about to be
exported, or for physical inspection of the items, whenever such action
is deemed to be necessary to assure compliance with the EAR.
    (7) Preventing departure of carrier. The U.S. Customs Service is
authorized under Title 22 of the U. S. Code, section 401, et seq., to
seize and detain, either before or after clearance, any vessel or
vehicle or air carrier that has been or is being used in exporting or
attempting to export any item intended to be, being, or having been
exported in violation of the EAR.
    (8) Ordering the unloading. The U.S. Customs Service is authorized
to unload, or to order the unloading of, items from any exporting
carrier, whenever the U.S. Customs Service has reasonable cause to
believe such items are intended to be, or are being, exported or
removed from the United States contrary to the EAR.
    (9) Ordering the return of items. If, after notice that an
inspection of a shipment is to be made, a carrier departs without
affording the U.S. Customs Service, Office of Export Enforcement, or
BXA personnel an adequate opportunity to examine the shipment, the
owner or operator of the exporting carrier and the exporting carrier's
agent(s) may be ordered to return items exported on such exporting
carrier and make them available for inspection.
    (10) Designating time and place for clearance. The U.S. Customs
Service is authorized to designate times and places at which U.S.
exports may move by land transportation to countries contiguous to the
United States.

Sec. 758.8  Return or unloading of cargo at direction of BXA, the
Office of Export Enforcement or Customs Service.

    (a) Exporting carrier. As used in this section, the term
``exporting carrier'' includes a connecting or on-forwarding carrier,
as well as the owner, charterer, agent, master, or any other person in
charge of the vessel, aircraft, or other kind of carrier, whether such
person is located in the United States or in a foreign country.
    (b) Ordering return or unloading of shipment. Where there are
reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of the Export
Administration Regulations has occurred, or will occur, with respect to
a particular export from the United States, BXA, the Office of Export
Enforcement, or the U.S. Customs Service may order any person in
possession or control of such shipment, including the exporting
carrier, to return or unload the shipment. Such person must, as
ordered, either:
    (1) Return the shipment to the United States or cause it to be
returned or;
    (2) Unload the shipment at a port of call and take steps to assure
that it is placed in custody under bond or other guaranty not to enter
the commerce of any foreign country without prior approval of BXA. For
the purpose of this section, the furnishing of a copy of the order to
any person included within the definition of exporting carrier will be
sufficient notice of the order to the exporting carrier.
    (c) Requirements regarding shipment to be unloaded. The provisions
of Sec. 758.5(b) and (c) of this part, relating to reporting,
notification to BXA, and the prohibition against unauthorized delivery
or entry of the item into a foreign country, shall apply also when
items are unloaded at a port of call, as provided in paragraph (b)(2)
of this section.
    (d) Notification. Upon discovery by any person included within the
term ``exporting carrier,'' as defined in paragraph (a) of this
section, that a violation of the EAR has occurred or will occur with

Sec. 760.1  Definitions.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR
chapter VII, subchapter C.
    (a) Definition of Person. For purposes of this part, the term
``person'' means any individual, or any association or organization,
public or private, which is organized, permanently established,
resident, or registered to do business, in the United States or any
foreign country. This definition of person includes both the singular
and plural and, in addition, includes:
    (1) Any partnership, corporation, company, branch, or other form of
association or organization, whether organized for profit or non-profit
purposes;
    (2) Any government, or any department, agency, or commission of any
government;
    (3) Any trade association, chamber of commerce, or labor union;
    (4) Any charitable or fraternal organization; and
    (5) Any other association or organization not specifically listed
in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (b) Definition of ``United States Person''.  (1) This part applies
to United States persons. For purposes of this part, the term United
States person means any person who is a United States resident or
national, including individuals, domestic concerns, and ``controlled in
fact'' foreign subsidiaries, affiliates, or other permanent foreign
establishments of domestic concerns. This definition of United States
person includes both the singular and plural and, in addition,
includes:
    (i) The government of the United States or any department, agency,
or commission thereof;
    (ii) The government of any State of the United States, the District
of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or
possession of the United States, or any subdivision, department,
agency, or commission of any such government;
    (iii) Any partnership, corporation, company, association, or other
entity organized under the laws of paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this
section;
    (iv) Any foreign concern's subsidiary, partnership, affiliate,
branch, office, or other permanent establishment in any state of the
United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States; and
    (v) Any domestic concern's foreign subsidiary, partnership,
affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment
which is controlled in fact by such domestic concern. (See paragraph
(c) of this section on ``Definition of 'Controlled in Fact'.'')
    (2) The term domestic concern means any partnership, corporation,
company, association, or other entity of, or organized under the laws
of, any jurisdiction named in paragraph (b)(1) (i) or (ii) of this
section, or any permanent domestic establishment of a foreign concern.
    (3) The term foreign concern means any partnership, corporation,
company, association, or other entity of, or organized under the laws
of, any jurisdiction other than those named in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or
(ii) of this section.
    (4) The term United States person does not include an individual
United States national who is resident outside the United States and
who is either employed permanently or temporarily by a non-United
States person or assigned to work as an employee for, and under the
direction and control of, a non-United States person.

Examples of ``United States Person''

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining whether a person is a ``United States person.'' They are
illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. bank A has a branch office in foreign country P. Such
branch office is a United States person, because it is a permanent
foreign establishment of a domestic concern.
    (ii) Ten foreign nationals establish a manufacturing plant, A,
in the United States, incorporating the plant under New York law.
    A is a United States person, because it is a corporation
organized under the laws of one of the states of the United States.
    (iii) A, a foreign corporation, opens an office in the United
States for purposes of soliciting U.S. orders. The office is not
separately incorporated.
    A's U.S. office is a United States person, because it is a
permanent establishment, in the United States, of a foreign concern.
    (iv) A, a U.S. individual, owns stock in foreign corporation B.
    A is a United States person. However, A is not a ``domestic
concern,'' because the term ``domestic concern'' does not include
individuals.
    (v) A, a foreign national resident in the United States, is
employed by B, a foreign corporation.
    A is a United States person, because he is resident in the
United States.
    (vi) A, a foreign national, who is resident in a foreign country
and is employed by a foreign corporation, makes occasional visits to
the United States, for purposes of exploring business opportunities.
    A is not a United States person, because he is not a United
States resident or national.
    (vii) A is an association of U.S. firms organized under the laws
of Pennsylvania for the purpose of expanding trade.
    A is a United States person, because it is an association
organized under the laws of one of the states of the United States.
    (viii) At the request of country Y, A, an individual employed by
U.S. company B, is transferred to company C as an employee. C is a
foreign company owned and controlled by country Y. A, a U.S.
national who will reside in Y, has agreed to the transfer provided
he is able to retain his insurance, pension, and other benefits.
Accordingly, company B has agreed to keep A as an employee in order
to protect his employee benefits, and company C has agreed to pay
for A's salary. At all times while he works for C, A will be under
C's direction and control.
    A is not a United States person while under C's direction and
control, because he will be resident outside the United States and
assigned as an employee to a non-United States person. The
arrangement designed to protect A's insurance, pension, and other
benefits does not destroy his status as an

[[Page 12863]]
employee of C so long as he is under the direction and control of C.
    (ix) A, a U.S. citizen, has resided in Europe for three years,
where he is a self-employed consultant for United States and foreign
companies in the communications industry.
    A is a United States person, because he is a U.S. national and
because he is not a resident outside the United States who is
employed by other than a United States person.

    (c) Definition of ``Controlled in Fact''. (1) This part applies to
any domestic concern's foreign subsidiary, partnership, affiliate,
branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment which is
controlled in fact by such domestic concern. Control in fact consists
of the authority or ability of a domestic concern to establish the
general policies or to control day-to-day operations of its foreign
subsidiary, partnership, affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent
foreign establishment.
    (2) A foreign subsidiary or affiliate of a domestic concern will be
presumed to be controlled in fact by that domestic concern, subject to
rebuttal by competent evidence, when:
    (i) The domestic concern beneficially owns or controls (whether
directly or indirectly) more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting
securities of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate;
    (ii) The domestic concern beneficially owns or controls (whether
directly or indirectly) 25 percent or more of the voting securities of
the foreign subsidiary or affiliate, if no other person owns or
controls (whether directly or indirectly) an equal or larger
percentage;
    (iii) The foreign subsidiary or affiliate is operated by the
domestic concern pursuant to the provisions of an exclusive management
contract;
    (iv) A majority of the members of the board of directors of the
foreign subsidiary or affiliate are also members of the comparable
governing body of the domestic concern;
    (v) The domestic concern has authority to appoint the majority of
the members of the board of directors of the foreign subsidiary or
affiliate; or
    (vi) The domestic concern has authority to appoint the chief
operating officer of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate.
    (3) A brokerage firm or other person which holds simple record
ownership of securities for the convenience of clients will not be
deemed to control the securities.
    (4) A domestic concern which owns, directly or indirectly,
securities that are immediately convertible at the option of the holder
or owner into voting securities is presumed to own or control those
voting securities.
    (5) A domestic concern's foreign branch office or other
unincorporated permanent foreign establishment is deemed to be
controlled in fact by such domestic concern under all circumstances.

Examples of ``Controlled in Fact''

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which a foreign subsidiary,
affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment of a domestic
concern is ``controlled in fact.'' They are illustrative, not
comprehensive.
    (i) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Fifty-one
percent of the voting stock of A is owned by U.S. company B.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumption
may be rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not,
in fact, lie with B.
    (ii) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Ten percent
of the voting stock of A is owned by U.S. company B. A has an
exclusive management contract with B pursuant to which A is operated
by B.
    As long as such contract is in effect, A is presumed to be
controlled in fact by B. This presumption may be rebutted by
competent evidence showing that control does not, in fact, lie with
B.
    (iii) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Ten
percent of the voting stock of A is owned by U.S. company B. A has
10 persons on its board of directors. Six of those persons are also
members of the board of directors of U.S. company B.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumption
may be rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not,
in fact, lie with B.
    (iv) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Thirty
percent of the voting securities of A is owned by U.S. company B and
no other person owns or controls an equal or larger share.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumption
may be rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not,
in fact, lie with B.
    (v) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. In A's
articles of incorporation, U.S. company B has been given authority
to appoint A's board of directors.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumption
may be rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not,
in fact, lie with B.
    (vi) Company A is a joint venture established in a foreign
country, with equal participation by U.S. company B and foreign
company C. U.S. Company B has authority to appoint A's chief
operating officer.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumption
may be rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not,
in fact, lie with B.
    (vii) Same as (vi), except that B has no authority to appoint
A's chief operating officer.
    B is not presumed to control A, absent other facts giving rise
to a presumption of control.
    (viii) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. U.S.
companies B, C, and D each own 20 percent of A's voting securities
and regularly cast their votes in concert.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B, C, and D, because
these companies are acting in concert to control A.
    (ix) U.S. bank B located in the United States has a branch
office, A, in a foreign country. A is not separately incorporated.
    A is deemed to be controlled in fact by B, because A is a branch
office of a domestic concern.
    (x) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Fifty-one
percent of the voting stock of A is owned by company B, which is
incorporated in another foreign country. Fifty-one percent of the
voting stock of B is owned by C, a U.S. company.
    Both A and B are presumed to be controlled in fact by C. The
presumption of C's control over B may be rebutted by competent
evidence showing that control over B does not, in fact, lie with C.
The presumption of B's control over A (and thus C's control over A)
may be rebutted by competent evidence showing that control over A
does not, in fact, lie with B.
    (xi) B, a U.S. individual, owns 51 percent of the voting
securities of A, a manufacturing company incorporated and located in
a foreign country.
    A is not ``controlled in fact'' under this part, because it is
not controlled by a ``domestic concern.''

    (d) Definition of ``Activities in the Interstate or Foreign
Commerce of the United States''.

Activities Involving United States Persons Located in the United
States

    (1) For purposes of this part, the activities of a United States
person located in the United States are in the interstate or foreign
commerce of the United States if they involve the sale, purchase, or
transfer of goods or services (including information) between:
    (i) Two or more of the several States (including the District of
Columbia);
    (ii) Any State (including the District of Columbia) and any
territory or possession of the United States;
    (iii) Two or more of the territories or possessions of the United
States; or
    (iv) A State (including the District of Columbia), territory or
possession of the United States and any foreign country.
    (2) For purposes of this part, the export of goods or services from
the United States and the import of goods or services into the United
States are activities in United States commerce. In addition, the
action of a domestic concern in specifically directing the activities
of its controlled in fact foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or other
permanent foreign establishment is an activity in United States
commerce.
    (3) Activities of a United States person located in the United
States may be in United States commerce even if they are part of or
ancillary to activities

Administration Regulations

[[Continued from page 12863]]

[[Page 12864]]

activity is in United States commerce does not, in and of itself, mean
that the underlying or related activity is in United States commerce.
    (4) Hence, the action of a United States bank located in the United
States in providing financing from the United States for a foreign
transaction that is not in United States commerce is nonetheless itself
in United States commerce. However, the fact that the financing is in
United States commerce does not, in and of itself, make the underlying
foreign transaction an activity in United States commerce, even if the
underlying transaction involves a foreign company that is a United
States person within the meaning of this part.
    (5) Similarly, the action of a United States person located in the
United States in providing financial, accounting, legal, t
ransportation, or other ancillary services to its controlled in fact
foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment
in connection with a foreign transaction is in United States commerce.
But the provision of such ancillary services will not, in and of
itself, bring the foreign transaction of such subsidiary, affiliate, or
permanent foreign establishment into United States commerce.

Activities of Controlled in Fact Foreign Subsidiaries, Affiliates, and
Other Permanent Foreign Establishments

    (6) Any transaction between a controlled in fact foreign
subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment of a
domestic concern and a person located in the United States is an
activity in United States commerce.
    (7) Whether a transaction between such a foreign subsidiary,
affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment and a person
located outside the United States is an activity in United States
commerce is governed by the following rules.

Activities in United States Commerce

    (8) A transaction between a domestic concern's controlled in fact
foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment
and a person outside the United States, involving goods or services
(including information but not including ancillary services) acquired
from a person in the United States is in United States commerce under
any of the following circumstances--
    (i) If the goods or services were acquired for the purpose of
filling an order from a person outside the United States;
    (ii) If the goods or services were acquired for incorporation into,
refining into, reprocessing into, or manufacture of another product for
the purpose of filling an order from a person outside the United
States;
    (iii) If the goods or services were acquired for the purpose of
fulfilling or engaging in any other transaction with a person outside
the United States; or
    (iv) If the goods were acquired and are ultimately used, without
substantial alteration or modification, in filling an order from, or
fulfilling or engaging in any other transaction with, a person outside
the United States (whether or not the goods were originally acquired
for that purpose). If the goods are indistinguishable as to origin from
similar foreign-trade goods with which they have been mingled in a
stockpile or inventory, the subsequent transaction involving the goods
is presumed to be in United States commerce unless, at the time of
filling the order, the foreign-origin inventory on hand was sufficient
to fill the order.
    (9) For purposes of this section, goods or services are considered
to be acquired for the purpose of filling an order from or engaging in
any other transaction with a person outside the United States where:
    (i) They are purchased by the foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or
other permanent foreign establishment upon the receipt of an order from
or on behalf of a customer with the intention that the goods or
services are to go to the customer;
    (ii) They are purchased by the foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or
other permanent foreign establishment to meet the needs of specified
customers pursuant to understandings with those customers, although not
for immediate delivery; or
    (iii) They are purchased by the foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or
other permanent foreign establishment based on the anticipated needs of
specified customers.
    (10) If any non-ancillary part of a transaction between a domestic
concern's controlled foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent
foreign establishment and a person outside the United States is in
United States commerce, the entire transaction is in United States
commerce. For example, if such a foreign subsidiary is engaged in
filling an order from a non-United States customer both with goods
acquired from the United States and with goods acquired elsewhere, the
entire transaction with that customer is in United States commerce.

Activities Outside United States Commerce

    (11) A transaction between a domestic concern's controlled foreign
subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment and a
person outside the United States, not involving the purchase, sale, or
transfer of goods or services (including information) to or from a
person in the United States, is not an activity in United States
commerce.
    (12) The activities of a domestic concern's controlled foreign
subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment with
respect to goods acquired from a person in the United States are not in
United States commerce where:
    (i) They were acquired without reference to a specific order from
or transaction with a person outside the United States; and
    (ii) They were further manufactured, incorporated into, refined
into, or reprocessed into another product.
    (13) The activities of a domestic concern's controlled foreign
subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment with
respect to services acquired from a person in the United States are not
in United States commerce where:
    (i) They were acquired without reference to a specific order from
or transaction with a person outside the United States; or
    (ii) They are ancillary to the transaction with the person outside
the United States.
    (14) For purposes of this section, services are ancillary services
if they are provided to a controlled foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or
other permanent foreign establishment primarily for its own use rather
than for the use of a third person. These typically include financial,
accounting, legal,transportation, and other services, whether provided
by a domestic concern or an unrelated entity.
    (15) Thus, the provision of the project financing by a United
States bank located in the United States to a controlled foreign
subsidiary unrelated to the bank is an ancillary service which will not
cause the underlying transaction to be in United States commerce. By
contrast, where a domestic concern, on behalf of its controlled foreign
subsidiary, gives a guaranty of performance to a foreign country
customer, that is a service provided to the customer and, as such,
brings that subsidiary's transaction with the customer into United
States commerce. Similarly, architectural or engineering services
provided by a

[[Page 12865]]
domestic concern in connection with its controlled foreign subsidiary's
construction project in a third country are services passed through to
the subsidiary's customer and, as such, bring that subsidiary's foreign
transaction into United States commerce.

General

    (16) Regardless of whether the subsequent disposition of goods or
services from the United States is in United States commerce, the
original acquisition of goods or services from a person in the United
States is an activity in United States commerce subject to this part.
Thus, if a domestic concern's controlled foreign subsidiary engages in
a prohibited refusal to do business in stocking its inventory with
goods from the United States, that action is subject to this part
whether or not subsequent sales from that inventory are.
    (17) In all the above, goods and services will be considered to
have been acquired from a person in the United States whether they were
acquired directly or indirectly through a third party, where the person
acquiring the goods or services knows or expects, at the time he places
the order, that they will be delivered from the United States.

Letters of Credit

    (18) Implementation of a letter of credit in the United States by a
United States person located in the United States, including a
permanent United States establishment of a foreign concern, is an
activity in United States commerce.
    (19) Implementation of a letter of credit outside the United States
by a United States person located outside the United States is in
United States commerce where the letter of credit (a) specifies a
United States address for the beneficiary, (b) calls for documents
indicating shipment from the United States, or (c) calls for documents
indicating that the goods are of United States origin.
    (20) See Sec. 760.2(f) of this part on ``Letters of Credit'' to
determine the circumstances in which paying, honoring, confirming, or
otherwise implementing a letter of credit is covered by this part.

Examples of Activities in the Interstate or Foreign Commerce of the
United States

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which an activity is in the
interstate or foreign commerce of the United States. They are
illustrative, not comprehensive.

United States Person Located in the United States

    (i) U.S. company A exports goods from the United States to a
foreign country. A's activity is in U.S. commerce, because A is
exporting goods from the United States.
    (ii) U.S. company A imports goods into the United States from a
foreign country. A's activity is in U.S. commerce, because A is
importing goods into the United States.
    (iii) U.S. engineering company A supplies consulting services to
its controlled foreign subsidiary, B. A's activity is in U.S.
commerce, because A is exporting services from the United States.
    (iv) U.S. company A supplies consulting services to foreign
company B. B is unrelated to A or any other U.S. person.
    A's activity is in U.S. commerce even though B, a foreign-owned
company located outside the United States, is not subject to this
part, because A is exporting services from the United States.
    (v) Same as (iv), except A is a bank located in the United
States and provides a construction loan to B.
    A's activity is in U.S. commerce even though B is not subject to
this part, because A is exporting financial services from the United
States.
    (vi) U.S. company A issues policy directives from time to time
to its controlled foreign subsidiary, B, governing the conduct of
B's activities with boycotting countries.
    A's activity in directing the activities of its foreign
subsidiary, B, is an activity in U.S. commerce.

Foreign Subsidiaries, Affiliates, and Other Permanent Foreign
Establishments of Domestic Concerns

    (i) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,
purchases goods from the United States.
    A's purchase of goods from the United States is in U.S.
commerce, because A is importing goods from the United States.
Whether A's subsequent disposition of these goods is in U.S.
commerce is irrelevant. Similarly, the fact that A purchased goods
from the United States does not, in and of itself, make any
subsequent disposition of those goods an activity in U.S. commerce.
    (ii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,
receives an order from boycotting country Y for construction
materials. A places an order with U.S. company B for the materials.
    A's transaction with Y is an activity in U.S. commerce, because
the materials are purchased from the United States for the purpose
of filling the order from Y.
    (iii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,
receives an order from boycotting country Y for construction
materials. A places an order with U.S. company B for some of the
materials, and with U.S. company C, an unrelated company, for the
rest of the materials.
    A's transaction with Y is an activity in U.S. commerce, because
the materials are purchased from the United States for the purpose
of filling the order from Y. It makes no difference whether the
materials are ordered from B or C.
    (iv) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is in
the wholesale and retail appliance sales business. A purchases
finished air conditioning units from the United States from time to
time in order to stock its inventory. A's inventory is also stocked
with air conditioning units purchased outside the United States. A
receives an order for air conditioning units from Y, a boycotting
country. The order is filled with U.S.-origin units in A's
inventory.
    A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because its U.S.-
origin goods are resold without substantial alteration.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that A is in the chemicals distribution
business. Its U.S.-origin goods are mingled in inventory with
foreign-origin goods.
    A's sale to Y of unaltered goods from its general inventory is
presumed to be in U.S. commerce unless A can show that at the time
of the sale the foreign-origin inventory on hand was sufficient to
cover the shipment to Y.
    (vi) A, a foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, receives an
order from boycotting country Y for computers. A places an order
with U.S. company B for some of the components; with U.S. company C,
an unrelated company, for other components; and with foreign company
D for the rest of the components. A then assembles the computers and
ships them to Y.
    A's transaction with Y is an activity in U.S. commerce, because
some of the components are acquired from the United States for
purposes of filling an order from Y.
    (vii) Same as (vi), except A purchases all the components from
non-U.S.sources.
    A's transaction with Y is not an activity in U.S. commerce,
because it involves no export of goods from the United States. It
makes no difference whether the technology A uses to manufacture
computers was originally acquired from its U.S. parent.
    (viii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,
manufactures computers. A stocks its general components and parts
inventory with purchases made at times from the United States and at
times from foreign sources. A receives an order from Y, a boycotting
country, for computers. A fills that order by manufacturing the
computers using materials from its general inventory.
    A's transaction with Y is not in U.S. commerce, because the
U.S.-origin components are not acquired for the purpose of meeting
the anticipated needs of specified customers in Y. It is irrelevant
that A's operations may be based on U.S.-origin technology.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that in anticipation of the order
from Y, A orders and receives the necessary materials from the
United States.
    A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because the U.S.-
origin goods were acquired for the purpose of filling an anticipated
order from Y.
    (x) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,
manufactures typewriters. It buys typewriter components both from
the United States and from foreign sources. A sells its output in
various places throughout the world, including boycotting country Y.
Its sales to Y vary from year to year, but have averaged
approximately 20 percent of sales for the past five years. A expects
that its sales

[[Page 12866]]
to Y will remain at approximately that level in the years ahead
although it has no contracts or orders from Y on hand.
    A's sales of typewriters to Y are not in U.S. commerce, because
the U.S. components are not acquired for the purpose of filling an
order from Y. A general expectancy of future sales is not an
``order'' within the meaning of this section.
    (xi) U.S. company A's corporate counsel provides legal advice to
B, its controlled foreign subsidiary, on the applicability of this
Part to B's transactions.
    While provision of this legal advice is itself an activity in
U.S. commerce, it does not, in and of itself, bring B's activities
into U.S. commerce.
    (xii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is
in the general construction business. A enters into a contract with
boycotting country Y to construct a power plant in Y. In preparing
engineering drawings and specifications, A uses the advice and
assistance of B.
    A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because B's services
are used for purposes of fulfilling the contract with Y. B's
services are not ancillary services, because the engineering
services in connection with construction of the power plant are part
of the services ultimately provided to Y by A.
    (xiii) Same as (xii), except that A gets no engineering advice
or assistance from B. However, B's corporate counsel provides legal
advice to A regarding the structure of the transaction. In addition,
B's corporate counsel draws up the contract documents.
    A's transaction with Y is not in U.S. commerce. The legal
services provided to A are ancillary services, because they are not
part of the services provided to Y by A in fulfillment of its
contract with Y.
    (xiv) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,
enters into a contract to construct an apartment complex in
boycotting country Y. A will fulfill its contract completely with
goods and services from outside the United States. Pursuant to a
provision in the contract, B guarantees A's performance of the
contract.
    A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because B's guaranty
of A's performance involves the acquisition of services from the
United States for purposes of fulfilling the transaction with Y, and
those services are part of the services ultimately provided to Y.
    (xv) Same as (xiv), except that the guaranty of A's performance
is supplied by C, a non-U.S. person located outside the United
States. However, unrelated to any particular transaction, B from
time to time provides general financial, legal, and technical
services to A.
    A's transaction with Y is not in U.S. commerce, because the
services acquired from the United States are not acquired for
purposes of fulfilling the contract with Y.
    (xvi) A, a foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, has a contract
with boycotting country Y to conduct oil drilling operations in that
country. In conducting these operations, A from time to time seeks
certain technical advice from B regarding the operation of the
drilling rigs.
    A's contract with Y is in U.S. commerce, because B's services
are sought for purposes of fulfilling the contract with Y and are
part of the services ultimately provided to Y.
    (xvii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,
enters into a contract to sell typewriters to boycotting country Y.
A is located in non-boycotting country P. None of the components are
acquired from the United States. A engages C, a U.S. shipping
company, to transport the typewriters from P to Y.
    A's sales to Y are not in U.S. commerce, because in carrying A's
goods, C is providing an ancillary service to A and not a service to
Y.
    (xviii) Same as (xvii), except that A's contract with Y calls
for title to pass to Y in P. In addition, the contract calls for A
to engage a carrier to make delivery to Y.
    A's sales to Y are in U.S. commerce, because in carrying Y's
goods, C is providing a service to A which is ultimately provided to
Y.
    (xix) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, has
general product liability insurance with U.S. company C. Foreign-
origin goods sold from time to time by A to boycotting country Y are
covered by the insurance policy.
    A's sales to Y are not in U.S. commerce, because the insurance
provided by C is an ancillary service provided to A which is not
ultimately provided to Y.
    (xx) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B,
manufactures automobiles abroad under a license agreement with B.
From time to time, A sells such goods to boycotting country Y.
    A's sales to Y are not in U.S. commerce, because the rights
conveyed by the license are not acquired for the specific purpose of
engaging in transactions with Y.

    (e) ``Intent''. (1) This part prohibits a United States person from
taking or knowingly agreeing to take certain specified actions with
intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign
boycott.
    (2) A United States person has the intent to comply with, further,
or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott when such a boycott is at
least one of the reasons for that person's decision whether to take a
particular prohibited action. So long as that is at least one of the
reasons for that person's action, a violation occurs regardless of
whether the prohibited action is also taken for non-boycott reasons.
Stated differently, the fact that such action was taken for legitimate
business reasons does not remove that action from the scope of this
part if compliance with an unsanctioned foreign boycott was also a
reason for the action.
    (3) Intent is a necessary element of any violation of this part. It
is not sufficient that one take action that is specifically prohibited
by this part. It is essential that one take such action with intent to
comply with, further,or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.
Accordingly, a person who inadvertently, without boycott intent, takes
a prohibited action, does not commit any violation of this part.
    (4) Intent in this context means the reason or purpose for one's
behavior. It does not mean that one has to agree with the boycott in
question or desire that it succeed or that it be furthered or
supported. But it does mean that the reason why a particular prohibited
action was taken must be established.
    (5) Reason or purpose can be proved by circumstantial evidence. For
example, if a person receives a request to supply certain boycott
information, the furnishing of which is prohibited by this part, and he
knowingly supplies that information in response, he clearly intends to
comply with that boycott request. It is irrelevant that he may disagree
with or object to the boycott itself. Information will be deemed to be
furnished with the requisite intent if the person furnishing the
information knows that it was sought for boycott purposes. On the other
hand, if a person refuses to do business with someone who happens to be
blacklisted, but the reason is because that person produces an inferior
product, the requisite intent does not exist.
    (6) Actions will be deemed to be taken with intent to comply with
an unsanctioned foreign boycott if the person taking such action knew
that such action was required or requested for boycott reasons. On the
other hand, the mere absence of a business relationship with a
blacklisted person or with or in a boycotted country does not indicate
the existence of the requisite intent.
    (7) In seeking to determine whether the requisite intent exists,
all available evidence will be examined.

Examples of ``Intent''

    The following examples are intended to illustrate the factors
which will be considered in determining whether the required intent
exists. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. person A does business in boycotting country Y. In
selecting firms to supply goods for shipment to Y, A chooses
supplier B because B's products are less expensive and of higher
quality than the comparable products of supplier C. A knows that C
is blacklisted, but that is not a reason for A's selection of B.
    A's choice of B rather than C is not action with intent to
comply with Y's boycott, because C's blacklist status is not a
reason for A's action.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that A chooses B rather than C in part
because C is blacklisted by Y.
    Since C's blacklist status is a reason for A's choice, A's
action is taken with intent to comply with Y's boycott.
    (iii) U.S. person A bids on a tender issued by boycotting
country Y. A inadvertently

[[Page 12867]]
fails to notice a prohibited certification which appears in the
tender document. A's bid is accepted.
    A's action in bidding was not taken with intent to comply with
Y's boycott, because the boycott was not a reason for A's action.
    (iv) U.S. bank A engages in letter of credit transactions, in
favor of U.S. beneficiaries, involving the shipments of U.S. goods
to boycotting country Y. As A knows, such letters of credit
routinely contain conditions requiring prohibited certifications. A
fails to take reasonable steps to prevent the implementation of such
letters of credit. A receives for implementation a letter of credit
which in fact contains a prohibited condition but does not examine
the letter of credit to determine whether it contains such a
condition.
    Although Y's boycott may not be a specific reason for A's action
in implementing the letter of credit with a prohibited condition,
all available evidence shows that A's action was taken with intent
to comply with the boycott, because A knows or should know that its
procedures result in compliance with the boycott.
    (v) U.S. bank A engages in letter of credit transactions, in
favor of U.S. beneficiaries, involving the shipment of U.S. goods to
boycotting country Y. As A knows, the documentation accompanying
such letters of credit sometimes contains prohibited certifications.
In accordance with standard banking practices applicable to A, it
does not examine such accompanying documentation. A receives a
letter of credit in favor of a U.S. beneficiary. The letter of
credit itself contains no prohibited conditions. However, the
accompanying documentation, which A does not examine, does contain
such a condition.
    All available evidence shows that A's action in implementing the
letter of credit was not taken with intent to comply with the
boycott, because A has no affirmative obligation to go beyond
applicable standard banking practices in implementing letters of
credit.
    (vi) A, a U.S. company, is considering opening a manufacturing
facility in boycotted country X. A already has such a facility in
boycotting country Y. After exploring the possibilities in X, A
concludes that the market does not justify the move. A is aware that
if it did open a plant in X, Y might object because of Y's boycott
of X. However Y's possible objection is not a reason for A's
decision not to open a plant in X.
    A's decision not to proceed with the plant in X is not action
with intent to comply with Y's boycott, because Y's boycott of X is
not a reason for A's decision.
    (vii) Same as (vi), except that after exploring the business
possibilities in X, A concludes that the market does justify the
move to X. However, A does not open the plant because of Y's
possible objections due to Y's boycott of X.
    A's decision not to proceed with the plant in X is action taken
with intent to comply with Y's boycott, because Y's boycott is a
reason for A's decision.
    (viii) A, a U.S. chemical manufacturer, receives a ``boycott
questionnaire'' from boycotting country Y asking, among other
things, whether A has any plants located in boycotted country X. A,
which has never supported Y's boycott of X, responds to Y's
questionnaire, indicating affirmatively that it does have plants in
X and that it intends to continue to have plants in X.
    A's responding to Y's questionnaire is deemed to be action with
intent to comply with Y's boycott because A knows that the
questionnaire is boycott-related. It is irrelevant that A does not
also wish to support Y's boycott.
    (ix) U.S. company A is on boycotting country Y's blacklist. In
an attempt to secure its removal from the blacklist, A wishes to
supply to Y information which demonstrates that A does at least as
much business in Y and other countries engaged in a boycott of X as
it does in X. A intends to continue its business in X undiminished
and in fact is exploring and intends to continue exploring an
expansion of its activities in X without regard to Y's boycott.
    A may furnish the information, because in doing so it has no
intent to comply with, further, or support Y's boycott.
    (x) U.S. company A has a manufacturing facility in boycotted
country X. A receives an invitation to bid on a construction project
in boycotting country Y. The invitation states that all bidders must
complete a boycott questionnaire and send it in with the bid. The
questionnaire asks for information about A's business relationships
with X. Regardless of whether A's bid is successful, A intends to
continue its business in X undiminished and in fact is exploring and
intends to continue exploring an expansion of its activities in X
without regard to Y's boycott.
    A may not answer the questionnaire, because, despite A's
intentions with regard to its business operations in X, Y's request
for completion of the questionnaire is for boycott purposes and by
responding, A's action would betaken with intent to comply with Y's
boycott.

    (Note: Example (ix) is distinguishable from (x), because in (ix)
A is not responding to any boycott request or requirement. Instead,
on its own initiative, it is supplying information to demonstrate
non-discriminatory conduct as between X and Y without any intent to
comply with, further, or support Y's boycott.)

Sec. 760.2  Prohibitions.

    (a) Refusals to do business.

Prohibition Against Refusals To Do Business

    (1) No United States person may: refuse, knowingly agree to refuse,
require any other person to refuse, or knowingly agree to require any
other person to refuse, to do business with or in a boycotted country,
with any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted
country, with any national or resident of a boycotted country, or with
any other person, when such refusal is pursuant to an agreement with
the boycotting country, or a requirement of the boycotting country, or
a request from or on behalf of the boycotting country.
    (2) Generally, a refusal to do business under this section consists
of action that excludes a person or country from a transaction for
boycott reasons. This includes a situation in which a United States
person chooses or selects one person over another on a boycott basis or
takes action to carry out another person's boycott-based selection when
he knows or has reason to know that the other person's selection is
boycott-based.
    (3) Refusals to do business which are prohibited by this section
include not only specific refusals, but also refusals implied by a
course or pattern of conduct. There need not be a specific offer and
refusal to constitute a refusal to do business; a refusal may occur
when a United States person has a financial or commercial opportunity
and declines for boycott reasons to consider or accept it.
    (4) A United States person's use of either a boycott-based list of
persons with whom he will not deal (a so-called ``blacklist'') or a
boycott-based list of persons with whom he will deal (a so-called
``whitelist'') constitutes a refusal to do business.
    (5) An agreement by a United States person to comply generally with
the laws of the boycotting country with which it is doing business or
an agreement that local laws of the boycotting country shall apply or
govern is not, in and of itself, a refusal to do business. Nor, in and
of itself, is use of a contractual clause explicitly requiring a person
to assume the risk of loss of non-delivery of his products a refusal to
do business with any person who will not or cannot comply with such a
clause. (But see Sec. 760.4 of this part on ``Evasion.'')
    (6) If, for boycott reasons, a United States general manager
chooses one supplier over another, or enters into a contract with one
supplier over another, or advises its client to do so, then the general
manager's actions constitute a refusal to do business under this
section. However, it is not a refusal to do business under this section
for a United States person to provide management, procurement, or other
pre-award services for another person so long as the provision of such
pre-award services is customary for that firm (or industry of which the
firm is a part), without regard to the boycotting or non-boycotting
character of the countries in which they are performed, and the United
States person, in providing such services, does not act to exclude a
person or country from the transaction for boycott reasons, or
otherwise take actions that are boycott-based. For example, a United
States person under

[[Page 12868]]
contract to provide general management services in connection with a
construction project in a boycotting country may compile lists of
qualified bidders for the client if that service is a customary one and
if persons who are qualified are not excluded from that list because
they are blacklisted.
    (7) With respect to post-award services, if a client makes a
boycott-based selection, actions taken by the United States general
manager or contractor to carry out the client's choice are themselves
refusals to do business if the United States contractor knows or has
reason to know that the client's choice was boycott-based. (It is
irrelevant whether the United States contractor also provided pre-award
services.) Such actions include entering into a contract with the
selected supplier, notifying the supplier of the client's choice,
executing a contract on behalf of the client, arranging for inspection
and shipment of the supplier's goods, or taking any other action to
effect the client's choice. (But see Sec. 760.3(c) of this part on
``Compliance with Unilateral Selection'' as it may apply to post-award
services.)
    (8) An agreement is not a prerequisite to a violation of this
section since the prohibition extends to actions taken pursuant not
only to agreements but also to requirements of, and requests from or on
behalf of, a boycotting country.
    (9) Agreements under this section may be either express or implied
by a course or pattern of conduct. There need not be a direct request
from a boycotting country for action by a United States person to have
been taken pursuant to an agreement with or requirement of a boycotting
country.
    (10) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect
to a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign
commerce of the United States and only when such activities are
undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an
unsanctioned foreign boycott. The mere absence of a business
relationship with or in the boycotted country, with any business
concern organized under the laws of the boycotted country, with
national(s) or resident(s) of the boycotted country, or with any other
person does not indicate the existence of the required intent.

Examples of Refusals and Agreements To Refuse To Do Business

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which, in a boycott situation, a
refusal to do business or an agreement to refuse to do business is
prohibited. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.

Refusals To Do Business

    (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, receives an order for its products
from boycotting country Y. To fill that order, A solicits bids from
U.S. companies B and C, manufacturers of components used in A's
products. A does not, however, solicit bids from U.S. companies D or
E, which also manufacture such components, because it knows that D
and E are restricted from doing business in Y and that their
products are, therefore, not importable into that country.
    Company A may not refuse to solicit bids from D and E for
boycott reasons, because to do so would constitute a refusal to do
business with those persons.
    (ii) A, a U.S. exporter, uses company B, a U.S. insurer, to
insure the shipment of its goods to all its overseas customers. For
the first time, A receives an order for its products from boycotting
country Y. Knowing that B is on the blacklist of Y, A arranges with
company C, a non-blacklisted U.S. insurer, to insure the shipment of
its goods to Y.
    A's action constitutes a refusal to do business with B.
    (iii) A, a U.S. exporter, purchases all its liability insurance
from company B, a U.S. company that does business in boycotted
country X. A wishes to expand its operations into country Y, the
boycotting country. Before doing so, A decides to switch from
insurer B to insurer C in anticipation of a request from Y that A
sever its relations with B as a condition of doing business in Y.
    A may not switch insurers for this reason, because doing so
would constitute a refusal to do business with B.
    (iv) U.S. company A exports goods to boycotting country Y. In
selecting vessels to transport the goods to Y, A chooses only from
among carriers which call at ports in Y.
    A's action is not a refusal to do business with carriers which
do not call at ports in Y.
    (v) A, a U.S. bank with a branch office in boycotting country Y,
sends representatives to boycotted country X to discuss plans for
opening a branch office in X. Upon learning of these discussions, an
official of the local boycott office in Y advises A's local branch
manager that if A opens an office in X it will no longer be allowed
to do business in Y. As a result of this notification, A decides to
abandon its plans to open a branch in X.
    Bank A may not abandon its plans to open a branch in X as a
result of Y's notification, because doing so would constitute a
refusal to do business in boycotted country X.
    (vi) A, a U.S. company that manufactures office equipment, has
been restricted from doing business in boycotting country Y because
of its business dealings with boycotted country X. In an effort to
have itself removed from Y's blacklist, A ceases its business in X.
    A's action constitutes a refusal to do business in boycotted
country X.
    (vii) A, a U.S. computer company, does business in boycotting
country Y. A decides to explore business opportunities in boycotted
country X. After careful analysis of possible business opportunities
in X, A decides, solely for business reasons, not to market its
products in X.
    A's decision not to proceed is not a refusal to do business,
because it is not based on boycott considerations. A has no
affirmative obligation to do business in X.
    (viii) A, a U.S. oil company with operations in boycotting
country Y, has regularly purchased equipment from U.S. petroleum
equipment suppliers B, C, and D, none of whom is on the blacklist of
Y. Because of its satisfactory relationship with B, C, and D, A has
not dealt with other suppliers, including supplier E, who is
blacklisted by Y.
    A's failure affirmatively to seek or secure business with
blacklisted supplier E is not a refusal to do business with E.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except U.S. petroleum equipment supplier E,
a company on boycotting country Y's blacklist, offers to supply U.S.
oil company A with goods comparable to those provided by U.S.
suppliers B, C, and D. A, because it has satisfactorily, established
relationships with suppliers B, C, and D, does not accept supplier
E's offer.
    A's refusal of supplier E's offer is not a refusal to do
business, because it is based solely on non-boycott considerations.
A has no affirmative obligation to do business with E.
    (x) A, a U.S. construction company, enters into a contract to
build an office complex in boycotting country Y. A receives bids
from B and C, U.S. companies that are equally qualified suppliers of
electrical cable for the project. A knows that B is blacklisted by Y
and that C is not. A accepts C's bid, in part because C is as
qualified as the other potential supplier and in part because C is
not blacklisted.
    A's decision to select supplier C instead of blacklisted
supplier B is a refusal to do business, because the boycott was one
of the reasons for A's decision.
    (xi) A, a U.S. general contractor, has been retained to
construct a highway in boycotting country Y. A circulates an
invitation to bid to U.S. manufacturers of road-building equipment.
One of the conditions listed in the invitation to bid is that, in
order for A to obtain prompt service, suppliers will be required to
maintain a supply of spare parts and a service facility in Y. A
includes this condition solely for commercial reasons unrelated to
the boycott. Because of this condition, however, those suppliers on
Y's blacklist do not bid, since they would be unable to satisfy the
parts and services requirements.
    A's action is not a refusal to do business, because the
contractual condition was included solely for legitimate business
reasons and was not boycott-based.
    (xii) Company A, a U.S. oil company, purchases drill bits from
U.S. suppliers for export to boycotting country Y. In its purchase
orders, A includes a provision requiring the supplier to make
delivery to A's facilities in Y and providing that title to the
goods does not pass until delivery has been made. As is customary
under such an arrangement, the supplier bears all risks of loss,
including loss from fire, theft, perils of the sea, and inability to
clear customs, until title passes.
    Insistence on such an arrangement does not constitute a refusal
to do business,

[[Page 12869]]
because this requirement is imposed on all suppliers whether they
are blacklisted or not. (But see Sec. 760.4 of this part on
``Evasion'').
    (xiii) A, a U.S. engineering and construction company, contracts
with a government agency in boycotting country Y to perform a
variety of services in connection with the construction of a large
industrial facility in Y. Pursuant to this contract, A analyzes the
market of prospective suppliers, compiles a suggested bidders list,
analyzes the bids received, and makes recommendations to the client.
The client independently selects and awards the contract to supplier
C for boycott reasons. All of A's services are performed without
regard to Y's blacklist or any other boycott considerations, and are
the type of services A provides clients in both boycotting and non-
boycotting countries.
    A's actions do not constitute a refusal to do business, because,
in the provision of pre-award services, A has not excluded the other
bidders and because A customarily provides such services to its
clients.
    (xiv) Same as (xiii), except that in compiling a list of
prospective suppliers, A deletes suppliers he knows his client will
refuse to select because they are blacklisted. A knows that
including the names of blacklisted suppliers will neither enhance
their chances of being selected nor provide his client with a useful
service, the function for which he has been retained.
    A's actions, which amount to furnishing a so-called
``whitelist'', constitute refusals to do business, because A's pre-
award services have not been furnished without regard to boycott
considerations.
    (xv) A, a U.S. construction firm, provides its boycotting
country client with a permissible list of prospective suppliers, B,
C, D, and E. The client independently selects and awards the
contract to C, for boycott reasons, and then requests A to advise C
of his selection, negotiate the contract with C, arrange for the
shipment, and inspect the goods upon arrival. A knows that C was
chosen by the client for boycott reasons.
    A's action in complying with his client's direction is a refusal
to do business, because A's post-award actions carry out his
client's boycott-based decision. (Note: Whether A's action comes
within the unilateral selection exception depends upon factors
discussed in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part).
    (xvi) Same as (xv), except that A is building the project on a
turnkey basis and will retain title until completion. The client
instructs A to contract only with C.
    A's action in contracting with C constitutes a refusal to do
business, because it is action that excludes blacklisted persons
from the transaction for boycott reasons. (Note: Whether A's action
comes within the unilateral selection exception depends upon factors
discussed in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part).
    (xvii) A, a U.S. exporter of machine tools, receives an order
for drill presses from boycotting country Y. The cover letter from
Y's procurement official states that A was selected over other U.S.
manufacturers in part because A is not on Y's blacklist.
    A's action in filling this order is not a refusal to do
business, because A has not excluded anyone from the transaction.
    (xviii) A, a U.S. engineering firm under contract to construct a
dam in boycotting country Y, compiles, on a non-boycott basis, a
list of potential heavy equipment suppliers, including information
on their qualifications and prior experience. A then solicits bids
from the top three firms on its list-B, C, and D-because they are
the best qualified.
    None of them happens to be blacklisted. A does not solicit bids
from E, F, or G, the next three firms on the list, one of whom is on
Y's blacklist.
    A's decision to solicit bids from only B, C, and D, is not a
refusal to do business with any person, because the solicited
bidders were not selected for boycott reasons.
    (xix) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S.
beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to certify that he is
not blacklisted. B meets all other conditions of the letter of
credit but refuses to certify as to his blacklist status. A refuses
to pay B on the letter of credit solely because B refuses to certify
as to his blacklist status.
    A has refused to do business with another person pursuant to a
boycott requirement or request.
    (xx) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S.
beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to provide a
certification from the steamship line that the vessel carrying the
goods is not blacklisted. B seeks payment from A and meets all other
conditions of the letter of credit but refuses or is unable to
provide the certification from the steamship line about the vessel's
blacklist status. A refuses to pay B on the letter of credit solely
because B cannot or will not provide the certification.
    A has required another person to refuse to do business pursuant
to a boycott requirement or request by insisting that B obtain such
a certificate. (Either A or B may request an amendment to the letter
of credit substituting a certificate of vessel eligibility, however.
See Example (xxi) below).
    (xxi) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit from a bank in
boycotting country Y in favor of U.S. beneficiary B. The letter of
credit requires B to provide a certification from the steamship line
that the vessel carrying the goods is eligible to enter the ports in
Y. B seeks payment from A and meets all other conditions of the
letter of credit. A refuses to pay B solely because B cannot or will
not provide the certification.
    A has neither refused, nor required another person to refuse, to
do business with another person pursuant to a boycott requirement or
request because the vessel eligibility certificate is a common
requirement for non-boycott purposes.
    (xxii) U.S. bank A confirms a letter of credit in favor of U.S.
beneficiary B. The letter of credit contains a requirement that B
certify that he is not blacklisted. B presents the letter of credit
to U.S. bank C, a correspondent of bank A. B does not present the
certificate of blacklist status to bank C, but, in accordance with
these rules, bank C pays B, and then presents the letter of credit
and documentation to bank A for reimbursement. Bank A refuses to
reimburse bank C because the blacklist certification of B is not
included in the documentation.
    A has required another person to refuse to do business with a
person pursuant to a boycott requirement or request by insisting
that C obtain the certificate from B.
    (xxiii) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S.
beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to certify that he is
not blacklisted. B fails to provide such a certification when he
presents the documents to A for payment. A notifies B that the
certification has not been submitted.
    A has not refused to do business with another person pursuant to
a boycott requirement by notifying B of the omitted certificate. A
may not refuse to pay on the letter of credit, however, if B states
that B will not provide such a certificate.
    (xxiv) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S.
beneficiary B from the issuing bank for the purpose of confirmation,
negotiation or payment. The letter of credit requires B to certify
that he is not blacklisted. A notifies B that it is contrary to the
policy of A to handle letters of credit containing this condition
and that, unless an amendment is obtained deleting this condition, A
will not implement the letter of credit.
    A has not refused to do business with another person pursuant to
a boycott requirement, because A has indicated its policy against
implementing the letter of credit containing the term without regard
to B's ability or willingness to furnish such a certificate.

Agreements To Refuse To Do Business

    (i) A, a U.S. construction firm, is retained by an agency of
boycotting country Y to build a primary school. The proposed
contract contains a clause stating that A ``may not use goods or
services in the project that are produced or provided by any person
restricted from having a business relationship with country Y by
reason of Y's boycott against country X''.
    A's action in entering into such a contract would constitute an
agreement to refuse to do business, because it is an agreement to
exclude blacklisted persons from the transaction. A may, however,
renegotiate this clause so that it does not contain terms prohibited
by this part.
    (ii) A, a U.S. manufacturer of commercial refrigerators and
freezers, receives an invitation to bid from boycotting country Y.
The tender states that the bidder must agree not to deal with
companies on Y's blacklist. A does not know which companies are on
the blacklist, and A's bid makes no commitment regarding not dealing
with certain companies. A's bid in response to the tender is
accepted.
    At the point when A's bid is accepted, A has agreed to refuse to
do business with blacklisted persons, because the terms of Y's
tender are part of the contract between Y and A.
    (iii) A, a U.S. construction firm, is offered a contract to
perform engineering and construction services in connection with a
project located in boycotting country Y. The contract contains a
clause stating that, in the event of a contract dispute, the laws of
Y will apply.
    A may enter into the contract. Agreement that the laws of
boycotting country Y will control in resolving a contract dispute is
not an agreement to refuse to do business.

[[Page 12870]]

    (iv) Same as (iii), except that the contract contains a clause
that A and its employees will comply with the laws of boycotting
country Y. A knows that Y has a number of boycott laws.
    Such an agreement is not, in and of itself, an agreement to
refuse to do business. If, however, A subsequently refuses to do
business with someone because of the laws of Y, A's action would be
a refusal to do business.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that the contract contains a clause
that A and its employees will comply with the laws of boycotting
country Y, ``including boycott laws''.
    A's agreeing, without qualification, to comply with local
boycott laws constitutes an agreement to refuse to do business.
    (vi) Same as (v), except that A inserts a proviso ``except
insofar as Y's laws conflict with U.S. laws'', or words to that
effect.
    Such an agreement is not an agreement to refuse to do business.
    (vii) A, a U.S. general contractor, is retained to construct a
pipeline in boycotting country Y. A provision in the proposed
contract stipulates that in purchasing equipment, supplies, and
services A must give preference to companies located in host country
Y.
    A may agree to this contract provision. Agreeing to a ``buy
local'' contract provision is not an agreement to refuse to do
business, because A's agreement is not made for boycott reasons.
    (viii) A, a U.S. exporter planning to sell retail goods to
customers in boycotting country Y, enters into a contract to
purchase goods wholesale from B, a U.S. appliance manufacturer. A's
contract with B includes a provision stipulating that B may not use
components or services of blacklisted companies in the manufacture
of its appliances.
    A's contract constitutes a refusal to do business, because it
would require another person, B, to refuse to do business with other
persons for boycott reasons. B may not agree to such a contract,
because it would be agreeing to refuse to do business with other
persons for boycott reasons.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that A and B reach an implicit
understanding that B will not use components or services of
blacklisted companies in the manufacture of goods to be exported to
Y. In the manufacture of appliances to be sold to A for export to
non-boycotting countries, B uses components manufactured by
blacklisted companies.
    The actions of both A and B constitute agreement to refuse to do
business. The agreement is implied by their pattern of conduct.
    (x) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Y
opens a letter of credit with foreign bank C in favor of B. The
letter of credit specifies that negotiation of the letter of credit
with a bank that appears on the country X boycott blacklist is
prohibited. U.S. bank A, C's correspondent bank, advises B of the
letter of credit. B presents documentation to bank A seeking to be
paid on the letter of credit, without amending or otherwise taking
exception to the boycott condition.
    B has agreed to refuse to do business with blacklisted banks
because, by presenting the letter of credit for payment, B has
accepted all of its terms and conditions.
    (b) Discriminatory actions.

Prohibition Against Taking Discriminatory Actions

    (1) No United States person may:
    (i) Refuse to employ or otherwise discriminate against any
individual who is a United States person on the basis of race,
religion, sex, or national origin;
    (ii) Discriminate against any corporation or other organization
which is a United States person on the basis of the race, religion,
sex, or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of
such corporation or organization;
    (iii) Knowingly agree to take any of the actions described in
paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section; or
    (iv) Require or knowingly agree to require any other person to take
any of the actions described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this
section.
    (2) This prohibition shall apply whether the discriminatory action
is taken by a United States person on its own or in response to an
agreement with, request from, or requirement of a boycotting country.
This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a
United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce
of the United States and only when such activities are undertaken with
intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign
boycott.
    (3) The section does not supersede or limit the operation of the
civil rights laws of the United States.

Examples of Discriminatory Actions

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which the taking of particular
discriminatory actions is prohibited. They are illustrative, not
comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. construction company A is awarded a contract to build
an office complex in boycotting country Y. A, believing that
employees of a particular religion will not be permitted to work in
Y because of Y's boycott against country X, excludes U.S. persons of
that religion from consideration for employment on the project.
    A's refusal to consider qualified U.S. persons of a particular
religion for work on the project in Y constitutes a prohibited
boycott-based discriminatory action against U.S. persons on the
basis of religion.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that a clause in the contract provides
that ``no persons of country X origin are to work on this project.''
    A's agreement constitutes a prohibited boycott-based agreement
to discriminate against U.S. persons, among others, on the basis of
national origin.
    (iii) Same as (i), except that a clause in the contract provides
that ``no persons who are citizens, residents, or nationals of
country X are to work on this project.''
    A's agreement does not constitute a boycott-based agreement to
discriminate against U.S. persons on the basis of race, religion,
sex, or national origin, because the clause requires exclusion on
the basis of citizenship, residency, and nationality only.
    (iv) U.S. construction company A enters into a contract to build
a school in boycotting country Y. Y's representative orally tells A
that no persons of country X origin are to work on the project.
    A may not comply, because to do so would constitute
discrimination on the basis of national origin.
    It makes no difference that A learned of Y's requirement orally.
It makes no difference how A learns about Y's discriminatory
requirement.
    (v) Boycotting country Y tenders an invitation to bid on a
construction project in Y. The tender requires that the successful
bidder's personnel will be interviewed and that persons of a
particular religious faith will not be permitted to work on the
project. Y's requirement is based on its boycott of country X, the
majority of whose citizens are of that particular faith.
    Agreement to this provision in the tender document by a U.S.
person would constitute a prohibited agreement to engage in boycott-
based discrimination against U.S. persons of a particular religion.
    (vi) Same as (v), except that the tender specifies that ``women
will not be allowed to work on this project.''
    Agreement to this provision in the tender by a U.S. person does
not constitute a prohibited agreement to engage in boycott-based
discrimination, because the restriction against employment of women
is not boycott-based. Such an agreement may, however, constitute a
violation of U.S. civil rights laws.
    (vii) A is a U.S. investment banking firm. As a condition of
participating in an underwriting of securities to be issued by
boycotting country Y, A is required to exclude investment banks
owned by persons of a particular faith from participation in the
underwriting. Y's requirement is based on its boycott of country X,
the majority of whose citizens are of that particular faith.
    A's agreement to such a provision constitutes a prohibited
agreement to engage in boycott-based discrimination against U.S.
persons on the basis of religion. Further, if A requires others to
agree to such a condition, A would be acting to require another
person to engage in such discrimination.
    (viii) U.S. company A is asked by boycotting country Y to
certify that A will not use a six-pointed star on the packaging of
its products to be imported into Y. The requirement is part of the
enforcement effort by Y of its boycott against country X.
    A may not so certify. The six-pointed star is a religious
symbol, and the certification by A that it will not use such a
symbol constitutes a statement that A will not ship products made or
handled by persons of that religion.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that A is asked to certify that no
symbol of boycotted country X will appear on the packaging of its
products imported into Y.

[[Page 12871]]

    Such a certification conveys no statement about any person's
religion and, thus, does not come within this prohibition.

    (c) Furnishing information about race, religion, sex, or national
origin.

Prohibition Against Furnishing Information About Race, Religion, Sex,
or National Origin

    (1) No United States person may:
    (i) Furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national
origin of any United States person;
    (ii) Furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national
origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of any corporation
or other organization which is a United States person;
    (iii) Knowingly agree to furnish information about the race,
religion, sex, or national origin of any United States person; or
    (iv) Knowingly agree to furnish information about the race,
religion, sex, or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or
employee of any corporation or other organization which is a United
States person.
    (2) This prohibition shall apply whether the information is
specifically requested or is offered voluntarily by the United States
person. It shall also apply whether the information requested or
volunteered is stated in the affirmative or the negative.
    (3) Information about the place of birth of or the nationality of
the parents of a United States person comes within this prohibition, as
does information in the form of code words or symbols which could
identify a United States person's race, religion, sex, or national
origin.
    (4) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to
a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign
commerce of the United States and only when such activities are
undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an
unsanctioned foreign boycott.

Examples of the Prohibition Against Furnishing Discriminatory
Information

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which the furnishing of
discriminatory information is prohibited. They are illustrative, not
comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. company A receives a boycott questionnaire from
boycotting country Y asking whether it is owned or controlled by
persons of a particular faith, whether it has any persons on its
board of directors who are of that faith, and what the national
origin of its president is. The information is sought for purposes
of enforcing Y's boycott against country X, and A knows or has
reason to know that the information is sought for that reason.
    A may not answer the questionnaire, because A would be
furnishing information about the religion and national origin of
U.S. persons for purposes of complying with or supporting Y's
boycott against X.
    (ii) U.S. company A, located in the United States, is asked by
boycotting country Y to certify that A has no persons of a
particular national origin on its board of directors. A knows that
Y's purpose in asking for the certification is to enforce its
boycott against country X.
    A may not make such a certification, because A would be
furnishing information about the national origin of U.S. persons for
purposes of complying with or supporting Y's boycott against X.
    (iii) U.S. company A believes that boycotting country Y will
select A's bid over those of other bidders if A volunteers that it
has no shareholders, officers, or directors of a particular national
origin. A's belief is based on its knowledge that Y generally
refuses, as part of its boycott against country X, to do business
with companies owned, controlled, or managed by persons of this
particular national origin.
    A may not volunteer this information, because it would be
furnishing information about the national origin of U.S. persons for
purposes of complying with or supporting Y's boycott against X.
    (iv) U.S. company A has a contract to construct an airport in
boycotting country Y. Before A begins work, A is asked by Y to
identify the national origin of its employees who will work on the
site. A knows or has reason to know that Y is seeking this
information in order to enforce its boycott against X.
    A may not furnish this information, because A would be providing
information about the national origin of U.S. persons for purposes
of complying with or supporting Y's boycott against X.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that in order to assemble its work
force on site in Y, A sends visa forms to its employees and asks
that the forms be returned to A for transmittal to Y's consulate or
embassy. A, itself, furnishes no information about its employees,
but merely transmits the visa forms back and forth.
    In performing the ministerial function of transmitting visa
forms, A is not furnishing information about any U.S. person's race,
religion, sex, or national origin.
    (vi) Same as (iv), except that A is asked by Y to certify that
none of its employees in Y will be women, because Y's laws prohibit
women from working.
    Such a certification does not constitute a prohibited furnishing
of information about any U.S. person's sex, since the reason the
information is sought has nothing to do with Y's boycott of X.
    (vii) U.S. company A is considering establishing an office in
boycotting country Y. In order to register to do business in Y, A is
asked to furnish information concerning the nationalities of its
corporate officers and board of directors.
    A may furnish the information about the nationalities of its
officers and directors, because in so doing A would not be
furnishing information about the race, religion, sex, or national
origin of any U.S. person.

    (d) Furnishing information about business relationships with
boycotted countries or blacklisted persons.

Prohibition Against Furnishing Information About Business Relationships
With Boycotted Countries or Blacklisted Persons

    (1) No United States person may furnish or knowingly agree to
furnish information concerning his or any other person's past, present
or proposed business relationships:
    (i) With or in a boycotted country;
    (ii) With any business concern organized under the laws of a
boycotted country;
    (iii) With any national or resident of a boycotted country; or
    (iv) With any other person who is known or believed to be
restricted from having any business relationship with or in a
boycotting country.
    (2) This prohibition shall apply:
    (i) Whether the information pertains to a business relationship
involving a sale, purchase, or supply transaction; legal or commercial
representation; shipping or other transportation transaction;
insurance; investment; or any other type of business transaction or
relationship; and
    (ii) Whether the information is directly or indirectly requested or
is furnished on the initiative of the United States person.
    (3) This prohibition does not apply to the furnishing of normal
business information in a commercial context. Normal business
information may relate to factors such as financial fitness, technical
competence, or professional experience, and may be found in documents
normally available to the public such as annual reports, disclosure
statements concerning securities, catalogs, promotional brochures, and
trade and business handbooks. Such information may also appear in
specifications or statements of experience and qualifications.
    (4) Normal business information furnished in a commercial context
does not cease to be such simply because the party soliciting the
information may be a boycotting country or a national or resident
thereof. If the information is of a type which is generally sought for
a legitimate business purpose (such as determining financial fitness,
technical competence, or professional experience), the information may
be furnished even if the information could be used, or without the
knowledge of the person supplying the information is intended to be
used, for boycott purposes. However, no information about business
relationships with blacklisted persons or boycotted

[[Page 12872]]
countries, their residents or nationals, may be furnished in response
to a boycott request, even if the information is publicly available.
Requests for such information from a boycott office will be presumed to
be boycott-based.
    (5) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to
a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign
commerce of the United States and only when such activities are
undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an
unsanctioned foreign boycott.

Examples Concerning Furnishing of Information

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which the furnishing of information
is prohibited. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. contractor A is considering bidding for a contract to
build a dam in boycotting country Y. The invitation to bid, which
appears in a trade journal, specifies that each bidder must state
that he does not have any offices in boycotted country X. A knows or
has reason to know that the requirement is boycott-based.
    A may not make this statement, because it constitutes
information about A's business relationships with X.
    (ii) U.S. contractor A is considering bidding for a contract to
construct a school in boycotting country Y. Each bidder is required
to submit copies of its annual report with its bid. Since A's annual
report describes A's worldwide operations, including the countries
in which it does business, it necessarily discloses whether A has
business relations with boycotted country X. A has no reason to know
that its report is being sought for boycott purposes.
    A, in furnishing its annual report, is supplying ordinary
business information in a commercial context.
    (iii) Same as (ii), except that accompanying the invitation to
bid is a questionnaire from country Y's boycott office asking each
bidder to supply a copy of its annual report.
    A may not furnish the annual report despite its public
availability, because it would be furnishing information in response
to a questionnaire from a boycott office.
    (iv) U.S. company A is on boycotting country Y's blacklist. For
reasons unrelated to the boycott, A terminates its business
relationships with boycotted country X. In exploring other marketing
areas, A determines that boycotting country Y offers great
potential. A is requested to complete a questionnaire from a central
boycott office which inquires about A's business relations with X.
    A may not furnish the information, because it is information
about A's business relationships with a boycotted country.
    (v) U.S. exporter A is seeking to sell its products to
boycotting country Y. A is informed by Y that, as a condition of
sale, A must certify that it has no salesmen in boycotted country X.
A knows or has reason to know that the condition is boycott-based.
    A may not furnish the certification, because it is information
about A's business relationships in a boycotted country.
    (vi) U.S. engineering company A receives an invitation to bid on
the construction of a dam in boycotting country Y. As a condition of
the bid, A is asked to certify that it does not have any offices in
boycotted country X. A is also asked to furnish plans for other dams
it has designed.
    A may not certify that it has no office in X, because this is
information about its business relationships in a boycotted country.
A may submit plans for other dams it has designed, because this is
furnishing normal business information, in a commercial context,
relating to A's technical competence and professional experience.
    (vii) U.S. company A, in seeking to expand its exports to
boycotting country Y, sends a sales representative to Y for a one
week trip. During a meeting in Y with trade association
representatives, A's representative desires to explain that neither
A nor any companies with which A deals has any business relationship
with boycotted country X. The purpose of supplying such information
is to ensure that A does not get blacklisted.
    A's representative may not volunteer this information even
though A, for reasons unrelated to the boycott, does not deal with
X, because A's representative would be volunteering information
about A's business relationships with X for boycott reasons.
    (viii) U.S. company A is asked by boycotting country Y to
furnish information concerning its business relationships with
boycotted country X. A, knowing that Y is seeking the information
for boycott purposes, refuses to furnish the information asked for
directly, but proposes to respond by supplying a copy of its annual
report which lists the countries with which A is presently doing
business. A does not happen to be doing business with X.
    A may not respond to Y's request by supplying its annual report,
because A knows that it would be responding to a boycott-based
request for information about its business relationships with X.
    (ix) U.S. company A receives a letter from a central boycott
office asking A to ``clarify'' A's operations in boycotted country
X. A intends to continue its operations in X, but fears that not
responding to the request will result in its being placed on
boycotting country Y's blacklist. A knows or has reason to know that
the information is sought for boycott reasons.
    A may not respond to this request, because the information
concerns its business relationships with a boycotted country.
    (x) U.S. company A, in the course of negotiating a sale of its
goods to a buyer in boycotting country Y, is asked to certify that
its supplier is not on Y's blacklist.
    A may not furnish the information about its supplier's blacklist
status, because this is information about A's business relationships
with another person who is believed to be restricted from having any
business relationship with or in a boycotting country.
    (xi) U.S. company A has a manufacturing plant in boycotted
country X and is on boycotting country Y's blacklist. A is seeking
to establish operations in Y, while expanding its operations in X. A
applies to Y to be removed from Y's blacklist. A is asked, in
response, to indicate whether it has manufacturing facilities in X.
    A may not supply the requested information, because A would be
furnishing information about its business relationships in a
boycotted country.
    (xii) U.S. bank A plans to open a branch office in boycotting
country Y. In order to do so, A is required to furnish certain
information about its business operations, including the location of
its other branch offices. Such information is normally sought in
other countries where A has opened a branch office, and A does not
have reason to know that Y is seeking the information for boycott
reasons.
    A may furnish this information, even though in furnishing it A
would disclose information about its business relationships in a
boycotted country, because it is being furnished in a normal
business context and A does not have reason to know that it is
sought for boycott reasons.
    (xiii) U.S. architectural firm A responds to an invitation to
submit designs for an office complex in boycotting country Y. The
invitation states that all bidders must include information
concerning similar types of buildings they have designed. A has not
designed such buildings in boycotted country X. Clients frequently
seek information of this type before engaging an architect.
    A may furnish this information, because this is furnishing
normal business information, in a commercial context, relating to
A's technical competence and professional experience.
    (xiv) U.S. oil company A distributes to potential customers
promotional brochures and catalogs which give background information
on A's past projects. A does not have business dealings with
boycotted country X. The brochures, which are identical to those
which A uses throughout the world, list those countries in which A
does or has done business. In soliciting potential customers in
boycotting country Y, A desires to distribute copies of its
brochures.
    A may do so, because this is furnishing normal business
information, in a commercial context, relating to professional
experience.
    (xv) U.S. company A is interested in doing business with
boycotting country Y. A wants to ask Y's Ministry of Trade whether,
and if so why, A is on Y's blacklist or is otherwise restricted for
boycott reasons from doing business with Y.
    A may make this limited inquiry, because it does not constitute
furnishing information.
    (xvi) U.S. company A is asked by boycotting country Y to certify
that it is not owned by subjects or nationals of boycotted country X
and that it is not resident in boycotted country X.
    A may not furnish the certification, because it is information
about A's business relationships with or in a boycotted country, or
with nationals of a boycotted country.
    (xvii) U.S. company A, a manufacturer of certain patented
products, desires to register its patents in boycotting country Y. A
receives a power of attorney form required to

[[Page 12873]]
register its patents. The form contains a question regarding A's
business relationships with or in boycotted country X. A has no
business relationships with X and knows or has reason to know that
the information is sought for boycott reasons.
    A may not answer the question, because A would be furnishing
information about its business relationships with or in a boycotted
country.
    (xviii) U.S. company A is asked by boycotting country Y to
certify that it is not the mother company, sister company,
subsidiary, or branch of any blacklisted company, and that it is not
in any way affiliated with any blacklisted company.
    A may not furnish the certification, because it is information
about whether A has a business relationship with another person who
is known or believed to be restricted from having any business
relationship with or in a boycotting country. This interpretation
became effective on June 22, 1978.

    (e) Information concerning association with charitable and
fraternal organizations.

Prohibition Against Furnishing Information About Associations With
Charitable and Fraternal Organizations

    (1) No United States person may furnish or knowingly agree to
furnish information about whether any person is a member of, has made
contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the
activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports a
boycotted country.
    (2) This prohibition shall apply whether:
    (i) The information concerns association with or involvement in any
charitable or fraternal organization which (a) has, as one of its
stated purposes, the support of a boycotted country through financial
contributions or other means, or (b) undertakes, as a major
organizational activity, to offer financial or other support to a
boycotted country;
    (ii) The information is directly or indirectly requested or is
furnished on the initiative of the United States person; or
    (iii) The information requested or volunteered concerns membership
in, financial contributions to, or any other type of association with
or involvement in the activities of such charitable or fraternal
organization.
    (3) This prohibition does not prohibit the furnishing of normal
business information in a commercial context as defined in paragraph
(d) of this section.
    (4) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to
a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign
commerce of the United States and only when such activities are
undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an
unsanctioned foreign boycott.

Examples of Prohibition Against Furnishing Information About
Associations With Charitable or Fraternal Organizations

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which the furnishing of information
concerning associations with charitable or fraternal organizations
is prohibited. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. engineering firm A receives an invitation to bid from
boycotting country Y. The invitation includes a request to supply
information concerning any association which A's officers have with
charitable organization B, an organization which is known by A to
contribute financial support to boycotted country X. A knows or has
reason to know that the information is sought for boycott reasons.
    A may not furnish the information.
    (ii) U.S. construction company A, in an effort to establish
business dealings with boycotting country Y, proposes to furnish
information to Y showing that no members of its board of directors
are in any way associated with charitable organizations which
support boycotted country X. A's purpose is to avoid any possibility
of its being blacklisted by Y.
    A may not furnish the information, because A's purpose in doing
so is boycott-based. It makes no difference that no specific request
for the information has been made by Y.
    (iii) A, a citizen of the United States, is applying for a
teaching position in a school in boycotting country Y. In connection
with his application, A furnishes a resume which happens to disclose
his affiliation with charitable organizations. A does so completely
without reference to Y's boycott and without knowledge of any
boycott requirement of Y that pertains to A's application for
employment.
    The furnishing of a resume by A is not a boycott-related
furnishing of information about his association with charitable
organizations which support boycotted country X.

    (f) Letters of credit.

Prohibition Against Implementing Letters of Credit Containing
Prohibited Conditions or Requirements

    (1) No United States person may pay, honor, confirm, or otherwise
implement a letter of credit which contains a condition or requirement
compliance with which is prohibited by this part, nor shall any United
States person, as a result of the application of this section, be
obligated to pay, honor or otherwise implement such a letter of credit.
    (2) For purposes of this section, ``implementing'' a letter of
credit includes:
    (i) Issuing or opening a letter of credit at the request of a
customer;
    (ii) Honoring, by accepting as being a valid instrument of credit,
any letter of credit;
    (iii) Paying, under a letter of credit, a draft or other demand for
payment by the beneficiary;
    (iv) Confirming a letter of credit by agreeing to be responsible
for payment to the beneficiary in response to a request by the issuer;
    (v) Negotiating a letter of credit by voluntarily purchasing a
draft from a beneficiary and presenting such draft for reimbursement to
the issuer or the confirmer of the letter of credit; and
    (vi) Taking any other action to implement a letter of credit.
    (3) In the standard international letter of credit transaction
facilitating payment for the export of goods from the United States, a
bank in a foreign country may be requested by its customer to issue a
revocable or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the United States
exporter. The customer usually requires, and the letter of credit
provides, that the issuing (or a confirming) bank will make payment to
the beneficiary against the bank's receipt of the documentation
specified in the letter of credit. Such documentation usually includes
commercial and consular invoices, a bill of lading, and evidence of
insurance, but it may also include other required certifications or
documentary assurances such as the origin of the goods and information
relating to the carrier or insurer of the shipment.
    Banks usually will not accept drafts for payment unless the
documents submitted therewith comply with the terms and conditions of
the letter of credit.
    (4) A United States person is not prohibited under this section
from advising a beneficiary of the existence of a letter of credit in
his favor, or from taking ministerial actions to dispose of a letter of
credit which it is prohibited from implementing.
    (5) Compliance with this section shall provide an absolute defense
in any action brought to compel payment of, honoring of, or other
implementation of a letter of credit, or for damages resulting from
failure to pay or otherwise honor or implement the letter of credit.
This section shall not otherwise relieve any person from any
obligations or other liabilities he may incur under other laws or
regulations, except as may be explicitly provided in this section.

Letters of Credit to Which This Section Applies

    (6) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to
a United States person's activities taken with intent to comply with,
further, or support an unsanctioned foreign

[[Page 12874]]
boycott. In addition, it applies only when the transaction to which the
letter of credit applies is in United States commerce and the
beneficiary is a United States person.

Implementation of Letters of Credit in the United States

    (7) A letter of credit implemented in the United States by a United
States person located in the United States, including a permanent
United States establishment of a foreign bank, will be presumed to
apply to a transaction in United States commerce and to be in favor of
a United States beneficiary where the letter of credit specifies a
United States address for the beneficiary. These presumptions may be
rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that
the beneficiary is not a United States person or that the underlying
transaction is not in United States commerce.
    (8) Where a letter of credit implemented in the United States by a
United States person located in the United States does not specify a
United States address for the beneficiary, the beneficiary will be
presumed to be other than a United States person. This presumption may
be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude
that the beneficiary is a United States person despite the foreign
address.

Implementation of Letters of Credit Outside the United States

    (9) A letter of credit implemented outside the United States by a
United States person located outside the United States will be presumed
to apply to a transaction in United States commerce and to be in favor
of a United States beneficiary where the letter of credit specifies a
United States address for the beneficiary and calls for documents
indicating shipment from the United States or otherwise indicating that
the goods are of United States origin. These presumptions may be
rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that
the beneficiary is not a United States person or that the underlying
transaction is not in United States commerce.
    (10) Where a letter of credit implemented outside the United States
by a United States person located outside the United States does not
specify a United States address for the beneficiary, the beneficiary
will be presumed to be other than a United States person. In addition,
where such a letter of credit does not call for documents indicating
shipment from the United States or otherwise indicating that the goods
are of United States origin, the transaction to which it applies will
be presumed to be outside United States commerce. The presumption that
the beneficiary is other than a United States person may be rebutted by
facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the
beneficiary is a United States person. The presumption that the
transaction to which the letter of credit applies is outside United
States commerce may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead
the bank to conclude that the underlying transaction is in United
States commerce.

Examples of the Prohibition Against Implementing Letters of Credit

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which this section applies to the
implementation of a letter of credit and in which such
implementation is prohibited. They are illustrative, not
comprehensive.

Implementation of Letters of Credit in United States Commerce

    (i) A, a U.S. bank located in the United States, opens a letter
of credit in the United States in favor of B, a foreign company
located outside the United States. The letter of credit specifies a
non-U.S. address for the beneficiary.
    The beneficiary is presumed to be other than a U.S. person,
because it does not have a U.S. address. The presumption may be
rebutted by facts showing that A could reasonably conclude that the
beneficiary is a U.S. person despite the foreign address.
    (ii) A, a branch of a foreign bank located in the United States,
opens a letter of credit in favor of B, a foreign company located
outside the United States. The letter of credit specifies a non-U.S.
address for the beneficiary.
    The beneficiary is presumed to be other than a U.S.person,
because it does not have a U.S. address. The presumption may be
rebutted by facts showing that A could reasonably conclude that the
beneficiary is a U.S. person despite the foreign address.
    (iii) A, a U.S. bank branch located outside the United States,
opens a letter of credit in favor of B, a person with a U.S.
address. The letter of credit calls for documents indicating
shipment of goods from the United States.
    The letter of credit is presumed to apply to a transaction in
U.S. commerce and to be in favor of a U.S. beneficiary because the
letter of credit specifies a U.S. address for the beneficiary and
calls for documents indicating that the goods will be shipped from
the United States. These presumptions may be rebutted by facts
showing that A could reasonably conclude that the beneficiary is not
a U.S. person or that the underlying transaction is not in U.S.
commerce.
    (iv) A, a U.S. bank branch located outside the United States,
opens a letter of credit which specifies a beneficiary, B, with an
address outside the United States and calls for documents indicating
that the goods are of U.S.-origin. A knows or has reason to know
that although B has an address outside the United States, B is a
U.S. person.
    The letter of credit is presumed to apply to a transaction in
U.S. commerce, because the letter of credit calls for shipment of
U.S.-origin goods. In addition, the letter of credit is presumed to
be in favor of a beneficiary who is a U.S. person, because A knows
or has reason to know that the beneficiary is a U.S. person despite
the foreign address.
    (v) A, a U.S. bank branch located outside the United States,
opens a letter of credit which specifies a beneficiary with a U.S.
address. The letter of credit calls for documents indicating
shipment of foreign-origin goods.
    The letter of credit is presumed to be in favor of a U.S.
beneficiary but to apply to a transaction outside U.S. commerce,
because it calls for documents indicating shipment of foreign-origin
goods. The presumption of non-U.S. commerce may be rebutted by facts
showing that A could reasonably conclude that the underlying
transaction involves shipment of U.S.-origin goods or goods from the
U.S.

Prohibition Against Implementing Letters of Credit

    (i) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Y
opens a letter of credit with foreign bank C in favor of B. The
letter of credit specifies as a condition of payment that B certify
that it does not do business with boycotted country X. Foreign bank
C forwards the letter of credit it has opened to U.S. bank A for
confirmation.
    A may not confirm or otherwise implement this letter of credit,
because it contains a condition with which a U.S. person may not
comply.
    (ii) Same as (i), except U.S. bank A desires to advise the
beneficiary, U.S. company B, of the letter of credit.
    A may do so, because advising the beneficiary of the letter of
credit (including the term which prevents A from implementing it) is
not implementation of the letter of credit.
    (iii) Same as (i), except foreign bank C sends a telegram to
U.S. bank A stating the major terms and conditions of the letter of
credit. The telegram does not reflect the boycott provision.
Subsequently, C mails to A documents setting forth the terms and
conditions of the letter of credit, including the prohibited boycott
condition.
    A may not further implement the letter of credit after it
receives the documents, because they reflect the prohibited boycott
condition in the letter of credit. A may advise the beneficiary and
C of the existence of the letter of credit (including the boycott
term), and may perform any essentially ministerial acts necessary to
dispose of the letter of credit.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that U.S. company B, based in part on
information received from U.S. bank A, desires to obtain an
amendment to the letter of credit which would eliminate or nullify
the language in the letter of credit which prevents A from paying or
otherwise implementing it.
    Either company B or bank A may undertake, and the other may
cooperate and

[[Page 12875]]
assist in, this endeavor. A could then pay or otherwise implement
the revised letter of credit, so long as the original prohibited
language is of no force or effect.
    (v) Boycotting country Y requests a foreign bank in Y to open a
letter of credit to effect payment for goods to be shipped by U.S.
supplier B, the beneficiary of the letter of credit. The letter of
credit contains prohibited boycott clauses. The foreign bank
forwards a copy of the letter of credit to its branch office A, in
the United States.
    A may advise the beneficiary but may not implement the letter of
credit, because it contains prohibited boycott conditions.
    (vi) On November 1, 1977, boycotting country Y orders goods from
U.S. company B. U.S. bank A is asked to implement, for the benefit
of B, a letter of credit which contains a clause requiring
documentation that the goods shipped are not of boycotted country X
origin.
    A may implement the letter of credit, but after June 21, 1978,
may accept only a positive certificate of origin as satisfactory
documentation. (See Sec. 760.3(b) of this part on ``Import and
Shipping Document Requirements.'')
    (vii) Same as (vi), except that U.S. company B has a contract
with Y to supply a certain quantity of goods each month over a two-
year period. B's contract was entered into on May 15, 1977, and thus
qualifies for grace period treatment until December 31, 1978. Each
month, Y causes a letter of credit to be opened in favor of B in
order to effect payment. Such letters of credit call for negative
certificates of origin.
    A may accept negative certificates of origin in fulfillment of
the terms of the letter of credit through December 31, 1978, because
the underlying contract is entitled to a grace period through that
date. (See Sec. 760.8 of this part on ``Grace Period.'')
    (viii) B is a foreign bank located outside the United States. B
maintains an account with U.S. bank A, located in the United States.
A letter of credit issued by B in favor of a U.S. beneficiary
provides that any negotiating bank may obtain reimbursement from A
by certifying that all the terms and conditions of the letter of
credit have been met and then drawing against B's account. B
notifies A by cable of the issuance of a letter of credit and the
existence of reimbursement authorization; A does not receive a copy
of the letter of credit.
    A may reimburse any negotiating bank, even when the underlying
letter of credit contains a prohibited boycott condition, because A
does not know or have reason to know that the letter of credit
contains a prohibited boycott condition.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that foreign bank B forwards a copy
of the letter of credit to U.S. bank A, which then becomes aware of
the prohibited boycott clause.
    A may not thereafter reimburse a negotiating bank or in any way
further implement the letter of credit, because it knows of the
prohibited boycott condition.
    (x) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. exporter B and
requests a foreign bank in Y to open a letter of credit in favor of
B to cover the cost. The letter of credit contains a prohibited
boycott clause. The foreign bank asks U.S. bank A to advise and
confirm the letter of credit. Through inadvertence, A does not
notice the prohibited clause and confirms the letter of credit. A
thereafter notices the clause and then refuses to honor B's draft
against the letter of credit. B sues bank A for payment.
    A has an absolute defense against the obligation to make payment
under this letter of credit. (Note that paragraph (ix) of this
section does not alter any other obligations or liabilities of the
parties under appropriate law.)
    (xi) [Reserved]
    (xii) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. A
letter of credit which contains a prohibited boycott clause is
opened in favor of B by a foreign bank in Y. The foreign bank asks
U.S. bank A to advise and confirm the letter of credit, which it
forwards to A.
    A may advise B that it has received the letter of credit
(including the boycott term), but may not confirm the letter of
credit with the prohibited clause.
    (xiii) Same as (xii), except U.S. bank A fails to tell B that it
cannot process the letter of credit. B requests payment.
    A may not pay. If the prohibited language is eliminated or
nullified as the result of renegotiation, A may then pay or
otherwise implement the revised letter of credit.
    (xiv) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S.
beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to certify that he is
not blacklisted.
    A may implement such a letter of credit, but it may not insist
that the certification be furnished, because by so insisting it
would be refusing to do business with a blacklisted person in
compliance with a boycott.
    (xv) A, a U.S. bank located in the U.S. opens a letter of credit
in favor of U.S. beneficiary B for B's sale of goods to boycotting
country Y. The letter of credit contains no boycott conditions, but
A knows that Y customarily requires the seller of goods to certify
that it has dealt with no blacklisted supplier. A, therefore,
instructs B that it will not make payment under the letter of credit
unless B makes such a certification.
    A's action in requiring the certification from B constitutes
action to require another person to refuse to do business with
blacklisted persons.
    (xvi) A, a U.S. bank located in the U.S., opens a letter of
credit in favor of U.S. beneficiary B for B's sale of goods to
boycotting country Y. The letter of credit contains no boycott
conditions, but A has actual knowledge that B has agreed to supply a
certification to Y that it has not dealt with blacklisted firms, as
a condition of receiving the letter of credit in its favor.
    A may not implement the letter of credit, because it knows that
an implicit condition of the credit is a condition with which B may
not legally comply.
    (xvii) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Y
opens a letter of credit with foreign bank C in favor of B. The
letter of credit includes the statement, ``Do not negotiate with
blacklisted banks.'' C forwards the letter of credit it has opened
to U.S. bank A for confirmation.
    A may not confirm or otherwise implement this letter of credit,
because it contains a condition with which a U.S. person may not
comply.

Sec. 760.3  Exceptions to prohibitions.

    (a) Import requirements of a boycotting country.

Compliance With Import Requirements of a Boycotting Country

    (1) A United States person, in supplying goods or services to a
boycotting country, or to a national or resident of a boycotting
country, may comply or agree to comply with requirements of such
boycotting country which prohibit the import of:
    (i) Goods or services from the boycotted country;
    (ii) Goods produced or services provided by any business concern
organized under the laws of the boycotted country; or
    (iii) Goods produced or services provided by nationals or residents
of the boycotted country.
    (2) A United States person may comply or agree to comply with such
import requirements whether or not he has received a specific request
to comply. By its terms, this exception applies only to transactions
involving imports into a boycotting country. A United States person may
not, under this exception, refuse on an across-the-board basis to do
business with a boycotted country or a national or resident of a
boycotted country.
    (3) In taking action within the scope of this exception, a United
States person is limited in the types of boycott-related information he
can supply. (See Sec. 760.2(d) of this part on ``Furnishing Information
About Business Relationships with Boycotted Countries or Blacklisted
Persons'' and paragraph (c) of this section on ``Import and Shipping
Document Requirements.'')

Examples of Compliance With Import Requirements of a Boycotting Country

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which compliance with the import
requirements of a boycotting country is permissible. They are
illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, receives an order from boycotting
country Y for its products, country X is boycotted by country Y, and
the import laws of Y prohibit the importation of goods produced or
manufactured in X. In filling this type of order, A would usually
include some component parts produced in X.
    For the purpose of filling this order, A may substitute
comparable component parts in place of parts produced in X, because
the import laws of Y prohibit the importation of goods manufactured
in X.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that A's contract with Y expressly
provides that in fulfilling the contract A ``may not include parts
or

[[Page 12876]]
components produced or manufactured in boycotted country X.''
    A may agree to and comply with this contract provision, because
Y prohibits the importation of goods from X. (NOTE: After June 21,
1978, A may not furnish negative certifications regarding the origin
of components in response to import and shipping document
requirements.)
    (iii) A, a U.S. building contractor, is awarded a contract to
construct a plant in boycotting country Y. A accepts bids on goods
required under the contract, and the lowest bid is made by B, a
business concern organized under the laws of X, a country boycotted
by Y. Y prohibits the import of goods produced by companies
organized under the laws of X.
    For purposes of this contract, A may reject B's bid and accept
another, because B's goods would be refused entry in to Y because of
Y's boycott against X.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that A also rejects the low bid by B
for work on a construction project in country M, a country not
boycotted by Y.
    This exception does not apply, because A's action is not taken
in order to comply with Y's requirements prohibiting the import of
products from boycotted country X.
    (v) A, a U.S. management consulting firm, contracts to provide
services to boycotting country Y. Y requests that A not employ
residents or nationals of boycotted country X to provide those
services.
    A may agree, as a condition of the contract, not to have
services furnished by nationals or residents of X, because
importation of such services is prohibited by Y.
    (vi) A, a U.S. company, is negotiating a contract to supply
machine tools to boycotting country Y. Y insists that the contract
contain a provision whereby A agrees that none of the machine tools
will be produced by any business concern owned by nationals of
boycotted country X, even if the business concern is organized under
the laws of a non-boycotted country.
    A may not agree to this provision, because it is a restriction
on the import of goods produced by business concerns owned by
nationals of a boycotted country even if the business concerns
themselves are organized under the laws of a non-boycotted country.

    (b) Shipment of goods to a boycotting country.

Compliance With Requirements Regarding the Shipment of Goods to a
Boycotting Country

    (1) A United States person, in shipping goods to a boycotting
country, may comply or agree to comply with requirements of that
country which prohibit the shipment of goods:
    (i) On a carrier of the boycotted country; or
    (ii) By a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting
country or the recipient of the shipment.
    (2) A specific request that a United States person comply or agree
to comply with requirements concerning the use of carriers of a
boycotted country is not necessary if the United States person knows,
or has reason to know, that the use of such carriers for shipping goods
to the boycotting country is prohibited by requirements of the
boycotting country. This exception applies whether a boycotting country
or the purchaser of the shipment:
    (i) Explicitly states that the shipment should not pass through a
port of the boycotted country; or
    (ii) Affirmatively describes a route of shipment that does not
include a port in the boycotted country.
    (3) For purposes of this exception, the term carrier of a boycotted
country means a carrier which flies the flag of a boycotted country or
which is owned, chartered, leased, or operated by a boycotted country
or by nationals or residents of a boycotted country.

Examples of Compliance With the Shipping Requirements of a Boycotting
Country

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which compliance with import and
shipping document requirements of a boycotting country is
permissible. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) A is a U.S. exporter from whom boycotting country Y is
importing goods. Y directs that the goods not pass through a port of
boycotted country X.
    A may comply with Y's shipping instructions, because they
pertain to the route of shipment of goods being shipped to Y.
    (ii) A, a U.S. fertilizer manufacturer, receives an order from
boycotting country Y for fertilizer. Y specifies in the order that A
may not ship the fertilizer on a carrier of boycotted country X.
    A may comply with this request, because it pertains to the
carrier of a boycotted country.
    (iii) B, a resident of boycotting country Y, orders textile
goods from A, a U.S. distributor, specifying that the shipment must
not be made on a carrier owned or leased by nationals of boycotted
country X and that the carrier must not pass through a port of
country X enroute to Y.
    A may comply or agree to comply with these requests, because
they pertain to the shipment of goods to Y on a carrier of a
boycotted country and the route such shipment will take.
    (iv) Boycotting country Y orders goods from A, a U.S. retail
merchant. The order specifies that the goods shipped by A ``may not
be shipped on a carrier registered in or owned by boycotted country
X.''
    A may agree to this contract provision, because it pertains to
the carrier of a boycotted country.
    (v) Boycotting country Y orders goods from A, a U.S.
pharmaceutical company, and requests that the shipment not pass
through a port of country P, which is not a country boycotted by Y.
    This exception does not apply in a non-boycotting situation. A
may comply with the shipping instructions of Y, because in doing so
he would not violate any prohibition of this part.

    (c) Import and shipping document requirements.

Compliance With Import and Shipping Document Requirements of a
Boycotting Country

    (1) A United States person, in shipping goods to a boycotting
country, may comply or agree to comply with import and shipping
document requirements of that country, with respect to:
    (i) The country or origin of the goods;
    (ii) The name of the carrier;
    (iii) The route of the shipment;
    (iv) The name of the supplier of the shipment; and
    (v) The name of the provider of other services.
    (2) After June 21, 1978, all such information must be stated in
positive, non-blacklisting, non-exclusionary terms except for
information with respect to the names of carriers or routes of
shipment, which may continue to be stated in negative terms in
conjunction with shipments to a boycotting country, in order to comply
with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks or
confiscation. The purpose of this delayed effective date, which is
provided by section 4A(a)(2)(B) of the Export Administration Act of
1969, as amended, is to allow time for persons to adjust their
practices to the use of import and shipping documentation stated in
positive rather than negative terms.

Examples of Compliance With Import and Shipping Document Requirements

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which compliance with the import
requirements of a boycotting country is permissible. They are
illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) Boycotting country Y contracts with A, a U.S. petroleum
equipment manufacturer, for certain equipment. Y requires that goods
being imported into Y must be accompanied by a certification that
the goods being supplied did not originate in boycotted country X.
    Until June 21, 1978, A may comply with such import requirements
in the terms requested. After June 21, 1978, A may not supply such a
certification in negative terms but may identify instead the country
of origin of the goods in positive terms only.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that Y requires that the shipping
documentation accompanying the goods specify the country of origin
of the goods.
    A may furnish the information.
    (iii) On February 1, 1978, A, a U.S. distributor, enters into a
two-year contract with boycotting country Y to make monthly
shipments of goods to Y. A clause in the contract requires that all
shipments into the

[[Page 12877]]
country must be accompanied by a certification that the goods did
not originate in X, a country boycotted by Y.
    A may supply such a negative certification until June 21, 1978.
After that date, A may state the origin of the goods on the shipping
or import documents in positive terms only.
    (iv) A, a U.S. apparel manufacturer, has contracted to sell
certain of its products to B, a national of boycotting country Y.
The form that must be submitted to customs officials of Y requires
the shipper to certify that the goods contained in the shipment have
not been supplied by ``blacklisted'' persons.
    Until June 21, 1978, A may furnish the information required in
the terms requested. After June 21, 1978, A may not furnish the
information in negative terms but may certify, in positive terms
only, the name of the supplier of the goods.
    (v) Same as (iv), except the customs form requires certification
that the insurer and freight forwarder used are not ``blacklisted.''
    Until June 21, 1978, A may furnish the information required in
the terms requested. After June 21, 1978, A may not comply with the
request but may supply a certification stating, in positive terms
only, the names of the insurer and freight forwarder.
    (vi) A, a U.S. petrochemical manufacturer, executes a sales
contract with B, a resident of boycotting country Y. A provision of
A's contract with B requires that the bill of lading and other
shipping documents contain certifications that the goods have not
been shipped on a ``blacklisted'' carrier.
    Until June 21, 1978, A may furnish the information required in
the terms requested. After June 21, 1978, A may not agree to supply
a certification that the carrier is not ``blacklisted'' but may
certify the name of the carrier in positive terms only.
    (vii) Same as (vi), except that the contract requires
certification that the goods will not be shipped on a carrier which
flies the flag of, or is owned, chartered, leased, or operated by
boycotted country X, or by nationals or residents of X.
    Such a certification, which is a reasonable requirement to
protect against war risks or confiscation, may be furnished at any
time.
    (viii) Same as (vi), except that the contract requires that the
shipping documents certify the name of the carrier being used.
    A may, at any time, supply or agree to supply the requested
documentation regarding the name of the carrier, either in negative
or positive terms.
    (ix) Same as (vi), except that the contract requires a
certification that the carrier will not call at a port in boycotted
country X before making delivery in Y.
    Such a certification, which is a reasonable requirement to
protect against war risks or confiscation, may be furnished at any
time.
    (x) Same as (vi), except that the contract requires that the
shipping documents indicate the name of the insurer and freight
forwarder.
    A may comply at any time, because the statement is not required
to be made in negative or blacklisting terms.
    (xi) A, a U.S. exporter, is negotiating a contract to sell
bicycles to boycotting country Y. Y insists that A agree to certify
that the goods will not be shipped on a vessel which has ever called
at a port in boycotted country X.
    As distinguished from a certification that goods will not be
shipped on a vessel which will call enroute at a port of boycotted
country X, such a certification is not a reasonable requirement to
protect against war risks or confiscation, and, hence, may not be
supplied.
    (xii) Same as (xi), except that Y insists that A agree to
certify that the goods will not be shipped on a carrier that is
ineligible to enter Y's waters.
    Such a certification, which is not a reasonable requirement to
protect against war risks or confiscation may not be supplied.
    (xiii) A, a U.S. exporter, sells some of its products to
boycotting country Y. A foreign bank located in Y opens a letter of
credit to pay for the goods. The letter of credit requires that A
supply documentation certifying that ``the goods are not
manufactured in boycotted country X.''
    A may make the required certification until June 21, 1978,
because import and shipping document requirements of a boycotting
country may be reflected in letters of credit.

    (d) Compliance with unilateral selection.

Compliance With Unilateral and Specific Selection

    (1) A United States person may comply or agree to comply in the
normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by
a boycotting country, a national of a boycotting country, or a resident
of a boycotting country (including a United States person who is a bona
fide resident of a boycotting country) of carriers, insurers, suppliers
of services to be performed within the boycotting country, or specific
goods, provided that with respect to services, it is necessary and
customary that an insignificant part of the services be performed
within the boycotting country, and with respect to goods, the items, in
the normal course of business, are identifiable as to their source or
origin at the time of their entry into the boycotting country by
uniqueness of design or appearance or trademark, trade name, or other
identification normally on the items themselves, including their
packaging.
    (2) This exception pertains to what is permissible for a United
States person who is the recipient of a unilateral and specific
selection of goods or services to be furnished by a third person. It
does not pertain to whether the act of making such a selection is
permitted; that question is covered, with respect to United States
persons, in paragraph (g) of this section on ``Compliance with Local
Law.'' Nor does it pertain to the United States person who is the
recipient of an order to supply its own goods or services. Nothing in
this part prohibits or restricts a United States person from filling an
order himself, even if he is selected by the buyer on a boycott basis
(e.g., because he is not blacklisted), so long as he does not himself
take any action prohibited by this part.

Unilateral and Specific Character of the Selection

    (3) In order for this exception to apply, the selection with which
a United States person wishes to comply must be unilateral and
specific.
    (4) A ``specific'' selection is one which is stated in the
affirmative and which specifies a particular supplier of goods or
services.
    (5) A ``unilateral'' selection is one in which the discretion in
making the selection is exercised by the boycotting country buyer. If
the United States person who receives a unilateral selection has
provided the buyer with any boycott-based assistance (including
information for purposes of helping the buyer select someone on a
boycott basis), then the buyer's selection is not unilateral, and
compliance with that selection by a United States person does not come
within this exception.
    (6) The provision of so-called ``pre-selection'' or ``pre-award''
services, such as providing lists of qualified suppliers,
subcontractors, or bidders, does not, in and of itself, destroy the
unilateral character of a selection, provided such services are not
boycott-based. Lists of qualified suppliers, for example, must not
exclude anyone because he is blacklisted. Moreover, such services must
be of the type customarily provided in similar transactions by the firm
(or industry of which the firm is a part) as measured by the practice
in non-boycotting as well as boycotting countries. If such services are
not customarily provided in similar transactions or such services are
provided in such a way as to exclude blacklisted persons from
participating in a transaction or diminish their opportunity for such
participation, then the services may not be provided without destroying
the unilateral character of any subsequent selection.

Selection To Be Made by Boycotting Country Resident

    (7) In order for this exception to be available, the unilateral and
specific selection must have been made by a boycotting country, or by a
national or resident of a boycotting country. Such a resident may be a
United States person. For purposes of this exception, a United States
person will be considered a resident of a boycotting country only if he
is a bona fide resident. A United States person may be a bona fide

[[Page 12878]]
resident of a boycotting country even if such person's residency is
temporary.
    (8) Factors that will be considered in determining whether a United
States person is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country include:
    (i) Physical presence in the country;
    (ii) Whether residence is needed for legitimate business reasons;
    (iii) Continuity of the residency;
    (iv) Intent to maintain the residency;
    (v) Prior residence in the country;
    (vi) Size and nature of presence in the country;
    (vii) Whether the person is registered to do business or
incorporated in the country;
    (viii) Whether the person has a valid work visa; and
    (ix) Whether the person has a similar presence in both boycotting
and non-boycotting foreign countries in connection with similar
business activities.

    Note to paragraph (d)(8) of this section: No one of the factors
is dispositive. All the circumstances will be examined closely to
ascertain whether there is, in fact, a bona fide residency.
Residency established solely for purposes of avoidance of the
application of this part, unrelated to legitimate business needs,
does not constitute bona fide residency.

    (9) The boycotting country resident must be the one actually making
the selection. If a selection is made by a non-resident agent, parent,
subsidiary, affiliate, home office or branch office of a boycotting
country resident, it is not a selection by a resident within the
meaning of this exception.
    (10) A selection made solely by a bona fide resident and merely
transmitted by another person to a United States person for execution
is a selection by a bona fide resident within the meaning of this
exception.

Duty of Inquiry

    (11) If a United States person receives, from another person
located in the United States, what may be a unilateral selection by a
boycotting country customer, and knows or has reason to know that the
selection is made for boycott reasons, he has a duty to inquire of the
transmitting person to determine who actually made the selection. If he
knows or has reason to know that the selection was made by other than a
boycotting country, or a national or resident of a boycotting country,
he may not comply. A course or pattern of conduct which a United States
person recognizes or should recognize as consistent with boycott
restrictions will create a duty to inquire.
    (12) If the United States person does not know or have reason to
know that the selection it receives is boycott-based, its compliance
with such a selection does not offend any prohibition and this
exception is not needed.

Selection of Services

    (13) This exception applies only to compliance with selections of
certain types of suppliers of services-carriers, insurers, and
suppliers of services to be performed ``within the boycotting
country.'' Services to be performed wholly within the United States or
wholly within any country other than the boycotting country are not
covered.
    (14) For purposes of this part, services are to be performed
``within the boycotting country'' only if they are of a type which
would customarily be performed by suppliers of those services within
the country of the recipient of those services, and if the part of the
services performed within the boycotting country is a necessary and not
insignificant part of the total services performed.
    (15) What is ``customary and necessary'' for these purposes depends
on the usual practice of the supplier of the services (or the industry
of which he is a part) as measured by the practice in non-boycotting as
well as boycotting countries, except where such practices are
instituted to accommodate this part.

Selection of Goods

    (16) This exception applies only to compliance with selections of
certain types of goods--goods that, in the normal course of business,
are identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their
entry into the boycotting country. The definition of ``specifically
identifiable goods'' is the same under this section as it is in
paragraph (g) of this section on ``Compliance with Local Law.''
    (17) Goods ``specifically identifiable'' in the normal course of
business are those items which at the time of their entry into a
boycotting country are identifiable as to source or origin by
uniqueness of design or appearance; or trademark, trade name, or other
identification normally on the items themselves, including their
packaging. Goods are ``specifically identifiable'' in the normal course
of business if their source or origin is ascertainable by inspection of
the items themselves, including their packaging, regardless of whether
inspection takes place. Goods are not considered to be ``specifically
identifiable'' in the normal course of business if a trademark, trade
name, or other form of identification not normally present is added to
the items themselves, including their packaging, to accommodate this
part.

General

    (18) If a unilateral selection meets the conditions described in
paragraph (d) of this section, the United States person receiving the
unilateral selection may comply or agree to comply, even if he knows or
has reason to know that the selection was boycott-based. However, no
United States person may comply or agree to comply with any unilateral
selection if he knows or has reason to know that the purpose of the
selection is to effect discrimination against any United States person
on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin.

Examples of Compliance With a Unilateral Selection

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining what constitutes a unilateral selection and the
circumstances in which compliance with such a selection is
permissible. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.

Specific and Unilateral Selection

    (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer of road-grading equipment, is asked
by boycotting country Y to ship goods to Y on U.S. vessel B, a
carrier which is not blacklisted by Y. A knows or has reason to know
that Y's selection of B is boycott-based.
    A may comply with Y's request, or may agree to comply as a
condition of the contract, because the selection is specific and
unilateral.
    (ii) A, a U.S. contractor building an industrial facility in
boycotting country Y is asked by B, a resident of Y, to use C as the
supplier of air conditioning equipment to be used in the facility. C
is not blacklisted by country Y. A knows or has reason to know that
B's request is boycott-based.
    A may comply with B's request, or may agree to comply as a
condition of the contract, because the selection of C is specific
and unilateral.
    (iii) A, a U.S. manufacturer of automotive equipment, is asked
by boycotting country Y not to ship its goods to Y on U.S. carriers,
B, C, or D. Carriers B, C, and D are blacklisted by boycotting
country Y. A knows or has reason to know that Y's request is
boycott-based.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because no
specific selection of any particular carrier has been made.
    (iv) A, a U.S. exporter shipping goods ordered by boycotting
country Y, is provided by Y with a list of eligible U.S. insurers
from which A may choose in insuring the shipment of its goods. A
knows or has reason to know that the list was compiled on a boycott
basis.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request that A
choose from among the eligible insurers, because no specific
selection of any particular insurer has been made.
    (v) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, is negotiating to sell
aircraft to boycotting country Y. During the negotiations, Y asks A

[[Page 12879]]
to identify the company which normally manufactures the engines for
the aircraft. A responds that they are normally manufactured by U.S.
engine manufacturer B. B is blacklisted by Y. In making the
purchase, Y specifies that the engines for the aircraft should be
supplied by U.S. engine manufacturer C.
    A may comply or agree to comply with Y's selection of C, because
Y's selection is unilateral and specific.
    (vi) A, a U.S. construction firm, is retained by an agency of
boycotting country Y to build a pipeline. Y requests A to suggest
qualified engineering firms to be used on-site in the construction
of the pipeline. It is customary for A, regardless of where it
conducts its operations, to identify qualified engineering firms to
its customers so that its customers may make their own selection of
the firm to be engaged. Choice of engineering firm is customarily a
prerogative of the customer. A provides a list of five engineering
firms, B-F, excluding no firm because it may be blacklisted, and
then confers with and gives its recommendations to Y. A recommends
C, because C is the best qualified. Y then selects B, because C is
blacklisted.
    A may comply with Y's selection of B, because the boycott-based
decision is made by Y and is unilateral and specific. Since A's pre-
award services are of the kind customarily provided in these
situations, and since they are provided without reference to the
boycott, they do not destroy the unilateral character of Y's
selection.
    (vii) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, has an order to supply a
certain number of planes to boycotting country Y. In connection with
the order, Y asks A to supply it with a list of qualified aircraft
tire manufacturers so that Y can select the tires to be placed on
the planes. This is a highly unusual request, since, in A's
worldwide business operations, choice of tires is customarily made
by the manufacturer, not the customer. Nonetheless, A supplies a
list of tire manufacturers, B, C, D, and E. Y chooses tire
manufacturer B because B is not blacklisted. Had A, as is customary,
selected the tires, company C would have been chosen. C happens to
be blacklisted, and A knows that C's blacklist status was the reason
for Y's selection of B.
    A's provision of a list of tire manufacturers for Y to choose
from destroys the unilateral character of Y's selection, because
such a pre-selection service is not customary in A's worldwide
business operations.
    (viii) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, receives an order from
U.S. company C, which is located in the United States, for the sale
of aircraft to company D, a U.S. affiliate of C. D is a bona fide
resident of boycotting country Y. C instructs A that ``in order to
avoid boycott problems,'' A must use engines that are manufactured
by company B, a company that is not blacklisted by Y. Engines built
by B are unique in design and also bear B's trade name.
    Since A has reason to know that the selection is boycott-based,
he must inquire of C whether the selection was in fact made by D. If
C informs A that the selection was made by D, A may comply.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that C initially states that the
designation was unilaterally and specifically made by D.
    A may accept C's statement without further investigation and may
comply with the selection, because C merely transmitted D's
unilateral and specific selection.
    (x) Same as (ix), except that C informs A that it, C, has
selected B on behalf of or as an agent of its affiliated company
resident in the boycotting country.
    A may not comply with this selection, because the decision was
not made by a resident of the boycotting country.
    (xi) A, a U.S. management consulting firm, is advising
boycotting country Y on the selection of a contracting firm to
construct a plant for the manufacture of agricultural chemicals. As
is customary in its business, A compiles a list of potential
contractors on the basis of its evaluation of the capabilities of
the respective candidates to perform the job. A has knowledge that
company B is blacklisted, but provides Y with the names of companies
B, C, D, and E, listing them in order of their qualifications. Y
instructs A to negotiate with C.
    A may comply with Y's instruction, because Y's selection is
unilateral and specific.
    (xii) A, a U.S. exporter, is asked by boycotting country Y not
to ship goods on carriers B, C, or D, which are owned by nationals
of and are registered in country P, a country not boycotted by Y.
    A may comply or agree to comply with Y's request even though the
selection is not specific, because A does not know or have reason to
know that the request is boycott-based.

(Note: In example (xii), A has violated no prohibition, because it
does not know or have reason to know that Y's instruction is
boycott-based. Therefore, A could not act with the requisite intent
to comply with the boycott.)

    (xiii) A, a U.S. construction company, receives a contract to
construct a hotel in boycotting country Y. As part of the contract,
A is required to furnish Y with lists of qualified suppliers of
various specifically identifiable items. A compiles lists of various
qualified suppliers wholly without reference to the boycott, and
thereafter Y instructs A to negotiate with, enter into contracts
with, and arrange for delivery from each of the suppliers which Y
designates. A knows that Y's choices are made on a boycott basis.
    A may comply with Y's selections and carry out these post-award
services for Y, because Y's selections were unilateral and specific
and A's pre-award services were provided without reference to Y's
boycott.

Examples of Boycotting Country Buyer

(The factors in determining whether a United States person is a
``bona fide resident'' of a boycotting country are the same as in
paragraph (g) of this section on ``Compliance with Local Law.'' See
also the examples in that section.)

    (i) A, a U.S. exporter, is asked by B, a U.S. person who is a
bona fide resident of boycotting country Y, to ship goods on U.S.
carrier C. C is not blacklisted by Y, and A knows that B has chosen
on a boycott basis in order to comply with Y's boycott laws.
    A may comply or agree to comply with B's request, because B is a
bona fide resident of Y.
    (ii) A is a U.S. computer company whose subsidiary, B, is a bona
fide resident of boycotting country Y. A receives an order from B
for specific, identifiable products manufactured by company C in
connection with a computer which B is installing in Y.
    A may comply or agree to comply with B's unilateral and specific
selection, so long as the discretion was in fact exercised by B, not
A.

(Note: Unilateral selection transactions involving related United
States persons will be scrutinized carefully to ensure that the
selection was in fact made by the bona fide resident of the
boycotting country.)

    (iii) A, a U.S. engineering firm, has chief engineer B as its
resident engineer on a dam construction site in boycotting country
Y. B's presence at the site is necessary in order to ensure proper
supervision of the project. In order to comply with local law, B
selects equipment supplier C rather than D, who is blacklisted, and
directs A to purchase certain specific equipment from C for use in
the project.
    A may comply with this unilateral selection, because the
decision was made by a bona fide resident of Y.

(As noted above, unilateral selections involving related United
States persons will be scrutinized carefully to ensure that the
selection was in fact made by the bona fide resident of the
boycotting country.)

    (iv) B, a branch of U.S. bank A, is located in boycotting
country Y. B is in need of office supplies and asks the home office
in New York to make the necessary purchases. A contacts C, a U.S.
company in the office supply business, and instructs C to purchase
various items from certain specific companies and ship them directly
to B. In order to avoid any difficulties for B with respect to Y's
boycott laws, A is careful to specify only non-blacklisted companies
or suppliers. C knows that that was A's purpose. C may not comply
with A's instruction, because the selection of suppliers was not
made by a resident of a boycotting country.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that A has given standing instructions
to B that whenever it needs office supplies, it should specify
certain suppliers designated by A. To avoid running afoul of Y's
boycott laws, A's designations consist exclusively of non-
blacklisted firms. A receives an order from B with the suppliers
designated in accordance with A's instructions.
    A may not comply with B's selection, because the selection was
not in fact made by a bona fide resident of the boycotting country,
but by a person located in the United States.

Examples of Suppliers of Services

    (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is asked by boycotting country Y to
ship goods to Y on U.S. vessel B, a carrier which is not blacklisted
by Y.
    A may comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because
compliance with the unilateral and specific selection of carriers is
expressly permitted under this exception.

[[Page 12880]]

    (ii) A, a U.S. exporter shipping goods ordered by C, a national
of boycotting country Y, is asked by C to insure the shipment
through U.S. insurer B.
    A may comply or agree to comply with C's request, because
compliance with the unilateral and specific selection of an insurer
is expressly permitted under this exception.
    (iii) A, a U.S. construction company, is hired by C, an agency
of the government of boycotting country Y, to build a power plant in
Y. C specifies that A should subcontract the foundation work to U.S.
contractor B. Part of the foundation design work will be done by B
in the United States.
    A may comply or agree to comply with Y's designation, because a
necessary and not insignificant part of B's services are to be
performed within the boycotting country, and such services are
customarily performed on-site.
    (iv) A, a U.S. contractor, is engaged by boycotting country Y to
build a power plant. Y specifies that U.S. architectural firm B
should be retained by A to design the plant. In order to design the
plant, it is essential that B's personnel visit and become familiar
with the site, although the bulk of the design and drawing work will
be done in the United States.
    A may comply or agree to comply with Y's unilateral and specific
selection of architectural firm B, because a necessary and not
insignificant part of B's services are to be performed within Y, and
such on-site work is customarily involved in the provision of
architectural services. The fact that the bulk of the actual work
may be performed in the United States is irrelevant since the part
to be performed within Y is necessary to B's effective performance.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that Y specifies that the turbine for
the power plant should be designed by U.S. engineer C. It is neither
customary nor necessary for C to visit the site in order to do any
of his work, but C has informed A that he would probably want to
visit the site in Y if he were selected for the job.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because,
in the normal course of business, it is neither customary nor
necessary for engineer C's services to be performed in Y.
    (vi) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, receives a contract from
boycotting country Y to manufacture jet engines for Y's use. Y
specifies that the engines should be designed by U.S. industrial
engineering firm B.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because,
in the normal course of business, the services will not be performed
in Y.
    (vii) U.S. company A has a contract to supply specially designed
road graders to boycotting country Y. Y has instructed A that it
should engage engineering firm B in the design work rather than
engineering firm C, which A normally uses, because C is blacklisted.
When A contacts B, B informs A that one of B's personnel customarily
visits the location in which any equipment B designs is used after
it is in use, in order to determine how good a design job B has
done. Such visits are necessary from B's point of view to provide a
check on the quality of its work, and they are necessary from Y's
point of view because they make it possible for Y to discuss
possible design changes should deficiencies be detected.
    A may not comply with Y's selection of B, because the services
which B would perform in Y are an insignificant part of the total
services to be performed by B.

Examples of Specifically Identifiable Goods

(The test of what constitutes ``specifically identifiable goods''
under this exception also applies to the term ``specifically
identifiable goods'' as used in paragraph (g) of this section on
``Compliance with Local Law.'')

    (i) A, a U.S. contractor, is constructing an apartment complex,
on a turnkey basis, for boycotting country Y. Y instructs A to use
only kitchen appliances manufactured by U.S. company B in completing
the project. The appliances normally bear the manufacturer's name
and trademark.
    A may comply with Y's selection of B, because Y's unilateral and
specific selection is of goods identifiable as to source or origin
in the normal course of business at the time of their entry into Y.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that Y directs A to use lumber
manufactured only by U.S. company C. In the normal course of
business, C neither stamps its name on the lumber nor identifies
itself as the manufacturer on the packaging. In addition, normal
export packaging does not identify the manufacturer.
    A may not comply with Y's selection, because the goods selected
are not identifiable by source or origin in the normal course of
business at the time of their entry into Y.
    (iii) B, a U.S. contractor who is a bona fide resident of
boycotting country Y, is engaged in building roads. B retains the
services of A, a U.S. engineering firm, to assist it in procuring
construction equipment. B directs A to purchase road graders only
from manufacturer C because other road grader manufacturers which A
might use are blacklisted. C's road graders normally bear C's
insignia.
    A may comply with B's selection of C, because the goods selected
are identifiable by source or origin in the normal course of
business at the time of their entry into Y.
    (iv) A, a U.S. company, manufactures computer-operated machine
tools. The computers are mounted on a separate bracket on the side
of the equipment and are readily identifiable by brand name
imprinted on the equipment. There are five or six U.S. manufacturers
of such computers which will function interchangeably to operate the
machine tools manufactured by A. B, a resident of boycotting country
Y, contracts to buy the machine tools manufactured by A on the
condition that A incorporate, as the computer drive, a computer
manufactured by U.S. company C. B's designation of C is made to
avoid boycott problems which could be caused if computers
manufactured by some other company were used.
    A may comply with B's designation of C, because the goods
selected are identifiable by source or origin in the normal course
of business at the time of their entry into Y.
    (v) A, a U.S. wholesaler of electronic equipment, receives an
order from B, a U.S. manufacturer of radio equipment, who is a bona
fide resident of boycotting country Y. B orders a variety of
electrical components and specifies that all transistors must be
purchased from company C, which is not blacklisted by Y. The
transistors requested by B do not normally bear the name of the
manufacturer; however, they are typically shipped in cartons, and
C's name and logo appear on the cartons.
    A may comply with B's selection, because the goods selected by B
are identifiable as to source or origin in the normal course of
business at the time of their entry into Y by virtue of the
containers or packaging used.
    (vi) A, a U.S. computer manufacturer, receives an order for a
computer from B, a university in boycotting country Y. B specifies
that certain integrated circuits incorporated in the computer must
be supplied by U.S. electronics company C. These circuits are
incorporated into the computer and are not visible without
disassembling the computer.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with B's specific selection
of these components, because they are not identifiable as to their
source or origin in the normal course of business at the time of
their entry into Y.
    (vii) A, a U.S. clothing manufacturer, receives an order for
shirts from B, a retailer resident in boycotting country Y. B
specifies that the shirts are to be manufactured from cotton
produced by U.S. farming cooperative C. Such shirts will not
identify C or the source of the cotton.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with B's designation,
because the cotton is not identifiable as to source or origin in the
normal course of business at the time of entry into Y.
    (viii) A, a U.S. contractor, is retained by B, a construction
firm located in and wholly-owned by boycotting country Y, to assist
B in procuring construction materials. B directs A to purchase a
range of materials, including hardware, tools, and trucks, all of
which bear the name of the manufacturer stamped on the item. In
addition, B directs A to purchase steel beams manufactured by U.S.
company C. The name of manufacturer C normally does not appear on
the steel itself or on its export packaging.
    A may comply with B's selection of the hardware, tools, and
trucks, because they are identifiable as to source or origin in the
normal course of business at the time of entry into Y. A may not
comply with B's selection of steel beams, because the goods are not
identifiable as to source or origin by trade name, trademark,
uniqueness or packaging at the time of their entry into Y.

Examples of Discrimination on Basis of Race, Religion, Sex, or National
Origin

    (i) A, a U.S. paper manufacturer, is asked by boycotting country
Y to ship goods to Y on U.S. vessel B. Y states that the reason for
its choice of B is that, unlike U.S. vessel C, B is not owned by
persons of a particular faith.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because A
has reason to know that the purpose of the selection is to effect
religious discrimination against a United States person.

    (e) Shipment and transshipment of exports pursuant to a boycotting
country's requirements.

Compliance With a Boycotting Country's Requirements Regarding Shipment
and Transshipment of Exports

    (1) A United States person may comply or agree to comply with the
export requirements of a boycotting country with respect to shipments
or transshipments of exports to:
    (i) A boycotted country;
    (ii) Any business concern of a boycotted country;
    (iii) Any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted
country; or
    (iv) Any national or resident of a boycotted country.
    (2) This exception permits compliance with restrictions which a
boycotting country may place on direct exports to a boycotted country;
on indirect exports to a boycotted country (i.e., those that pass via
third parties); and on exports to residents, nationals, or business
concerns of, or organized under the laws of, a boycotted country,
including those located in third countries.
    (3) This exception also permits compliance with restrictions which
a boycotting country may place on the route of export shipments when
the restrictions are reasonably related to preventing the export
shipments from coming into contact with or under the jurisdiction of
the boycotted country. This exception applies whether a boycotting
country or the vendor of the shipment:
    (i) Explicitly states that the shipment should not pass through the
boycotted country enroute to its final destination; or
    (ii) Affirmatively describes a route of shipment that does not
include the boycotted country.
    (4) A United States person may not, under this exception, refuse on
an across-the-board basis to do business with a boycotted country or a
national or resident of a boycotted country.

Examples of Compliance With a Boycotting Country's Requirements
Regarding Shipment or Transshipment of Exports

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which compliance with the export
requirements of a boycotting country is permissible. They are
illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. petroleum company, exports petroleum products to
20 countries, including the United States, from boycotting country
Y. Country Y's export regulations require that products not be
exported from Y to boycotted country X.
    A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations with respect to
the export of goods from Y to X.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that Y's export regulations require
that goods not be exported from boycotting country Y to any business
concern organized under the laws of boycotted country X.
    A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations with respect to
the export of goods from Y to a business concern organized under the
laws of X, even if such concern is located in a country not involved
in Y's boycott of X.
    (iii) B, the operator of a storage facility in country M,
contracts with A, a U.S. carrier, for the shipment of certain goods
manufactured in boycotting country Y. A's contract with B contains a
provision stating that the goods to be transported may not be
shipped or transshipped to boycotted country X. B informs A that
this provision is a requirement of C, the manufacturer of goods who
is a resident of boycotting country Y. Country M is not boycotted by
Y.
    A may agree to and comply with this provision, because such a
provision is required by the export regulations of boycotting
country Y in order to prevent shipment of Y-origin goods to a
country boycotted by Y.
    (iv) A, a U.S. petroleum refiner located in the United States,
purchases crude oil from boycotting country Y. A has a branch
operation in boycotted country X. Y requires, as a condition of
sale, that A agree not to ship or transship the crude oil or
products refined in Y to A's branch in X.
    A may agree to and comply with these requirements, because they
are export requirements of Y designed to prevent Y-origin products
from being shipped to a boycotted country.
    (v) A, a U.S. company, has a petrochemical plant in boycotting
country Y. As a condition of securing an export license from Y, A
must agree that it will not ship or permit transshipment of any of
its output from the plant in Y to any companies which Y lists as
being owned by nationals of boycotted country X.
    A may agree to this condition, because it is a restriction
designed to prevent Y-origin products from being exported to a
business concern of boycotted country X or to nationals of boycotted
country X.
    (vi) Same as (v), except that the condition imposed on A is that
Y-origin goods may not be shipped or permitted to be transshipped to
any companies which Y lists as being owned by persons whose national
origin is X.
    A may not agree to this condition, because it is a restriction
designed to prevent Y-origin goods from being exported to persons of
a particular national origin rather than to residents or nationals
of a particular boycotted country.
    (vii) A, a U.S. petroleum company, exports petroleum products to
20 countries, including the United States, from boycotting country
Y. Y requires, as a condition of sale, that A not ship the products
to be exported from Y to or through boycotted country X.
    A may agree to and comply with this requirement because it is an
export requirement of Y designed to prevent Y-origin products from
coming into contact with or under the jurisdiction of a boycotted
country.
    (viii) Same as (vii), except that boycotting country Y's export
regulations require that products to be exported from Y not pass
through a port of boycotted country X.
    A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations prohibiting Y-
origin exports from passing through a port at boycotted country X,
because they are export requirements of Y designed to prevent Y-
origin products from coming into contact with or under the
jurisdiction of a boycotted country.
    (ix) Same as (vii), except that Y's export regulations require
that A not transship the exported products ``in or at'' boycotted
country X.
    A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations with respect to
the transshipment of goods ``in or at'' X, because they are export
requirements of Y designed to prevent Y-origin products from coming
into contact with or under the jurisdiction of a boycotted country.

    (f) Immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements of a
boycotting country.

Compliance With Immigration, Passport, Visa, or Employment Requirements
of a Boycotting Country

    (1) A United States individual may comply or agree to comply with
the immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements of a
boycotting country, and with requests for information from a boycotting
country made to ascertain whether such individual meets requirements
for employment within the boycotting country, provided that he
furnishes information only about himself or a member of his family, and
not about any other United States individual, including his employees,
employers, or co-workers.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a United States individual means
a person who is a resident or national of the United States. Family
means immediate family members, including parents, siblings, spouse,
children, and other dependents living in the individual's home.
    (3) A United States person may not furnish information about its
employees or executives, but may allow any individual to respond on his
own to any request for information relating to immigration, passport,
visa, or employment requirements. A United States person may also
perform any ministerial acts to expedite processing of applications by
individuals. These include informing employees of boycotting country
visa requirements at an appropriate time; typing, translation,
messenger and similar services; and assisting in or arranging for the
expeditious processing of applications.

[[Page 12882]]
All such actions must be undertaken on a non-discriminatory basis.
    (4) A United States person may proceed with a project in a
boycotting country even if certain of its employees or other
prospective participants in a transaction are denied entry for boycott
reasons. But no employees or other participants may be selected in
advance in a manner designed to comply with a boycott.

Examples of Compliance With Immigration, Passport, Visa, or Employment
Requirements of a Boycotting Country

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which compliance with immigration,
passport, visa, or employment requirements is permissible. They are
illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. individual employed by B, a U.S. manufacturer of
sporting goods with a plant in boycotting country Y, wishes to
obtain a work visa so that he may transfer to the plant in Y.
Country Y's immigration laws specify that anyone wishing to enter
the country or obtain a visa to work in the country must supply
information about his religion. This information is required for
boycott purposes.
    A may furnish such information, because it is required by Y's
immigration laws.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that A is asked to supply such
information about other employees of B.
    A may not supply this information, because it is not information
about himself or his family.
    (iii) A, a U.S. building contractor, has been awarded a
construction contract to be performed in boycotting country Y. Y's
immigration laws require that individuals applying for visas must
indicate race, religion, and place of birth. The information is
sought for boycott purposes. To avoid repeated rejections of
applications for work visas by A's employees, A desires to furnish
to country Y a list of its prospective and current employees and
required information about each so that Y can make an initial
screening.
    A may not furnish such a list, because A would be furnishing
information about the race, religion, and national origin of its
employees.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that A selects for work on the
project those of its current employees whom it believes will be
granted work visas from boycotting country Y.
    A may not make a selection from among its employees in a manner
designed to comply with the boycott-based visa requirements of Y,
but must allow all eligible employees to apply for visas. A may
later substitute an employee who obtains the necessary visa for one
who has had his application rejected.
    (v) Same as (iii), except that A selects employees for the
project and then allows each employee individually to apply for his
own visa. Two employees' applications are rejected, and A then
substitutes two other employees who, in turn, submit their own visa
applications.
    A may take such action, because in so doing A is not acting in
contravention of any prohibition of this part.
    (vi) Same as (v), except that A arranges for the translation,
typing and processing of its employees' applications, and transmits
all the applications to the consulate of boycotting country Y.
    A may take such ministerial actions, because in so doing A is
not itself furnishing information with respect to race, religion,
sex, or national origin, but is merely transmitting information
furnished by its individual employees.
    (vii) A, a U.S. contractor, selects U.S. subcontractor B to
perform certain engineering services in connection with A's project
in boycotting country Y. The work visa application submitted by the
employee B has proposed as chief engineer of this project is
rejected by Y because his national origin is of boycotted country X.
Subcontractor B thereupon withdraws.
    A may continue with the project and select another
subcontractor, because A is not acting in contravention of any
prohibition of this part.

    (g) Compliance with local law.
    (1) This exception contains two parts. The first covers compliance
with local law with respect to a United States person's activities
exclusively within a foreign country; the second covers compliance with
local import laws by United States persons resident in a foreign
country. Under both parts of this exception, local laws are laws of the
host country, whether derived from statutes, regulations, decrees, or
other official sources having the effect of law in the host country.
This exception is not available for compliance with presumed policies
or understandings of policies unless those policies are reflected in
official sources having the effect of law.
    (2) Both parts of this exception apply only to United States
persons resident in a foreign country. For purposes of this exception,
a United States person will be considered to be a resident of a foreign
country only if he is a bona fide resident. A United States person may
be a bona fide resident of a foreign country even if such person's
residency is temporary.
    (3)(i) Factors that will be considered in determining whether a
United States person is a bona fide resident of a foreign country
include:
    (A) Physical presence in the country;
    (B) Whether residence is needed for legitimate business reasons;
    (C) Continuity of the residency;
    (D) Intent to maintain the residency;
    (E) Prior residence in the country;
    (F) Size and nature of presence in the country;
    (G) Whether the person is registered to do business or incorporated
in the country;
    (H) Whether the person has a valid work visa; and
    (I) Whether the person has a similar presence in both boycotting
and non-boycotting foreign countries in connection with similar
business activities.
    (ii) No one of the factors in paragraph (g)(3) of this section is
dispositive. All the circumstances involved will be closely examined to
ascertain whether there is, in fact, bona fide residency. Residency
established solely for purposes of avoidance of the application of this
part, unrelated to legitimate business needs, does not constitute bona
fide residency.

Examples of Bona Fide Residency

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which a United States person may be
a bona fide resident of a foreign country. For purposes of
illustration, each example discusses only one or two factors,
instead of all relevant factors. They are illustrative, not
comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. radio manufacturer located in the United States,
receives a tender to bid on a contract to supply radios for a hotel
to be built in boycotting country Y. After examining the proposal, A
sends a bid from its New York office to Y.
    A is not a resident of Y, because it is not physically present
in Y.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that after receiving the tender, A
sends its sales representative to Y. A does not usually have sales
representatives in countries when it bids from the United States,
and this particular person's presence in Y is not necessary to
enable A to make the bid.
    A is not a bona fide resident of Y, because it has no legitimate
business reasons for having its sales representative resident in Y.
    (iii) A, a U.S. bank, wishes to establish a branch office in
boycotting country Y. In pursuit of that objective, A's personnel
visit Y to make the necessary arrangements. A intends to establish a
permanent branch office in Y after the necessary arrangements are
made.
    A's personnel in Y are not bona fide residents of Y, because A
does not yet have a permanent business operation in Y.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except A's personnel are required by Y's
laws to furnish certain non-discriminatory boycott information in
order to establish a branch in Y.
    In these limited circumstances, A's personnel may furnish the
non-discriminatory boycott information necessary to establish
residency to the same extent a U.S. person who is a bona fide
resident in that country could. If this information could not be
furnished in such limited circumstances, the exception would be
available only to firms resident in a boycotting country before the
effective date of this part.
    (v) A, a U.S. construction company, receives an invitation to
build a power plant in boycotting country Y. After receipt of the
invitation, A's personnel visit Y in order to

[[Page 12883]]
survey the site and make necessary analyses in preparation for
submitting a bid. The invitation requires that otherwise prohibited
boycott information be furnished with the bid.
    A's personnel in Y are not bona fide residents of Y, because A
has no permanent business operation in Y. Therefore, A's personnel
may not furnish the prohibited information.
    (vi) Same as (v), except that A is considering establishing an
office in boycotting country Y. A's personnel visit Y in order to
register A to do business in that country. A intends to establish
ongoing construction operations in Y. A's personnel are required by
Y's laws to furnish certain non-discriminatory boycott information
in order to register A to do business or incorporate a subsidiary in
Y.
    In these limited circumstances, A's personnel may furnish non-
discriminatory boycott information necessary to establish residency
to the same extent a U.S. person who is a bona fide resident in that
country could. If this information could not be furnished in such
limited circumstances, the exception would be available only to
firms resident in a boycotting country before the effective date of
this part.
    (vii) A, a subsidiary of U.S. oil company B, is located in
boycotting country Y. A has been engaged in oil explorations in Y
for a number of years.
    A is a bona fide resident of Y, because of its pre-existing
continuous presence in Y for legitimate business reasons.
    (viii) Same as (vii), except that A has just been established in
Y and has not yet begun operations.
    A is a bona fide resident of Y, because it is present in Y for
legitimate business reasons and it intends to reside continuously.
    (ix) U.S. company A is a manufacturer of prefabricated homes. A
builds a plant in boycotting country Y for purposes of assembling
components made by A in the United States and shipped to Y.
    A's personnel in Y are bona fide residents of Y, because A's
plant in Y is established for legitimate business reasons, and it
intends to reside continuously.
    (x) U.S. company A has its principal place of business in the
United States. A's sales agent visits boycotting country Y from time
to time for purposes of soliciting orders.
    A's sales agent is not a bona fide resident of Y, because such
periodic visits to Y are insufficient to establish a bona fide
residency.
    (xi) A, a branch office of U.S. construction company B, is
located in boycotting country Y. The branch office has been in
existence for a number of years and has been performing various
management services in connection with B's construction operations
in Y.
    A is a bona fide resident of Y, because of its longstanding
presence in Y and its conduct of ongoing operations in Y.
    (xii) U.S. construction company A has never done any business in
boycotting country Y. It is awarded a contract to construct a
hospital in Y, and preparatory to beginning construction, sends its
personnel to Y to set up operations.
    A's personnel are bona fide residents of Y, because they are
present in Y for the purposes of carrying out A's legitimate
business purposes; they intend to reside continuously; and residency
is necessary to conduct their business.
    (xiii) U.S. company A manufactures furniture. All its sales in
foreign countries are conducted from its offices in the United
States. From time to time A has considered opening sales offices
abroad, but it has concluded that it is more efficient to conduct
sales operations from the United States. Shortly after the effective
date of this part, A sends a sales representative to boycotting
country Y to open an office in and solicit orders from Y. It is more
costly to conduct operations from that office than to sell directly
from the United States, but A believes that if it establishes a
residence in Y, it will be in a better position to avoid conflicts
with U.S. law in its sales to Y.
    A's sales representative is not a bona fide resident of Y,
because the residency was established to avoid the application of
this part and not for legitimate business reasons.
    (xiv) Same as (xiii), except that it is in fact more efficient
to have a sales office in Y. In fact, without a sales office in Y, A
would find it difficult to explore business opportunities in Y. A is
aware, however, that residency in Y would permit its sales
representative to comply with Y's boycott laws.
    A's sales representative is a bona fide resident of Y, because A
has a legitimate business reason for establishing a sales office in
Y.
    (xv) U.S. company B is a computer manufacturer. B sells
computers and related programming services tailored to the needs of
individual clients. Because of the complex nature of the product, B
must have sales representatives in any country where sales are made.
B has a sales representative, A, in boycotting country Y. A spends
two months of the year in Y, and the rest of the year in other
countries. B has a permanent sales office from which A operates
while in Y, and the sales office is stocked with brochures and other
sales materials.
    A is a bona fide resident of Y, because his presence in Y is
necessary to carry out B's legitimate business purposes; B maintains
a permanent office in Y; and B intends to continue doing business in
Y in the future.
    (xvi) A, a U.S. construction engineering company, is engaged by
B, a U.S. general contracting company, to provide services in
connection with B's contract to construct a hospital complex in
boycotting country Y. In order to perform those services, A's
engineers set up a temporary office in a trailer on the construction
site in Y. A's work is expected to be completed within six months.
    A's personnel in Y are bona fide residents of Y, because A's on-
site office is necessary to the performance of its services for B,
and because A's personnel are continuously there.
    (xvii) A, a U.S. company, sends one of its representatives to
boycotting country Y to explore new sales possibilities for its line
of transistor radios. After spending several weeks in Y, A's
representative rents a post office box in Y, to which all persons
interested in A's products are directed to make inquiry.
    A is not a bona fide resident of Y, because rental of a post
office box is not a sufficient presence in Y to constitute
residency.
    (xviii) A, a U.S. computer company, has a patent and trademark
registered in the United States. In order to obtain registration of
its patent and trademark in boycotting country Y, A is required to
furnish certain non-discriminatory boycott information.
    A may not furnish the information, because A is not a bona fide
resident of Y.

    (h) Activities exclusively within a foreign country.
    (1) Any United States person who is a bona fide resident of a
foreign country, including a boycotting country, may comply or agree to
comply with the laws of that country with respect to his activities
exclusively within that country. These activities include:
    (i) Entering into contracts which provide that local law applies or
governs, or that the parties will comply with such laws;
    (ii) Employing residents of the host country;
    (iii) Retaining local contractors to perform work within the host
country;
    (iv) Purchasing or selling goods or services from or to residents
of the host country; and
    (v) Furnishing information within the host country.
    (2) Activities exclusively within the country do not include
importing goods or services from outside the host country, and,
therefore, this part of the exception does not apply to compliance with
import laws in connection with importing goods or services.

Examples of Permissible Compliance With Local Law With Respect to
Activities Exclusively Within a Foreign Country

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which compliance with local law is
permissible. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.

Activities Exclusively Within a Foreign Country

    (i) U.S. construction company A, a bona fide resident of
boycotting country Y, has a contract to build a school complex in Y.
Pursuant to Y's boycott laws, the contract requires A to refuse to
purchase supplies from certain local merchants. While Y permits such
merchants to operate within Y, their freedom of action in Y is
constrained because of their relationship with boycotted country X.
    A may enter into the contract, because dealings with local
merchants are activities exclusively within Y.
    (ii) A, a banking subsidiary of U.S. bank B, is a bona fide
resident of boycotting country Y. From time to time, A purchases
office supplies from the United States.
    A's purchase of office supplies is not an activity exclusively
within Y, because it involves the import of goods from abroad.
    (iii) A, a branch of U.S. bank B, is a bona fide resident of
boycotting country Y. Under

[[Page 12884]]
Y's boycott laws, A is required to supply information about whether
A has any dealings with boycotted country X. A compiles and
furnishes the information within Y and does so of its own knowledge.
    A may comply with that requirement, because in compiling and
furnishing the information within Y, based on its own knowledge, A
is engaging in an activity exclusively within Y.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that A is required to supply
information about B's dealings with X. From its own knowledge and
without making any inquiry of B, A compiles and furnishes the
information.
    A may comply with that requirement, because in compiling and
furnishing the information within Y, based on its own knowledge, A
is engaging in an activity exclusively within Y.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that in making its responses, A asks B
to compile some of the information.
    A may not comply, because the gathering of the necessary
information takes place partially outside Y.
    (vi) U.S. company A has applied for a license to establish a
permanent manufacturing facility in boycotting country Y. Under Y's
boycott law, A must agree, as a condition of the license, that it
will not sell any of its output to blacklisted foreign firms.
    A may not comply, because the agreement would govern activities
of A which are not exclusively within Y.

Discrimination Against United States Persons

    (i) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide resident
of boycotting country Y. A manufactures air conditioners in its
plant in Y. Under Y's boycott laws, A must agree not to hire
nationals of boycotted country X.
    A may agree to the restriction and may abide by it with respect
to its recruitment of individuals within Y, because the recruitment
of such individuals is an activity exclusively within Y. However, A
cannot abide by this restriction with respect to its recruitment of
individuals outside Y, because this is not an activity exclusively
within Y.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that pursuant to Y's boycott laws, A
must agree not to hire anyone who is of a designated religion.
    A may not agree to this restriction, because the agreement calls
for discrimination against U.S. persons on the basis of religion. It
makes no difference whether the recruitment of the U.S. persons
occurs within or without Y.

(Note: The exception for compliance with local law does not apply to
boycott-based refusals to employ U.S. persons on the basis of race,
religion, sex, or national origin even if the activity is
exclusively within the boycotting country.)

    (i) Compliance with local import law.
    (1) Any United States person who is a bona fide resident of a
foreign country, including a boycotting country, may, in importing
goods, materials or components into that country, comply or agree to
comply with the import laws of that country, provided that:
    (i) The items are for his own use or for his use in performing
contractual services within that country; and
    (ii) In the normal course of business, the items are identifiable
as to their source or origin at the time of their entry into the
foreign country by:
    (a) Uniqueness of design or appearance; or
    (b) Trademark, trade name, or other identification normally on the
items themselves, including their packaging.
    (2) The factors that will be considered in determining whether a
United States person is a bona fide resident of a foreign country are
those set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. Bona fide residence
of a United States company's subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent
establishment in a foreign country does not confer such residence on
such United States company. Likewise, bona fide residence of a United
States company's employee in a foreign country does not confer such
residence on the entire company.
    (3) A United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign
country may take action under this exception through an agent outside
the country, but the agent must act at the direction of the resident
and not exercise his own discretion. Therefore, if a United States
person resident in a boycotting country takes action to comply with a
boycotting country's import law with respect to the importation of
qualified goods, he may direct his agent in the United States on the
action to be taken, but the United States agent himself may not
exercise any discretion.
    (4) For purposes of this exception, the test that governs whether
goods or components of goods are specifically identifiable is identical
to the test applied in paragraph (c) of this section on ``Compliance
With Unilateral Selection'' to determine whether they are identifiable
as to their source or origin in the normal course of business.
    (5) The availability of this exception for the import of goods
depends on whether the goods are intended for the United States
person's own use at the time they are imported. It does not depend upon
who has title to the goods at the time of importation into a foreign
country.
    (6) Goods are for the United States person's own use (including the
performance of contractual services within the foreign country) if:
    (i) They are to be consumed by the United States person;
    (ii) They are to remain in the United States person's possession
and to be used by that person;
    (iii) They are to be used by the United States person in performing
contractual services for another;
    (iv) They are to be further manufactured, incorporated into,
refined into, or reprocessed into another product to be manufactured
for another; or
    (v) They are to be incorporated into, or permanently affixed as a
functional part of, a project to be constructed for another.
    (7) Goods acquired to fill an order for such goods from another are
not for the United States person's own use. Goods procured for another
are not for one's own use, even if the furnishing of procurement
services is the business in which the United States person is
customarily engaged. Nor are goods obtained for simple resale acquired
for one's own use, even if the United States person is engaged in the
retail business. Likewise, goods obtained for inclusion in a turnkey
project are not for one's own use if they are not customarily
incorporated into, or do not customarily become permanently affixed as
a functional part of the project.
    (8) This part of the local law exception does not apply to the
import of services, even when the United States person importing such
services is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country and is
importing them for his own use. In addition, this exception is
available for a United States person who is a bona fide resident of a
foreign country only when the individual or entity actually present
within that country takes action through the exercise of his own
discretion.
    (9) Use of this exception will be monitored and continually
reviewed to determine whether its continued availability is consistent
with the national interest. Its availability may be limited or
withdrawn as appropriate. In reviewing the continued availability of
this exception, the effect that the inability to comply with local
import laws would have on the economic and other relations of the
United States with boycotting countries will be considered.
    (10) A United States person who is a bona fide resident of a
foreign country may comply or agree to comply with the host country's
import laws even if he knows or has reason to know that particular laws
are boycott-related. However, no United States person may comply or
agree to comply with any host country law which would require him to
discriminate against any United States person on the basis of race,
religion, sex, or national origin, or to supply information about any
United States person's race, religion, sex, or national origin.

Examples of Permissible Compliance With Local Import Law

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining the circumstances in which compliance with local import
law is permissible. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.

Compliance by a Bona Fide Resident

    (i) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide resident
of boycotting country Y and is engaged in oil drilling operations in
Y. In acquiring certain large, specifically identifiable products
for carrying out its operations in Y, A chooses only from non-
blacklisted firms because Y's import laws prohibit the importation
of goods from blacklisted firms. However, with respect to smaller
items, B makes the selection on behalf of A and sends them to A in
Y.
    A may choose from non-blacklisted firms, because it is a U.S.
person who is a bona fide resident in Y. However, because B is not
resident in Y, B cannot make boycott-based selections to conform
with Y's import laws prohibiting the importation of goods from
blacklisted firms.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that after making its choices on the
larger items, A directs B to carry out its instructions by entering
into appropriate contracts and making necessary shipping
arrangements.
    B may carry out A's instructions provided that A, a bona fide
resident of Y, has in fact made the choice and B is exercising no
discretion, but is acting only as A's agent.
    (Note: Such transactions between related companies will be
scrutinized carefully. A must in fact exercise the discretion and
make the selections. If the discretion is exercised by B, B would be
in violation of this part.)

    (iii) U.S. construction company A has a contract to build a
school in boycotting country Y. A's employees set up operations in Y
for purposes of commencing construction. A's employees in Y advise
A's headquarters in the United States that Y's import laws prohibit
importation of goods manufactured by blacklisted firms. A's
headquarters then issues invitations to bid only to non-blacklisted
firms for certain specifically identifiable goods.
    A's headquarters' choice of non-blacklisted suppliers is not a
choice made by a U.S. person who is a bona fide resident of Y,
because the discretion in issuing the bids was exercised in the
United States, not in Y.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that A's employees in Y actually make
the decision regarding to whom the bids should be issued.
    The choices made by A's employees are choices made by U.S.
persons who are bona fide residents of Y, because the discretion in
choosing was exercised solely in Y.

(Note: Choices purportedly made by employees of U.S. companies who
are resident in boycotting countries will be carefully scrutinized
to ensure that the discretion was exercised entirely in the
boycotting country.)

Specifically Identifiable Goods

    The test and examples as to what constitutes specifically
identifiable goods are identical to those applicable under paragraph
(d) of this section on ``Compliance With Unilateral Selection.''

Imports for U.S. Person's Own Use

    (i) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide resident
of boycotting country Y. A plans to import computer operated machine
tools to be installed in its automobile plant in boycotting country
Y. The computers are mounted on a separate bracket on the side of
the equipment and are readily identifiable by brand name. A orders
the tools from U.S. supplier C and specifies that C must incorporate
computers manufactured by D, a non-blacklisted company. A would have
chosen computers manufactured by E, except that E is blacklisted,
and Y's import laws prohibit the importation of goods manufactured
by blacklisted firms.
    A may refuse to purchase E's computers, because A is importing
the computers for its own use in its manufacturing operations in Y.
    (ii) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide resident
of boycotting country Y. To meet the needs of its employees in Y, A
imports certain specifically identifiable commissary items for sale,
such as cosmetics; and canteen items, such as candy. In selecting
such items for importation into Y, A chooses items made only by non-
blacklisted firms, because Y's import laws prohibit importation of
goods from blacklisted firms.
    A may import these items only from non-blacklisted firms,
because the importation of goods for consumption by A's employees is
an importation for A's own use.
    (iii) A, a U.S. construction company which is a bona fide
resident of boycotting country Y, has a contract to build a hospital
complex for the Ministry of Health in Y. Under the contract, A will
be general manager of the project with discretion to choose all
subcontractors and suppliers. The complex is to be built on a
turnkey basis, with A retaining title to the property and bearing
all financial risk until the complex is conveyed to Y. In choosing
specifically identifiable goods for import, such as central air
conditioning units and plate glass, A excludes blacklisted suppliers
in order to comply with Y's import laws. These goods are customarily
incorporated into, or permanently affixed as a functional part of,
the project.
    A may refuse to deal with blacklisted suppliers of specifically
identifiable goods, because importation of goods by a general
contractor to be incorporated into a construction project in Y is an
importation of goods for A's own use.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that, in addition, in choosing U.S.
architects and engineers to work on the project, A excludes
blacklisted firms, because Y's import laws prohibit the use of
services rendered by blacklisted persons.
    A may not refuse to deal with blacklisted architectural or
engineering firms, because this exception does not apply to the
import of services. It is irrelevant that, at some stage, the
architectural or engineering drawings or plans may be brought to the
site in Y. This factor is insufficient to transform such services
into ``goods'' for purposes of this exception.
    (v) Same as (iii), except that the project is to be completed on
a ``cost plus'' basis, with Y making progress payments to A at
various stages of completion.
    A may refuse to deal with blacklisted suppliers of specifically
identifiable goods, because the importation of goods by A to be
incorporated in a project A is under contract to complete is an
importation of goods for its own use. The terms of payment are
irrelevant.
    (vi) A, a U.S. construction company which is a bona fide
resident of boycotting country Y, has a contract for the
construction of an office building in Y on a turnkey basis. In
choosing goods to be used or included in the office complex, A
orders wallboard, office partitions, and lighting fixtures from non-
blacklisted manufacturers. A likewise orders desks, office chairs,
typewriters, and office supplies from non-blacklisted manufacturers.
    Because they are customarily incorporated into or permanently
affixed as a functional part of an office building, the wallboard,
office partitions, and lighting fixtures are for A's own use, and A
may select non-blacklisted suppliers of these goods in order to
comply with Y's import laws. Because they are not customarily
incorporated into or permanently affixed to the project, the desks,
office chairs, typewriters, and office supplies are not for A's own
use, and A may not make boycott-based selections of the suppliers of
these goods.
    (vii) A, a U.S. company engaged in the business of selling
automobiles, is a bona fide resident of boycotting country Y. In
ordering automobiles from time to time for purposes of stocking its
inventory, A purchases from U.S. manufacturer B, but not U.S.
manufacturer C, because C is blacklisted. Retail sales are
subsequently made from this inventory.
    A's import of automobiles from B is not an import for A's own
use, because the importation of items for general inventory in a
retail sales operation is not an importation for one's own use.
    (viii) A, a U.S. company engaged in the manufacture of
pharmaceutical products, is a bona fide resident of boycotting
country Y. In importing chemicals for incorporation into the
pharmaceutical products, A purchases from U.S. supplier B, but not
U.S. supplier C, because C is blacklisted.
    A may import chemicals from B rather than C, because the
importation of specifically identifiable items for incorporation
into another product is an importation for one's own use.
    (ix) A, a U.S. management company which is a bona fide resident
of boycotting country Y, has a contract with the Ministry of
Education in Y to purchase supplies for Y's school system. From time
to time, A purchases goods from abroad for delivery to various
schools in Y.
    A's purchase of goods for Y's school system does not constitute
an importation of goods for A's own use, because A is acting as a
procurement agent for another. A, therefore, cannot make boycott-
based selections of suppliers of such school supplies.

[[Page 12886]]

    (x) A, a U.S. company which is a bona fide resident of
boycotting country Y, has a contract to make purchases for Y in
connection with a construction project in Y. A is not engaged in the
construction of, or in any other activity in connection with, the
project. A's role is merely to purchase goods for Y and arrange for
their delivery to Y.
    A is not purchasing goods for its own use, because A is acting
as a procurement agent for Y. A, therefore, cannot make boycott
selections of suppliers of such goods.
    (xi) A, a U.S. company which is a bona fide resident of
boycotting country Y, imports specifically identifiable goods into Y
for exhibit by A at a trade fair in Y. In selecting goods for
exhibit, A excludes items made by blacklisted firms.
    A's import of goods for its exhibit at a trade fair constitutes
an import for A's own use. However, A may not sell in Y those goods
it imported for exhibit.

For Use Within Boycotting Country

    A is a bona fide resident of boycotting countries Y and Z. In
compliance with Y's boycott laws, A chooses specifically
identifiable goods for its oil drilling operations in Y and Z by
excluding blacklisted suppliers. The goods are first imported into
Y. Those purchased for A's use in Z are then transshipped to Z.
    In selecting those goods for importation into Y, A is making an
import selection for its own use, even though A may use some of the
imported goods in Z. Further, the subsequent shipment from Y to Z of
those goods purchased for use in Z is an import into Z for A's own
use.

Sec. 760.4  Evasion.

    (a) No United States person may engage in any transaction or take
any other action, either independently or through any other person,
with intent to evade the provisions of this part. Nor may any United
States person assist another United States person to violate or evade
the provisions of this part.
    (b) The exceptions set forth in Sec. 760.3(a) through (g) of this
part do not permit activities or agreements (express or implied by a
course of conduct, including a pattern of responses) which are
otherwise prohibited by this part and which are not within the intent
of such exceptions. However, activities within the coverage and intent
of the exceptions set forth in this part do not constitute evasion
regardless of how often such exceptions are utilized.
    (c) Use of any artifice, device or scheme which is intended to
place a person at a commercial disadvantage or impose on him special
burdens because he is blacklisted or otherwise restricted for boycott
reasons from having a business relationship with or in a boycotting
country will be regarded as evasion for purposes of this part.
    (d) Unless permitted under one of the exceptions, use of risk of
loss provisions that expressly impose a financial risk on another
because of the import laws of a boycotting country may constitute
evasion. If they are introduced after January 21, 1978, their use will
be presumed to constitute evasion. This presumption may be rebutted by
a showing that such a provision is in customary usage without
distinction between boycotting and non-boycotting countries and that
there is a legitimate non-boycott reason for its use. On the other
hand, use of such a provision by a United States person subsequent to
January 21, 1978 is presumed not to constitute evasion if the provision
had been customarily used by that person prior to January 21, 1978.
    (e) Use of dummy corporations or other devices to mask prohibited
activity will also be regarded as evasion. Similarly, it is evasion
under this part to divert specific boycotting country orders from a
United States parent to a foreign subsidiary for purposes of complying
with prohibited boycott requirements. However, alteration of a person's
structure or method of doing business will not constitute evasion so
long as the alteration is based on legitimate business considerations
and is not undertaken solely to avoid the application of the
prohibitions of this part. The facts and circumstances of an
arrangement or transaction will be carefully scrutinized to see whether
appearances conform to reality.

Examples

    The following examples are intended to give guidance to persons
in determining circumstances in which this section will apply. They
are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. insurance company, receives a request from
boycotting country Y asking whether it does business in boycotted
country X. Because furnishing such information is prohibited, A
declines to answer and as a result is placed on Y's blacklist. The
following year, A's annual report contains new information about A's
worldwide operations, including a list of all countries in which A
does business. A then mails a copy of its annual report, which has
never before contained such information, to officials of the
government of country Y.
    Absent some business justification unrelated to the boycott for
changing the annual report in this fashion, A's action constitutes
evasion of this part.
    (ii) A, a U.S. construction firm resident in boycotting country
Y, orders lumber from U.S. company B. A unilaterally selects B in
part because U.S. lumber producer C is blacklisted by Y and C's
products are therefore not importable. In placing its order with B,
A requests that B stamp its name or logo on the lumber so that A
``can be certain that it is, in fact, receiving B's products.'' B
does not normally so stamp its lumber, and A's purpose in making the
request is to appear to fit within the unilateral selection
exception of this part.
    Absent additional facts justifying A's action, A's action
constitutes evasion of this part.
    (iii) A, a U.S. company, has been selling sewing machines to
boycotting country Y for a number of years and routinely supplying
negative certificates of origin. A is aware that the furnishing of
negative certificates of origin will be prohibited after June 21,
1978 and, therefore, arranges to have all future shipments run
through a foreign corporation in a third country which will affix
the necessary certification before forwarding the machines on to Y.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is a
device to mask prohibited activity carried out on A's behalf.
    (iv) A, a U.S. company, has been selling hand calculators to
boycotting country Y for a number of years and routinely supplies
negative certificates of origin. A is aware that the furnishing of
such negative certificates will be prohibited after June 21, 1978. A
thereupon ceases all direct sales to Y, and instead arranges to make
all future sales to distributor B in a third country. A knows B will
step in and make the sales to Y which A would otherwise have made
directly. B will make the necessary negative certifications. A's
warranty, which it will continue to honor, runs to the purchaser in
Y.
    A's action constitutes evasion, because the diverting of orders
to B is a device to mask prohibited activity carried out on A's
behalf.
    (v) A, a U.S. company, is negotiating a long-term contract with
boycotting country Y to meet all Y's medical supply needs. Y informs
A that before such a contract can be concluded, A must complete Y's
boycott questionnaire. A knows that it is prohibited from answering
the questionnaire so it arranges for a local agent in Y to supply
the necessary information.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is a
device to mask prohibited activity carried out on A's behalf.
    (vi) A, a U.S. contractor which has not previously dealt with
boycotting country Y, is awarded a construction contract by Y.
Because it is customary in the construction industry for a
contractor to establish an on-site facility for the duration of the
project, A establishes such an office, which satisfies the
requirements for bona fide residency. Thereafter, A's office in Y
takes a number of actions permitted under the compliance with local
law exception.
    A's actions do not constitute evasion, because A's facility in Y
was established for legitimate business reasons.
    (vii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is
located in non-boycotting country M. A and B both make machine tools
for sale in their respective marketing regions. B's marketing region
includes boycotting country Y. After assessing the requirements of
this part, B decides that it can no longer make machines for sale in
Y. Instead, A decides to expand its facilities in M in order to
service the Y market.
    The actions of A and B do not constitute evasion, because there
is a legitimate business reason for their actions. It is irrelevant
that the effect may be to place sales which would otherwise have
been subject to this part beyond the reach of this part.

[[Page 12887]]

    (viii) A, a U.S. manufacturer, from time to time receives
purchase orders from boycotting country Y which A fills from its
plant in the United States. A knows that it is about to receive an
order from Y which contains a request for a certification which A is
prohibited from furnishing under this part. In order to permit the
certification to be made, A diverts the purchase order to its
foreign subsidiary.
    A's diversion of the purchase order constitutes evasion of this
part, because it is a device to mask prohibited activity carried out
on A's behalf.
    (ix) A, a U.S. company, is engaged in assembling drilling rigs
for shipment to boycotting country Y. Because of potential
difficulties in securing entry into Y of materials supplied by
blacklisted firms, A insists that blacklisted firms take a 15
percent discount on all materials which they supply to A. As a
result, no blacklisted firms are willing to transact with A.
    A's insistence on the discount for materials supplied by
blacklisted firms constitutes evasion of this part, because it is a
device or scheme which is intended to place a special burden on
blacklisted firms because of Y's boycott.
    (x) Same as (ix), except that shortly after the effective date
of this part, A insists that its suppliers sign contracts which
provide that even after title passes from the supplier to A, the
supplier will bear the risk of loss and indemnify A if goods which
the supplier has furnished are denied entry into Y for boycott
reasons.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is a
device or scheme which is intended to place a special burden on
blacklisted persons because of Y's boycott.
    (xi) Same as (x), except that A customarily insisted on such an
arrangement with its supplier prior to the effective date of this
part.
    A's action is presumed not to constitute evasion, because use of
this contractual arrangement was customary for A prior to the
effective date of this part.
    (xii) A, a U.S. company, has a contract to supply automobile
sub-assembly units to boycotting country Y. Shortly after the
effective date of this part, A insists that its suppliers sign
contracts which provide that even after title passes to A, the
supplier will bear the risk of loss and indemnify A if goods which
the supplier has furnished are denied entry into boycotting country
Y for whatever reason.
    A's insistence on this arrangement is presumed to constitute
evasion, because it is a device which is intended to place a special
burden on blacklisted firms because of Y's boycott. The presumption
may be rebutted by competent evidence showing that use of such an
arrangement is customary without regard to the boycotting or non-
boycotting character of the country to which it relates and that
there is a legitimate non-boycott business reason for its use.
    (xiii) Same as (vii), except that A requires that all suppliers
make in-country delivery.
    A's action does not constitute evasion, because it is an
ordinary commercial practice to require in-country delivery of
goods.
    (xiv) Same as (xii), except that A requires that title remain
with the supplier until delivery in Y has been made.
    A's action does not constitute evasion, because it is ordinary
commercial practice to require that title remain with the supplier
until delivery has been made. This example is distinguishable from
example (xii), because in example (xii) A had insisted on an
extraordinary arrangement designed to require that the risk of loss
remain with the supplier even after title had passed to A.
    (xv) U.S. bank A is contacted by U.S. company B to finance B's
transaction with boycotting country Y. Payment will be effected
through a letter of credit in favor of B at its U.S. address. A
knows that the letter of credit will contain restrictive boycott
conditions which would bar its implementation by A if the
beneficiary were a U.S. person. A suggests to B that the beneficiary
should be changed to C, a shell corporation in non-boycotting
country M. The beneficiary is changed accordingly.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because the
arrangement is a device to mask prohibited activity on A's part.
    (xvi) Same as (xv), except that U.S. company B, the beneficiary
of the letter of credit, arranges to change the beneficiary to B's
foreign subsidiary so that A can implement the letter of credit. A
knows that this has been done.
    A's implementation of the letter of credit in the face of its
knowledge of B's action constitutes evasion of this part, because
its action is part of a device to mask prohibited activity on A's
part.
    (xvii) U.S. bank A, located in the United States, is contacted
by foreign company B to finance B's transaction with boycotting
country Y. B is a controlled subsidiary of a U.S. company. The
transaction which is to be financed with a letter of credit payable
to B at its foreign address, requires B to certify that none of its
board members are of a particular religious faith. Since B cannot
legally furnish the certificate, it asks A to convey the necessary
information to Y through A's bank branch in Y. Such information
would be furnished wholly outside the letter of credit transaction.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is
undertaken to assist B's violation of this part.
    (xviii) U.S. bank A is asked by foreign corporation B to
implement a letter of credit in favor of B so that B might perform
under its long-term contract with boycotting country Y. Under the
terms of the letter of credit, B is required to certify that none of
its suppliers is blacklisted. A knows that it cannot implement a
letter of credit with this condition, so it tells B to negotiate the
elimination of this requirement from the letter of credit and
instead supply the certification to Y directly.
    A's suggestion to B that it provide the negative certification
to Y directly constitutes evasion of this part, because A is taking
an action through another person to mask prohibited activity on A's
part.

Sec. 760.5  Reporting requirements.

    (a) Scope of reporting requirements.
    (1) A United States person who receives a request to take any
action which has the effect of furthering or supporting a restrictive
trade practice or boycott fostered or imposed by a foreign country
against a country friendly to the United States or against any United
States person must report such request to the Department of Commerce in
accordance with the requirements of this section. Such a request may be
either written or oral and may include a request to furnish information
or enter into or implement an agreement. It may also include a
solicitation, directive, legend or instruction that asks for
information or that asks that a United States person take or refrain
from taking a particular action. Such a request shall be reported
regardless of whether the action requested is prohibited or permissible
under this part, except as otherwise provided by this section.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a request received by a United
States person is reportable if he knows or has reason to know that the
purpose of the request is to enforce, implement, or otherwise further,
support, or secure compliance with an unsanctioned foreign boycott or
restrictive trade practice.
    (i) A request received by a United States person located in the
United States is reportable if it is received in connection with a
transaction or activity in the interstate or foreign commerce of the
United States, as determined under Sec. 760.1(d)(1) through (5) and
(18) of this part.
    (ii) A request received by a United States person located outside
the United States (that is, a foreign subsidiary, partnership,
affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment
which is controlled in fact by any domestic concern, as determined
under Sec. 760.1(c) of this part) is reportable if it is received in
connection with a transaction or activity in the interstate or foreign
commerce of the United States, as determined under Sec. 760.1(d)(6)
through (17) and (19) of this part.
    (iii) A request such as a boycott questionnaire, unrelated to a
particular transaction or activity, received by any United States
person is reportable when such person has or anticipates a business
relationship with or in a boycotting country involving the sale,
purchase or transfer of goods or services (including information) in
the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, as determined
under Sec. 760.1(d) of this part.
    (3) These reporting requirements apply to all United States
persons. They apply whether the United States person receiving the
request is an exporter, bank or other financial institution,

[[Page 12888]]
insurer, freight forwarder, manufacturer, or any other United States
person subject to this part.
    (4) The acquisition of information about a boycotting country's
boycott requirements through the receipt or review of books, pamphlets,
legal texts, exporters' guidebooks and other similar publications does
not constitute receipt of a reportable request for purposes of this
section. In addition, a United States person who receives an
unsolicited invitation to bid, or similar proposal, containing a
boycott request has not received a reportable request for purposes of
this section where he does not respond to the invitation to bid or
other proposal.
    (5) Because of the use of certain terms for boycott and non-boycott
purposes; because of Congressional mandates to provide clear and
precise guidelines in areas of inherent uncertainty; and because of the
Department's commitment to minimize paperwork and reduce the cost of
reporting where it will not impair the Department's ability to continue
to monitor foreign boycotts, the following specific requests are not
reportable:
    (i) A request to refrain from shipping goods on a carrier which
flies the flag of a particular country or which is owned, chartered,
leased or operated by a particular country or by nationals or residents
of a particular country, or a request to certify to that effect.
    (ii) A request to ship goods via a prescribed route, or a request
to refrain from shipping goods via a proscribed route, or a request to
certify to either effect.
    (iii) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification
regarding the country of origin of goods.
    (iv) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification
regarding the name of the supplier or manufacturer of the goods shipped
or the name of the provider of services.
    (v) A request to comply with the laws of another country except
where the request expressly requires compliance with that country's
boycott laws.
    (vi) A request to an individual to supply information about himself
or a member of his family for immigration, passport, visa, or
employment purposes.
    (vii) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification
indicating the destination of exports or confirming or otherwise
indicating that such cargo will be unloaded or discharged at a
particular destination.
    (viii) A request to supply a certificate by the owner, master,
charterer, or any employee thereof, that a vessel, aircraft, truck or
any other mode of transportation is eligible, otherwise eligible,
permitted, or allowed to enter, or not restricted from entering, a
particular port, country, or group of countries pursuant to the laws,
rules, or regulations of that port, country, or group of countries.
    (ix) A request to supply a certificate from an insurance company
stating that the insurance company has a duly authorized agent or
representative within a boycotting country and/or the name and address
of such agent.
    (x) A request to comply with a term or condition of a transaction
that provides that the vendor bear the risk of loss and indemnify the
purchaser if the vendor's goods are denied entry into a country for any
reason (``risk of loss clause'') if such clause was in use by the
purchaser prior to January 18, 1978.
    (6) No United States person may engage in any transaction or take
any other action, either independently or through any other person,
with intent to evade the provisions of this part.
    (7) From time to time the Department will survey domestic concerns
for purposes of determining the worldwide scope of boycott requests
received by their controlled foreign subsidiaries and affiliates with
respect to their activities outside United States commerce. This
pertains to requests which would be reportable under this section but
for the fact that the activities to which the requests relate are
outside United States commerce. The information requested will include
the number and nature of non-reportable boycott requests received, the
action(s) requested, the actions(s) taken in response and the countries
in which the requests originate. The results of such surveys, including
the names of those surveyed, will be made public.
    (b) Manner of reporting. (1) Each reportable request must be
reported. However, if more than one document (such as an invitation to
bid, purchase order, or letter of credit) containing the same boycott
request is received as part of the same transaction, only the first
such request need be reported. Individual shipments against the same
purchase order or letter of credit are to be treated as part of the
same transaction. Each different boycott request associated with a
given transaction must be reported, regardless of how or when the
request is received.
    (2) Each United States person actually receiving a reportable
request must report that request. However, such person may designate
someone else to report on his behalf. For example, a United States
company, if authorized, may report on behalf of its controlled foreign
subsidiary or affiliates; a freight forwarder, if authorized, may
report on behalf of the exporter; and a bank, if authorized, may report
on behalf of the beneficiary of a letter of credit. If a person
designated to report a request received by another receives an
identical request directed to him in connection with the same
transaction, he may file one report on behalf of himself and the other
person.
    (3) Where a person is designated to report on behalf of another,
the person receiving the request remains liable for any failure to
report or for any representations made on his behalf. Further, anyone
reporting on behalf of another is not relieved of his own
responsibility for reporting any boycott request which he receives,
even if it is an identical request in connection with the same
transaction.
    (4) Reports must be submitted in duplicate to: Report Processing
Staff, Office of Antiboycott Compliance, U.S. Department of Commerce,
Room 6099C, Washington, D.C. 20230. Each submission must be made in
accordance with the following requirements:
    (i) Where the person receiving the request is a United States
person located in the United States, each report of requests received
through June 30, 1979, must be postmarked by the last day of the month
following the month in which the request was received. Thereafter, each
submission must be postmarked by the last day of the month following
the calendar quarter in which the request was received (e.g., April 30
for the quarter consisting of January, February, and March).
    (ii) Where the person receiving the request is a United States
person located outside the United States, each report of requests
received through June 30, 1979, must be postmarked by the last day of
the second month following the month in which the request was received.
Thereafter, each submission must be postmarked by the last day of the
second month following the calendar quarter in which the request was
received (e.g., May 31 for the quarter consisting of January, February,
and March).
    (5) At the reporting person's option, reports may be submitted on
either a single transaction form (Form BXA-621P, Report of Restrictive
Trade Practice or Boycott Request Single Transaction (revised 10-89))
or on a multiple transaction form (Form BXA-6051P, Report of Request
for Restrictive Trade Practice or Boycott Multiple Transactions
(revised 10-89)). Use of the multiple transaction form permits the
reporting person to provide on one form all required information
relating to as many as 75 reportable requests

[[Page 12889]]
received within any single reporting period.
    (6) Reports, whether submitted on the single transaction form or on
the multiple transaction form, must contain entries for every
applicable item on the form, including whether the reporting person
intends to take or has taken the action requested. If the reporting
person has not decided what action he will take by the time the report
is required to be filed, he must later report the action he decides to
take within 10 business days after deciding. In addition, anyone filing
a report on behalf of another must so indicate and identify that other
person.
    (7) Each report of a boycott request must be accompanied by two
copies of the relevant page(s) of any document(s) in which the request
appears. Reports may also be accompanied by any additional information
relating to the request as the reporting person desires to provide
concerning his response to the request.
    (8) Records containing information relating to a reportable boycott
request, including a copy of any document(s) in which the request
appears, must be maintained by the recipient for a five-year period
after receipt of the request. The Department may require that these
materials be submitted to it or that it have access to them at any time
within that period. (See part 762 of the EAR for additional
recordkeeping requirements.)
    (c) Disclosure of information. (1) Reports of requests received on
or after October 7, 1976, as well as any accompanying documents filed
with the reports, have been and will continue to be made available for
public inspection and copying, except for certain proprietary
information. With respect to reports of requests received on or after
August 1, 1978, if the person making the report certifies that a United
States person to whom the report relates would be placed at a
competitive disadvantage because of the disclosure of information
regarding the quantity, description, or value of any articles,
materials, and supplies, including related technical data and other
information, whether contained in a report or in any accompanying
document(s), such information will not be publicly disclosed except
upon failure by the reporting entity to edit the public inspection copy
of the accompanying document(s) as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this
section, unless the Secretary of Commerce determines that the
disclosure would not place the United States person involved at a
competitive disadvantage or that it would be contrary to the national
interest to withhold the information. In the event the Secretary of
Commerce considers making such a determination concerning competitive
disadvantage, appropriate notice and an opportunity for comment will be
given before any such proprietary information is publicly disclosed. In
no event will requests of reporting persons to withhold any information
contained in the report other than that specified in this paragraph be
honored.
    (2) Because a copy of any document(s) accompanying the report will
be made available for public inspection and copying, one copy must be
submitted intact and another copy must be edited by the reporting
entity to delete the same information which it certified in the report
would place a United States person at a competitive disadvantage if
disclosed. In addition, the reporting entity may delete from this copy
information that is considered confidential and that is not required to
be contained in the report (e.g., information related to foreign
consignee). This copy should be conspicuously marked with the legend
``Public Inspection Copy.'' With respect to documents accompanying
reports received by the Department on or after July 1, 1979, the public
inspection copy will be made available as submitted whether or not it
has been appropriately edited by the reporting entity as provided by
this paragraph.
    (3) Reports and accompanying documents which are available to the
public for inspection and copying are located in the BXA Freedom of
Information Records Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of
Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20230. Requests to inspect such documents should be addressed to that
facility.
    (4) The Secretary of Commerce will periodically transmit summaries
of the information contained in the reports to the Secretary of State
for such action as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the
Secretary of Commerce, may deem appropriate for carrying out the
policies in section 8(b)(2) of the Export Administration Act of 1979.

Examples

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in
determining what is reportable. They are illustrative, not
comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is shipping goods to boycotting
country Y and is asked by Y to certify that it is not blacklisted by
Y's boycott office.
    The request to A is reportable, because it is a request to A to
comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (ii) A, a U.S. manufacturing company, receives an order for
tractors from boycotting country Y. Y's order specifies that the
tires on the tractors be made by B, another U.S. company. A believes
Y has specified B as the tire supplier because otherwise A would
have used tires made by C, a blacklisted company, and Y will not
take shipment of tractors containing tires made by blacklisted
companies.
    A must report Y's request for tires made by B, because A has
reason to know that B was chosen for boycott reasons.
    (iii) Same as (ii), except A knows that Y's request has nothing
to do with the boycott but simply reflects Y's preference for tires
made by B.
    Y's request is not reportable, because it is unrelated to Y's
boycott.
    (iv) Same as (ii), except A neither knows nor has reason to know
why Y has chosen B.
    Y's request is not reportable, because A neither knows nor has
reason to know that Y's request is based on Y's boycott.
    (v) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a
resident of boycotting country Y. A is a general contractor. After
being supplied by A with a list of competent subcontractors, A's
customer instructs A to use subcontractor C on the project. A
believes that C was chosen because, among other things, the other
listed subcontractors are blacklisted.
    The instruction to A by its customer that C be used on the
project is reportable, because it is a request to comply with Y's
boycott requirements.
    (vi) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is
located in non-boycotting country P. A receives an order for washing
machines from boycotting country Y. Y instructs A that a negative
certificate of origin must accompany the shipment. The washing
machines are made wholly in P, without U.S. components.
    Y's instruction to A regarding the negative certificate of
origin is not reportable, because the transaction to which it
relates is not in U.S. commerce.
    (vii) Same as (vi), except that A obtains components from the
United States for the purpose of filling the order from Y. Y's
instruction to A regarding the negative certificate of origin is
reportable, because the transaction to which it relates is in U.S.
commerce.
    (viii) A, a U.S. construction company, receives in the mail an
unsolicited invitation to bid on a construction project in
boycotting country Y. The invitation to bid requires those who
respond to certify that they do not have any plants or branch
offices in boycotted country X. A does not respond.
    A's receipt of the unsolicited invitation to bid is not
reportable, because the request does not relate to any present or
anticipated business of A with or in Y.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that A receives a boycott
questionnaire from a central boycott office. A does not do business
in any of the boycotting countries involved, and does not anticipate
doing any business in those countries. A does not respond.
    A's receipt of the boycott questionnaire is not reportable,
because it does not relate to any present or anticipated business by
A with or in a boycotting country.
    (x) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is seeking markets in which to
expand its exports. A

[[Page 12890]]
sends a representative to boycotting country Y to explore Y's
potential as a market for A's products. A's representative discusses
its products but does not enter into any contracts on that trip. A
does, however, hope that sales will materialize in the future.
Subsequently, A receives a boycott questionnaire from Y.
    A's receipt of the boycott questionnaire is reportable, because
the request relates to A's anticipated business with or in a
boycotting country. For purposes of determining whether a report is
required, it makes no difference whether A responds to the
questionnaire, and it makes no difference that actual sales
contracts are not in existence or do not materialize.
    (xi) Same as (x), except that A's representative enters into a
contract to sell A's products to a buyer in boycotting country Y.
Subsequently, A receives a boycott questionnaire from Y.
    A's receipt of the boycott questionnaire is reportable, because
it relates to A's present business with or in a boycotting country.
For purposes of determining whether a report is required, it makes
no difference whether A responds to the questionnaire.
    (xii) A, a U.S. freight forwarder, purchases an exporter's
guidebook which includes the import requirements of boycotting
country Y. The guidebook contains descriptions of actions which U.S.
exporters must take in order to make delivery of goods to Y.
    A's acquisition of the guidebook is not reportable, because he
has not received a request from anyone.
    (xiii) A, a U.S. freight forwarder, is arranging for the
shipment of goods to boycotting country Y at the request of B, a
U.S. exporter. B asks A to assume responsibility to assure that the
documentation accompanying the shipment is in compliance with Y's
import requirements. A examines an exporters' guidebook, determines
that Y's import regulations require a certification that the insurer
of the goods is not blacklisted and asks U.S. insurer C for such a
certification.
    B's request to A is reportable by A, because it constitutes a
request to comply with Y's boycott as of the time A takes action to
comply with Y's boycott requirements in response to the request. A's
request to C is reportable by C.
    (xiv) A, a U.S. freight forwarder, is arranging for the shipment
of U.S. goods to boycotting country Y. The manufacturer supplies A
with all the necessary documentation to accompany the shipment.
Among the documents supplied by the manufacturer is his certificate
that he himself is not blacklisted. A transmits the documentation
supplied by the manufacturer.
    A's action in merely transmitting documents received from the
manufacturer is not reportable, because A has received no request to
comply with Y's boycott.
    (xv) Same as (xiv), except that A is asked by U.S. exporter B to
assume the responsibility to assure that the necessary documentation
accompanies the shipment whatever that documentation might be. B
forwards to A a letter of credit which requires that a negative
certificate of origin accompany the bill of lading. A supplies a
positive certificate of origin.
    Both A and B must report receipt of the letter of credit,
because it contains a request to both of them to comply with Y's
boycott.
    (xvi) Same as (xiv), except that the manufacturer fails to
supply a required negative certificate of origin, and A is
subsequently asked by a consular official of Y to see to it that the
certificate is supplied. A supplies a positive certificate of
origin.
    The consular official's request to A is reportable by A, because
A was asked to comply with Y's boycott requirements by supplying the
negative certificate of origin.
    (xvii) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is shipping goods to boycotting
country Y. Arrangements have been made for freight forwarder B to
handle the shipment and secure all necessary shipping
certifications. B notes that the letter of credit requires that the
manufacturer supply a negative certificate of origin and B asks A to
do so. A supplies a positive certificate of origin.
    B's request to A is reportable by A, because A is asked to
comply with Y's boycott requirements by providing the negative
certificate.
    (xviii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is
a resident of boycotting country Y. A is engaged in oil exploration
and drilling operations in Y. In placing orders for drilling
equipment to be shipped from the United States, A, in compliance
with Y's laws, selects only those suppliers who are not blacklisted.
    A's action in choosing non-blacklisted suppliers is not
reportable, because A has not received a request to comply with Y's
boycott in making these selections.
    (xix) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is
seeking permission to do business in boycotting country Y. Before
being granted such permission, A is asked to sign an agreement to
comply with Y's boycott laws.
    The request to A is reportable, because it is a request that
expressly requires compliance with Y's boycott law and is received
in connection with A's anticipated business in Y.
    (xx) A, a U.S. bank, is asked by a firm in boycotting country Y
to confirm a letter of credit in favor of B, a U.S. company. The
letter of credit calls for a certificate from B that the goods to be
supplied are not produced by a firm blacklisted by Y. A informs B of
the letter of credit, including its certification condition, and
sends B a copy.
    B must report the certification request contained in the letter
of credit, and A must report the request to confirm the letter of
credit containing the boycott condition, because both are being
asked to comply with Y's boycott.
    (xxi) Same as (xx), except that the letter of credit calls for a
certificate from the beneficiary that the goods will not be shipped
on a vessel that will call at a port in boycotted country X before
making delivery in Y.
    The request is not reportable, because it is a request of a type
deemed by this section to be in common use for non-boycott purposes.
    (xxii) A, a U.S. company, receives a letter of credit from
boycotting country Y stating that on no condition may a bank
blacklisted by Y be permitted to negotiate the credit.
    A's receipt of the letter of credit is reportable, because it
contains a request to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (xxiii) A, a U.S. bank, receives a demand draft from B, a U.S.
company, in connection with B's shipment of goods to boycotting
country Y. The draft contains a directive that it is valid in all
countries except boycotted country X.
    A's receipt of the demand draft is reportable, because it
contains a request to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (xxiv) A, a U.S. exporter, receives an order from boycotting
country Y. On the order is a legend that A's goods, invoices, and
packaging must not bear a six-pointed star or other symbol of
boycotted country X.
    A's receipt of the order is reportable, because it contains a
request to comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (xxv) Same as (xxiv), except the order contains a statement that
goods exported must not represent part of war reparations to
boycotted country X.
    A's receipt of the order is reportable, because it contains a
request to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (xxvi) A, a U.S. contractor, is negotiating with boycotting
country Y to build a school in Y. During the course of the
negotiations, Y suggests that one of the terms of the construction
contract be that A agree not to import materials produced in
boycotted country X. It is A's company policy not to agree to such a
contractual clause, and A suggests that instead it agree that all of
the necessary materials will be obtained from U.S. suppliers. Y
agrees to A's suggestion and a contract is executed.
    A has received a reportable request, but, for purposes of
reporting, the request is deemed to be received when the contract is
executed.
    (xxvii) Same as (xxvi), except Y does not accept A's suggested
alternative clause and negotiations break off.
    A's receipt of Y's request is reportable. For purposes of
reporting, it makes no difference that A was not successful in the
negotiations. The request is deemed to be received at the time the
negotiations break off.
    (xxviii) A, a U.S. insurance company, is insuring the shipment
of drilling equipment to boycotting country Y. The transaction is
being financed by a letter of credit which requires that A certify
that it is not blacklisted by Y. Freight forwarder B asks A to
supply the certification in order to satisfy the requirements of the
letter of credit.
    The request to A is reportable by A, because it is a request to
comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (xxix) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is engaged from time-to-time in
supplying drilling rigs to company B in boycotting country Y. B
insists that its suppliers sign contracts which provide that, even
after title passes from the supplier to B, the supplier will bear
the risk of loss and indemnify B if goods which the supplier has
furnished are denied entry into Y for whatever reason. A knows or
has reason to know that this contractual provision is required by B
because of Y's boycott, and that B has been using the provision
since 1977. A receives an order from B which contains such a clause.

[[Page 12891]]

    B's request is not reportable by A, because the request is
deemed to be not reportable by these regulations if the provision
was in use by B prior to the effective date of the regulations,
January 18, 1978.
    (xxx) Same as (xxix), except that A does not know when B began
using the provision.
    Unless A receives information from B that B introduced the term
prior to the effective date of the regulations, January 18, 1978, A
must report receipt of the request.
    (xxxi) A, a U.S. citizen, is a shipping clerk for B, a U.S.
manufacturing company. In the course of his employment, A receives
an order for goods from boycotting country Y. The order specifies
that none of the components of the goods is to be furnished by
blacklisted firms.
    B must report the request received by its employee, A, acting in
the scope of his employment. Although A is a U.S. person, such an
individual does not have a separate obligation to report requests
received by him in his capacity as an employee of B.
    (xxxii) U.S. exporter A is negotiating a transaction with
boycotting country Y. A knows that at the conclusion of the
negotiations he will be asked by Y to supply certain boycott-related
information and that such a request is reportable. In an effort to
forestall the request and thereby avoid having to file a report, A
supplies the information in advance.
    A is deemed to have received a reportable request.
    (xxxiii) A, a controlled foreign affiliate of U.S. company B,
receives an order for computers from boycotting country Y and
obtains components from the United States for the purpose of filling
the order. Y instructs A that a negative certificate of origin must
accompany the shipment.
    Y's instruction to A regarding the negative certificate of
origin is reportable by A. Moreover, A may designate B or any other
person to report on its behalf. However, A remains liable for any
failure to report or for any representations made on its behalf.
    (xxxiv) U.S. exporter A, in shipping goods to boycotting country
Y, receives a request from the customer in Y to state on the bill of
lading that the vessel is allowed to enter Y's ports. The request
further states that a certificate from the owner or master of the
vessel to that effect is acceptable.
    The request A received from his customer in Y is not reportable
if it was received after January 21, 1978, because it is a request
of a type deemed to be not reportable by these regulations. (A may
not make such a statement on the bill of lading himself, if he knows
or has reason to know it is requested for a boycott purpose.
    (xxxv) U.S. exporter A, in shipping goods to boycotting country
Y, receives a request from the customer in Y to furnish a
certificate from the owner of the vessel that the vessel is
permitted to call at Y's ports.
    The request A received from his customer in Y is not reportable
if it was received after the effective date of these rules, because
it is a request of a type deemed to be not reportable by these
regulations.
    (xxxvi) U.S. exporter A, in shipping goods to boycotting country
Y, receives a request from the customer in Y to furnish a
certificate from the insurance company indicating that the company
has a duly authorized representative in country Y and giving the
name of that representative.
    The request A received from his customer in Y is not reportable
if it was received after the effective date of these rules, because
it is a request of a type deemed to be not reportable by these
regulations.

Supplement No. 1 to Part 760--Interpretations

    It has come to the Department's attention that some U.S. persons
are being or may be asked to comply with new boycotting country
requirements with respect to shipping and insurance certifications
and certificates of origin. It has also come to the Department's
attention that some U.S. persons are being or may be asked to agree
to new contractual provisions in connection with certain foreign
government or foreign government agency contracts. In order to
maximize its guidance with respect to section 8 of the Export
Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. app. 2407) and
part 760 of the EAR, the Department hereby sets forth its views on
these certifications and contractual clauses.<SUP>1

    \1\  The Department originally issued this interpretation
pursuant to the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1979 (Public
Law 95-52) and the regulations on restrictive trade practices and
boycotts (15 CFR part 369) published on January 25, 1978 (43 FR
3508) and contained in the 15 CFR edition revised as of January 1,
1979.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Certifications

    Sec. 760.2(d) of this part prohibits a U.S. person from
furnishing or knowingly agreeing to furnish:
    ``Information concerning his or any other person's past, present
or proposed business relationships:
    (i) With or in a boycotted country;
    (ii) With any business concern organized under the laws of a
boycotted country;
    (iii) With any national or resident of a boycotted country; or
    (iv) With any other person who is known or believed to be
restricted from having any business relationship with or in a
boycotting country.''
    This prohibition, like all others under part 760, applies only
with respect to a U.S. person's activities in the interstate or
foreign commerce of the United States and only when such activities
are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an
unsanctioned foreign boycott. (Sec. 760.2(d)(5) of this part.)
    This prohibition does not apply to the furnishing of normal
business information in a commercial context. ( Sec. 760.2(d)(3) of
this part). Normal business information furnished in a commercial
context does not cease to be such simply because the party
soliciting the information may be a boycotting country or a national
or resident thereof. If the information is of a type which is
generally sought for a legitimate business purpose (such as
determining financial fitness, technical competence, or professional
experience), the information may be furnished even if the
information could be used, or without the knowledge of the person
supplying the information is intended to be used, for boycott
purposes. (Sec. 760.2(d)(4) of this part).
    The new certification requirements and the Department's
interpretation of the applicability of part 760 thereto are as
follows:
    A. Certificate of origin. A certificate of origin is to be
issued by the supplier or exporting company and authenticated by the
exporting country, attesting that the goods exported to the
boycotting country are of purely indigenous origin, and stating the
name of the factory or the manufacturing company. To the extent that
the goods as described on the certificate of origin are not solely
and exclusively products of their country of origin indicated
thereon, a declaration must be appended to the certificate of origin
giving the name of the supplier/manufacturer and declaring:
    ``The undersigned, ____________, does hereby declare on behalf
of the above-named supplier/manufacturer, that certain parts or
components of the goods described in the attached certificate of
origin are the products of such country or countries, other than the
country named therein as specifically indicated hereunder:

Country of Origin and Percentage of Value of Parts or Components
Relative to Total Shipment

2.---------------------------------------------------------------------
3.---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dated:-----------------------------------------------------------------
Signature--------------------------------------------------------------
    Sworn to before me, this ________ day of ____________, 19 ____.
Notary Seal.''

Interpretation

    It is the Department's position that furnishing a positive
certificate of origin, such as the one set out above, falls within
the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part for compliance
with the import and shipping document requirements of a boycotting
country. See Sec. 760.3(c) of this part and examples (i) and (ii)
thereunder.
    B. Shipping certificate. A certificate must be appended to the
bill of lading stating: (1) Name of vessel; (2) Nationality of
vessel; and (3) Owner of vessel, and declaring:
    ``The undersigned does hereby declare on behalf of the owner,
master, or agent of the above-named vessel that said vessel is not
registered in the boycotted country or owned by nationals or
residents of the boycotted country and will not call at or pass
through any boycotted country port enroute to its boycotting country
destination.
    ``The undersigned further declares that said vessel is otherwise
eligible to enter into the ports of the boycotting country in
conformity with its laws and regulations.
    Sworn to before me, this ________ day of __________, 19 ____.
Notary Seal.''

Interpretation

    It is the Department's position that furnishing a certificate,
such as the one set out above, stating: (1) The name of the vessel,
(2) The nationality of the vessel, and (3) The owner of the vessel
and further declaring that the vessel: (a) Is not registered in a
boycotted country, (b) Is not owned by nationals or

[[Page 12892]]
residents of a boycotted country, and (c) Will not call at or pass
through a boycotted country port enroute to its destination in a
boycotting country falls within the exception contained in
Sec. 760.3(b) of this part for compliance with the import and
shipping document requirements of a boycotting country. See
Sec. 760.3(b) of this part and examples (vii), (viii), and (ix)
thereunder.
    It is also the Department's position that the owner, charterer,
or master of a vessel may certify that the vessel is ``eligible'' or
``otherwise eligible'' to enter into the ports of a boycotting
country in conformity with its laws and regulations. Furnishing such
a statement pertaining to one's own eligibility offends no
prohibition under part 760. See Sec. 760.2(f) of this part, example
(xiv).
    On the other hand, where a boycott is in force, a declaration
that a vessel is ``eligible'' or ``otherwise eligible'' to enter the
ports of the boycotting country necessarily conveys the information
that the vessel is not blacklisted or otherwise restricted from
having a business relationship with the boycotting country. See
Sec. 760.3(b) of this part, examples (vi), (xi), and (xii). Where a
person other than the vessel's owner, charterer, or master furnishes
such a statement, that is tantamount to his furnishing a statement
that he is not doing business with a blacklisted person or is doing
business only with nonblacklisted persons. Therefore, it is the
Department's position that furnishing such a certification (which
does not reflect customary international commercial practice) by
anyone other than the owner, charterer, or master of a vessel would
fall within the prohibition set forth in Sec. 760.2(d) of this part
unless it is clear from all the facts and circumstances that the
certification is not required for a boycott reason. See
Sec. 760.2(d)(3) and (4) of this part. However, in accordance with
the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part for compliance
with the import and shipping document requirements of a boycotting
country, such a United States person may furnish such a
certification until June 21, 1978.
    C. Insurance certificate. A certificate must be appended to the
insurance policy stating: (1) Name of insurance company; (2) Address
of its principal office; and (3) Country of its incorporation, and
declaring:
    ``The undersigned, ________________, does hereby certify on
behalf of the above-named insurance company that the said company
has a duly qualified and appointed agent or representative in the
boycotting country whose name and address appear below:
    Name of agent/representative and address in the boycotting
country.
    Sworn to before me this ________ day of ____________, 19____.
Notary Seal.''

Interpretation

    It is the Department's position that furnishing the name of the
insurance company falls within the exception contained in
Sec. 760.3(c) of this part for compliance with the import and
shipping document requirements of a boycotting country. See
Sec. 760.3(c)(1)(v) of this part and examples (v) and (x)
thereunder. In addition, it is the Department's position that
furnishing a certificate, such as the one set out above, stating the
address of the insurance company's principal office and its country
of incorporation offends no prohibition under part 760 unless the
U.S. person furnishing the certificate knows or has reason to know
that the information is sought for the purpose of determining that
the insurance company is neither headquartered nor incorporated in a
boycotted country. See Sec. 760.2(d)(1)(i) of this part.
    It is also the Department's position that the insurer, himself,
may certify that he has a duly qualified and appointed agent or
representative in the boycotting country and may furnish the name
and address of his agent or representative. Furnishing such a
statement pertaining to one's own status offends no prohibition
under part 760. See Sec. 760.2(f) of this part, example (xiv).
    On the other hand, where a boycott is in force, a declaration
that an insurer ``has a duly qualified and appointed agent or
representative'' in the boycotting country necessarily conveys the
information that the insurer is not blacklisted or otherwise
restricted from having a business relationship with the boycotting
country. See Sec. 760.3(c) of this part, example (v). Therefore, it
is the Department's position that furnishing such a certification by
anyone other than the insurer would fall within the prohibition set
forth in Sec. 760.2(d) of this part unless it is clear from all the
facts and circumstances that the certification is not required for a
boycott reason. See Sec. 760.2(d) (3) and (4) of this part. However,
in accordance with the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this
part for compliance with the import and shipping document
requirements of a boycotting country, such a U.S. person may furnish
such a certification until June 21, 1978.

II. Contractual Clauses

    The new contractual requirements and the Department's
interpretation of the applicability of part 760 thereto are as
follows:
    A. Contractual clause regarding import laws of boycotting
country. ``In connection with the performance of this contract the
Contractor/Supplier acknowledges that the import and customs laws
and regulations of the boycotting country shall apply to the
furnishing and shipment of any products or components thereof to the
boycotting country. The Contractor/Supplier specifically
acknowledges that the aforementioned import and customs laws and
regulations of the boycotting country prohibit, among other things,
the importation into the boycotting country of products or
components thereof: (1) Originating in the boycotted country; (2)
Manufactured, produced, or furnished by companies organized under
the laws of the boycotted country; and (3) Manufactured, produced,
or furnished by nationals or residents of the boycotted country.''

Interpretation

    It is the Department's position that an agreement, such as the
one set out in the first sentence above, that the import and customs
requirements of a boycotting country shall apply to the performance
of a contract does not, in and of itself, offend any prohibition
under Part 760. See Sec. 760.2(a)(5) of this part and example (iii)
under ``Examples of Agreements To Refuse To Do Business.'' It is
also the Department's position that an agreement to comply generally
with the import and customs requirements of a boycotting country
does not, in and of itself, offend any prohibition under part 760 of
this part. See Sec. 760.2(a)(5) of this part and examples (iv) and
(v) under ``Examples of Agreements To Refuse To Do Business.'' In
addition, it is the Department's position that an agreement, such as
the one set out in the second sentence above, to comply with the
boycotting country's import and customs requirements prohibiting the
importation of products or components: (1) Originating in the
boycotted country; (2) Manufactured, produced, or furnished by
companies organized under the laws of the boycotted country; or (3)
Manufactured, produced, or furnished by nationals or residents of
the boycotted country falls within the exception contained in
Sec. 760.3(a) of this part for compliance with the import
requirements of a boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(a) of this part
and example (ii) thereunder.
    The Department notes that, after June 21, 1978, a United States
person may not furnish a negative certification regarding the origin
of goods or their components even though the certification is
furnished in response to the import and shipping document
requirements of the boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(c) of this
part and examples (i), (ii), and (iii) thereunder, and Sec. 760.3(a)
of this part and example (ii) thereunder.
    B. Contractual clause regarding unilateral and specific
selection. ``The Government of the boycotting country (or the First
Party), in its exclusive power, reserves its right to make the final
unilateral and specific selection of any proposed carriers,
insurers, suppliers of services to be performed within the
boycotting country, or of specific goods to be furnished in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract.''

Interpretation

    It is the Department's position that an agreement, such as the
one set out above, falls within the exception contained in
Sec. 760.3(d) of this part for compliance with unilateral
selections. However, the Department notes that whether a U.S. person
may subsequently comply or agree to comply with any particular
selection depends upon whether that selection meets all the
requirements contained in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part for compliance
with unilateral selections. For example, the particular selection
must be unilateral and specific, particular goods must be
specifically identifiable as to their source or origin at the time
of their entry into the boycotting country, and all other
requirements contained in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part must be
observed.

Supplement No. 2 to Part 760--Interpretation

    The Department hereby sets forth its views on whether the
furnishing of certain shipping and insurance certificates in
compliance with boycotting country requirements violates the
provisions of section 8 of the Export

[[Page 12893]]
Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. app. 2407) and
part 760 of the EAR,<SUP>1 as follows:

    \1\ The Department originally issued this interpretation on
April 21, 1978 (43 FR 16969) pursuant to the Export Administration
Amendments Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-52) and the regulations on
restrictive trade practices and boycotts (15 CFR part 369) published
on January 25, 1978 (43 FR 3508) and contained in the 15 CFR edition
revised as of January 1, 1979.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) ``The owner, charterer or master of a vessel may certify
that the vessel is `eligible' or `otherwise eligible' to enter into
the ports of a boycotting country in conformity with its laws and
regulations;''
    (ii) ``The insurer, himself, may certify that he has a duly
qualified and appointed agent or representative in the boycotting
country and may furnish the name and address of his agent or
representative.''
    Furnishing such certifications by anyone other than:
    (i) The owner, charterer or master of a vessel, or
    (ii) The insurer would fall within the prohibition set forth in
Sec. 760.2(d) of this part, ``unless it is clear from all the facts
and circumstances that these certifications are not required for a
boycott reason.'' See Sec. 760.2(d) (3) and (4) of this part.
    The Department has received from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia a
clarification that the shipping and insurance certifications are
required by Saudi Arabia in order to:
    (i) Demonstrate that there are no applicable restrictions under
Saudi laws or regulations pertaining to maritime matters such as the
age of the ship, the condition of the ship, and similar matters that
would bar entry of the vessel into Saudi ports; and
    (ii) Facilitate dealings with insurers by Saudi Arabian
importers whose ability to secure expeditious payments in the event
of damage to insured goods may be adversely affected by the absence
of a qualified agent or representative of the insurer in Saudi
Arabia. In the Department's judgment, this clarification constitutes
sufficient facts and circumstances to demonstrate that the
certifications are not required by Saudi Arabia for boycott reasons.
    On the basis of this clarification, it is the Department's
position that any United States person may furnish such shipping and
insurance certificates required by Saudi Arabia without violating
Sec. 760.2(d) of this part. Moreover, under these circumstances,
receipt of requests for such shipping and insurance certificates
from Saudi Arabia is not reportable.
    It is still the Department's position that furnishing such a
certificate pertaining to one's own eligibility offends no
prohibition under part 760. See Sec. 760.2(f) of this part, example
(xiv). However, absent facts and circumstances clearly indicating
that the certifications are required for ordinary commercial reasons
as demonstrated by the Saudi clarification, furnishing
certifications about the eligibility or blacklist status of any
other person would fall within the prohibition set forth in
Sec. 760.2(d) of this part, and receipt of requests for such
certifications is reportable.
    It also remains the Department's position that where a United
States person asks an insurer or carrier of the exporter's goods to
self-certify, such request offends no prohibition under this part.
However, where a United States person asks anyone other than an
insurer or carrier of the exporter's goods to self-certify, such
requests will be considered by the Department as evidence of the
requesting person's refusal to do business with those persons who
cannot or will not furnish such a self-certification. For example,
if an exporter-beneficiary of a letter of credit asks his component
suppliers to self-certify, such a request will be considered as
evidence of his refusal to do business with those component
suppliers who cannot or will not furnish such a self-certification.
    The Department wishes to emphasize that notwithstanding the fact
that self-certifications are permissible, it will closely scrutinize
the activities of all United States persons who provide such self-
certifications, including insurers and carriers, to determine that
such persons have not taken any prohibited actions or entered into
any prohibited agreements in order to be able to furnish such
certifications.

Supplement No. 3 to Part 760--Interpretation

    Pursuant to Article 2, Annex II of the Peace Treaty between
Egypt and Israel, Egypt's participation in the Arab economic boycott
of Israel was formally terminated on January 25, 1980. On the basis
of this action, it is the Department's position that certain
requests for information, action or agreement which were considered
boycott-related by implication now cannot be presumed boycott-
related and thus would not be prohibited or reportable under the
Regulations. For example, a request that an exporter certify that
the vessel on which it is shipping its goods is eligible to enter
Arab Republic of Egypt ports has been considered a boycott-related
request that the exporter could not comply with because Egypt has a
boycott in force against Israel (see 43 FR 16969, April 21, 1978 or
the 15 CFR edition revised as of January 1, 1979). Such a request
after January 25, 1980 would not be presumed boycott-related because
the underlying boycott requirement/basis for the certification has
been eliminated. Similarly, a U.S. company would not be prohibited
from complying with a request received from Egyptian government
officials to furnish the place of birth of employees the company is
seeking to take to Egypt, because there is no underlying boycott law
or policy that would give rise to a presumption that the request was
boycott-related.
    U.S. persons are reminded that requests that are on their face
boycott-related or that are for action obviously in furtherance or
support of an unsanctioned foreign boycott are subject to the
Regulations, irrespective of the country or origin. For example,
requests containing references to ``blacklisted companies'',
``Israel boycott list'', ``non-Israeli goods'' or other phrases or
words indicating boycott purpose would be subject to the appropriate
provisions of the Department's antiboycott regulations.

Supplement No. 4 to Part 760--Interpretation

    The question has arisen how the definition of U.S. commerce in
the antiboycott regulations (15 CFR part 760) applies to a shipment
of foreign-made goods when U.S.-origin spare parts are included in
the shipment. Specifically, if the shipment of foreign goods falls
outside the definition of U.S. commerce, will the inclusion of U.S.-
origin spare parts bring the entire transaction into U.S. commerce?
    Section 760.1(d)(12) of this part provides the general
guidelines for determining when U.S.-origin goods shipped from a
controlled in fact foreign subsidiary are outside U.S. commerce. The
two key tests of that provision are that the goods were (1) acquired
without reference to a specific order, and (2) further manufactured,
incorporated or reprocessed into another product. Because the
application of these two tests to spare parts does not conclusively
answer the U.S. commerce question, the Department is presenting this
clarification.
    In the cases brought to the Department's attention, an order for
foreign-origin goods was placed with a controlled in fact foreign
subsidiary of a United States company. The foreign goods contained
components manufactured in the United States and in other countries,
and the order included a request for extras of the U.S. manufactured
components (spare parts) to allow the customer to repair the item.
Both the foreign manufactured product and the U.S. spare parts were
to be shipped from the general inventory of the foreign subsidiary.
Since the spare parts, if shipped by themselves, would be in U.S.
commerce as that term is defined in the Regulations, the question
was whether including them with the foreign manufactured item would
bring the entire shipment into U.S. commerce. The Department has
decided that it will not and presents the following specific
guidance.
    As used above, the term ``spare parts'' refers to parts of the
quantities and types normally and customarily ordered with a product
and kept on hand in the event they are needed to assure prompt
repair of the product. Parts, components or accessories that improve
or change the basic operations or design characteristics, for
example, as to accuracy, capability or productivity, are not spare
parts under this definition.
    Inclusion of U.S.-origin spare parts in a shipment of products
which is otherwise outside U.S. commerce will not bring the
transaction into U.S. commerce if the following conditions are met:
    (I) The parts included in the shipment are acquired from the
United States by the controlled in fact foreign subsidiary without
reference to a specific order from or transaction with a person
outside the United States;
    (II) The parts are identical to the corresponding United States-
origin parts which have been manufactured, incorporated into or
reprocessed into the completed product;
    (III) The parts are of the quantity and type normally and
customarily ordered with the completed product and kept on hand by
the

[[Page 12894]]
firm or industry of which the firm is a part to assure prompt repair
of the product; and
    (IV) The parts are covered by the same order as the completed
product and are shipped with or at the same time as the original
product.
    The Department emphasizes that unless each of the above
conditions is met, the inclusion of United States-origin spare parts
in an order for a foreign-manufactured or assembled product will
bring the entire transaction into the interstate or foreign commerce
of the United States for purposes of part 760.

Supplement No. 5 to Part 760--Interpretation

A. Permissible Furnishing of Information

    The information outlined below may be furnished in response to
boycott-related requests from boycotting countries or others. This
information is, in the view of the Department, not prohibited by the
Regulations. Thus, a person does not have to qualify under any of
the exceptions to be able to make the following statements. Such
statements can be made, however, only by the person indicated and
under the circumstances described. These statements should not be
used as a point of departure or analogy for determining the
permissibility of other types of statements. The Department's view
that these statements are not contrary to the prohibitions contained
in antiboycott provisions of the Regulations is limited to the
specific statement in the specific context indicated.
    1. A U.S. person may always provide its own name, address, place
of incorporation (``nationality''), and nature of business.
    2. A U.S. person may state that it is not on a blacklist, or
restricted from doing business in a boycotting country. A company
may not make that statement about its subsidiaries or affiliates--
only about itself. A U.S. person may not say that there is no reason
for it to be blacklisted. To make that statement would provide
directly or by implication information that may not be provided. A
U.S. person may inquire about the reasons it is blacklisted if it
learns that it is on a blacklist (see Sec. 760.2(d) of this part
example (xv)).
    3. A U.S. person may describe in detail its past dealings with
boycotting countries; may state in which boycotting countries its
trademarks are registered; and may specify in which boycotting
countries it is registered or qualified to do business. In general,
a U.S. person is free to furnish any information it wishes about the
nature and extent of its commercial dealings with boycotting
countries.
    4. A U.S. person may state that many U.S. firms or individuals
have similar names and that it believes that it may be confused with
a similarly named entity. A U.S. person may not state that it does
or does not have an affiliation or relationship with such similarly
named entity.
    5. A U.S. person may state that the information requested is a
matter of public record in the United States. However, the person
may not direct the inquirer to the location of that information, nor
may the U.S. person provide or cause to be provided such
information.

B. Availability of the Compliance With Local Law Exception to
Establish a Foreign Branch

    Section 760.3(f) of this part, the Compliance With Local Law
exception, permits U.S. persons, who are bona fide residents of a
boycotting country, to take certain limited, but otherwise
prohibited, actions, if they are required to do so in order to
comply with local law.
    Among these actions is the furnishing of non-discriminatory
information. Examples (iv) through (vi) under ``Examples of Bona
Fide Residency'' indicate that a company seeking to become a bona
fide resident within a boycotting country may take advantage of the
exception for the limited purpose of furnishing information required
by local law to obtain resident status. Exactly when and how this
exception is available has been the subject of a number of
inquiries. It is the Department's view that the following conditions
must be met for a non-resident company to be permitted to furnish
otherwise prohibited information for the limited purpose of seeking
to become a bona fide resident:
    1. The company must have a legitimate business reason for
seeking to establish a branch or other resident operation in the
boycotting country. (Removal from the blacklist does not constitute
such a reason.)
    2. The local operation it seeks to establish must be similar or
comparable in nature and operation to ones the company operates in
other parts of the world, unless local law or custom dictates a
significantly different form.
    3. The person who visits the boycotting country to furnish the
information must be the official whose responsibility ordinarily
includes the creation and registration of foreign operations (i.e.,
the chairman of the board cannot be flown in to answer boycott
questions unless the chairman of the board is the corporate official
who ordinarily goes into a country to handle foreign registrations).
    4. The information provided must be that which is ordinarily
known to the person establishing the foreign branch. Obviously, at
the time of establishment, the foreign branch will have no
information of its own knowledge. Rather, the information should be
that which the responsible person has of his own knowledge, or that
he would have with him as incidental and necessary to the
registration and establishment process. As a general rule, such
information would not include such things as copies of agreements
with boycotted country concerns or detailed information about the
person's dealings with blacklisted concerns.
    5. It is not necessary that documents prepared in compliance
with this exception be drafted or executed within the boycotting
country. The restrictions on the type of information which may be
provided and on who may provide it apply regardless of where the
papers are prepared or signed.

Supplement No. 6 to Part 760--Interpretation

    The antiboycott regulations prohibit knowing agreements to
comply with certain prohibited requests and requirements of
boycotting countries, regardless of how these terms are stated.
Similarly, the reporting rules require that a boycott related
``solicitation, directive, legend or instruction that asks for
information or that asks that a United States person take or refrain
from taking a particular action'' be reported. Questions have
frequently arisen about how particular requirements in the form of
directive or instructions are viewed under the antiboycott
regulations, and we believe that it will add clarity to the
regulations to provide a written interpretation of how three of
these terms are treated under the law. The terms in question appear
frequently in letters of credit, but may also be found on purchase
orders or other shipping or sale documents. They have been brought
to the attention of the Department by numerous persons. The terms
are, or are similar to, the following: (1) Goods of boycotted
country origin are prohibited; (2) No six-pointed stars may be used
on the goods, packing or cases; (3) Neither goods nor packing shall
bear any symbols prohibited in the boycotting country.
    (a) Goods of boycotted country origin prohibited. This term is
very common in letters of credit from Kuwait and may also appear
from time-to-time in invitations to bid, contracts, or other trade
documents. It imposes a condition or requirement compliance with
which is prohibited, but permitted by an exception under the
Regulations (see Sec. 760.2(a) and Sec. 760.3(b) of this part). It
is reportable by those parties to the letter of credit or other
transaction that are required to take or refrain from taking some
boycott related action by the request. Thus the bank must report the
request because it is a term or condition of the letter of credit
that it is handling, and the exporter-beneficiary must report the
request because the exporter determines the origin of the goods. The
freight forwarder does not have to report this request because the
forwarder has no role or obligation in this part of the transaction.
See Sec. 760.5, examples (xiii)-(xv) of this part.
    (b) No six-pointed stars may be used on the goods, packing or
cases. This term appears from time-to-time on documents from a
variety of countries. The Department has taken the position that the
six-pointed star is a religious symbol. See Sec. 760.2(b), example
(viii) of this part. Agreeing to this term is prohibited by the
Regulations and not excepted because it constitutes an agreement to
furnish information about the religion of a U.S. person. See
Sec. 760.2(c) of this part. If a person proceeds with a transaction
in which this is a condition at any stage of the transaction, that
person has agreed to the condition in violation of the Regulations.
It is not enough to ignore the condition. Exception must
affirmatively be taken to this term or it must be stricken from the
documents of the transaction. It is reportable by all parties to the
transaction that are restricted by it. For example, unlike the
situation described in (a) above, the freight forwarder would have
to report this request because his role in the transaction would
involve preparation of the packing and cases. The bank and exporter
would both have to report, of course, if it were a term in a letter
of credit. Each party would be obligated affirmatively to seek an
amendment or deletion of the term.

[[Page 12895]]

    (c) Neither goods nor packaging shall bear any symbols
prohibited in the boycotting country. This term appears from time-
to-time in letters of credit and shipping documents from Saudi
Arabia. In our view, it is neither prohibited, nor reportable
because it is not boycott-related. There is a wide range of symbols
that are prohibited in Saudi Arabia for a variety of reasons, many
having to do with that nation's cultural and religious beliefs. On
this basis, we do not interpret the term to be boycott related. See
Sec. 760.2(a)(5) and Sec. 760.5(a)(5)(v) of this part.

Supplement No. 7 to Part 760--Interpretation

Prohibited Refusal To Do Business

    When a boycotting country rejects for boycott-related reasons a
shipment of goods sold by a United States person, the United States
person selling the goods may return them to its inventory or may re-
ship them to other markets (the United States person may not return
them to the original supplier and demand restitution). The U.S.
person may then make a non-boycott based selection of another
supplier and provide the goods necessary to meet its obligations to
the boycotting customer in that particular transaction without
violating Sec. 760.2(a) of this part. If the United States person
receives another order from the same boycotting country for similar
goods, the Department has determined that a boycott-based refusal by
a United States person to ship goods from the supplier whose goods
were previously rejected would constitute a prohibited refusal to do
business under Sec. 760.2(a) of this part. The Department will
presume that filling such an order with alternative goods is
evidence of the person's refusal to deal with the original supplier.
    The Department recognizes the limitations this places on future
transactions with a boycotting country once a shipment of goods has
been rejected. Because of this, the Department wishes to point out
that, when faced with a boycotting country's refusal to permit entry
of the particular goods, a United States person may state its
obligation to abide by the requirements of United States law and
indicate its readiness to comply with the unilateral and specific
selection of goods by the boycotting country in accordance with
Sec. 760.3(c) of this part. That section provides, in pertinent
part, as follows:
    A United States person may comply or agree to comply in the
normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection
by a boycotting country ________ of ________ specific goods,
________ provided that ________ with respect to goods, the items, in
the normal course of business, are identifiable as to their source
or origin at the time of their entry into the boycotting country by
(a) uniqueness of design or appearance or (b) trademark, trade name,
or other identification normally on the items themselves, including
their packaging.
    The United States person may also provide certain services in
advance of the unilateral selection by the boycotting country, such
as the compilation of lists of qualified suppliers, so long as such
services are customary to the type of business the United States
person is engaged in, and the services rendered are completely non-
exclusionary in character (i.e., the list of qualified suppliers
would have to include the supplier whose goods had previously been
rejected by the boycotting country, if they were fully qualified).
See Sec. 760.2(a)(6) of this part for a discussion of the
requirements for the provision of these services.
    The Department wishes to emphasize that the unilateral selection
exception in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part will be construed narrowly,
and that all its requirements and conditions must be met, including
the following:

--Discretion for the selection must be exercised by a boycotting
country; or by a national or resident of a boycotting country;
--The selection must be stated in the affirmative specifying a
particular supplier of goods;
--While a permissible selection may be boycott based, if the United
States person knows or has reason to know that the purpose of the
selection is to effect discrimination against any United States
person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin, the
person may not comply under any circumstances.

    The Department cautions United States persons confronted with
the problem or concern over the boycott-based rejection of goods
shipped to a boycotting country that the adoption of devices such as
``risk of loss'' clauses, or conditions that make the supplier
financially liable if his or her goods are rejected by the
boycotting country for boycott reasons are presumed by the
Department to be evasion of the statute and regulations, and as such
are prohibited by Sec. 760.4 of this part, unless adopted prior to
January 18, 1978. See Sec. 760.4(d) of this part.

Supplement No. 8 to Part 760--Interpretation

Definition of Interstate or Foreign Commerce of the United States

    When United States persons (as defined by the antiboycott
regulations) located within the United States purchase or sell goods
or services located outside the United States, they have engaged in
an activity within the foreign commerce of the United States.
Although the goods or services may never physically come within the
geographic boundaries of the several states or territories of the
United States, legal ownership or title is transferred from a
foreign nation to the United States person who is located in the
United States. In the case of a purchase, subsequent resale would
also be within United States commerce.
    It is the Department's view that the terms ``sale'' and
``purchase'' as used in the regulations are not limited to those
circumstances where the goods or services are physically transferred
to the person who acquires title. The EAR define the activities that
serve as the transactional basis for U.S. commerce as those
involving the ``sale, purchase, or transfer'' of goods or services.
In the Department's view, as used in the antiboycott regulations,
``transfer'' contemplates physical movement of the goods or services
between the several states or territories and a foreign country,
while ``sale'' and ``purchase'' relate to the movement of ownership
or title.
    This interpretation applies only to those circumstances in which
the person located within the United States buys or sells goods or
services for its own account. Where the United States person is
engaged in the brokerage of foreign goods, i.e., bringing foreign
buyers and sellers together and assisting in the transfer of the
goods, the sale or purchase itself would not ordinarily be
considered to be within U.S. commerce. The brokerage service,
however, would be a service provided from the United States to the
parties and thus an activity within U.S. commerce and subject to the
antiboycott laws. See Sec. 760.1(d)(13) of this part.
    The Department cautions that United States persons who alter
their normal pattern of dealing to eliminate the passage of
ownership of the goods or services to or from the several states or
territories of the United States in order to avoid the application
of the antiboycott regulations would be in violation of Sec. 760.4
of this part.

Supplement No. 9 to Part 760--Interpretation

Activities Exclusively Within a Boycotting Country--Furnishing
Information

    Sec. 760.3(h) of this part provides that a United States person
who is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country may comply with
the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities
exclusively within the boycotting country. Among the types of
conduct permitted by this exception is ``furnishing information
within the host country'' Sec. 760.3(h)(1)(v) of this part. For
purposes of the discussion which follows, the Department is assuming
that the person in question is a bona fide resident of the
boycotting country as defined in Sec. 760.3(f) of this part, and
that the information to be provided is required by the laws or
regulations of the boycotting country, as also defined in
Sec. 760.3(g) of this part. The only issue this interpretation
addresses is under what circumstances the provision of information
is ``an activity exclusively within the boycotting country.''
    The activity of ``furnishing information'' consists of two
parts, the acquisition of the information and its subsequent
transmittal. Under the terms of this exception, the information may
not be acquired outside the country for the purpose of responding to
the requirement for information imposed by the boycotting country.
Thus, if an American company which is a bona fide resident of a
boycotting country is required to provide information about its
dealings with other U.S. firms, the company may not ask its parent
corporation in the United States for that information, or make any
other inquiry outside the boundaries of the boycotting country. The
information must be provided to the boycotting country authorities
based on information or knowledge available to the company and its
personnel located within the boycotting country at the time the
inquiry is received. See Sec. 760.3, (h) of this part, examples
(iii), (iv), and (v). Much of the information in the company's
possession (transaction and corporate records) may have

[[Page 12896]]
actually originated outside the boycotting country, and much of the
information known to the employees may have been acquired outside
the boycotting country. This will not cause the information to fall
outside the coverage of this exception, if the information was sent
to the boycotting country or acquired by the individuals in normal
commercial context prior to and unrelated to a boycott inquiry or
purpose. It should be noted that if prohibited information (about
business relations with a boycotted country, for example) has been
forwarded to the affiliate in the boycotting country in anticipation
of a possible boycott inquiry from the boycotting country
government, the Department will not regard this as information
within the knowledge of the bona fide resident under the terms of
the exception. However, if the bona fide resident possesses the
information prior to receipt of a boycott-related inquiry and
obtained it in a normal commercial context, the information can be
provided pursuant to this exception notwithstanding the fact that,
at some point, the information came into the boycotting country from
the outside.
    The second part of the analysis of ``furnishing information''
deals with the limitation on the transmittal of the information. It
can only be provided within the boundaries of the boycotting
country. The bona fide resident may only provide the information to
the party that the boycotting country law requires (directly or
through an agent or representative within the country) so long as
that party is located within the boycotting country. This
application of the exception is somewhat easier, since it is
relatively simple to determine if the information is to be given to
somebody within the country.
    Note that in discussing what constitutes furnishing information
``exclusively within'' the boycotting country, the Department does
not address the nature of the transaction or activity that the
information relates to. It is the Department's position that the
nature of the transaction, including the inception or completion of
the transaction, is not material in analyzing the availability of
this exception.
    For example, if a shipment of goods imported into a boycotting
country is held up at the time of entry, and information from the
bona fide resident within that country is legally required to free
those goods, the fact that the information may relate to a
transaction that began outside the boycotting country is not
material. The availability of the exception will be judged based on
the activity of the bona fide resident within the country. If the
resident provides that information of his or her own knowledge, and
provides it to appropriate parties located exclusively within the
country, the exception permits the information to be furnished.
    Factual variations may raise questions about the application of
this exception and the effect of this interpretation. In an effort
to anticipate some of these, the Department has set forth below a
number of questions and answers. They are incorporated as a part of
this interpretation.
    1. Q. Under this exception, can a company which is a U.S. person
and a bona fide resident of the boycotting country provide
information to the local boycott office?
    A. Yes, if local law requires the company to provide this
information to the boycott office and all the other requirements are
met.
    2. Q. If the company knows that the local boycott office will
forward the information to the Central Boycott Office, may it still
provide the information to the local boycott office?
    A. Yes, if it is required by local law to furnish the
information to the local boycott office and all the other
requirements are met. The company has no control over what happens
to the information after it is provided to the proper authorities.
(There is obvious potential for evasion here, and the Department
will examine such occurrences closely.)
    3. Q. Can a U.S. person who is a bona fide resident of Syria
furnish information to the Central Boycott Office in Damascus?
    A. No, unless the law in Syria specifically requires information
to be provided to the Central Boycott Office the exception will not
apply. Syria has a local boycott office responsible for enforcing
the boycott in that country.
    4. Q. If a company which is a U.S. person and a bona fide
resident of the boycotting country has an import shipment held up in
customs of the boycotting country, and is required to provide
information about the shipment to get it out of customs, may the
company do so?
    A. Yes, assuming all other requirements are met. The act of
furnishing the information is the activity taking place exclusively
within the boycotting country. The fact that the information is
provided corollary to a transaction that originates or terminates
outside the boycotting country is not material.
    5. Q. If the U.S. person and bona fide resident of the
boycotting country is shipping goods out of the boycotting country,
and is required to certify to customs officials of the country at
the time of export that the goods are not of Israeli origin, may he
do so even though the certification relates to an export
transaction?
    A. Yes, assuming all other requirements are met. See number 4
above.

Supplement No. 10 to Part 760--Interpretation

    (a) The words ``Persian Gulf'' cannot appear on the document.
    This term is common in letters of credit from Kuwait and may be
found in letters of credit from Bahrain. Although more commonly
appearing in letters of credit, the term may also appear in other
trade documents.
    It is the Department's view that this term reflects a historical
dispute between the Arabs and the Iranians over geographic place
names which in no way relates to existing economic boycotts. Thus,
the term is neither prohibited nor reportable under the Regulations.
    (b) Certify that goods are of U.S.A. origin and contain no
foreign parts.
    This term appears periodically on documents from a number of
Arab countries. It is the Department's position that the statement
is a positive certification of origin and, as such, falls within the
exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part for compliance
with the import and shipping document requirements of a boycotting
country. Even though a negative phrase is contained within the
positive clause, the phrase is a non exclusionary, non blacklisting
statement. In the Department's view, the additional phrase does not
affect the permissible status of the positive certificate, nor does
it make the request reportable Sec. 760.5(a)(5)(iii) of this part.
    (c) Legalization of documents by any Arab consulate except
Egyptian Consulate permitted.
    This term appears from time to time in letters of credit but
also may appear in various other trade documents requiring
legalization and thus is not prohibited, and a request to comply
with the statement is not reportable. Because a number of Arab
states do not have formal diplomatic relations with Egypt, they do
not recognize Egyptian embassy actions. The absence of diplomatic
relations is the reason for the requirement. In the Department's
view this does not constitute an unsanctioned foreign boycott or
embargo against Egypt under the terms of the Export Administration
Act. Thus the term is not prohibited, and a request to comply with
the statement is not reportable.

Supplement No. 11 to Part 760--Interpretation

Definition of Unsolicited Invitation to Bid

    Sec. 760.5(a)(4) of this part states in part:
    In addition, a United States person who receives an unsolicited
invitation to bid, or similar proposal, containing a boycott request
has not received a reportable request for purposes of this section
where he does not respond to the invitation to bid or other
proposal.
    The Regulations do not define ``unsolicited'' in this context.
Based on review of numerous situations, the Department has developed
certain criteria that it applies in determining if an invitation to
bid or other proposal received by a U.S. person is in fact
unsolicited.
    The invitation is not unsolicited if, during a commercially
reasonable period of time preceding the issuance of the invitation,
a representative of the U.S. person contacted the company or agency
involved for the purpose of promoting business on behalf of the
company.
    The invitation is not unsolicited if the U.S. person has
advertised the product or line of products that are the subject of
the invitation in periodicals or publications that ordinarily
circulate to the country issuing the invitation during a
commercially reasonable period of time preceding the issuance of the
invitation.
    The invitation is not unsolicited if the U.S. person has sold
the same or similar products to the company or agency issuing the
invitation within a commercially reasonable period of time before
the issuance of the current invitation.
    The invitation is not unsolicited if the U.S. person has
participated in a trade mission to or trade fair in the country
issuing the invitation within a commercially reasonable

[[Page 12897]]
period of time before the issuance of the invitation.
    Under Sec. 760.5(a)(4) of this part, the invitation is regarded
as not reportable if the U.S. person receiving it does not respond.
The Department has determined that a simple acknowledgment of the
invitation does not constitute a response for purposes of this rule.
However, an acknowledgment that requests inclusion for future
invitations will be considered a response, and a report is required.
    Where the person in receipt of an invitation containing a
boycott term or condition is undecided about a response by the time
a report would be required to be filed under the regulations, it is
the Department's view that the person must file a report as called
for in the Regulations. The person filing the report may indicate at
the time of filing that he has not made a decision on the boycott
request but must file a supplemental report as called for in the
regulations at the time a decision is made (Sec. 760.5(a)(6) of this
part).

Supplement No. 12 to Part 760--Interpretation

    The Department has taken the position that a U.S. person as
defined by Sec. 760.1(b) of this part may not make use of an agent
to furnish information that the U.S. person is prohibited from
furnishing pursuant to Sec. 760.2(d) of this part.
    Example (v) under Sec. 760.4 of this part (Evasion) provides:
    A, a U.S. company, is negotiating a long-term contract with
boycotting country Y to meet all of Y's medical supply needs. Y
informs A that before such a contract can be concluded, A must
complete Y's boycott questionnaire. A knows that it is prohibited
from answering the questionnaire so it arranges for a local agent in
Y to supply the necessary information.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is a
device to mask prohibited activity carried out on A's behalf.
    This interpretation deals with the application of the
Regulations to a commercial agent registration requirement recently
imposed by the government of Saudi Arabia. The requirement provides
that nationals of Saudi Arabia seeking to register in Saudi Arabia
as commercial agents or representatives of foreign concerns must
furnish certain boycott-related information about the foreign
concern prior to obtaining approval of the registration.
    The requirement has been imposed by the Ministry of Commerce of
Saudi Arabia, which is the government agency responsible for
regulation of commercial agents and foreign commercial
registrations. The Ministry requires the agent or representative to
state the following:
    Declaration: I, the undersigned, hereby declare, in my capacity
as (blank) that (name and address of foreign principal) is not
presently on the blacklist of the Office for the Boycott of Israel
and that it and all its branches, if any, are bound by the decisions
issued by the Boycott Office and do not (1) participate in the
capital of, (2) license the manufacture of any products or grant
trademarks or tradeware license to, (3) give experience or technical
advice to, or (4) have any other relationship with other companies
which are prohibited to be dealt with by the Boycott Office. Signed
(name of commercial agent/representative/distributor).
    It is the Department's view that under the circumstances
specifically outlined in this interpretation relating to the nature
of the requirement, a U.S. person will not be held responsible for a
violation of this part when such statements are provided by its
commercial agent or representative, even when such statements are
made with the full knowledge of the U.S. person.
    Nature of the requirement. For a boycott-related commercial
registration requirement to fall within the coverage of this
interpretation it must have the following characteristics:
    1. The requirement for information imposed by the boycotting
country applies to a national or other subject of the boycotting
country qualified under the local laws of that country to function
as a commercial representative within that country;
    2. The registration requirement relates to the registration of
the commercial agent's or representative's authority to sell or
distribute goods within the boycotting country acquired from the
foreign concern;
    3. The requirement is a routine part of the registration process
and is not applied selectively based on boycott-related criteria;
    4. The requirement applies only to a commercial agent or
representative in the boycotting country and does not apply to the
foreign concern itself; and
    5. The requirement is imposed by the agency of the boycotting
country responsible for regulating commercial agencies.
    The U.S. person whose agent is complying with the registration
requirement continues to be subject to all the terms of the
Regulations, and may not provide any prohibited information to the
agent for purposes of the agent's compliance with the requirement.
    In addition, the authority granted to the commercial agent or
representative by the U.S. person must be consistent with standard
commercial practices and not involve any grants of authority beyond
those incidental to the commercial sales and distributorship
responsibilities of the agent.
    Because the requirement does not apply to the U.S. person, no
reporting obligation under Sec. 760.5 of this part would arise.
    This interpretation, like all others issued by the Department
discussing applications of the antiboycott provisions of the Export
Administration Regulations, should be read narrowly. Circumstances
that differ in any material way from those discussed in this notice
will be considered under the applicable provisions of the
Regulations. Persons are particularly advised not to seek to apply
this interpretation to circumstances in which U.S. principals seek
to use agents to deal with boycott-related or potential blacklisting
situations.

Supplement No. 13 to Part 760--Interpretation

Summary

    This interpretation considers boycott-based contractual language
dealing with the selection of suppliers and subcontractors. While
this language borrows terms from the ``unilateral and specific
selection'' exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part, it
fails to meet the requirements of that exception. Compliance with
the requirements of the language constitutes a violation of the
regulatory prohibition of boycott-based refusals to do business.

Regulatory Background

    Section 760.2(a) of this part prohibits U.S. persons from
refusing or knowingly agreeing to refuse to do business with other
persons when such refusal is pursuant to an agreement with,
requirement of, or request of a boycotting country. That prohibition
does not extend to the performance of management, procurement or
other pre-award services, however, notwithstanding knowledge that
the ultimate selection may be boycott-based. To be permissible such
services: (1) Must be customary for the firm or industry involved
and (2) must not exclude others from the transaction or involve
other actions based on the boycott. See Sec. 760.2(a)(6) of this
part, ``Refusals to Do Business'', and example (xiii).
    A specific exception is also made in the Regulations for
compliance (and agreements to comply) with a unilateral and specific
selection of suppliers or subcontractors by a boycotting country
buyer. See Sec. 760.3(d) of this part. In Supplement No. 1 to part
760, the following form of contractual language was said to fall
within that exception for compliance with unilateral and specific
selection:
    The Government of the boycotting country (or the First Party),
in its exclusive power, reserves its right to make the final
unilateral and specific selection of any proposed carriers,
insurers, suppliers of services to be performed within the
boycotting country, or of specific goods to be furnished in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract.
    The Department noted that the actual steps necessary to comply
with any selection made under this agreement would also have to meet
the requirements of Sec. 760.3(c) of this part to claim the benefit
of that exception. In other words, the discretion in selecting would
have to be exercised exclusively by the boycotting country customer
and the selection would have to be stated in the affirmative, naming
a particular supplier. See Sec. 760.3(d) (4) and (5) of this part.

Analysis of the New Contractual Language

    The Office of Antiboycott Compliance has learned of the
introduction of a new contractual clause into tender documents
issued by boycotting country governments. This clause is, in many
respects, similar to that dealt with in Supplement No. 1 to part
760, but several critical differences exist.
    The clause states:

Boycott of Boycotted Country

    In connection with the performance of this Agreement, Contractor
acknowledges that the import and customs laws and regulations of
boycotting country apply to the furnishing and shipment of any
products or components thereof to boycotting country. The Contractor
specifically acknowledges that the

[[Page 12898]]
aforementioned import and customs laws and regulations of boycotting
country prohibit, among other things, the importation into
boycotting country of products or components thereof: (A)
Originating in boycotted country; (B) Manufactured, produced and
furnish by companies organized under the laws of boycotted country;
and (C) Manufactured, produced or furnished by Nationals or
Residents of boycotted country.
    The Government, in its exclusive power, reserves its right to
make the final unilateral and specific selection of any proposed
Carriers, Insurers, Suppliers of Services to be performed within
boycotting country or of specific goods to be furnished in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Contract.
    To assist the Government in exercising its right under the
preceding paragraph, Contractor further agrees to provide a complete
list of names and addresses of all his Sub-Contractors, Suppliers,
Vendors and Consultants and any other suppliers of the service for
the project.
    The title of this clause makes clear that its provisions are
intended to be boycott-related. The first paragraph acknowledges the
applicability of certain boycott-related requirements of the
boycotting country's laws in language reviewed in part 760,
Supplement No. 1, Part II.B. and found to constitute a permissible
agreement under the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(a) of this
part for compliance with the import requirements of a boycotting
country. The second and third paragraphs together deal with the
procedure for selecting subcontractors and suppliers of services and
goods and, in the context of the clause as a whole, must be regarded
as motivated by boycott considerations and intended to enable the
boycotting country government to make boycott-based selections,
including the elimination of blacklisted subcontractors and
suppliers.
    The question is whether the incorporation into these paragraphs
of some language from the ``unilateral and specific selection''
clause approved in Supplement No. 1 to part 760 suffices to take the
language outside Sec. 760.2(a) of this part's prohibition on
boycott-based agreements to refuse to do business. While the first
sentence of this clause is consistent with the language discussed in
Supplement No. 1 to part 760, the second sentence significantly
alters the effect of this clause. The effect is to draw the
contractor into the decision-making process, thereby destroying the
unilateral character of the selection by the buyer. By agreeing to
submit the names of the suppliers it plans to use, the contractor is
agreeing to give the boycotting country buyer, who has retained the
right of final selection, the ability to reject, for boycott-related
reasons, any supplier the contractor has already chosen. Because the
requirement appears in the contractual provision dealing with the
boycott, the buyer's rejection of any supplier whose name is given
to the buyer pursuant to this provision would be presumed to be
boycott-based. By signing the contract, and thereby agreeing to
comply with all of its provisions, the contractor must either accept
the buyer's rejection of any supplier, which is presumed to be
boycott-based because of the context of this provision, or breach
the contract.
    In these circumstances, the contractor's method of choosing its
subcontractors and suppliers, in anticipation of the buyer's
boycott-based review, cannot be considered a permissible pre-award
service because of the presumed intrusion of boycott-based criteria
into the selection process. Thus, assuming all other jurisdictional
requirements necessary to establish a violation of part 760 are met,
the signing of the contract by the contractor constitutes a
violation of Sec. 760.2(a) of this part because he is agreeing to
refuse to do business for boycott reasons.
    The apparent attempt to bring this language within the exception
for compliance with unilateral and specific selections is
ineffective. The language does not place the discretion to choose
suppliers in the hands of the boycotting country buyer but divides
this discretion between the buyer and his principal contractor.
Knowing that the buyer will not accept a boycotted company as
supplier or subcontractor, the contractor is asked to use his
discretion in selecting a single supplier or subcontractor for each
element of the contract. The boycotting country buyer exercises
discretion only through accepting or rejecting the selected supplier
or contractor as its boycott policies require. In these
circumstances it cannot be said that the buyer is exercising right
of unilateral and specific selection which meets the criteria of
Sec. 760.3(c) of this part. For this reason, agreement to the
contractual language discussed here would constitute an agreement to
refuse to do business with any person rejected by the buyer and
would violate Sec. 760.2(a) of this part.

Supplement No. 14 to Part 760--Interpretation

    (a) Contractual clause concerning import, customs and boycott
laws of a boycotting country.
    The following language has appeared in tender documents issued
by a boycotting country:
    Supplier declares his knowledge of the fact that the import,
Customs and boycott laws, rules and regulations of [name of
boycotting country] apply in importing to [name of boycotting
country].
    Supplier declares his knowledge of the fact that under these
laws, rules and regulations, it is prohibited to import into [name
of the boycotting country] any products or parts thereof that
originated in [name of boycotted country]; were manufactured,
produced or imported by companies formed under the laws of [name of
boycotted country]; or were manufactured, produced or imported by
nationals or residents of [name of boycotted country].
    Agreeing to the above contractual language is a prohibited
agreement to refuse to do business, under Sec. 760.2(a) of this
part. The first paragraph requires broad acknowledgment of the
application of the boycotting country's boycott laws, rules and
regulations. Unless this language is qualified to apply only to
boycott restrictions with which U.S. persons may comply, agreement
to it is prohibited. See Sec. 760.2(a) of this part, examples (v)
and (vi) under ``Agreement to Refuse to Do Business.''
    The second paragraph does not limit the scope of the boycott
restrictions referenced in the first paragraph. It states that the
boycott laws include restrictions on goods originating in the
boycotted country; manufactured, produced or supplied by companies
organized under the laws of the boycotted country; or manufactured,
produced or supplied by nationals or residents of the boycotted
country. Each of these restrictions is within the exception for
compliance with the import requirements of the boycotting country
(Sec. 760.3(a) of this part). However, the second paragraph's list
of restrictions is not exclusive. Since the boycott laws generally
include more than what is listed and permissible under the
antiboycott law, U.S. persons may not agree to the quoted clause.
For example, a country's boycott laws may prohibit imports of goods
manufactured by blacklisted firms. Except as provided by
Sec. 760.3(g) of this part, agreement to and compliance with this
boycott restriction would be prohibited under the antiboycott law.
    The above contractual language is distinguished from the
contract clause determined to be permissible in supplement 1, Part
II, A, by its acknowledgment that the boycott requirements of the
boycotting country apply. Although the first sentence of the
Supplement 1 clause does not exclude the possible application of
boycott laws, it refers only to the import and customs laws of the
boycotting country without mentioning the boycott laws as well. As
discussed fully in Supplement No. 1 to part 760, compliance with or
agreement to the clause quoted there is, therefore, permissible.
    The contract clause quoted above, as well as the clause dealt
with in Supplement No. 1 to part 760, part II, A, is reportable
under Sec. 760.6(a)(1) of this part.
    (b) Letter of credit terms removing blacklist certificate
requirement if specified vessels used.
    The following terms frequently appear on letters of credit
covering shipment to Iraq:
    Shipment to be effected by Iraqi State Enterprise for Maritime
Transport Vessels or by United Arab Shipping Company (SAB) vessels,
if available.
    If shipment is effected by any of the above company's [sic]
vessels, black list certificate or evidence to that effect is not
required.
    These terms are not reportable and compliance with them is
permissible.
    The first sentence, a directive to use Iraqi State Enterprise
for Maritime Transport or United Arab Shipping vessels, is neither
reportable nor prohibited because it is not considered by the
Department to be boycott-related. The apparent reason for the
directive is Iraq's preference to have cargo shipped on its own
vessels (or, as in the case of United Arab Shipping, on vessels
owned by a company in part established and owned by the Iraqi
government). Such ``cargo preference'' requirements, calling for the
use of an importing or exporting country's own ships, are common
throughout the world and are imposed for non-boycott reasons. (See
Sec. 760.2(a) of this part, example (vii)

[[Page 12899]]
AGREEMENTS TO REFUSE TO DO BUSINESS.)
    In contrast, if the letter of credit contains a list of vessels
or carriers that appears to constitute a boycott-related whitelist,
a directive to select a vessel from that list would be both
reportable and prohibited. When such a directive appears in
conjunction with a term removing the blacklist certificate
requirement if these vessels are used, the Department will presume
that beneficiaries, banks and any other U.S. person receiving the
letter of credit know that there is a boycott-related purpose for
the directive.
    The second sentence of the letter of credit language quoted
above does not, by itself, call for a blacklist certificate and is
not therefore, reportable. If a term elsewhere on the letter of
credit imposes a blacklist certificate requirement, then that other
term would be reportable.
    (c) Information not related to a particular transaction in U.S.
commerce.
    Under Sec. 760.2 (c), (d) and (e), of this part U.S. persons are
prohibited, with respect to their activities in U.S. commerce, from
furnishing certain information. It is the Department's position that
the required nexus with U.S. commerce is established when the
furnishing of information itself occurs in U.S. commerce. Even when
the furnishing of information is not itself in U.S. commerce,
however, the necessary relationship to U.S. commerce will be
established if the furnishing of information relates to particular
transactions in U.S. commerce or to anticipated transactions in U.S.
commerce. See, e.g. Sec. 760.2(d), examples (vii), (ix) and (xii) of
this part.
    The simplest situation occurs where a U.S. person located in the
United States furnishes information to a boycotting country. The
transfer of information from the United States to a foreign country
is itself an activity in U.S. commerce. See Sec. 760.1(d)(1)(iv) of
this part. In some circumstances, the furnishing of information by a
U.S. person located outside the United States may also be an
activity in U.S. commerce. For example, the controlled foreign
subsidiary of a domestic concern might furnish to a boycotting
country information the subsidiary obtained from the U.S.-located
parent for that purpose. The subsidiary's furnishing would, in these
circumstances, constitute an activity in U.S. commerce. See
Sec. 760.1(d)(8) of this part.
    Where the furnishing of information is not itself in U.S.
commerce, the U.S. commerce requirement may be satisfied by the fact
that the furnishing is related to an activity in U.S. foreign or
domestic commerce. For example, if a shipment of goods by a
controlled-in-fact foreign subsidiary of a U.S. company to a
boycotting country gives rise to an inquiry from the boycotting
country concerning the subsidiary's relationship with another firm,
the Department regards any responsive furnishing of information by
the subsidiary as related to the shipment giving rise to the
inquiry. If the shipment is in U.S. foreign or domestic commerce, as
defined by the regulations, then the Department regards the
furnishing to be related to an activity in U.S. commerce and subject
to the antiboycott regulations, whether or not the furnishing itself
is in U.S. commerce.
    In some circumstances, the Department may regard a furnishing of
information as related to a broader category of present and
prospective transactions. For example, if a controlled-in-fact
foreign subsidiary of a U.S. company is requested to furnish
information about its commercial dealings and it appears that
failure to respond will result in its blacklisting, any responsive
furnishing of information will be regarded by the Department as
relating to all of the subsidiary's present and anticipated business
activities with the inquiring boycotting country. Accordingly, if
any of these present or anticipated business activities are in U.S.
commerce, the Department will regard the furnishing as related to an
activity in U.S. commerce and subject to the antiboycott
regulations.
    In deciding whether anticipated business activities will be in
U.S. commerce, the Department will consider all of the surrounding
circumstances. Particular attention will be given to the history of
the U.S. person's business activities with the boycotting country
and others, the nature of any activities occurring after a
furnishing of information occurs and any relevant economic or
commercial factors which may affect these activities.
    For example, if a U.S. person has no activities with the
boycotting country at present but all of its other international
activities are in U.S. commerce, as defined by the Regulations, then
the Department is likely to regard any furnishing of information by
that person for the purpose of securing entry into the boycotting
country's market as relating to anticipated activities in U.S.
commerce and subject to the antiboycott regulations. Similarly, if
subsequent to the furnishing of information to the boycotting
country for the purpose of securing entry into its markets, the U.S.
person engages in transactions with that country which are in U.S.
commerce, the Department is likely to regard the furnishing as
related to an activity in U.S. commerce and subject to the
antiboycott regulations.

Supplement No. 15 to Part 760--Interpretation

    Section 760.2 (c), (d), and (e) of this part prohibits United
States persons from furnishing certain types of information with
intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign
boycott against a country friendly to the United States. The
Department has been asked whether prohibited information may be
transmitted--that is, passed to others by a United States person who
has not directly or indirectly authored the information--without
such transmission constituting a furnishing of information in
violation of Sec. 760.2 (c), (d), and (e) of this part. Throughout
this interpretation, ``transmission'' is defined as the passing on
by one person of information initially authored by another. The
Department believes that there is no distinction in the EAR between
transmitting (as defined above) and furnishing prohibited
information under the EAR and that the transmission of prohibited
information with the requisite boycott intent is a furnishing of
information violative of the EAR. At the same time, however, the
circumstances relating to the transmitting party's involvement will
be carefully considered in determining whether that party intended
to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.
    The EAR does not deal specifically with the relationship between
transmitting and furnishing. However, the restrictions in the EAR on
responses to boycott-related conditions, both by direct and indirect
actions and whether by primary parties or intermediaries, indicate
that U.S. persons who simply transmit prohibited information are to
be treated the same under the EAR as those who both author and
furnish prohibited information. This has been the Department's
position in enforcement actions it has brought.
    The few references in the EAR to the transmission of information
by third parties are consistent with this position. Two examples,
both relating to the prohibition against the furnishing of
information about U.S. persons' race, religion, sex, or national
origin (Sec. 760.2(c) of this part), deal explicitly with
transmitting information. These examples (Sec. 760.2(c) of this
part, example (v), and Sec. 760.3(f) of this part, example (vi))
show that, in certain cases, when furnishing certain information is
permissible, either because it is not within a prohibition or is
excepted from a prohibition, transmitting it is also permissible.
These examples concern information that may be furnished by
individuals about themselves or their families. The examples show
that employers may transmit to a boycotting country visa
applications or forms containing information about an employee's
race, religion, sex, or national origin if that employee is the
source of the information and authorizes its transmission. In other
words, within the limits of ministerial action set forth in these
examples, employees' actions in transmitting information are
protected by the exception available to the employee. The
distinction between permissible and prohibited behavior rests not on
the definitional distinction between furnishing and transmitting,
but on the excepted nature of the information furnished by the
employee. The information originating from the employee does not
lose its excepted character because it is transmitted by the
employer.
    The Department's position regarding the furnishing and
transmission of certificates of one's own blacklist status rests on
a similar basis and does not support the contention that third
parties may transmit prohibited information authored by another.
Such self-certifications do not violate any prohibitions in the EAR
(see Supplement Nos. 1(I)(B), 2, and 5(A)(2); Sec. 760.2(f), example
(xiv)). It is the Department's position that it is not prohibited
for U.S. persons to transmit such self-certifications completed by
others. Once again, because furnishing the self-certification is not
prohibited, third parties who transmit the self-certifications
offend no prohibition. On the other hand, if a third party authored
information about another's blacklist status, the act of
transmitting that information would be prohibited.
    A third example in the EAR (Sec. 760.5, example (xiv) of this
part), which also concerns a permissible transmission of

[[Page 12900]]
boycott-related information, does not support the theory that one may
transmit prohibited information authored by another. This example deals
with the reporting requirements in Sec. 760.5 of this part--not the
prohibitions--and merely illustrates that a person who receives and
transmits a self-certification has not received a reportable request.
    It is also the Department's position that a U.S. person violates
the prohibitions against furnishing information by transmitting
prohibited information even if that person has received no
reportable request in the transaction. For example, where documents
accompanying a letter of credit contain prohibited information, a
negotiating bank that transmits the documents, with the requisite
boycott intent, to an issuing bank has not received a reportable
request, but has furnished prohibited information.
    While the Department does not regard the suggested distinction
between transmitting and furnishing information as meaningful, the
facts relating to the third party's involvement may be important in
determining whether that party furnished information with the
required intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned
foreign boycott. For example, if it is a standard business practice
for one participant in a transaction to obtain and pass on, without
examination, documents prepared by another party, it might be
difficult to maintain that the first participant intended to comply
with a boycott by passing on information contained in the unexamined
documents. Resolution of such intent questions, however, depends
upon an analysis of the individual facts and circumstances of the
transaction and the Department will continue to engage in such
analysis on a case-by-case basis.
    This interpretation, like all others issued by the Department
discussing applications of the antiboycott provisions of the EAR,
should be read narrowly. Circumstances that differ in any material
way from those discussed in this interpretation will be considered
under the applicable provisions of the Regulations.

Supplement No. 16 to Part 760--Interpretation

    Pursuant to Articles 5, 7, and 26 of the Treaty of Peace between
the State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and
implementing legislation enacted by Jordan, Jordan's participation
in the Arab economic boycott of Israel was formally terminated on
August 16, 1995.
    On the basis of this action, it is the Department's position
that certain requests for information, action or agreement from
Jordan which were considered boycott-related by implication now
cannot be presumed boycott-related and thus would not be prohibited
or reportable under the regulations. For example, a request that an
exporter certify that the vessel on which it is shipping its goods
is eligible to enter Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan ports has been
considered a boycott-related request that the exporter could not
comply with because Jordan has had a boycott in force against
Israel. Such a request from Jordan after August 16, 1995 would not
be presumed boycott-related because the underlying boycott
requirement/basis for the certification has been eliminated.
Similarly, a U.S. company would not be prohibited from complying
with a request received from Jordanian government officials to
furnish the place of birth of employees the company is seeking to
take to Jordan because there is no underlying boycott law or policy
that would give rise to a presumption that the request was boycott-
related.
    U.S. persons are reminded that requests that are on their face
boycott-related or that are for action obviously in furtherance or
support of an unsanctioned foreign boycott are subject to the
regulations, irrespective of the country of origin. For example,
requests containing references to ``blacklisted companies'',
``Israel boycott list'', ``non-Israeli goods'' or other phrases or
words indicating boycott purpose would be subject to the appropriate
provisions of the Department's antiboycott regulations.

    The regulated person must maintain the original records in the form
in which that person receives or creates them unless that person meets
all of the conditions of Sec. 762.5 of this part relating to
reproduction of records. If the original record does not meet the
standards of legibility and readability described in Sec. 762.5 of this
part and the regulated person intends to rely on that record to meet
the recordkeeping requirements of the EAR, that person must retain the
original record.

Sec. 762.5   Reproduction of original records.

    (a) The regulated person may maintain reproductions instead of the
original records provided all of the requirements of paragraph (b) of
this section are met.
    (b) In order to maintain the records required by Sec. 762.2 of this
part, the regulated persons defined in Sec. 762.1 of this part may use
any photographic, photostatic, miniature photographic, micrographic,
automated archival storage, or other process that completely,
accurately, legibly and durably reproduces the original records
(whether on paper, microfilm, or through electronic digital storage
techniques). The process must meet all of the following requirements,
which are applicable to all systems:
    (1) The system must be capable of reproducing all records on paper.
    (2) The system must record and be able to reproduce all marks,
information, and other characteristics of the original record,
including both obverse and reverse sides of paper documents in legible
form.
    (3) When displayed on a viewer, monitor, or reproduced on paper,
the records must exhibit a high degree of legibility and readability.
(For purposes of this section, legible and legibility mean the quality
of a letter or numeral that enable the observer to identify it
positively and quickly to the exclusion of all other letters or
numerals. Readable and readability mean the quality of a group of
letters or numerals being recognized as complete words or numbers.)
    (4) The system must preserve the initial image (including both
obverse and reverse sides of paper documents) and record all changes,
who made them and when they were made. This information must be stored
in such a manner that none of it may be altered once it is initially
recorded.
    (5) The regulated person must establish written procedures to
identify the individuals who are responsible for the operation, use and
maintenance of the system.
    (6) The regulated person must establish written procedures for
inspection and quality assurance of records in the system and document
the implementation of those procedures.
    (7) The system must be complete and contain all records required to
be kept by this part or the regulated person must provide a method for
correlating, identifying and locating records relating to the same
transaction(s) that are kept in other record keeping systems.
    (8) The regulated person must keep a record of where, when, by
whom, and on what equipment the records and other information were
entered into the system.
    (9) Upon request by the Office of Export Enforcement, the Office of
Antiboycott Compliance, or any other agency of competent jurisdiction,
the regulated person must furnish, at the examination site, the
records, the equipment and, if necessary, knowledgeable personnel for
locating, reading, and reproducing any record in the system.
    (c) Requirements applicable to systems based on the storage of
digital images. For systems based on the storage of digital images, the
system must provide accessibility to any digital image in the system.
With respect to records of transactions, including those involving
restrictive trade practices or boycott requirements or requests. The
system must be able to locate and reproduce all records relating to a
particular transaction based on any one of the following criteria:

[[Page 12902]]

    (1) The name(s) of the parties to the transaction;
    (2) Any country(ies) connected with the transaction; or
    (3) A document reference number that was on any original document.
    (d) Requirements applicable to a system based on photographic
processes. For systems based on photographic, photostatic, or miniature
photographic processes, the regulated person must maintain a detailed
index of all records in the system that is arranged in such a manner as
to allow immediate location of any particular record in the system.

Sec. 762.6  Period of retention.

    (a) Five year retention period. All records required to be kept by
the EAR must be retained for five years from the latest of the
following times:
    (1) The export from the United States of the item involved in the
transaction to which the records pertain or the provision of financing,
transporting or other service for or on behalf of end-users of
proliferation concern as described in Secs. 736.2(b)(7) and 744.6 of
the EAR;
    (2) Any known reexport, transshipment, or diversion of such item;
    (3) Any other termination of the transaction, whether formally in
writing or by any other means; or
    (4) In the case of records of pertaining to transactions involving
restrictive trade practices or boycotts described in part 760 of the
EAR, the date the regulated person receives the boycott-related request
or requirement.
    (b) Destruction or disposal of records. If the Bureau of Export
Administration or any other government agency makes a formal or
informal request for a certain record or records, such record or
records may not be destroyed or disposed of without the written
authorization of the agency concerned. This prohibition applies to
records pertaining to voluntary disclosures made to BXA in accordance
with Sec. 765.5(c)(4)(ii) and other records even if such records have
been retained for a period of time exceeding that required by paragraph
(a) of this section.

Sec. 762.7  Producing and inspecting records.

    (a) Persons located in the United States. Persons located in the
United States may be asked to produce records that are required to be
kept by any provision of the EAR, or any license, order, or
authorization issued thereunder and to make them available for
inspection and copying by any authorized agent, official, or employee
of the Bureau of Export Administration, the U.S. Customs Service, or
any other agency of the U.S. Government, without any charge or expense
to such agent, official, or employee. The Office of Export Enforcement
and the Office of Antiboycott Compliance encourage voluntary
cooperation with such requests. When voluntary cooperation is not
forthcoming, the Office of Export Enforcement and the Office of
Antiboycott Compliance are authorized to issue subpoenas for books,
records, and other writings. In instances where a person does not
comply with a subpoena, the Department of Commerce may petition a
district court to have a subpoena enforced.
    (b) Persons located outside of the United States. Persons located
outside of the United States that are required to keep records by any
provision of the EAR or by any license, order, or authorization issued
thereunder shall produce all records or reproductions of records
required to be kept, and make them available for inspection and copying
upon request by an authorized agent, official, or employee of the
Bureau of Export Administration, the U.S. Customs Service, or a Foreign
Service post, or by any other accredited representative of the U.S.
Government, without any charge or expense to such agent, official or
employee.

any representation, statement, or certification must notify BXA and any
other relevant agency, in writing, of any change of any material fact
or intention from that previously represented, stated, or certified,
immediately upon receipt of any information that would lead a
reasonably prudent person to know that a change of material fact or
intention has occurred or may occur in the future.
    (h) Evasion. No person may engage in any transaction or take any
other action with intent to evade the provisions of the EAA, the EAR,
or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder.

liability, sanction, or penalty available under law. The protective
administrative measures that are described in Sec. 764.6 of this part
are distinct from administrative sanctions.

    \1\ In the event that any part of the EAR is not under the
authority of the EAA, sanctions shall be limited to those provided
for by such other authority, but the provisions of this part and of
part 766 of the EAR shall apply insofar as not inconsistent with
that other authority.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Civil penalty. (i) A civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 may be
imposed for each violation, except that a civil penalty not to exceed
$100,000 may be imposed for each violation involving national security
controls imposed under section 5 of the EAA.
    (ii) The payment of any civil penalty may be made a condition, for
a period not exceeding one year after the imposition of such penalty,
to the granting, restoration, or continuing validity of any export
license, License Exception, permission, or privilege granted or to be
granted to the person upon whom such penalty is imposed.
    (iii) The payment of any civil penalty may be deferred or suspended
in whole or in part during any probation period that may be imposed.
Such deferral or suspension shall not bar the collection of the penalty
if the conditions of the deferral, suspension, or probation are not
fulfilled.
    (2) Denial of export privileges. An order may be issued that
restricts the ability of the named persons to engage in export and
reexport transactions involving items subject to the EAR, or that
restricts access by named persons to items subject to the EAR. An order
denying export privileges may be imposed either as a sanction for a
violation specified in this part or as a protective administrative
measure described in Sec. 764.6(c) or (d) of this part. An order
denying export privileges may suspend or revoke any or all outstanding
licenses issued under the EAR to a person named in the denial order or
in which such person has an interest, may deny or restrict exports and
reexports by or to such person of any item subject to the EAR, and may
restrict dealings in which that person may benefit from any export or
reexport of such items. The standard terms of a denial order are set
forth in Supplement No. 1 to this part. A non-standard denial order,
narrower in scope, may be issued. Authorization to engage in actions
otherwise prohibited by a denial order may be given by the Office of
Exporter Services, in consultation with the Office of Export
Enforcement, following application by a person named in the denial
order or by a person seeking permission to deal with a named person.
    (3) Exclusion from practice. Any person acting as an attorney,
accountant, consultant, freight forwarder, or in any other
representative capacity for any license application or other matter
before BXA may be excluded by order from any or all such activities
before BXA.
    (b) Criminal.\2\ (1) General. Except as provided in paragraph
(b)(2) of this section, whoever knowingly violates or conspires to or
attempts to violate the EAA, the EAR, or any order or license issued
thereunder, shall be fined not more than five times the value of the
exports involved or $50,000, whichever is greater, or imprisoned not
more than five years, or both.

    \2\ In the event that any part of the EAR is not under the
authority of the EAA, sanctions shall be limited to those provided
for by such other authority or by 18 U.S.C. 3571, a criminal code
provision that establishes a maximum criminal fine for a felony that
is the greater of the amount provided by the statute that was
violated, or an amount not more than $500,000 for an organization.
The Federal Sentencing Guidelines found in Sec. 2M5.1 of Appendix 4
to Title 18 of the United States Code apply, to the extent followed
by the court, to sentencing for convictions for violating the EAA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Willful violations. (i) Whoever willfully violates or conspires
to or attempts to violate any provision of the EAA, the EAR, or any
order or license issued thereunder, with knowledge that the exports
involved will be used for the benefit of, or that the destination or
intended destination of the items involved is, any controlled country
or any country to which exports are controlled for foreign policy
purposes, except in the case of an individual, shall be fined not more
than five times the value of the export involved or $1,000,000,
whichever is greater; and, in the case of an individual, shall be fined
not more than $250,000, or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.
    (ii) Any person who is issued a license under the EAA or the EAR
for the export of any items to a controlled country and who, with
knowledge that such export is being used by such controlled country for
military or intelligence gathering purposes contrary to the conditions
under which the license was issued, willfully fails to report such use
to the Secretary of Defense, except in the case of an individual, shall
be fined not more than five times the value of the exports involved or
$1,000,000, whichever is greater; and, in the case of an individual,
shall be fined not more than $250,000, or imprisoned not more than five
years, or both.
    (iii) Any person who possesses any item with intent to export such
item in violation of an export control imposed under sections 5 or 6 of
the EAA, the EAR, or any order or license issued thereunder, or knowing
or having reason to believe that the item would be so exported, shall,
in the case of a violation of an export control imposed under section 5
of the EAA (or the EAR, or any order or license issued

[[Page 12904]]
thereunder with respect to such control), be subject to the penalties
set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and shall, in the case
of a violation of an export control imposed under section 6 of the EAA
(or the EAR, or any order or license issued thereunder with respect to
such control), be subject to the penalties set forth in paragraph
(b)(1) of this section.
    (iv) Any person who takes any action with intent to evade the
provisions of the EAA, the EAR, or any order or license issued
thereunder, shall be subject to the penalties set forth in paragraph
(b)(1) of this section, except that in the case of an evasion of an
export control imposed under sections 5 or 6 of the EAA (or the EAR, or
any order or license issued thereunder with respect to such control),
such person shall be subject to the penalties set forth in paragraph
(b)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) Other criminal sanctions. Conduct that constitutes a violation
of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued
thereunder, or that occurs in connection with such a violation, may
also be prosecuted under other provisions of law, including 18 U.S.C.
371 (conspiracy), 18 U.S.C. 1001 (false statements), 18 U.S.C. 1341,
1343, and 1346 (mail and wire fraud), and 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957
(money laundering).
    (c) Other sanctions. Conduct that violates the EAA, the EAR, or any
order, license or authorization issued thereunder, and other conduct
specified in the EAA may be subject to sanctions or other measures in
addition to criminal and administrative sanctions under the EAA or EAR.
These include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) Statutory sanctions. Statutorily-mandated sanctions may be
imposed on account of specified conduct related to weapons
proliferation. Such statutory sanctions are not civil or criminal
penalties, but restrict imports and procurement (See section 11A of the
EAA, Multilateral Export Control Violations, and section 11C of the
EAA, Chemical and Biological Weapons Proliferation), or restrict export
licenses (See section 11B of the EAA, Missile Proliferation Violations,
and the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992).
    (2) Other sanctions and measures. (i) Seizure and forfeiture. Items
that have been, are being, or are intended to be, exported or shipped
from or taken out of the United States in violation of the EAA, the
EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder, are
subject to being seized and detained as are the vessels, vehicles, and
aircraft carrying such items. Seized items are subject to forfeiture.
(50 U.S.C. app. 2411(g); 22 U.S.C. 401.)
    (ii) Cross-debarment. (A) The Department of State may deny licenses
or approvals for the export or reexport of defense articles and defense
services controlled under the Arms Export Control Act to persons
indicted or convicted of specified criminal offenses, including
violations of the EAA, or to persons denied export privileges by BXA or
another agency. (22 CFR 126.7(a) and 127.11(a).)
    (B) The Department of Defense, among other agencies, may suspend
the right of any person to contract with the United States Government
based on export control violations. (Federal Acquisition Regulations
9.407-2.)

Sec. 764.4  Reporting of violations.

    (a) Where to report. If a person learns that an export control
violation of the EAR has occurred or may occur, that person may notify:

Office of Export Enforcement, Bureau of Export Administration,U.S.
Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Room
H-4520, Washington, D.C. 20230, Tel: (202) 482-1208, Facsimile: (202)
482-0964

or, for violations of part 760 of the EAR:

Office of Antiboycott Compliance, Bureau of Export Administration, U.S.
Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Room
H-6099C, Washington, D.C. 20230, Tel: (202) 482-2381, Facsimile: (202)
482-0913.
    (b) Failure to report violations. Failure to report potential
violations may result in the unwarranted issuance of licenses or
exports without the required licenses to the detriment of the interests
of the United States.
    (c) Reporting requirement distinguished. The reporting provisions
in paragraph (a) of this section are not ``reporting requirements''
within the meaning of Sec. 764.2(i) of this part.

Sec. 764.5  Voluntary self-disclosure.

    (a) General policy. BXA strongly encourages disclosure to OEE if
you believe that you may have violated the EAR, or any order, license
or authorization issued thereunder. Voluntary self-disclosure is a
mitigating factor in determining what administrative sanctions, if any,
will be sought by OEE.
    (b) Limitations.
    (1) The provisions of this section do not apply to disclosures of
violations relating to part 760 of the EAR.
    (2) The provisions of this section apply only when information is
provided to OEE for its review in determining whether to take
administrative action under part 766 of the EAR for violations of the
export control provisions of the EAR.
    (3) The provisions of this section apply only when information is
received by OEE for review prior to the time that OEE, or any other
agency of the United States Government, has learned the same or
substantially similar information from another source and has commenced
an investigation or inquiry in connection with that information.
    (4) While voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor in
determining what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought by
OEE, it is a factor that is considered together with all other factors
in a case. The weight given to voluntary self-disclosure is solely
within the discretion of OEE, and the mitigating effect of voluntary
self-disclosure may be outweighed by aggravating factors. Voluntary
self-disclosure does not prevent transactions from being referred to
the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. In such a case, OEE
would notify the Department of Justice of the voluntary self-
disclosure, but the consideration of that factor is within the
discretion of the Department of Justice.
    (5) A firm will not be deemed to have made a disclosure under this
section unless the individual making the disclosure did so with the
full knowledge and authorization of the firm's senior management.
    (6) The provisions of this section do not, nor should they be
relied on to, create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits,
privileges, or protection enforceable at law or in equity by any
person, business, or entity in any civil, criminal, administrative, or
other matter.
    (c) Information to be provided.
    (1) General. Any person wanting to disclose information that
constitutes a voluntary self-disclosure should, in the manner outlined
below, initially notify OEE as soon as possible after violations are
discovered, and then conduct a thorough review of all export-related
transactions where violations are suspected.
    (2) Initial notification.
    (i) The initial notification should be in writing and be sent to
one of the addresses in Sec. 764.5(c)(7) of this part. The notification
should include the name of the person making the disclosure and a brief
description of the suspected violations. The notification should
describe the general nature and extent of the violations. If the person
making the disclosure subsequently

[[Page 12905]]
completes the narrative account required by Sec. 764.5(c)(3) of this
part, the disclosure will be deemed to have been made on the date of
the initial notification for purposes of Sec. 764.5(b)(3) of this part.
    (ii) OEE recognizes that there may be situations where it will not
be practical to make an initial notification in writing. For example,
written notification may not be practical if a shipment leaves the
United States without the required license, yet there is still an
opportunity to prevent acquisition of the items by unauthorized
persons. In such situations, OEE should be contacted promptly at one of
the offices listed in Sec. 764.5(c)(7) of this part.
    (3) Narrative account. After the initial notification, a thorough
review should be conducted of all export-related transactions where
possible violations are suspected. OEE recommends that the review cover
a period of five years prior to the date of the initial notification.
If your review goes back less than five years, you risk failing to
discover violations that may later become the subject of an
investigation. Any violations not voluntarily disclosed do not receive
consideration under this section. However, the failure to make such
disclosures will not be treated as a separate violation unless some
other section of the EAR or other provision of law requires disclosure.
Upon completion of the review, OEE should be furnished with a narrative
account that sufficiently describes the suspected violations so that
their nature and gravity can be assessed. The narrative account should
also describe the nature of the review conducted and measures that may
have been taken to minimize the likelihood that violations will occur
in the future. The narrative account should include:
    (i) The kind of violation involved, for example, a shipment without
the required license or dealing with a party denied export privileges;
    (ii) An explanation of when and how the violations occurred;
    (iii) The complete identities and addresses of all individuals and
organizations, whether foreign or domestic, involved in the activities
giving rise to the violations;
    (iv) License numbers;
    (v) The description, quantity, value in U.S. dollars and ECCN or
other classification of the items involved; and
    (vi) A description of any mitigating circumstances.
    (4) Supporting documentation.
    (i) The narrative account should be accompanied by copies of
documents that explain and support it, including:
    (A) Licensing documents such as licenses, license applications,
import certificates and end-user statements;
    (B) Shipping documents such as Shipper's Export Declarations, air
waybills and bills of lading; and
    (C) Other documents such as letters, facsimiles, telexes and other
evidence of written or oral communications, internal memoranda,
purchase orders, invoices, letters of credit and brochures.
    (ii) Any relevant documents not attached to the narrative account
must be retained by the person making the disclosure until OEE requests
them, or until a final decision on the disclosed information has been
made. After a final decision, the documents should be handled in
accordance with the recordkeeping rules in part 762 of the EAR.
    (5) Certification. A certification must be submitted stating that
all of the representations made in connection with the voluntary self-
disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge
and belief. Certifications made by a corporation or other organization
should be signed by an official of the corporation or other
organization with the authority to do so. Section 764.2(g) of this
part, relating to false or misleading representations, applies in
connection with the disclosure of information under this section.
    (6) Oral presentations. OEE believes that oral presentations are
generally not necessary to augment the written narrative account and
supporting documentation. If the person making the disclosure believes
otherwise, a request for a meeting should be included with the
disclosure.
    (7) Where to make voluntary self-disclosures. The information
constituting a voluntary self-disclosure or any other correspondence
pertaining to a voluntary self-disclosure may be submitted to:

Office of Export Enforcement, Director, Intelligence Division, U.S.
Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 70, Washington, D.C. 20044

    (d) Action by the Office of Export Enforcement. After OEE has been
provided with the required narrative and supporting documentation, it
will acknowledge the disclosure by letter, provide the person making
the disclosure with a point of contact, and take whatever additional
action, including further investigation, it deems appropriate. As
quickly as the facts and circumstances of a given case permit, OEE may
take any of the following actions:
    (1) Inform the person making the disclosure that, based on the
facts disclosed, it plans to take no action;
    (2) Issue a warning letter;
    (3) Issue a proposed charging letter pursuant to Sec. 766.18 of the
EAR and attempt to settle the matter;
    (4) Issue a charging letter pursuant to Sec. 766.3 of the EAR if a
settlement is not reached; and/or
    (5) Refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal
prosecution.
    (e) Criteria. For purposes of determining what administrative
action to take and what sanctions, if any, to

[[Page 12906]]
seek, the fact that a voluntary self-disclosure has been made will be a
mitigating factor. OEE will take that factor into account along with
other mitigating and aggravating factors when determining what, if any,
administrative sanctions should be imposed. The factors that OEE will
consider are in its sole discretion, but may include:
    (1) The extent to which the purpose of the control is undermined by
the transaction;
    (2) Whether the transaction would have been authorized had proper
application been made;
    (3) The quantity and value of the items involved;
    (4) Why the violations occurred. For example, OEE may consider
whether the violations were intentional or inadvertent; the degree to
which the person responsible for the violation making the disclosure
was familiar with the EAR; and whether the violator has been the
subject of prior administrative or criminal action under the EAA or the
EAR;
    (5) Whether, as a result of the information provided, OEE is able
to prevent any items exported illegally from reaching unauthorized
persons or destinations;
    (6) The degree of cooperation with the ensuing investigation;
    (7) Whether the person has instituted or improved an internal
compliance program to reduce the likelihood of future violations.
    (f) Treatment of unlawfully exported items after voluntary self-
disclosure.
    (1) Any person taking certain actions with knowledge that a
violation of the EAA or the EAR has occurred has violated Sec. 764.2(e)
of this part. Any person who has made a voluntary self-disclosure knows
that a violation may have occurred. Therefore, at the time that a
voluntary self-disclosure is made, the person making the disclosure may
request permission from BXA to engage in the activities described in
Sec. 764.2(e) of this part that would otherwise be prohibited. If the
request is granted by the Office of Exporter Services in consultation
with OEE, future activities with respect to those items that would
otherwise violate Sec. 764.2(e) of this part will not constitute
violations. However, even if permission is granted, the person making
the voluntary self-disclosure is not absolved from liability for any
violations disclosed nor relieved of the obligation to obtain any
required reexport authorizations.
    (2) A license to reexport items that are the subject of a voluntary
self-disclosure, and that have been exported contrary to the provisions
of the EAA or the EAR, may be requested from BXA in accordance with the
provisions of part 748 of the EAR. If the applicant for reexport
authorization knows that the items are the subject of a voluntary self-
disclosure, the request should state that a voluntary self-disclosure
was made in connection with the export of the commodities for which
reexport authorization is sought.

Sec. 764.6  Protective administrative measures.

    (a) License Exception limitation. As provided in Sec. 740.2(b) of
the EAR , all License Exceptions are subject to revision, suspension,
or revocation.
    (b) Revocation or suspension of licenses. As provided in Sec. 750.8
of the EAR, all licenses are subject to revision, suspension, or
revocation.
    (c) Temporary denial orders. BXA may, in accordance with
Sec. 766.24 of the EAR, issue an order temporarily denying export
privileges when such an order is necessary in the public interest to
prevent the occurrence of an imminent violation.
    (d) Denial based on criminal conviction. BXA may, in accordance
with Sec. 766.25 of the EAR, issue an order denying the export
privileges of any person who has been convicted of an offense specified
in Sec. 11(h) of the EAA.

Supplement No. 1 To Part 764--Standard Terms of Orders Denying Export
Privileges

    (a) General. Orders denying export privileges may be ``standard''
or ``non-standard.'' This Supplement specifies terms of the standard
order denying export privileges. All denial orders are published in the
Federal Register. The failure by any person to comply with any denial
order is a violation of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).
(See General Prohibition Four at Sec. 736.2(b)(4) of the EAR;
Sec. 764.2(k) of this part.) All persons whose export privileges are
denied by any form of denial order are identified on the Denied Persons
List (Supplement No. 2 to this part), with an indication of whether an
order is standard or non-standard denoted in the ``Terms of order''
column. The Denied Persons List also tells you where each denial order
can be found in the Federal Register. Reference should be made to the
text of the denial order, as published in the Federal Register, to
learn the scope of any denial order, including any non-standard denial
order.
    Denial orders issued prior to March 25, 1996, are to be construed,
insofar as possible, as having the same scope and effect as the
standard denial order.
    The introduction to each denial order shall be specific to that
order, and shall include: (1) The name and address of any denied
persons and any related persons subject to the denial order; (2) the
basis for the denial order, such as final decision following charges of
violation, settlement agreement, Sec. 11(h) of the EAA, or temporary
denial order request; (3) the period of denial, the effective date of
the order, whether and for how long any portion of the denial of export
privileges is suspended, and any conditions of probation; and (4)
whether any or all outstanding licenses issued under the EAR to the
person(s) named in the denial order or in which such person(s) has an
interest, are suspended or revoked.
    (b) Standard text.
    The standard denial order shall provide:
    ``It is therefore ordered:
    First, that [the denied person(s)] may not, directly or indirectly,
participate in any way in any transaction involving any commodity,
software or technology (hereinafter collectively referred to as
``item'') exported or to be exported from the United States that is
subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), or in any other
activity subject to the EAR, including, but not limited to:
    A. Applying for, obtaining, or using any license, License
Exception, or export control document;
    B. Carrying on negotiations concerning, or ordering, buying,
receiving, using, selling, delivering, storing, disposing of,
forwarding, transporting, financing, or otherwise servicing in any way,
any transaction involving any item exported or to be exported from the
United States that is subject to the EAR, or in any other activity
subject to the EAR; or
    C. Benefiting in any way from any transaction involving any item
exported or to be exported from the United States that is subject to
the EAR, or in any other activity subject to the EAR.
    Second, that no person may, directly or indirectly, do any of the
following:
    A. Export or reexport to or on behalf of the denied person any item
subject to the EAR;
    B. Take any action that facilitates the acquisition or attempted
acquisition by a denied person of the ownership, possession, or control
of any item subject to the EAR that has been or will be exported from
the United States, including financing or other support activities
related to a transaction whereby a denied person acquires or attempts
to acquire such ownership, possession or control;
    C. Take any action to acquire from or to facilitate the acquisition
or attempted acquisition from the denied person of

[[Page 12907]]
any item subject to the EAR that has been exported from the United
States;
    D. Obtain from the denied person in the United States any item
subject to the EAR with knowledge or reason to know that the item will
be, or is intended to be, exported from the United States; or
    E. Engage in any transaction to service any item subject to the EAR
that has been or will be exported from the United States and which is
owned, possessed or controlled by a denied person, or service any item,
of whatever origin, that is owned, possessed or controlled by a denied
person if such service involves the use of any item subject to the EAR
that has been or will be exported from the United States. For purposes
of this paragraph, servicing means installation, maintenance, repair,
modification or testing.
    Third, that, after notice and opportunity for comment as provided
in Sec. 766.23 of the EAR, any person, firm, corporation, or business
organization related to the denied person by affiliation, ownership,
control, or position of responsibility in the conduct of trade or
related services may also be made subject to the provisions of this
order.
    Fourth, that this order does not prohibit any export, reexport, or
other transaction subject to the EAR where the only items involved that
are subject to the EAR are the foreign-produced direct product of U.S.-
origin technology.
    This order, which constitutes the final agency action in this
matter, is effective immediately.''

Supplement No. 2 To Part 764--Denied Persons List

    (a) General.
    (1) The Denied Persons List identifies those persons denied export
privileges by the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) pursuant to the
terms of an order. Part A of the Denied Persons List lists all denied
persons in alphabetical order and provides supplementary information,
while Part B lists all denied persons by geographic area. Part A of the
Denied Persons List is organized into five columns, including the name
and address of the denied person, the effective and expiration dates of
the order, a brief description of the terms of the order, and a
citation to the Federal Register where the terms of the order can be
located. Reference should always be made to the text of a denial order
when using the Denied Persons List.
    (2) Denial orders issued subsequent to March 25, 1996, shall be
identified in part A as being standard or non-standard, and denial
orders issued prior to March 25, 1996, shall be construed, insofar as
possible, as having the same scope and effect as the standard denial
order. Non-standard orders are denoted by the phrase ``non-standard''
in the ``Terms of order'' column in part A, standard orders are denoted
by the word ``standard,'' and orders issued prior to March 25, 1996,
are denoted by the same brief description entered at the time of
issuance. Standard orders denying export privileges contain the
standard terms set forth in Supplement No. 1 to part 764.
    (3) You are responsible for ensuring that you take no action
involving items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
that is contrary to the terms of a denial order.
    (b) Related persons. Related persons who are denied export
privileges subsequent to [the effective date of the interim EAR] shall
appear in part A of the Denied Persons List with a note identifying the
denied persons to whom they are related in the column entitled ``Terms
of order.''
    (c) Publication. New and amended denial orders are published in the
Federal Register as they are issued. This publication constitutes
official notice to the public.
    (d) Updates and availability.
    (1) As a convenience for the public, issuance of denial orders is
announced in Export Administration Bulletins. Part A of the Denied
Persons List is also available electronically on two bulletin boards of
Department of Commerce agencies, Fedworld (National Technical
Information Service) and the Economic Bulletin Board (Economics and
Statistics Administration).

Sec. 766.1 Scope.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR
chapter VII, subchapter C. This part describes the procedures for
imposing administrative sanctions for violations of the Export
Administration Act of 1979, as amended (the EAA), the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR), or any order, license or
authorization issued thereunder. Parts 760 and 764 of the EAR specify
those actions that constitute violations, and part 764 describes the
sanctions that apply. In addition to describing the procedures for
imposing sanctions, this part describes the procedures for imposing
temporary denial orders to prevent imminent violations of the EAA, the
EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. This
part also describes the procedures for taking the discretionary
protective administrative action of denying the export privileges of
persons who have been convicted of violating any of the statutes,
including the EAA, listed in section 11(h) of the EAA. Nothing in this
part shall be construed as applying to or limiting other administrative
or enforcement action relating to the EAA or the EAR, including the
exercise of any investigative authorities conferred by the EAA. This
part does not confer any procedural rights or impose any requirements
based on the Administrative Procedure Act for proceedings charging
violations under the EAA, except as expressly provided for in this
part.

Sec. 766.2  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the following definitions apply:
    Administrative law judge. The person authorized to conduct hearings
in administrative enforcement proceedings brought under the EAA or to
hear appeals from the imposition of temporary denial orders. The term
``judge'' may be used for brevity when it is clear that the reference
is to the administrative law judge.
    Assistant Secretary. The Assistant Secretary for Export
Enforcement, Bureau of Export Administration.
    Bureau of Export Administration (BXA). Bureau of Export
Administration, United States

[[Page 12908]]
Department of Commerce, and all of its component units, including, in
particular for purposes of this part, the Office of Antiboycott
Compliance, the Office of Export Enforcement, and the Office of
Exporter Services.
    Final decision. A decision or order assessing a civil penalty,
denial of export privileges or other sanction, or otherwise disposing
of or dismissing a case, which is not subject to further review under
this part, but which is subject to collection proceedings or judicial
review in an appropriate Federal district court as authorized by law.
    Initial decision. A decision of the administrative law judge in
proceedings involving violations relating to part 760 of the EAR, which
is subject to appellate review by the Under Secretary for Export
Administration, but which becomes the final decision in the absence of
such an appeal.
    Party. BXA and any person named as a respondent under this part.
    Recommended decision. A decision of the administrative law judge in
proceedings involving violations other than those relating to part 760
of the EAR, which is subject to review by the Under Secretary of
Commerce for Export Administration, who issues a written order
affirming, modifying or vacating the recommended decision.
    Respondent. Any person named as the subject of a charging letter,
proposed charging letter, temporary denial order, or other order
proposed or issued under this part.
    Under Secretary. The Under Secretary for Export Administration,

Sec. 766.3  Institution of administrative enforcement proceedings.

    (a) Charging letters. The Director of the Office of Export
Enforcement <SUP>1 (OEE) or the Director of the Office of Antiboycott
Compliance (OAC), as appropriate, may begin administrative enforcement
proceedings under this part by issuing a charging letter in the name of
BXA. The charging letter shall constitute the formal complaint and will
state that there is reason to believe that a violation of the EAA, the
EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder, has
occurred. It will set forth the essential facts about the alleged
violation, refer to the specific regulatory or other provisions
involved, and give notice of the sanctions available under part 764 of
the EAR. The charging letter will inform the respondent that failure to
answer the charges as provided in Sec. 766.6 of this part will be
treated as a default under Sec. 766.7 of this part, that the respondent
is entitled to a hearing if a written demand for one is requested with
the answer, and that the respondent may be represented by counsel, or
by other authorized representative who has a power of attorney to
represent the respondent. A copy of the charging letter shall be filed
with the administrative law judge, which filing shall toll the running
of the applicable statute of limitations. Charging letters may be
amended or supplemented at any time before an answer is filed, or, with
permission of the administrative law judge, afterwards. BXA may
unilaterally withdraw charging letters at any time, by notifying the
respondent and the administrative law judge.

    \1\ By agreement with the Director of the Office of Strategic
Industries and Economic Resource Administration, the Director of the
Office of Export Enforcement enforces short supply controls imposed
under section 7 of the EAA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Notice of issuance of charging letter instituting
administrative enforcement proceeding. A respondent shall be notified
of the issuance of a charging letter, or any amendment or supplement
thereto:
    (1) By mailing a copy by registered or certified mail addressed to
the respondent at the respondent's last known address;
    (2) By leaving a copy with the respondent or with an officer, a
managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment
or by law to receive service of process for the respondent; or
    (3) By leaving a copy with a person of suitable age and discretion
who resides at the respondent's last known dwelling.
    (4) Delivery of a copy of the charging letter, if made in the
manner described in paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, shall be
evidenced by a certificate of service signed by the person making such
service, stating the method of service and the identity of the person
with whom the charging letter was left. The certificate of service
shall be filed with the administrative law judge.
    (c) Date. The date of service of notice of the issuance of a
charging letter instituting an administrative enforcement proceeding,
or service of notice of the issuance of a supplement or amendment to a
charging letter, is the date of its delivery, or of its attempted
delivery if delivery is refused.

Sec. 766.4  Representation.

    A respondent individual may appear and participate in person, a
corporation by a duly authorized officer or employee, and a partnership
by a partner. If a respondent is represented by counsel, counsel shall
be a member in good standing of the bar of any State, Commonwealth or
Territory of the United States, or of the District of Columbia, or be
licensed to practice law in the country in which counsel resides if not
the United States. A respondent personally, or through counsel or other
representative, shall file a notice of appearance with the
administrative law judge. BXA will be represented by the Office of
Chief Counsel for Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.

Sec. 766.5  Filing and service of papers other than charging letter.

    (a) Filing. All papers to be filed shall be addressed to ``EAR
Administrative Enforcement Proceedings,'' U.S. Department of Commerce,
Room H-6716, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20230, or such other place as the administrative law judge may
designate. Filing by United States mail, first class postage prepaid,
by express or equivalent parcel delivery service, or by hand delivery,
is acceptable. Filing by mail from a foreign country shall be by
airmail. In addition, the administrative law judge may authorize filing
of papers by facsimile or other electronic means, provided that a hard
copy of any such paper is subsequently filed. A copy of each paper
filed shall be simultaneously served on each party.
    (b) Service. Service shall be made by personal delivery or by
mailing one copy of each paper to each party in the proceeding. Service
by delivery service or facsimile, in the manner set forth in paragraph
(a) of this section, is acceptable. Service on BXA shall be addressed
to the Chief Counsel for Export Administration, Room H-3839, U.S.
Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20230. Service on a respondent shall be to the address
to which the charging letter was sent or to such other address as
respondent may provide. When a party has appeared by counsel or other
representative, service on counsel or other representative shall
constitute service on that party.
    (c) Date. The date of filing or service is the day when the papers
are deposited in the mail or are delivered in person, by delivery
service, or by facsimile.
    (d) Certificate of service. A certificate of service signed by the
party making service, stating the date and manner of service, shall
accompany every paper, other than the charging letter, filed and served
on parties.
    (e) Computing period of time. In computing any period of time
prescribed or allowed by this part or by

[[Page 12909]]
order of the administrative law judge or the Under Secretary, the day
of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time
begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period so
computed is to be included unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a
legal holiday (as defined in Rule 6(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure), in which case the period runs until the end of the next day
which is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a legal holiday.
Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded from
the computation when the period of time prescribed or allowed is seven
days or less.

Sec. 766.6  Answer and demand for hearing.

    (a) When to answer. The respondent must answer the charging letter
within 30 days after being served with notice of the issuance of a
charging letter instituting an administrative enforcement proceeding,
or within 30 days of notice of any supplement or amendment to a
charging letter, unless time is extended under Sec. 766.16 of this
part.
    (b) Contents of answer. The answer must be responsive to the
charging letter and must fully set forth the nature of the respondent's
defense or defenses. The answer must admit or deny specifically each
separate allegation of the charging letter; if the respondent is
without knowledge, the answer must so state and will operate as a
denial. Failure to deny or controvert a particular allegation will be
deemed an admission of that allegation. The answer must also set forth
any additional or new matter the respondent believes supports a defense
or claim of mitigation. Any defense or partial defense not specifically
set forth in the answer shall be deemed waived, and evidence thereon
may be refused, except for good cause shown.
    (c) Demand for hearing. If the respondent desires a hearing, a
written demand for one must be submitted with the answer. Any demand by
BXA for a hearing must be filed with the administrative law judge
within 30 days after service of the answer. Failure to make a timely
written demand for a hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the party's
right to a hearing, except for good cause shown. If no party demands a
hearing, the matter will go forward in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Sec. 766.15 of this part.
    (d) English language required. The answer, all other papers, and
all documentary evidence must be submitted in English, or translations
into English must be filed and served at the same time.

Sec. 766.7  Default.

    (a) General. Failure of the respondent to file an answer within the
time provided constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right to appear
and contest the allegations in the charging letter. In such event, the
administrative law judge, on BXA's motion and without further notice to
the respondent, shall find the facts to be as alleged in the charging
letter and render an initial or recommended decision containing
findings of fact and appropriate conclusions of law and issue or
recommend an order imposing appropriate sanctions. The decision and
order shall be subject to review by the Under Secretary in accordance
with the applicable procedures set forth in Sec. 766.21 or Sec. 766.22
of this part.
    (b) Petition to set aside default. (1) Procedure. Upon petition
filed by a respondent against whom a default order has been issued,
which petition is accompanied by an answer meeting the requirements of
Sec. 766.6(b) of this part, the Under Secretary may, after giving all
parties an opportunity to comment, and for good cause shown, set aside
the default and vacate the order entered thereon and remand the matter
to the administrative law judge for further proceedings.
    (2) Time limits. A petition under this section must be made within
one year of the date of entry of the order which the petition seeks to
have vacated.

Sec. 766.8  Summary decision.

    At any time after a proceeding has been initiated, a party may move
for a summary decision disposing of some or all of the issues. The
administrative law judge may render an initial or recommended decision
and issue or recommend an order if the entire record shows, as to the
issue(s) under consideration:
    (a) That there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; and
    (b) That the moving party is entitled to a summary decision as a
matter of law.

Sec. 766.9  Discovery.

    (a) General. The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary
discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to
the subject matter of the pending proceeding. The provisions of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to discovery apply to the
extent consistent with this part and except as otherwise provided by
the administrative law judge or by waiver or agreement of the parties.
The administrative law judge may make any order which justice requires
to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression,
or undue burden or expense. These orders may include limitations on the
scope, method, time and place of discovery, and provisions for
protecting the confidentiality of classified or otherwise sensitive
information.
    (b) Interrogatories and requests for admission or production of
documents. A party may serve on any party interrogatories, requests for
admission, or requests for production of documents for inspection and
copying, and a party concerned may apply to the administrative law
judge for such enforcement or protective order as that party deems
warranted with respect to such discovery. The service of a discovery
request shall be made at least 20 days before the scheduled date of the
hearing unless the administrative law judge specifies a shorter time
period. Copies of interrogatories, requests for admission and requests
for production of documents and responses thereto shall be served on
all parties, and a copy of the certificate of service shall be filed
with the administrative law judge. Matters of fact or law of which
admission is requested shall be deemed admitted unless, within a period
designated in the request (at least 10 days after service, or within
such additional time as the administrative law judge may allow), the
party to whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting party
a sworn statement either denying specifically the matters of which
admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why the
party to whom the request is directed cannot truthfully either admit or
deny such matters.
    (c) Depositions. Upon application of a party and for good cause
shown, the administrative law judge may order the taking of the
testimony of any person by deposition and the production of specified
documents or materials by the person at the deposition. The application
shall state the purpose of the deposition and set forth the facts
sought to be established through the deposition.
    (d) Enforcement. The administrative law judge may order a party to
answer designated questions, to produce specified documents or things
or to take any other action in response to a proper discovery request.
If a party does not comply with such an order, the administrative law
judge may make a determination or enter any order in the proceeding as
the judge deems reasonable and appropriate. The judge may strike
related charges or defenses in whole or in part or may take particular
facts relating to the discovery request to

[[Page 12910]]
which the party failed or refused to respond as being established for
purposes of the proceeding in accordance with the contentions of the
party seeking discovery. In addition, enforcement by a district court
of the United States may be sought under section 12(a) of the EAA.

Sec. 766.10  Subpoenas.

    (a) Issuance. Upon the application of any party, supported by a
satisfactory showing that there is substantial reason to believe that
the evidence would not otherwise be available, the administrative law
judge will issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of
witnesses and the production of such books, records or other
documentary or physical evidence for the purpose of the hearing, as the
judge deems relevant and material to the proceedings, and reasonable in
scope.
    (b) Service. Subpoenas issued by the administrative law judge may
be served in any of the methods set forth in Sec. 766.5(b) of this
part.
    (c) Timing. Applications for subpoenas must be submitted at least
10 days before the scheduled hearing or deposition, unless the
administrative law judge determines, for good cause shown, that
extraordinary circumstances warrant a shorter time.

Sec. 766.11  Matter protected against disclosure.

    (a) Protective measures. It is often necessary for BXA to receive
and consider information and documents that are sensitive from the
standpoint of national security, foreign policy, business
confidentiality, or investigative concern, and that are to be protected
against disclosure. Accordingly, and without limiting the discretion of
the administrative law judge to give effect to any other applicable
privilege, it is proper for the administrative law judge to limit
discovery or introduction of evidence or to issue such protective or
other orders as in the judge's judgment may be consistent with the
objective of preventing undue disclosure of the sensitive documents or
information. Where the administrative law judge determines that
documents containing the sensitive matter need to be made available to
a respondent to avoid prejudice, the judge may direct BXA to prepare an
unclassified and nonsensitive summary or extract of the documents. The
administrative law judge may compare the extract or summary with the
original to ensure that it is supported by the source document and that
it omits only so much as must remain classified or undisclosed. The
summary or extract may be admitted as evidence in the record.
    (b) Arrangements for access. If the administrative law judge
determines that this procedure is unsatisfactory and that classified or
otherwise sensitive matter must form part of the record in order to
avoid prejudice to a party, the judge may provide the parties
opportunity to make arrangements that permit a party or a
representative to have access to such matter without compromising
sensitive information. Such arrangements may include obtaining security
clearances, obtaining a national interest determination under section
12(c) of the EAA, or giving counsel for a party access to sensitive
information and documents subject to assurances against further
disclosure, including a protective order, if necessary.

Sec. 766.12  Prehearing conference.

    (a) The administrative law judge, on the judge's own motion or on
request of a party, may direct the parties to participate in a
prehearing conference, either in person or by telephone, to consider:
    (1) Simplification of issues;
    (2) The necessity or desirability of amendments to pleadings;
    (3) Obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents to avoid
unnecessary proof; or
    (4) Such other matters as may expedite the disposition of the
proceedings.
    (b) The administrative law judge may order the conference
proceedings to be recorded electronically or taken by a reporter,
transcribed and filed with the judge.
    (c) If a prehearing conference is impracticable, the administrative
law judge may direct the parties to correspond with the judge to
achieve the purposes of such a conference.
    (d) The administrative law judge will prepare a summary of any
actions agreed on or taken pursuant to this section. The summary will
include any written stipulations or agreements made by the parties.

Sec. 766.13  Hearings.

    (a) Scheduling. The administrative law judge, by agreement with the
parties or upon notice to all parties of not less than 30 days, will
schedule a hearing. All hearings will be held in Washington, D.C.,
unless the administrative law judge determines, for good cause shown,
that another location would better serve the interests of justice.
    (b) Hearing procedure. Hearings will be conducted in a fair and
impartial manner by the administrative law judge, who may limit
attendance at any hearing or portion thereof to the parties, their
representatives and witnesses if the judge deems this necessary or
advisable in order to protect sensitive matter (see Sec. 766.11 of this
part) from improper disclosure. The rules of evidence prevailing in
courts of law do not apply, and all evidentiary material deemed by the
administrative law judge to be relevant and material to the proceeding
and not unduly repetitious will be received and given appropriate
weight.
    (c) Testimony and record. Witnesses will testify under oath or
affirmation. A verbatim record of the hearing and of any other oral
proceedings will be taken by reporter or by electronic recording,
transcribed and filed with the administrative law judge. A respondent
may examine the transcript and may obtain a copy by paying any
applicable costs. Upon such terms as the administrative law judge deems
just, the judge may direct that the testimony of any person be taken by
deposition and may admit an affidavit or declaration as evidence,
provided that any affidavits or declarations have been filed and served
on the parties sufficiently in advance of the hearing to permit a party
to file and serve an objection thereto on the grounds that it is
necessary that the affiant or declarant testify at the hearing and be
subject to cross-examination.
    (d) Failure to appear. If a party fails to appear in person or by
counsel at a scheduled hearing, the hearing may nevertheless proceed,
and that party's failure to appear will not affect the validity of the
hearing or any proceedings or action taken thereafter.

Sec. 766.14  Interlocutory review of rulings.

    (a) At the request of a party, or on the judge's own initiative,
the administrative law judge may certify to the Under Secretary for
review a ruling that does not finally dispose of a proceeding, if the
administrative law judge determines that immediate review may hasten or
facilitate the final disposition of the matter.
    (b) Upon certification to the Under Secretary of the interlocutory
ruling for review, the parties will have 10 days to file and serve
briefs stating their positions, and five days to file and serve
replies, following which the Under Secretary will decide the matter
promptly.

Sec. 766.15  Proceeding without a hearing.

    If the parties have waived a hearing, the case will be decided on
the record by the administrative law judge. Proceeding without a
hearing does not relieve the parties from the necessity of

[[Page 12911]]
proving the facts supporting their charges or defenses. Affidavits or
declarations, depositions, admissions, answers to interrogatories and
stipulations may supplement other documentary evidence in the record.
The administrative law judge will give each party reasonable
opportunity to file rebuttal evidence.

Sec. 766.16  Procedural stipulations; extension of time.

    (a) Procedural stipulations. Unless otherwise ordered, a written
stipulation agreed to by all parties and filed with the administrative
law judge will modify any procedures established by this part.
    (b) Extension of time. (1) The parties may extend any applicable
time limitation, by stipulation filed with the administrative law judge
before the time limitation expires.
    (2) The administrative law judge may, on the judge's own initiative
or upon application by any party, either before or after the expiration
of any applicable time limitation, extend the time within which to file
and serve an answer to a charging letter or do any other act required
by this part.

Sec. 766.17  Decision of the administrative law judge.

    (a) Predecisional matters. Except for default proceedings under
Sec. 766.7 of this part, the administrative law judge will give the
parties reasonable opportunity to submit the following, which will be
made a part of the record:
    (1) Exceptions to any ruling by the judge or to the admissibility
of evidence proffered at the hearing;
    (2) Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (3) Supporting legal arguments for the exceptions and proposed
findings and conclusions submitted; and
    (4) A proposed order.
    (b) Decision and order. After considering the entire record in the
proceeding, the administrative law judge will issue a written decision.
    (1) Initial decision. For proceedings charging violations relating
to part 760 of the EAR, the decision rendered shall be an initial
decision. The decision will include findings of fact, conclusions of
law, and findings as to whether there has been a violation of the EAA,
the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. If
the administrative law judge finds that the evidence of record is
insufficient to sustain a finding that a violation has occurred with
respect to one or more charges, the judge shall order dismissal of the
charges in whole or in part, as appropriate. If the administrative law
judge finds that one or more violations have been committed, the judge
may issue an order imposing administrative sanctions, as provided in
part 764 of the EAR. The decision and order shall be served on each
party, and shall become effective as the final decision of the
Department 30 days after service, unless an appeal is filed in
accordance with Sec. 766.21 of this part.
    (2) Recommended decision. For proceedings not involving violations
relating to part 760 of the EAR, the decision rendered shall be a
recommended decision. The decision will include recommended findings of
fact, conclusions of law, and findings as to whether there has been a
violation of the EAA, the EAR or any order, license or authorization
issued thereunder. If the administrative law judge finds that the
evidence of record is insufficient to sustain a recommended finding
that a violation has occurred with respect to one or more charges, the
judge shall recommend dismissal of any such charge. If the
administrative law judge finds that one or more violations have been
committed, the judge shall recommend an order imposing administrative
sanctions, as provided in part 764 of the EAR, or such other action as
the judge deems appropriate. The administrative law judge shall
immediately certify the record, including the original copy of the
recommended decision and order, to the Under Secretary for review in
accordance with Sec. 766.22 of this part. The administrative law judge
shall also immediately serve the recommended decision on all parties.
Because of the time limits established in the EAA for review by the
Under Secretary, service upon parties shall be by personal delivery,
express mail or other overnight carrier.
    (c) Suspension of sanctions. Any order imposing administrative
sanctions may provide for the suspension of the sanction imposed, in
whole or in part and on such terms of probation or other conditions as
the administrative law judge or the Under Secretary may specify. Any
suspension order may be modified or revoked by the signing official
upon application of BXA showing a violation of the probationary terms
or other conditions, after service on the respondent of notice of the
application in accordance with the service provisions of Sec. 766.3 of
this part, and with such opportunity for response as the responsible
signing official in his/her discretion may allow. A copy of any order
modifying or revoking the suspension shall also be served on the
respondent in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 766.3 of this
part.
    (d) Time for decision. Administrative enforcement proceedings not
involving violations relating to part 760 of the EAR shall be
concluded, including review by the Under Secretary under Sec. 766.22 of
this part, within one year of the submission of a charging letter,
unless the administrative law judge, for good cause shown, extends such
period. The charging letter will be deemed to have been submitted to
the administrative law judge on the date the respondent files an answer
or on the date BXA files a motion for a default order pursuant to
Sec. 766.7(a) of this part, whichever occurs first.

Sec. 766.18  Settlement.

    (a) Cases may be settled before service of a charging letter. In
cases in which settlement is reached before service of a charging
letter, a proposed charging letter will be prepared, and a settlement
proposal consisting of a settlement agreement and order will be
submitted to the Assistant Secretary for approval and signature. If the
Assistant Secretary does not approve the proposal, he/she will notify
the parties and the case will proceed as though no settlement proposal
had been made. If the Assistant Secretary approves the proposal, he/she
will issue an appropriate order, and no action will be required by the
administrative law judge.
    (b) Cases may also be settled after service of a charging letter.
(1) If the case is pending before the administrative law judge, the
judge shall stay the proceedings for a reasonable period of time,
usually not to exceed 30 days, upon notification by the parties that
they have entered into good faith settlement negotiations. The
administrative law judge may, in his/her discretion, grant additional
stays. If settlement is reached, a proposal will be submitted to the
Assistant Secretary for approval and signature. If the Assistant
Secretary approves the proposal, he/she will issue an appropriate
order, and notify the administrative law judge that the case is
withdrawn from adjudication. If the Assistant Secretary does not
approve the proposal, he/she will notify the parties and the case will
proceed to adjudication by the administrative law judge as though no
settlement proposal had been made.
    (2) If the case is pending before the Under Secretary under
Sec. 766.21 or Sec. 766.22 of this part, the parties may submit a
settlement proposal to the Under Secretary for approval and signature.
If the Under Secretary approves the proposal, he/she will issue an
appropriate order. If the Under Secretary does not approve the
proposal, the case will proceed to final

[[Page 12912]]
decision in accordance with Sec. 766.21 or Sec. 766.22 of this part, as
appropriate.
    (c) Any order disposing of a case by settlement may suspend the
administrative sanction imposed, in whole or in part, on such terms of
probation or other conditions as the signing official may specify. Any
such suspension may be modified or revoked by the signing official, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 766.17(c) of this
part.
    (d) Any respondent who agrees to an order imposing any
administrative sanction does so solely for the purpose of resolving the
claims in the administrative enforcement proceeding brought under this
part. This reflects the fact that BXA has neither the authority nor the
responsibility for instituting, conducting, settling, or otherwise
disposing of criminal proceedings. That authority and responsibility
are vested in the Attorney General and the Department of Justice.
    (e) Cases that are settled may not be reopened or appealed.

Sec. 766.19  Reopening.

    The respondent may petition the administrative law judge within one
year of the date of the final decision, except where the decision
arises from a default judgment or from a settlement, to reopen an
administrative enforcement proceeding to receive any relevant and
material evidence which was unknown or unobtainable at the time the
proceeding was held. The petition must include a summary of such
evidence, the reasons why it is deemed relevant and material, and the
reasons why it could not have been presented at the time the
proceedings were held. The administrative law judge will grant or deny
the petition after providing other parties reasonable opportunity to
comment. If the proceeding is reopened, the administrative law judge
may make such arrangements as the judge deems appropriate for receiving
the new evidence and completing the record. The administrative law
judge will then issue a new initial or recommended decision and order,
and the case will proceed to final decision and order in accordance
with Sec. 766.21 or Sec. 766.22 of this part, as appropriate.

Sec. 766.20  Record for decision and availability of documents.

    (a) General. The transcript of hearings, exhibits, rulings, orders,
all papers and requests filed in the proceedings and, for purposes of
any appeal under Sec. 766.21 of this part or review under Sec. 766.22
of this part, the decision of the administrative law judge and such
submissions as are provided for by Secs. 766.21 and 766.22 of this
part, will constitute the record and the exclusive basis for decision.
When a case is settled after the service of a charging letter, the
record will consist of any and all of the foregoing, as well as the
settlement agreement and the order. When a case is settled before
service of a charging letter, the record will consist of the proposed
charging letter, the settlement agreement and the order.
    (b) Restricted access. On the judge's own motion, or on the motion
of any party, the administrative law judge may direct that there be a
restricted access portion of the record for any material in the record
to which public access is restricted by law or by the terms of a
protective order entered in the proceedings. A party seeking to
restrict access to any portion of the record is responsible for
submitting, at the time specified in Sec. 766.20(c)(2) of this part, a
version of the document proposed for public availability that reflects
the requested deletion. The restricted access portion of the record
will be placed in a separate file and the file will be clearly marked
to avoid improper disclosure and to identify it as a portion of the
official record in the proceedings. The administrative law judge may
act at any time to permit material that becomes declassified or
unrestricted through passage of time to be transferred to the
unrestricted access portion of the record.
    (c) Availability of documents. (1) Scope. (i) For proceedings
started on or after October 12, 1979, all charging letters, answers,
initial and recommended decisions, and orders disposing of a case will
be made available for public inspection in the BXA Freedom of
Information Records Inspection Facility, U.S. Department of Commerce,
Room H-6624, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20230. The complete record for decision, as defined in paragraphs
(a) and (b) of this section will be made available on request. In
addition, all decisions of the Under Secretary on appeal pursuant to
Sec. 766.22 of this part and those final orders providing for denial,
suspension or revocation of export privileges shall be published in the
Federal Register.
    (ii) For proceedings started before October 12, 1979, the public
availability of the record for decision will be governed by the
applicable regulations in effect when the proceedings were begun.
    (2) Timing. (i) Antiboycott cases. For matters relating to part 760
of the EAR, documents are available immediately upon filing, except for
any portion of the record for which a request for segregation is made.
Parties that seek to restrict access to any portion of the record under
paragraph (b) of this section must make such a request, together with
the reasons supporting the claim of confidentiality, simultaneously
with the submission of material for the record.
    (ii) Other cases. In all other cases, documents will be available
only after the final administrative disposition of the case. In these
cases, parties desiring to restrict access to any portion of the record
under paragraph (b) of this section must assert their claim of
confidentiality, together with the reasons for supporting the claim,
before the close of the proceeding.

Sec. 766.21  Appeals.

    (a) Grounds. For proceedings charging violations relating to part
760 of the EAR, a party may appeal to the Under Secretary from an order
disposing of a proceeding or an order denying a petition to set aside a
default or a petition for reopening, on the grounds:
    (1) That a necessary finding of fact is omitted, erroneous or
unsupported by substantial evidence of record;
    (2) That a necessary legal conclusion or finding is contrary to
law;
    (3) That prejudicial procedural error occurred, or
    (4) That the decision or the extent of sanctions is arbitrary,
capricious or an abuse of discretion. The appeal must specify the
grounds on which the appeal is based and the provisions of the order
from which the appeal is taken.
    (b) Filing of appeal. An appeal from an order must be filed with
the Office of the Under Secretary for Export Administration, Bureau of
Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room H-3898, 14th
Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230, within 30
days after service of the order appealed from. If the Under Secretary
cannot act on an appeal for any reason, the Under Secretary will
designate another Department of Commerce official to receive and act on
the appeal.
    (c) Effect of appeal. The filing of an appeal shall not stay the
operation of any order, unless the order by its express terms so
provides or unless the Under Secretary, upon application by a party and
with opportunity for response, grants a stay.
    (d) Appeal procedure. The Under Secretary normally will not hold
hearings or entertain oral argument on appeals. A full written
statement in support of the appeal must be filed with the appeal and be
simultaneously served on all parties, who shall have 30 days from
service to file a reply. At his/

[[Page 12913]]
her discretion, the Under Secretary may accept new submissions, but
will not ordinarily accept those submissions filed more than 30 days
after the filing of the reply to the appellant's first submission.
    (e) Decisions. The decision will be in writing and will be
accompanied by an order signed by the Under Secretary giving effect to
the decision. The order may either dispose of the case by affirming,
modifying or reversing the order of the administrative law judge or may
refer the case back to the administrative law judge for further
proceedings.

Sec. 766.22  Review by Under Secretary.

    (a) Recommended decision. For proceedings not involving violations
relating to part 760 of the EAR, the administrative law judge shall
immediately refer the recommended decision and order to the Under
Secretary. Because of the time limits provided under the EAA for review
by the Under Secretary, service of the recommended decision and order
on the parties, all papers filed by the parties in response, and the
final decision of the Under Secretary must be by personal delivery,
facsimile, express mail or other overnight carrier. If the Under
Secretary cannot act on a recommended decision and order for any
reason, the Under Secretary will designate another Department of
Commerce official to receive and act on the recommendation.
    (b) Submissions by parties. Parties shall have 12 days from the
date of issuance of the recommended decision and order in which to
submit simultaneous responses. Parties thereafter shall have eight days
from receipt of any response(s) in which to submit replies. Any
response or reply must be received within the time specified by the
Under Secretary.
    (c) Final decision. Within 30 days after receipt of the recommended
decision and order, the Under Secretary shall issue a written order
affirming, modifying or vacating the recommended decision and order of
the administrative law judge. If he/she vacates the recommended
decision and order, the Under Secretary may refer the case back to the
administrative law judge for further proceedings. Because of the time
limits, the Under Secretary's review will ordinarily be limited to the
written record for decision, including the transcript of any hearing,
and any submissions by the parties concerning the recommended decision.
    (d) Delivery. The final decision and implementing order shall be
served on the parties and will be publicly available in accordance with
Sec. 766.20 of this part.
    (e) Appeals. The charged party may appeal the Under Secretary's
written order within 15 days to the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. Sec. 2412(c)(3).

Sec. 766.23  Related persons.

    (a) General. In order to prevent evasion, certain types of orders
under this part may be made applicable not only to the respondent, but
also to other persons then or thereafter related to the respondent by
ownership, control, position of responsibility, affiliation, or other
connection in the conduct of trade or business. Orders that may be made
applicable to related persons include those that deny or affect export
privileges, including temporary denial orders, and those that exclude a
respondent from practice before BXA.
    (b) Procedures. If BXA has reason to believe that a person is
related to the respondent and that an order that is being sought or
that has been issued should be made applicable to that person in order
to prevent evasion of the order, BXA shall, except in an ex parte
proceeding under Sec. 766.24(a) of this part, give that person notice
in accordance with Sec. 766.5(b) of this part and an opportunity to
oppose such action. If the official authorized to issue the order
against the respondent finds that the order should be made applicable
to that person in order to prevent evasion of the order that official
shall issue or amend the order accordingly.
    (c) Appeals. Any person named by BXA in an order as related to the
respondent may file an appeal with the administrative law judge. The
sole issues to be raised and ruled on in any such appeal are whether
the person so named is related to the respondent and whether the order
is justified in order to prevent evasion. The recommended decision and
order of the administrative law judge shall be reviewed by the Under
Secretary in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 766.22 of
this part.

Sec. 766.24  Temporary denials.

    (a) General. The procedures in this section apply to temporary
denial orders issued on or after July 12, 1985. For temporary denial
orders issued on or before July 11, 1985, the proceedings will be
governed by the applicable regulations in effect at the time the
temporary denial orders were issued. Without limiting any other action
BXA may take under the EAR with respect to any application, order,
license or authorization issued under the EAA, BXA may ask the
Assistant Secretary to issue a temporary denial order on an ex parte
basis to prevent an imminent violation, as defined in this section, of
the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued
thereunder. The temporary denial order will deny export privileges to
any person named in the order as provided for in Sec. 764.3(a)(2) of
the EAR.
    (b) Issuance. (1) The Assistant Secretary may issue an order
temporarily denying to a person any or all of the export privileges
described in part 764 of the EAR upon a showing by BXA that the order
is necessary in the public interest to prevent an imminent violation of
the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued
thereunder.
    (2) The temporary denial order shall define the imminent violation
and state why it was issued without a hearing. Because all denial
orders are public, the description of the imminent violation and the
reasons for proceeding on an ex parte basis set forth therein shall be
stated in a manner that is consistent with national security, foreign
policy, business confidentiality, and investigative concerns.
    (3) A violation may be ``imminent'' either in time or in degree of
likelihood. To establish grounds for the temporary denial order, BXA
may show either that a violation is about to occur, or that the general
circumstances of the matter under investigation or case under criminal
or administrative charges demonstrate a likelihood of future
violations. To indicate the likelihood of future violations, BXA may
show that the violation under investigation or charges is significant,
deliberate, covert and/or likely to occur again, rather than technical
or negligent, and that it is appropriate to give notice to companies in
the United States and abroad to cease dealing with the person in U.S.-
origin items in order to reduce the likelihood that a person under
investigation or charges continues to export or acquire abroad such
items, risking subsequent disposition contrary to export control
requirements. Lack of information establishing the precise time a
violation may occur does not preclude a finding that a violation is
imminent, so long as there is sufficient reason to believe the
likelihood of a violation.
    (4) The temporary denial order will be issued for a period not
exceeding 180 days.
    (5) Notice of the issuance of a temporary denial order on an ex
parte basis shall be given in accordance with Sec. 766.5(b) of this
part upon issuance.

    (c) Related persons. A temporary denial order may be made
applicable to related persons in accordance with Sec. 766.23 of this
part.
    (d) Renewal. (1) If, no later than 20 days before the expiration
date of a temporary denial order, BXA believes that renewal of the
denial order is necessary in the public interest to prevent an imminent
violation, BXA may file a written request setting forth the basis for
its belief, including any additional or changed circumstances, asking
that the Assistant Secretary renew the temporary denial order, with
modifications, if any are appropriate, for an additional period not
exceeding 180 days. BXA's request shall be delivered to the respondent,
or any agent designated for this purpose, in accordance with
Sec. 766.5(b) of this part, which will constitute notice of the renewal
application.
    (2) Non-resident respondents. To facilitate timely notice of
renewal requests, a respondent not a resident of the United States may
designate a local agent for this purpose and provide written
notification of such designation to BXA in the manner set forth in
Sec. 766.5(b) of this part.
    (3) Hearing. (i) A respondent may oppose renewal of a temporary
denial order by filing with the Assistant Secretary a written
submission, supported by appropriate evidence, to be received not later
than seven days before the expiration date of such order. For good
cause shown, the Assistant Secretary may consider submissions received
not later than five days before the expiration date. The Assistant
Secretary ordinarily will not allow discovery; however, for good cause
shown in respondent's submission, he/she may allow the parties to take
limited discovery, consisting of a request for production of documents.
If requested by the respondent in the written submission, the Assistant
Secretary shall hold a hearing on the renewal application. The hearing
shall be on the record and ordinarily will consist only of oral
argument. The only issue to be considered on BXA's request for renewal
is whether the temporary denial order should be continued to prevent an
imminent violation as defined herein.
    (ii) Any person designated as a related person may not oppose
issuance or renewal of the temporary denial order, but may file an
appeal in accordance with Sec. 766.2(3)(c) of this part.
    (iii) If no written opposition to BXA's renewal request is received
within the specified time, the Assistant Secretary may issue the order
renewing the temporary denial order without a hearing.
    (4) A temporary denial order may be renewed more than once.
    (e) Appeals. (1) Filing. (i) A respondent may, at any time, file an
appeal of the initial or renewed temporary denial order with the
administrative law judge.
    (ii) The filing of an appeal shall stay neither the effectiveness
of the temporary denial order nor any application for renewal, nor will
it operate to bar the Assistant Secretary's consideration of any
renewal application.
    (2) Grounds. A respondent may appeal on the grounds that the
finding that the order is necessary in the public interest to prevent
an imminent violation is unsupported.
    (3) Appeal procedure. A full written statement in support of the
appeal must be filed with the appeal together with appropriate
evidence, and be simultaneously served on BXA, which shall have seven
days from receipt to file a reply. Service on the administrative law
judge shall be addressed to the Office of the Administrative Law Judge,
U.S. Department of Commerce, Room H-6716, 14th Street and Constitution
Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230. Service on BXA shall be as set
forth in Sec. 766.5(b) of this part. The administrative law judge
normally will not hold hearings or entertain oral argument on appeals.
    (4) Recommended Decision. Within 10 working days after an appeal is
filed, the administrative law judge shall submit a recommended decision
to the Under Secretary, and serve copies on the parties, recommending
whether the issuance or the renewal of the temporary denial order
should be affirmed, modified or vacated.
    (5) Final decision. Within five working days after receipt of the
recommended decision, the Under Secretary shall issue a written order
accepting, rejecting or modifying the recommended decision. Because of
the time constraints, the Under Secretary's review will ordinarily be
limited to the written record for decision, including the transcript of
any hearing. The issuance or renewal of the temporary denial order
shall be affirmed only if there is reason to believe that the temporary
denial order is required in the public interest to prevent an imminent
violation of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or other
authorization issued under the EAA. The Under Secretary's written order
is final and is not subject to judicial review, except as provided in
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (f) Delivery. A copy of any temporary denial order issued or
renewed and any final decision on appeal shall be published in the
Federal Register and shall be delivered to BXA and to the respondent,
or any agent designated for this purpose, and to any related person in
the same manner as provided in Sec. 766.5 of this part for filing for
papers other than a charging letter.
    (g) Judicial review. A respondent temporarily denied export
privileges by order of the Under Secretary may appeal to the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia pursuant to 50
U.S.C. app. Sec. 2412(d)(3).

Sec. 766.25  Administrative action denying permission to apply for or
use export licenses.

    (a) General. The Director of the Office of Exporter Services, in
consultation with the Director of the Office of Export Enforcement, may
deny permission to apply for or use any license, including any License
Exception, to any person who has been convicted of a violation of the
EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder;
any regulation, license or order issued under the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706); 18 U.S.C. 793, 794
or 798; section 4(b) of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C.
783(b)), or section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778).
    (b) Procedure. Upon notification that a person has been convicted
of a violation of one or more of the provisions specified in paragraph
(a) of this section, the Director of the Office of Exporter Services,
in consultation with the Director of the Office of Export Enforcement,
will determine whether to deny permission to apply for or use any
export license, including any License Exception, to any such person.
The Director of the Office of Exporter Services will notify each person
denied under this section by letter stating that permission to apply
for or use export licenses has been denied.
    (c) Criteria. In determining whether and for how long to deny U.S.
export privileges to a person previously convicted of one or more of
the statutes set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the Director
of the Office of Exporter Services may take into consideration any
relevant information, including, but not limited to, the seriousness of
the offense involved in the criminal prosecution, the nature and
duration of the criminal sanctions imposed, and whether the person has
undertaken any corrective measures.
    (d) Duration. Any denial of permission to apply for or use export

[[Page 12915]]
licenses, including any License Exception, under this section shall not
exceed 10 years from the date of the conviction of the person who is
subject to the denial.
    (e) Effect. Any person denied permission to apply for and use
licenses under this section will be considered a ``person denied export
privileges'' for purposes of Sec. 736.2(b)(4) (General Prohibition 4--
Engage in actions prohibited by a denial order) and Sec. 764.2(k) of
the EAR.
    (f) Publication. The name and address(es) of any person denied
permission to apply for or use export licenses under this section will
be published as described in Supplement No. 2 to part 764 of the EAR,
noting that such action was taken pursuant to this section and section
11(h) of the EAA.
    (g) Appeal. An appeal of an action under this section will be
pursuant to part 756 of the EAR.
    (h) Applicability to related person. The Director of the Office of
Exporter Services, in consultation with the Director of the Office of
Export Enforcement, may take action in accordance with Sec. 766.23 of
this part to make applicable to related persons an order that is being
sought or that has been issued under this section.

Supplement No. 2 to Part 768--Items Eligible For Expedited Licensing
Procedures

    Authority: 50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.;
E.O. 12924, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 917; Notice of August 15, 1995 (60
FR 42767, August 17, 1995).

Sec. 768.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the Export Administration Regulations
(EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.
    (a) Authority. Pursuant to sections 5(f) and 5(h) of the Export
Administration Act (EAA), the Under Secretary of Commerce for Export
Administration directs the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) in
gathering and analyzing all the evidence necessary for the Secretary to
determine foreign availability.
    (b) Scope. This part applies only to the extent that items are
controlled for national security purposes.
    (c) Types of programs. There are two general programs of foreign
availability:
    (1) Foreign availability to controlled countries. In this category
are denied license assessments (see Secs. 768.4(b) and 768.7 of this
part) and decontrol assessments (see Secs. 768.4(c) and 768.7 of this
part).
    (2) Foreign availability to non-controlled countries. In this
category are denied license assessments, decontrol assessments, and
evaluations of eligibility for expedited licensing (see Sec. 768.8 of
this part).
    (d) Definitions. The following are definitions of terms used in
this part 768:
    Allegation. See foreign availability submission.
    Assessment. An evidentiary analysis that BXA conducts concerning
the foreign availability of a given item based on the assessment
criteria, data gathered by BXA, and the data and recommendations
submitted by the Departments of Defense and State and other relevant
departments and agencies, TAC committees, and industry.
    Assessment criteria. Statutorily established criteria that must be
assessed for the Secretary to make a determination with respect to
foreign availability. They are, available-in-fact, from a non-U.S.
source, in sufficient quantity so as to render the control ineffective,
and of comparable quality. (See Sec. 768.6 of this part).
    Available-in-fact. An item is available-in-fact to a country if it
is produced within the country or if it may be obtained by that country
from a third country. Ordinarily, items will not be considered
available-in-fact to non-controlled countries if the items are
available only under a validated national security license or a
comparable authorization from a country that maintains export controls
on such items cooperatively with the United States.
    Claimant. Any party who makes a foreign availability submission,
excluding TACs.
    Comparable quality. An item is of comparable quality to an item
controlled under the EAR if it possesses the characteristics specified
in the Commerce Control List (CCL) for that item and is alike in key
characteristics that include, but are not limited to: (1) Function; (2)
technological approach; (3) performance thresholds; (4) maintainability
and service life; and (5) any other attribute relevant to the purpose
for which the control was placed on the item.
    Controlled countries. Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,
Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cuba, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan,
Laos, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Mongolia, North Korea, Romania,
Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vietnam and the
People's Republic of China.
    Decontrol. Removal of license requirements under the EAR.
    Decontrol assessment. An assessment of the foreign availability of
an item to a country or countries for purposes of determining whether
decontrol is warranted. Such assessments may be conducted after BXA
receives a foreign availability submission or a TAC certification, or
by the Secretary's own initiative.
    Denied license assessment. A foreign availability assessment
conducted as a result of a claimant's allegation of foreign
availability for an item (or items) that BXA has denied or has issued a
letter of intent to deny a license. If the Secretary determines that
foreign availability exists, BXA's approval of a license will be
limited to the items, countries, and quantities in the allegation.
    Determination. The Secretary's decision that foreign availability
within the meaning of the EAA does or does not exist. (See Sec. 768.7
of this part).
    Expedited licensing procedure eligibility evaluation. An evaluation
that BXA initiates for the purpose of determining whether an item is
eligible for the expedited licensing procedure. (See Sec. 768.8 of this
part).
    Expedited licensing procedures. Under expedited licensing
procedures, BXA reviews and processes a license application for the
export of an eligible item to a non-controlled country within statutory
time limits. Licenses are deemed approved unless BXA denies within the
statutory time limits (See Sec. 768.8 of this part).
    Foreign availability submission (FAS). An allegation of foreign
availability a claimant makes, supported by reasonable evidence, and
submits to BXA. (See Sec. 768.5 of this part).
    Item. Any commodity, software, or technology.
    Items eligible for non-controlled country expedited licensing
procedures. The items described in Supplement No. 2 to this part 768
are eligible for the

[[Page 12916]]
expedited license procedures (See Sec. 768.8 of this part).
    National Security Override (NSO). A Presidential decision to
maintain export controls on an item notwithstanding its foreign
availability as determined under the EAA. The President's decision is
based on his/her determination that the absence of the controls would
prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. Once
the President makes such a decision, the President must actively pursue
negotiations to eliminate foreign availability with the governments of
the sources of foreign availability. (See Sec. 768.7 of this part).
    Non-controlled countries. Any country not defined as a controlled
country by this section.
    Non-U.S. source/foreign source. A person located outside the
jurisdiction of the United States (as defined in part 772 of the EAR).
    Reasonable evidence. Relevant information that is credible.
    Reliable evidence. Relevant information that is credible and
dependable.
    Secretary. As used in this part, the Secretary refers to the
Secretary of Commerce or his/her designee.
    Similar quality. An item is of similar quality to an item that is
controlled under the EAR if it is substantially alike in key
characteristics that may include, but are not limited to: (1) Function;
(2) technological approach; (3) performance thresholds; (4)
maintainability and service life; and (5) any other attribute relevant
to the purpose for which the control was placed on the item.
    Sufficient quantity. The amount of an item that would render the
U.S. export control, or the denial of the license in question,
ineffective in achieving its purpose. For a controlled country, it is
the quantity that meets the military needs of that country so that U.S.
exports of the item to that country would not make a significant
contribution to its military potential.
    Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). A Committee created under
section 5(h) of the EAA that advises and assists the Secretary of
Commerce, the Secretary of Defense, and any other department, agency,
or official of the Government of the United States to which the
President delegates authority under the EAA on export control matters
related to specific areas of controlled items.
    TAC certification. A statement that a TAC submits to BXA, supported
by reasonable evidence, documented as in a FAS, that foreign
availability to a controlled country exists for an item that falls
within the TAC's area of technical expertise.

Sec. 768.2  Foreign availability described.

    (a) Foreign availability. Foreign availability exists when the
Secretary determines that an item is comparable in quality to an item
subject to U.S. national security export controls, and is available-in-
fact to a country, from a non-U.S. source, in sufficient quantities to
render the U.S. export control of that item or the denial of a license
ineffective. For a controlled country, such control or denial is
``ineffective'' when maintaining such control or denying a specific
license would not restrict the availability of items that would make a
significant contribution to the military potential of the controlled
country or combination of countries detrimental to the national
security of the United States (see sections 5(a) and 3(2)(A) of the
EAA.)
    (b) Types of foreign availability. There are two types of foreign
availability:
    (1) Foreign availability to a controlled country; and
    (2) Foreign availability to a non-controlled country.

(Note to paragraph (b) of this section: See Sec. 768.7 of this part
for delineation of the foreign availability assessment procedures,
and Sec. 768.6 of this part for the criteria used in determining
foreign availability)

Sec. 768.3  Foreign availability assessment.

    (a) Foreign availability assessment. A foreign availability
assessment is an evidentiary analysis that BXA conducts to assess the
foreign availability of a given item according to the assessment
criteria, based on data submitted by a claimant, the data gathered by
BXA, and the data and recommendations submitted by the Departments of
Defense and State and other relevant departments and agencies, TAC
committees, and industry. BXA uses the results of the analysis in
formulating its recommendation to the Secretary on whether foreign
availability exists for a given item. If the Secretary determines that
foreign availability exists, the Secretary will decontrol the item for
national security reasons or approve the license in question if there
is no foreign policy reason to deny the license, unless the President
exercises a National Security Override (see Sec. 768.7 of this part).
    (b) Types of assessments. There are two types of foreign
availability assessments:
    (1) Denied license assessment; and
    (2) Decontrol assessment.
    (c) Expedited licensing procedures. See Sec. 768.8 of this part for
the evaluation of eligibility of an item for the expedited licensing
procedures.

Sec. 768.4  Initiation of an assessment.

    (a) Assessment request. To initiate an assessment, each claimant or
TAC must submit a FAS or a TAC Certification to BXA. TACs are
authorized to certify foreign availability only to controlled
countries. Claimants can allege foreign availability for either
controlled or non-controlled countries.
    (b) Denied license assessment. A claimant whose license application
BXA has denied, or for which it has issued a letter of intent to deny
on national security grounds, may request that BXA initiate a denied
license assessment by submitting a Foreign Availability Submission
(FAS) within 90 days after denial of the license. As part of its
submission, the claimant must request that the specified license
application be approved on the grounds of foreign availability. The
evidence must relate to the particular export as described on the
license application and to the alleged comparable item. If foreign
availability is found, the Secretary will approve the license for the
specific items, countries, and quantities listed on the application.
The denied license assessment procedure, however, is not intended to
result in the removal of the U.S. export control on an item by
incrementally providing a country with amounts that, taken together,
would constitute a sufficient quantity of an item. The Secretary will
not approve on foreign availability grounds a denied license if the
approval of such license would itself render the U.S. export control
ineffective in achieving its purpose. In the case of a positive
determination, the Secretary will determine whether a decontrol
assessment is warranted. If so, then BXA will initiate a decontrol
assessment.
    (c) Decontrol assessment. (1) Any claimant may at any time request
that BXA initiate a decontrol assessment by a FAS to BXA alleging
foreign availability to any country or countries.
    (2) A TAC may request that BXA initiate a decontrol assessment at
any time by submitting a TAC Certification to BXA that there is foreign
availability to a controlled country for items that fall within the
area of the TAC's technical expertise.
    (3) The Secretary, on his/her own initiative, may initiate a
decontrol assessment.
    (d) BXA mailing address. All foreign availability submissions and
TAC certifications should be submitted to: Department of Commerce,
Bureau of Export Administration, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue,
NW, Room 3877, Washington, DC 20230.

[[Page 12917]]

Sec. 768.5  Contents of foreign availability submissions and Technical
Advisory Committee certifications.

    (a) All foreign availability submissions must contain, in addition
to information on product or technology alleged to be available from
foreign sources, at least:
    (1) The name of the claimant;
    (2) The claimant's mailing and business address;
    (3) The claimant's telephone number; and
    (4) A contact point and telephone number.
    (b) Foreign availability submissions and TAC certifications should
contain as much evidence as is available to support the claim,
including, but not limited to:
    (1) Product names and model designations of the items alleged to be
comparable;
    (2) Extent to which the alleged comparable item is based on U.S.
technology;
    (3) Names and locations of the non-U.S. sources and the basis for
claiming that the item is a non-U.S. source item;
    (4) Key performance elements, attributes, and characteristics of
the items on which a qualitative comparison may be made;
    (5) Non-U.S. source's production quantities and/or sales of the
alleged comparable items and marketing efforts;
    (6) Estimated market demand and the economic impact of the control;
    (7) Product names, model designations, and value of U.S. controlled
parts and components incorporated in the items alleged to be
comparable; and
    (8) The basis for the claim that the item is available-in-fact to
the country or countries for which foreign availability is alleged.
    (c) Supporting evidence of foreign availability may include, but is
not limited to, the following:
    (1) Foreign manufacturers' catalogs, brochures, operation or
maintenance manuals;
    (2) Articles from reputable trade and technical publications;
    (3) Photographs;
    (4) Depositions based on eyewitness accounts; and
    (5) Other credible evidence.

    Note to paragraph (c) of this section: See Supplement No. 1 to
part 768 for additional examples of supporting evidence.

    (d) Upon receipt of a FAS or TAC certification, BXA will review it
to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the belief
that foreign availability may exist. If BXA determines the FAS or TAC
certification is lacking in supporting evidence, BXA will seek
additional evidence from appropriate sources, including the claimant or
TAC. BXA will initiate the assessment when it determines that it has
sufficient evidence that foreign availability may exist. Claimant and
TAC certified assessments will be deemed to be initiated as of the date
of such determination.
    (e) Claimants and TACs are advised to review the foreign
availability assessment criteria described in Sec. 768.6 of this part
and the examples of evidence described in Supplement No. 1 to part 768
when assembling supporting evidence for inclusion in the FAS or TAC
certification.

Sec. 768.6  Criteria.

    BXA will evaluate the evidence contained in a FAS or TAC
certification and all other evidence gathered in the assessment process
in accordance with certain criteria that must be met before BXA can
recommend a positive determination to the Secretary. The criteria are
defined in Sec. 768.1(d) of this part. In order to initiate an
assessment, each FAS and TAC certification should address each of these
criteria. The criteria are statutorily prescribed and are:
    (a) Available-in-fact;
    (b) Non-U.S. source;
    (c) Sufficient quantity; and
    (d) Comparable quality.

Sec. 768.7  Procedures.

    (a) Initiation of an assessment. (1) Once BXA accepts a FAS or TAC
certification of foreign availability, BXA will notify the claimant or
TAC that it is initiating the assessment.
    (2) BXA will publish a Federal Register notice of the initiation of
any assessment.
    (3) BXA will notify the Departments of Defense and State, the
intelligence community, and any other departments, agencies and their
contractors that may have information concerning the item on which BXA
has initiated an assessment. Each such department, agency, and
contractor shall provide BXA all relevant information concerning the
item. BXA will invite interested departments and agencies to
participate in the assessment process (See paragraph (e) of this
section).
    (b) Data gathering. BXA will seek and consider all available
information that bears upon the presence or absence of foreign
availability, including but not limited to that evidence described in
Sec. 768.5 (b) and (c) of this part. As soon as BXA initiates the
assessment, it will seek evidence relevant to the assessment, including
an analysis of the military needs of a selected country or countries,
technical analysis, and intelligence information from the Departments
of Defense and State, and other U.S. agencies. Evidence is particularly
sought from: industry sources worldwide; other U.S. organizations;
foreign governments; commercial, academic and classified data bases;
scientific and engineering research and development organizations; and
international trade fairs.
    (c) Analysis. BXA will conduct its analysis by evaluating whether
the reasonable and reliable evidence that is relevant to each of the
foreign availability criteria provides a sufficient basis to recommend
a determination that foreign availability does or does not exist.
    (d) Recommendation and determination. (1) Upon completion of each
assessment, BXA, on the basis of its analysis, will recommend that the
Secretary make a determination either that there is or that there is
not foreign availability, whichever the evidence supports. The
assessment upon which BXA bases its recommendation will accompany the
recommendation to the Secretary.
    (2) BXA will recommend on the basis of its analysis that the
Secretary determine that foreign availability exists to a country when
the available evidence demonstrates that an item of comparable quality
is available-in-fact to the country, from non-U.S. sources, in
sufficient quantity so that continuation of the existing national
security export control, or denial of the license application in
question on national security grounds, would be ineffective in
achieving its purpose. For a controlled country, such control or denial
is ``ineffective'' when comparable items are available-in-fact from
foreign sources in sufficient quantities so that maintaining such
control or denying a license would not be effective in restricting the
availability of items that would make a significant contribution to the
military potential of any country or combination of countries
detrimental to the national security of the United States.
    (3) The Secretary will make the determination of foreign
availability on the basis of the BXA assessment and recommendation; the
Secretary's determination will take into account the evidence provided
to BXA, the recommendations of the Secretaries of Defense and State and
any other interested agencies, and any other information that the
Secretary considers relevant.

[[Page 12918]]

    (4) For all decontrol and denied license assessments (under section
5(f)(3) of the EAA) initiated by a FAS, the Secretary will make a
determination within 4 months of the initiation of the assessment and
will notify the claimant. The Secretary will submit positive
determinations for review to the appropriate departments and agencies.
    (5) The deadlines for determinations based on self-initiated and
TAC-initiated assessments are different from the deadlines for
claimant-initiated assessments (see paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of
this section).
    (e) Interagency review. BXA will notify all appropriate U.S.
agencies and Departments upon the initiation of an assessment and will
invite their participation in the assessment process. BXA will provide
all interested agencies and departments an opportunity to review source
material, draft analyses and draft assessments immediately upon their
receipt or production. For claimant-initiated assessments, BXA will
provide a copy of all positive recommendations and assessments to
interested agencies and departments for their review following the
Secretary's determination of foreign availability. For self-initiated
and TAC-initiated assessments, BXA will provide all interested agencies
an opportunity to review and comment on the assessment.
    (f) Notification. (1) No later than 5 months after the initiation
of an assessment based on a FAS (claimant assessments), the Secretary
will inform the claimant in writing and will submit for publication in
the Federal Register a notice that:
    (i) Foreign availability exists, and
    (A) The requirement of a license has been removed or the license
application in question has been approved; or
    (B) The President has determined that for national security
purposes the export controls must be maintained or the license
application must be denied, notwithstanding foreign availability, and
that appropriate steps to eliminate the foreign availability are being
initiated; or
    (C) In the case of an item controlled multilaterally under the
former COCOM regime, the U.S. Government will conduct any necessary
consultations concerning the proposed decontrol or approval of the
license with the former COCOM regime for a period of up to 4 months
from the date of the publication of the determination in the Federal
Register (the U.S. Government may remove the license requirement for
exports to non-controlled countries pending completion of the former
COCOM regime review process); or
    (ii) Foreign availability does not exist.
    (2) For all TAC certification assessments, the Secretary will make
a foreign availability determination within 90 days following
initiation of the assessment. BXA will prepare and submit a report to
the TAC and to the Congress stating that:
    (i) The Secretary has found foreign availability and has removed
the license requirement; or
    (ii) The Secretary has found foreign availability, but has
recommended to the President that negotiations be undertaken to
eliminate the foreign availability; or
    (iii) The Secretary has not found foreign availability.
    (3) There is no statutory deadline for assessments self-initiated
by the Secretary or for the resulting determination. However, BXA will
make every effort to complete such assessments and determinations
promptly.
    (g) Foreign availability to controlled countries. When the
Secretary determines that an item controlled for national security
reasons is available to a controlled country and the President does not
issue a National Security Override (NSO), BXA will submit the
determination to the Department of State, along with a draft proposal
for the multilateral decontrol of the item or for the former COCOM
regime approval of the license. The Department of State will submit the
proposal or the license for former COCOM regime review. The former
COCOM regime will have up to 4 months for review of the proposal.
    (h) Foreign availability to non-controlled countries. If the
Secretary determines that foreign availability to non-controlled
countries exists, the Secretary will decontrol the item for export to
all non-controlled countries where it is found to be available, or
approve the license in question, unless the President exercises a
National Security Override.
    (i) Negotiations to eliminate foreign availability. (1) The
President may determine that an export control must be maintained
notwithstanding the existence of foreign availability. Such a
determination is called a National Security Override (NSO) and is based
on the President's decision that the absence of the control would prove
detrimental to the United States national security. Unless extended (as
described in paragraph (i)(7) of this section), an NSO is effective for
6 months. Where the President invokes an NSO, the U.S. Government will
actively pursue negotiations with the government of any source country
during the 6 month period to eliminate the availability.
    (2) There are two types of National Security Overrides:
    (i) An NSO of a determination of foreign availability resulting
from an assessment initiated pursuant to section 5(f) of the EAA
(claimant and self-initiated assessments); and
    (ii) An NSO of a determination of foreign availability resulting
from an assessment initiated pursuant to section 5(h) of the EAA (TAC-
certification assessments).
    (3) For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section
5(f) of the EAA, the Secretary of any agency may recommend that the
President exercise the authority under the EAA to retain the controls
or deny the license notwithstanding the finding of foreign
availability.
    (4) For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section
5(h) of the EAA, the Secretary of Commerce may recommend that the
President exercise the authority under the EAA to retain the controls
notwithstanding the finding of foreign availability.
    (5) Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under
section 5(f) of the EAA, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban
Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of
the House of Representatives will be notified of the initiation of the
required negotiations. The notice will include an explanation of the
national security interest that necessitates the retention of controls.
    (6) Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under
section 5(f) of the EAA, BXA will publish notices in the Federal
Register consisting of:
    (i) The Secretary's determination of foreign availability;
    (ii) The President's decision to exercise the NSO;
    (iii) A concise statement of the basis for the President's
decision; and
    (iv) An estimate of the economic impact of the decision.
    (7) The 6 month effective period for an NSO may be extended up to
an additional 12 months if, prior to the end of the 6 months, the
President certifies to Congress that the negotiations are progressing,
and determines that the absence of the controls would continue to be
detrimental to the United States national security.
    (8) After the conclusion of negotiations, BXA will retain the
control only to the extent that foreign availability is eliminated. If
foreign availability is not eliminated, BXA will decontrol the item by
removing the requirement for a license for the export of the item to
the destinations covered by the assessment. To the extent that the
negotiations are successful and the

[[Page 12919]]
foreign availability is eliminated, BXA will remove the license
requirement for the export of the item to any country that has agreed
to eliminate foreign availability.
    (j) Changes in foreign availability. If BXA becomes aware of
conditions, including new evidence, that affect a previous
determination that foreign availability exists or does not exist, BXA
may review the conditions. If BXA finds that the foreign availability
previously determined no longer exists, or that foreign availability
not earlier found now does exist, BXA will make a recommendation to the
Secretary of Commerce for the appropriate changes in the control. The
Secretary of Commerce will make a determination, and BXA will publish a
Federal Register notice of the determination.

Sec. 768.8  Eligibility of expedited licensing procedures for non-
controlled countries.

    (a) BXA determines the eligibility of an item for expedited
licensing procedures on the basis of an evaluation of the foreign
availability of the item. Eligibility is specific to the items and the
countries to which they are found to be available.
    (b) BXA will initiate an eligibility evaluation:
    (1) On its own initiative;
    (2) On receipt of a FAS; or
    (3) On receipt of a TAC certification.
    (c) Upon initiation of an eligibility evaluation following receipt
of either a FAS or TAC certification, BXA will notify the claimant or
TAC of the receipt and initiation of an evaluation and publish a
Federal Register notice of the initiation of the evaluation.
    (d) The criteria for determining eligibility for expedited
licensing procedures are:
    (1) The item must be available-in-fact to the specified
    non-controlled country from a foreign source;
    (2) The item must be of a quality similar to that of the U.S.-
controlled item; and
    (3) The item must be available-in-fact to the specified non-
controlled country without effective restrictions.
    (e) Within 30 days of initiation of the evaluation, the Secretary
of Commerce will make a determination of foreign availability on the
basis of the BXA evaluation and recommendation, taking into
consideration the evidence the Secretaries of Defense, State, and other
interested agencies provide to BXA and any other information that the
Secretary considers relevant.
    (f) Within 30 days of the receipt of the FAS or TAC certification,
BXA will publish the Secretary's determination in the Federal Register,
that the item will or will not be eligible for expedited licensing
procedures to the stated countries and, where appropriate, amend
Supplement No. 2 to part 768.
    (g) Following completion of a self-initiated evaluation, BXA will
be notified of the Secretary's determination and, where appropriate,
Supplement No. 2 to part 768 will be amended.
    (h) Foreign availability submissions and TAC certifications to
initiate an expedited licensing procedure evaluation must be clearly
designated on their face as a request for expedited licensing procedure
and must specify the items, quantities and countries alleged eligible.
Submissions and certifications should be sent to: Department of
Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration, 14th Street and Pennsylvania
Avenue, NW., Room 3877, Washington, DC 20230.

Sec. 768.9  Appeals of negative foreign availability determinations.

    Appeals of negative determinations will be conducted according to
the standards and procedures described in part 756 of the EAR. A
Presidential decision (NSO) to deny a license or continue controls
notwithstanding a determination of foreign availability is not subject
to appeal.

Sec. 768.10  Removal of controls on less sophisticated items.

    Where the Secretary has removed national security controls on an
item for foreign availability reasons, the Secretary will also remove
controls on similar items that are controlled for national security
reasons and whose functions, technological approach, performance
thresholds, and other attributes that form the basis for national
security export controls do not exceed the technical parameters of the
item that BXA has decontrolled for foreign availability reasons.

Supplement No. 1 to Part 768--Evidence of Foreign Availability

    This Supplement provides a list of examples of evidence that the
Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) has found to be useful in
conducting assessments of foreign availability. A claimant submitting
evidence supporting a claim of foreign availability should review this
list for suggestions as evidence is collected. Acceptable evidence
indicating possible foreign availability is not limited to these
examples, nor is any one of these examples, usually, in and of itself,
necessarily sufficient to meet a foreign availability criterion. A
combination of several types of evidence for each criterion usually is
required. A Foreign Availability Submission (FAS) should include as
much evidence as possible on all four of the criteria listed below. BXA
combines the submitted evidence with the evidence that it collects from
other sources. BXA evaluates all evidence, taking into account factors
that may include, but are not limited to: Information concerning the
source of the evidence, corroborative or contradictory indications, and
experience concerning the reliability or reasonableness of such
evidence. BXA will assess all relevant evidence to determine whether
each of the four criteria has been met. Where possible, all information
should be in writing. If information is based on third party
documentation, the submitter should provide such documentation to BXA.
If information is based on oral statements a third party made, the
submitter should provide a memorandum of the conversation to BXA if the
submitter cannot obtain a written memorandum from the source. BXA will
amend this informational list as it identifies new examples of
evidence.
    (a) Examples of evidence of foreign availability:
    The following are intended as examples of evidence that BXA will
consider in evaluating foreign availability. BXA will evaluate all
evidence according to the provisions in Sec. 768.7(c) of this part in
order for it to be used in support of a foreign availability
determination. This list is illustrative only.
    (1) Available-in-fact:
    (i) Evidence of marketing of an item in a foreign country (e.g., an
advertisement in the media of the foreign country that the item is for

770.1  Introduction.
770.2  Commodity interpretations.
770.3  Interpretations related to exports of technology and software
to destinations in Country Group D:1.
770.4  Interpretations related to chemical mixtures--de minimis
exceptions examples.

    Authority: 50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.;
E.O. 12924, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 917; Notice of August 15, 1995 (60
FR 42767, August 17, 1995).

Sec. 770.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR
chapter VII, subchapter C. This part provides commodity, technology,
and software interpretations. These interpretations clarify the scope
of controls where such scope is not readily apparent from the Commerce
Control List (CCL) (see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) and
other provisions of the Export Administration Regulations.

Sec. 770.2  Commodity interpretations.

    (a) Interpretation 1: Anti-friction bearing or bearing systems and
specially designed parts. (1) Anti-friction bearings or bearing systems
shipped as spares or replacements are classified under Export Control
Classification Numbers (ECCNs) 2A001, 2A002, 2A003, 2A004, 2A005, and
2A006 (ball, roller, or needle-roller bearings and parts). This applies
to separate shipments of anti-friction bearings or bearing systems and
anti-friction bearings or bearing systems shipped with machinery or
equipment for which they are intended to be used as spares or
replacement parts.
    (2) An anti-friction bearing or bearing system physically
incorporated in a segment of a machine or in a complete machine prior
to shipment loses its identity as a bearing. In this scenario, the
machine or segment of machinery containing the bearing is the item
subject to export control requirements.
    (3) An anti-friction bearing or bearing system not incorporated in
a segment of a machine prior to shipment, but shipped as a component of
a complete unassembled (knocked-down) machine, is considered a
component of a machine. In this scenario, the complete machine is the
item subject to export license requirements.
    (b) Interpretation 2: Classification of ``parts'' of machinery,
equipment, or other items. (1) An assembled machine or unit of
equipment is being exported. In instances where one or more assembled
machines or units of equipment are being exported, the individual
component parts that are physically incorporated into the machine or
equipment do not require a license. The license or general exception
under which the complete machine or unit of equipment is exported will
also cover its component parts, provided that the parts are normal and
usual components of the machine or equipment being exported, or that
the physical incorporation is not used as a device to evade the
requirement for a license.
    (2) Parts are exported as spares, replacements, for resale, or for
stock. In instances where parts are exported as spares, replacements,
for resale, or for stock, a license is required only if the appropriate
entry for the part specifies that a license is required for the
intended destination.
    (c) Interpretation 3: Wire or cable cut to length. (1) Wire or
cable may be included as a component of a system or piece of equipment,
whether or not the

[[Page 12921]]
wire or cable is cut to length and whether or not it is fitted with
connectors at one or both ends, so long as it is in normal quantity
necessary to make the original installation of the equipment and is
necessary to its operation.
    (2) Wire or cable exported as replacement or spares, or for further
manufacture is controlled under the applicable wire or cable ECCN only.
This includes wire or cable, whether or not cut to length or fitted
with connectors at one or both ends.
    (d) Interpretation 4: Telecommunications equipment and systems.
Control equipment for paging systems (broadcast radio or selectively
signalled receiving systems) is defined as circuit switching equipment
in Category 5 of the CCL.
    (e) Interpretation 5: Numerical control systems. (1) Classification
of ``Numerical Control'' Units. ``Numerical control'' units for machine
tools, regardless of their configurations or architectures, are
controlled by their functional characteristics as described in ECCN
2B001.a. ``Numerical control'' units include computers with add-on
``motion control boards''. A computer with add-on ``motion control
boards'' for machine tools may be controlled under ECCN 2B001.a even
when the computer alone without ``motion control boards'' is not
subject to licensing requirements under Category 4 and the ``motion
control boards'' are not controlled under ECCN 2B001.b.
    (2) Export documentation requirement. (i) When preparing a license
application for a numerical control system, the machine tool and the
control unit are classified separately. If either the machine tool or
the control unit requires a license, then the entire unit requires a
license. If either a machine tool or a control unit is exported
separately from the system, the exported component is classified on the
license application without regard to the other parts of a possible
system.
    (ii) When preparing the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED), a
system being shipped complete (i.e., machine and control unit), should
be reported under the Schedule B number for each machine. When either a
control unit or a machine is shipped separately, it should be reported
under the Schedule B number appropriate for the individual item being
exported.
    (f) Interpretation 6: Parts, accessories, and equipment exported as
scrap. Parts, accessories, or equipment that are being shipped as scrap
should be described on the SED in sufficient detail to be identified
under the proper ECCN. When commodities declared as parts, accessories,
or equipment are shipped in bulk, or are otherwise not packaged,
packed, or sorted in accordance with normal trade practices, the
Customs Officer may require evidence that the shipment is not scrap.
Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, bills of sale, orders
and correspondence indicating whether the commodities are scrap or are
being exported for use as parts, accessories, or equipment.
    (g) Interpretation 7: Scrap arms, ammunition, and implements of
war. Arms, ammunition, and implements of war, as defined in the U.S.
Munitions List, and are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department
of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130), except for the following,
which are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce:
    (1) Cartridge and shell cases that have been rendered useless
beyond the possibility of restoration to their original identity by
means of excessive heating, flame treatment, mangling, crushing,
cutting, or by any other method are ``scrap''.
    (2) Cartridge and shell cases that have been sold by the armed
services as ``scrap'', whether or not they have been heated, flame-
treated, mangled, crushed, cut, or reduced to scrap by any other
method.
    (3) Other commodities that may have been on the U.S. Munitions List
are ``scrap'', and therefore under the jurisdiction of the Department
of Commerce, if they have been rendered useless beyond the possibility
of restoration to their original identify only by means of mangling,
crushing, or cutting. When in doubt as to whether a commodity covered
by the Munitions List has been rendered useless, exporters should
consult the Office of Defense Trade Controls, U.S. Department of State,
Washington, DC 20520, or the Exporter Counseling Division, Office of
Exporter Services, Room 1099A, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington,
DC 20230, before reporting a shipment as metal scrap.
    (h) Interpretation 8: Military automotive vehicles and parts for
such vehicles. (1) Military automotive vehicles. (i) For purposes of
U.S. export controls, military automotive vehicles ``possessing or
built to current military specifications differing materially from
normal commercial specifications'' may include, but are not limited to,
the following characteristics:
    (A) Special fittings for mounting ordnance or military equipment;
    (B) Bullet-proof glass;
    (C) Armor plate;
    (D) Fungus preventive treatment;
    (E) Twenty-four volt electrical systems;
    (F) Shielded electrical system (electronic emission suppression);
or
    (G) Puncture-proof or run-flat tires.
    (ii) Automotive vehicles fall into two categories.
    (A) Military automotive vehicles on the Munitions List, new and
used. Automotive vehicles in this category are primarily combat
(fighting) vehicles, with or without armor and/or armament, ``designed
for specific fighting function.'' These automotive vehicles are
licensed for export by the U.S. Department of State (22 CFR parts 120
through 130).
    (B) Military automotive vehicles not on the U.S. Munitions List,
new and used. Automotive vehicles in this category are primarily
transport vehicles designed for non-combat military purposes
(transporting cargo, personnel and/or equipment, and/or for to wing
other vehicles and equipment over land and roads in close support of
fighting vehicles and troops). These automotive vehicles are licensed
for export by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
    (iii) Parts for military automotive vehicles. Functional parts are
defined as those parts making up the power train of the vehicles,
including the electrical system, the cooling system, the fuel system,
and the control system (brake and steering mechanism), the front and
rear axle assemblies including the wheels, the chassis frame, springs
and shock absorbers. Parts specifically designed for military
automotive vehicles on the Munitions List are licensed for export by
the U.S. Department of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130).
    (iv) General instructions. Manufacturers of non-Munitions List
automotive vehicles and/or parts will know whether their products meet
the conditions described in this paragraph (h). Merchant exporters and
other parties who are not sure whether their products (automotive
vehicles and/or parts) meet these conditions should check with their
suppliers for the required information before making a shipment under
general exception or submitting an application to BXA for a license.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (i) Interpretation 9: Aircraft, parts, accessories and components.
Aircraft, parts, accessories, and components defined in Categories VIII
and IX of the Munitions List are under the export licensing authority
of the U.S. Department of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130). All
other aircraft, and parts, accessories and components therefor, are
under the export licensing

[[Page 12922]]
authority of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The following aircraft,
parts, accessories and components are under the licensing authority of
the U.S. Department of Commerce:
    (1) Any aircraft (except an aircraft that has been demilitarized,
but including aircraft specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section)
that conforms to a Federal Aviation Agency type certificate in the
normal, utility, acrobatic, transport, or restricted category, provided
such aircraft has not been equipped with or modified to include
military equipment, such as gun mounts, turrets, rocket launchers, or
similar equipment designed for military combat or military training
purposes.
    (2) Only the following military aircraft, demilitarized (aircraft
not specifically equipped, reequipped, or modified for military
operations):
    (i) Cargo, bearing designations ``C-45 through C-118 inclusive,''
and ``C-121'';
    (ii) Trainers, bearing a ``T'' designation and using piston
engines;
    (iii) Utility, bearing a ``U'' designation and using piston

for military aircraft.
    (5) Parts, accessories, and components (including propellers),
designed exclusively for aircraft and engines described in paragraphs
(i)(1), (i)(2), (i)(3), and (i)(4) of this section.
    (6) General purpose parts, accessories, and components usable
interchangeably on either military or civil aircraft.
    (j) Interpretation 10: Civil aircraft inertial navigation
equipment. (1) The Department of Commerce has licensing jurisdiction
over exports and reexports to all destinations of inertial navigation
systems, inertial navigation equipment, and specially designed
components therefor for ``civil aircraft''.
    (2) The Department of State, retains jurisdiction over all software
and technology for inertial navigation systems and navigation
equipment, and specially designed components therefor, for shipborne
use, underwater use, ground vehicle use, spaceborne use or use other
than ``civil aircraft''.
    (k) Interpretation 11: Precursor chemicals. The following chemicals
are controlled by ECCN 1C350. The appropriate Chemical Abstract Service
Registry (C.A.S.) number and synonyms, (i.e., alternative names) are
included to help you determine whether your chemicals are controlled by
this entry. These chemicals require a license to all countries except

Sec. 770.3  Interpretations related to exports of technology and
software to destinations in Country Group D:1.

    (a) Introduction. This section is intended to provide you
additional guidance on how to determine whether your technology or
software would be eligible for a License Exception, may be exported
under NLR, or require a license, for export to Country Group D:1.
    (b) Scope of licenses. The export of technology and software under
a license is authorized only to the extent specifically indicated on
the face of the license. The only technology and software related to
equipment exports that may be exported without a license is technology
described in Secs. 734.7 through 734.11 of the EAR; operating
technology and software described in Sec. 740.8(a) of the EAR; sales
technology described in Sec. 740.8(b) of the EAR; and software updates
described in Sec. 740.8(c) of the EAR.
    (c) Commingled technology and software. (1) U.S.-origin technology
does not lose its U.S.-origin when it is redrawn, used, consulted, or
otherwise commingled abroad in any respect with other technology of any
other origin. Therefore, any subsequent or similar technical data
prepared or engineered abroad for the design, construction, operation,
or maintenance of any plant or equipment, or part thereof, which is
based on or utilizes any U.S.-origin technology, is subject to the EAR
is the same manner as the original U.S.-origin technology, including
license requirements, unless the commingled technology is not subject
to the EAR by reason of the de minimis exclusions described at
Sec. 732.4 of the EAR.
    (2) U.S.-origin software that is incorporated into or commingled
with foreign-origin software does not lose its U.S.-origin. Such
commingled software is subject to the EAR is the same manner as the
original U.S.-origin software, including license requirements, unless
the commingled software is not subject to the EAR by reason of the de
minimis exclusions described at Sec. 732.4 of the EAR.
    (d) Certain License Exception. The following questions and answers
are intended to further clarify the scope of technology and software
eligible for a License Exception.
    (1)(i) Question 1. (A) Our engineers, in installing or repairing
equipment, use techniques (experience as well as proprietary knowledge
of the internal componentry or specifications of the equipment) that
exceed what is provided in the standard manuals or instructions
(including training) given to the customer. In some cases, it is also a
condition of the license that such information provided to the customer
be constrained to the minimum necessary for normal installation,
maintenance and operation situations.
    (B) Can we send an engineer (with knowledge and experience) to the
customer site to perform the installation or repair, under the
provisions of License Exception for operating technology and software
(OTS) described in Sec. 740.8(a) of the EAR, if it is understood that
he is restricted by our normal business practices to performing the
work without imparting the knowledge or technology to the customer
personnel?
    (ii) Answer 1. Export of technology includes release of U.S.-origin
data in a foreign country, and ``release'' includes ``application to
situations abroad of personal knowledge or technical experience
acquired in the United States.'' As the release of technology in the
circumstances described here would exceed that permitted under the
License Exception for operating technology and software described in
Sec. 740.8(a) of the EAR, a license would be required even though the
technician could apply the data without disclosing it to the customer.
    (2)(i) Question 2. We plan, according to our normal business
practices, to train customer engineers to maintain equipment that we
have exported under a license, License Exception, or NLR. The training
is contractual in nature, provided for a fee, and is scheduled to take
place in part in the customer's facility and in part in the U.S. Can we
now proceed with this training at both locations under a License
Exception?
    (ii) Answer 2. (A) Provided that this is your normal training, and
involves technology contained in your manuals and standard instructions
for the exported equipment, and meets the other requirements of License
Exception for operating technology and software (OTS) described in
Sec. 740.8(a), the training may be provided within the limits of that
License Exception. The location of the training is not significant, as
the export occurs at the time and place of the actual transfer or
imparting of the technology to the customer's engineers.
    (B) Any training beyond that covered under the provisions of
License Exception for operating technology and software (OTS) described
in Sec. 740.8(a), but specifically represented in your license
application as required for this customer installation, and in fact
authorized on the face of the license or a separate technology license,
may not be undertaken while the license is suspended or revoked.

Sec. 770.4  Interpretations related to chemical mixtures--de minimis
exceptions examples.

    (a)(1) Introduction: The following are examples for applying the de
minimis exceptions for chemical mixtures containing precursor and
intermediate chemicals controlled under ECCN 1C350.
    (2) In ECCN 1C350, Note 2, paragraphs (c) and (d) within the
Mixtures Exemptions state that a validated license is required when at
least one of the listed chemicals constitutes more than 10% or 25%,
respectively, of the weight of the mixture on a solvent free basis.
    (b)(1) Example One. A mixture contains the following components:
    (i) 90% polymer polyol (a liquid raw material used to make
polyurethane polymers); and
    (ii) 10% Australia Group (AG)-controlled chemical eligible for 25%
de minimis exemption.

    Note to paragraph (b) of this section: The polymer does not
dissolve the AG-controlled chemical.

    (2) In this example, the polymer polyol does not dissolve the AG-
controlled chemical (the only other component of the mixture).
Therefore, the polyol is NOT considered a solvent, and the
concentration of the polymer polyol is included in the concentration
calculation. As a result, the AG-controlled chemical's concentration is
10% when calculated on a solvent-free basis (.10/1.00). Accordingly,
this concentration is below the threshold concentration of 25%
applicable to specific AG-controlled chemicals under the chemical
mixtures rule and can be exported under NLR to all destinations except
Iran, Sudan, Syria, and Country Group E:2 in Supplement No. 1 to part
740 of the EAR.
    (3) To determine the classification of this mixture, it is
necessary to determine whether the polymer is capable of functioning as
a solvent for the other components of the mixture. If the polymer
polyol is capable of functioning as a solvent for the controlled AG
chemical, then the polymer component is omitted from the concentration
calculation. If the polymer polyol is not capable of functioning as a
solvent for the AG chemical, then the polymer component is included in
the concentration calculation.

    (c)(1) Example Two: An automotive coolant (antifreeze) is a mixture
of the following components:
    (i) 75% ethylene glycol;
    (ii) 10% additive package; and
    (iii) 15% water.

    Note to paragraph (c) of this section: The ``additive package''
contains an AG-controlled chemical that is eligible for the 10% de
minimis exemption. This chemical is added as a stabilizer and
represents 9% of the total mixture. The remaining components of the
additive package are various dyes and stabilizers that represent 1%
of the total mixture. Ethylene glycol serves as the basic functional
ingredient that prevents the engine block from freezing, and does
not dissolve the other components of the mixture. The water is added
to keep the mixture in solution.

    (2) To determine if this mixture requires a license it is necessary
to calculate the concentration of the AG-controlled chemical on a
solvent-free basis. Since the water dissolves all of the other
components of the mixture, water is considered a ``solvent'' and the
quantity of water present is not included in the calculation of the AG-
chemical concentration. Consequently, the concentration of the AG
chemical is approximately 11% (.09/.85), and the mixture is classified
under ECCN 1C350. Accordingly, since this concentration is above the
threshold concentration of 10% applicable to this category of AG-
controlled chemical under the chemical mixtures rule, a license is
required to all destinations except AG member countries.
    (d)(1) Example Three. A pesticide formulation consists of an AG-
controlled chemical that is eligible for the 25% de minimis exemption,
and an active ingredient that is not AG-controlled. The formulation is
diluted with water to allow safe, effective, and economic application.
The resulting mixture is 15% AG chemical, 40% active ingredient and 45%
water. Although the water is added as a diluent, it dissolves the other
components of the mixture.
    (2) Since the water dissolves all components in the mixture, it is
considered a solvent even though it was added as a diluent. The percent
concentration of the AG-controlled chemical calculated on a solvent
free basis is .15/.55 = 27%, and the mixture is therefore classified
under ECCN 1C350. Accordingly, since this concentration is above the
threshold concentration of 25% applicable to this category of AG-
controlled chemicals under the chemical mixtures rule, a license is
required to all destinations except AG member countries.
    (e)(1) Example Four. A mixture contains the following components:
    (i) 10% water;
    (ii) 22% Chemical A;
    (iii) 21% Chemical B;
    (iv) 20% Chemical C;
    (v) 19% Chemical D; and
    (vi) 8% Chemical E.

    Note to paragraph (e) of this section: The water is added to
dissolve the other components of the mixture. Chemicals A, B, C, and
D are AG-controlled chemicals each eligible for 25% de minimis
exemption. Chemical E is an AG-controlled chemical eligible for 10%
de minimis exemption.

    (2) In this example, water is considered a solvent since it
dissolves all components in the mixture. Therefore, the quantity of
water present in the mixture is not included in calculating the
concentrations of the controlled chemicals on a solvent-free basis. The
concentrations of the controlled chemicals are as follows: Chemical A
24%; Chemical B 23%; Chemical C 22%; Chemical D 21%; Chemical E 9%. It
is important to note that in this example, even though the cumulative
amount of the mixture (90%) consists of controlled chemicals, each one
of the controlled chemicals is below the de minimis level for its
category. Consequently, this mixture can be exported under NLR to all
destinations except Iran, Sudan, Syria, and Country Group E:2 in
Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR.

chapter VII, subchapter C. The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA)
maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL) that includes items
(commodities, software, and technology) subject to the authority of
BXA. The CCL does not include those items exclusively controlled for
export by another department or agency of the U.S. Government. In
instances where other agencies administer controls over related items,
entries in the CCL will contain a reference to these controls. Those
items subject to the EAR but not specified on the CCL are identified by
the designator ``EAR99''. See Sec. 734.2(a) of the EAR for items that
are ``subject to the EAR''. You should consult part 738 of the EAR for
an explanation of the organization of the CCL and its relationship to
the Country Chart.
    The CCL is contained in Supplement No. 1 to this part, and
Supplement No. 2 to this part contains the General Technology and
Software Notes relevant to entries contained in the CCL.

    Technical Note: The positioning accuracy of ``numerically
controlled'' machine tools is to be determined and presented in
accordance with ISO/DIS 230/2, paragraph 2.13, in conjunction with
the requirements below:
    a. Test conditions (paragraph 3):
    1. For 12 hours before and during measurements, the machine tool
and accuracy measuring equipment will be kept at the same ambient
temperature. During the premeasurement time the slides of the
machine will be continuously cycled in the same manner that the
accuracy measurements will be taken;
    2. The machine shall be equipped with any mechanical,
electronic, or software compensation to be exported with the
machine;
    3. Accuracy of measuring equipment for the measurements shall be
at least four times more accurate than the expected machine tool
accuracy;
    4. Power supply for slide drives shall be as follows:
    a. Line voltage variation shall not exceed <plus-minus>10% of
nominal rated voltage;
    b. Frequency variation shall not exceed <plus-minus>2 Hz of
normal frequency;
    c. Lineouts or interrupted service are not permitted.
    b. Test program (paragraph 4):
    1. Feed rate (velocity of slides) during measurement shall be
the rapid traverse rate;

    Note: In the case of machine tools that generate optical quality
surfaces, the feedrate shall be equal to or less than 50 mm per
minute.
    2. Measurements shall be made in an incremental manner from one
limit of the axis travel to the other without returning to the
starting position for each move to the target position;
    3. Axes not being measured shall be retained at mid travel
during test of an axis.
    c. Presentation of test results (paragraph 2): The results of
the measurement must include:
    1. Positioning accuracy (A); and
    2. The mean reversal error (B).
    c.1.b.6.a A ``positioning accuracy'' less (better) than 0.007
mm; and
    c.1.b.6.b. A slide motion from rest for all slides within 20% of
a motion command input for inputs of less than 0.5 micrometer;

    Technical Note: Minimum increment of motion test (slide motion
from rest): The test is conducted only if the machine tool is
equipped with a control unit the minimum increment of which is less
(better) than 0.5 micrometer. Prepare the machine for testing in
accordance with ISO 230.2 paragraphs 3.1, 3.2, 3.3. Conduct the test
on each axis (slide) of the machine tool as follows:
    1. Move the axis over at least 50% of the maximum travel in plus
and minus directions twice at maximum feed rate, rapid traverse rate
or jog control;
    2. Wait at least 10 seconds;
    3. With manual data input, input the minimum programmable
increment of the control unit;
    4. Measure the axis movement;
    5. Clear the control unit with the servo null, reset or whatever
clears any signal (voltage) in the servo loop;
    6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 five times, twice in the same direction
of the axis travel and three times in the opposite direction of
travel for a total of six test points;
    7. If the axis movement is between 80% and 120% of the minimum
programmable input for four of the six test points, the machine is
controlled. For rotary axes, the measurement is taken 200 mm from
the center of rotation.

Technical Note to Table on Deposition Techniques

    Processes specified in Column 1 of the Table are defined as
follows:
    a. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or
surface modification coating process wherein a metal, alloy,
composite, dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated
substrate. Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the
vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired
elemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate. Energy for
this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by
the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or ``laser''
irradiation.

    Note 1: CVD includes the following processes: directed gas flow
out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal
decomposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD
processes.
    Note 2: Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture.
    Note 3: The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process
are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the
pack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is
not in contact with the powder mixture.

    b. Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapor Deposition (TE-PVD) is an
overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less
than 0.1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize
the coating material. This process results in the condensation, or
deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned
substrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the
coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary
modification of the process. The use of ion or electron beams, or
plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a
common modification in this technique. The use of monitors to
provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and
thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes. Specific
TE-PVD processes are as follows:
    1. Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate
the material which forms the coating;
    2. Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating
sources capable of producing a controlled and uniform flux of
evaporated coating species;
    3. ``Laser'' Evaporation uses either pulsed or continuous wave
``laser'' beams to heat the material which forms the coating;
    4. Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the
material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge
established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground
trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface
creating a highly ionized plasma. The anode can be either a cone
attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or
the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight
deposition.

    Note: This definition does not include random cathodic arc
deposition with non-biased substrates.

    c. Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD
process in which a plasma

[[Page 12974]]
or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and
a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate
the extraction of the species to be deposited from the plasma. The
introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the
process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process
measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings
are ordinary modifications of the process.
    d. Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay
coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture
(a pack), that consists of:
    1. The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually
aluminum, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof);
    2. An activator (normally a halide salt); and
    3. An inert powder, most frequently alumina. The substrate and
powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to
between 1,030 K (757 deg. C) to 1,375 K (1,102 deg. C) for
sufficient time to deposit the coating.
    e. Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun
(spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or
wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a
substrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma
spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high
velocity plasma spraying carried out underwater.

    Note 1: Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric
pressure.
    Note 2: High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity
exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20 deg. C) at 0.1 MPa.

    f. Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or
overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an
organic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a
substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or
oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating.
    g. Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a
momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated
by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating
material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to
cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an
appropriately positioned substrate.

    Note 1: The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive
sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating
and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter
deposition used to permit vaporization of non-metallic coating
materials.
    Note 2: Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to
activate the deposition.

    h. Ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process in
which the element to be alloyed is ionized, accelerated through a
potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the
substrate. This includes processes in which ion implantation is
performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapor
deposition or sputter deposition.

    Related Definition: Detonators using only primary explosives,
such as lead azide, are not controlled by this entry.
    Items:

    a. Electrically driven explosive detonators, as follows:
    a.1. Exploding bridge (EB);
    a.2. Exploding bridge wire (EBW);
    a.3. Slapper;
    a.4. Exploding foil initiators (EFI)
    b. Arrangements using single or multiple detonators designed to
nearly simultaneously initiate an expolsive surface (over greater
than 5,000 mm\2\) from a single firing signal (with an initiation
timing spread over the surface of less than 2.5 microseconds).

    Technical Note: The detonators controlled by 3A232 utilize a
small electrical conductor (bridge, bridgewire, or foil) that
explosively vaporizes when a fast, high-current electrical pulse is
passed through it. In nonslapper types, the exploding conductor
starts a chemical detonation in a contacting high-explosive material
such as PETN (pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper detonators,
the explosive vaporization of the electrical conductor drives a
flyer or slapper across a gap, and the impact of the slapper on an
explosive starts a chemical detonation. The slapper in some designs
is driven by magnetic force. The term exploding foil detonator may
refer to either an EB or a slapper-type detonator. Also, the word
initiator is sometimes used in place of the word detonator.

Abbreviations Used in This Technical Note

CE  ``computing element'' (typically an arithmetic logical unit)
FP  floating point
XP  fixed point
t  execution time
XOR  exclusive OR
CPU  central processing unit
TP  theoretical performance (of a single CE)
CTP  ``composite theoretical performance'' (multiple CEs)
R  effective calculating rate
WL  word length
L  word length adjustment
*  multiply

    Execution time `t' is expressed in microseconds, TP and ``CTP''
are expressed in Mtops (millions of theoretical operations per
second) and WL is expressed in bits.

Outline of ``CTP'' Calculation Method

    ``CTP'' is a measure of computational performance given in
millions of theoretical operations per second (Mtops). In
calculating the ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') of
an aggregation of ``Computing Elements'' (``CEs''), the following
three steps are required:
    1. Calculate the effective calculating rate (R) for each
``computing element'' (``CE'');
    2. Apply the word length adjustment (L) to the effective
calculating rate (R), resulting in a Theoretical Performance (TP)
for each ``computing element'' (``CE'');
    3. If there is more than one ``computing element'' (``CE''),
combine the Theoretical Performances (TPs), resulting in a
``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') for the aggregation.
Details for these steps are given in the following section.

    Note 1: For aggregations of multiple ``computing elements''
(``CEs'') that have both shared and unshared memory subsystems, the
calculation of ``CTP'' is completed hierarchically, in two steps:
first, aggregate the group of ``computing elements'' (``CEs'')
sharing memory, second calculate the ``CTP'' of the groups using the
calculation method for multiple ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') not
sharing memory.

    Note 2: ``Computing elements'' (``CEs'') that are limited to
input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive,
communication and video display controllers) are not aggregated into
the ``CTP'' calculation.

    The following table shows the method of calculating the
``Effective Calculating Rate'' (R) for each ``Computing Element''
(``CE''):
    Step 1: The effective calculating rate R. For Computing Elements
(CEs) Implementing: Effective calculating Rate, R

    Note: Every ``CE'' must be evaluated independently

    Both FP and XP (R).
    Calculate both R<INF>xp, R<INF>fp.
    For simple logic processors not implementing any of the
specified arithmetic operations.

    Where t<INF>log is the execute time of the XOR, or for logic
hardware not implementing the XOR, the fastest simple logic
operation.
    See Notes X and Z.
    For special logic processors not using any of the specified
arithmetic or logic operations. R = R<SUP>t x WL/64
    Where R is the number of results per second, WL is the number of
bits upon which the logic operation occurs, and 64 is a factor to
normalize to a 64 bit operation.

    Note W: For a pipelined ``CE'' capable of executing up to one
arithmetic or logic operation every clock cycle after the pipeline
is full, a pipelined rate can be established. The effective
calculating rate (R) for such a ``CE'' is the faster of the
pipelined rate or non-pipelined execution rate.

    Note X: For a ``CE'' that performs multiple operations of a
specific type in a single cycle (e.g., two additions per cycle or
two identical logic operations per cycle), the execution time t is
given by:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.019

    ``Computing elements'' (``CEs'') that perform different types of
arithmetic or logic operations in a single machine cycle are to be
treated as multiple separate ``computing elements'' (``CEs'')
performing simultaneously (e.g., a ``CE'' performing an addition and
a multiplication in one cycle is to be treated as two ``CEs'', the
first performing an addition in one cycle and the second performing
a multiplication in one cycle).
    If a single ``Computing element'' (``CE'') has both scalar
function and vector function, use the shorter execution time value.

    Note Y: For the ``CE'' that does not implement FP add or FP
multiply, but that performs FP divide:

[[Page 12994]]
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.020

    If the ``CE'' implements FP reciprocal, but not FP add, FP
multiply or FP divide, then:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.021

    If the divide is not implemented, the fp reciprocal should be
used.
    If none of the specified instructions is implemented, the
effective floating point (FP) rate is 0.
    Note Z: In simple logic operations, a single instruction
performs a single logic manipulation of no more than two operands of
given lengths. In complex logic operations, a single instruction
performs multiple logic manipulations to produce one or more results
from two or more operands.
    Rates should be calculated for all supported operand lengths
considering both pipelined operations (if supported), and non-
pipelined operations, using the fastest executing instruction for
each operand length based on:
    1. Pipelined or register-to-register operations. Exclude
extraordinarily short execution times generated for operations on a
predetermined operand or operands (for example, multiplication by 0
or 1). If no register-to-register operations are implemented,
continue with (2).
    2. The faster of register-to-memory or memory-to-register
operations; if these also do not exist, then continue with (3).
    3. Memory-to-memory.
    In each case above, use the shortest execution time certified by
the manufacturer.
    Step 2: TP for each supported operand length WL:
    Adjust the effective rate R (or R<SUP>t) by the word length
adjustment L as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.022

    Note: The word length WL used in these calculations is the
operand length in bits. (If an operation uses operands of different
lengths, select the largest word length.)

    The combination of a mantissa ALU and an exponent ALU of a
floating point processor or unit is considered to be one ``computing
Element'' (``CE'') with a Word Length (WL) equal to the number of
bits in the data representation (typically 32 or 64) for purposes of
the ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') calculations.
    This adjustment is not applied to specialized logic processors
that do not use XOR instructions. In this case TP = R.
    Select the maximum resulting value of TP for:
    Each XP-only ``CE'' (R<INF>xp);
    Each FP-only ``CE'' (R<INF>fp);
    Each combined FP and XP ``CE'' (R);
    Each simple logic processor not implementing any of the
specified arithmetic operations; and
    Each special logic processor not using any of the specified
arithmetic or logic operations.
    Step 3: ``CTP'' for aggregations of ``CEs'', including CPU's:
    For a CPU with a single ``CE'', ``CTP'' = TP (for CEs performing
both fixed and floating point operations, TP = max (TP<INF>fp,
TP<INF>xp)).
    ``CTP'' for aggregations of multiple ``CEs'' operating
simultaneously is calculated as follows:

    Note 1: For aggregations that do not allow all of the ``CEs'' to
run simultaneously, the possible combination of ``CEs'' that
provides the largest ``CTP'' should be used. The TP of each
contributing ``CE'' is to be calculated at its maximum value
theoretically possible before the ``CTP'' of the combination is
derived.

    N.B.: To determine the possible combinations of simultaneously
operating ``CEs'', generate an instruction sequence that initiates
operations in multiple ``CEs'', beginning with the slowest ``CE''
(the one needing the largest number of cycles to complete its
operation) and ending with the fastest ``CE''. At each cycle of the
sequence, the combination of ``CEs'' that are in operation during
that cycle is a possible combination. The instruction sequence must
take into account all hardware and/or architectural constraints on
overlapping operations.

    Note 2: A single integrated circuit chip or board assembly may
contain multiple ``CEs''.
    Note 3: Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the
computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel or simultaneous
operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.
    Note 4: ``CTP'' values are not to be aggregated for ``CE''-
combinations (inter)connected by ``Local Area Networks'', Wide Area
Networks, Input/Output shared connections/devices, I/O controllers
and any communication interconnection implemented by ``software''.
    Note 5: ``CTP'' values must be aggregated for multiple ``CEs''
specially designed to enhance performance by aggregation, operating
simultaneously and sharing memory,-- or multiple memory/``CE''--
combinations operating simultaneously utilizing specially designed
hardware. This aggregation does not apply to ``electronic
assemblies'' controlled by 4A003.c.

    ``CTP'' = TP<INF>1 + C<INF>2 * TP<INF>2 + . . . + C<INF>n *
TP<INF>n, where the TPs are ordered by value, with TP<INF>1, being
the highest, TP<INF>2 being the second highest, . . . and TP<INF>n
being the lowest. C<INF>i is a coefficient determined by the
strength of the interconnection between ``CEs'', as follows:
    For multiple ``CEs'' operating simultaneously and sharing
memory:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.023

    Note 1: When the ``CTP'' calculated by the above method does not
exceed 194 Mtops, the following formula may be used to calculate
C<INF>i:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.024

    where m = the number of ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'' sharing
access.
    Provided:
    1. The TP<INF>i of each ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' does not
exceed 30 Mtops;
    2. The ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'' share access to main memory
(excluding cache memory) over a single channel; and
    3. Only one ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' can have use of the
channel at any given time.

    N.B.: This does not apply to items controlled under Category 3.

    Note 2: ``CEs'' share memory if they access a common segment of
solid state memory. This memory may include cache memory, main
memory, or other internal memory. Peripheral memory devices such as
disk drives, tape drives, or RAM disks are not included.

    For multiple ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'' not sharing memory,
interconnected by one or more data channels:

C<INF>i=0.75*k<INF>i (i=2, . . ., 32) (see NOTE on k<INF>i factor)
=0.60*k<INF>i (i=33, . . ., 64)
=0.45*k<INF>i (i=65, . . ., 256)
=0.30*k<INF>i (i>256)

    The value of C<INF>i is based on the number of ``CEs'', not the
number of nodes.

where k<INF>i=min (S<INF>i/K<INF>r, 1), and
    K<INF>r=normalizing factor of 20 MByte/s.
    S<INF>i=sum of the maximum data rates (in units of MBytes/s) for
all data channels connected to the i<INF>th ``CE'' or group of
``CEs'' sharing memory.

    When calculating a C<INF>i for a group of ``CEs'', the number of
the first ``CE'' in a group determines the proper limit for C<INF>i.
For example, in an aggregation of groups consisting of 3 ``CEs''
each, the 22nd group will contain ``CE''<INF>64, ``CE''<INF>65 and
``CE''<INF>66 . The proper limit for C<INF>i for this group is 0.60.
    Aggregation (of ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'') should be from the
fastest-to-slowest; i.e.:

[[Page 12995]]

    TP<INF>1<gr-thn-eq>TP<INF>2<gr-thn-eq>TP<INF>3; and in the case
of TP<INF>i=TP<INF>i+<INF>1, from the largest to smallest, i.e.:
    C<INF>i<gr-thn-eq>C<INF>i+<INF>1

    Note: The k<INF>i factor is not to be applied to ``CEs'' to 2 to
12 if the TP i / of the ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' is more than 50
Mtops; i.e., C<INF>i for ``CEs'' 2 to 12 is 0.75.

voltage to a 1 V rms reference, when the hydrophone sensor, without
a pre-amplifier, is placed in a plane wave acoustic field with an
rms pressure of 1 micropascal. For example, a hydrophone of -160 dB
(reference 1 V per micropascal) would yield an output voltage of
10<SUP>-8 V in such a field, while one of -180 dB sensitivity would
yield only 10<SUP>-9 V output. Thus, -160 dB is better than -180 dB.

removes the LRU and replaces it with a spare.
    (2.) Maintenance Level II: The defective LRU is sent to the
maintenance workshop (the manufacturer's or that of the operator
responsible for level II maintenance). At the maintenance workshop,
the malfunctioning LRU is tested by various appropriate means to
verify and localize the defective shop replaceable assembly (SRA)
module responsible for the failure. This SRA is removed and replaced
by an operative spare. The defective SRA (or possibly the complete
LRU) is then shipped to the manufacturer. Maintenance Level II does
not include the removal of controlled accelerometers or gyro sensors
